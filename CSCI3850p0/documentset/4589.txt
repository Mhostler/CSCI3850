<P>  The PLO's architect of peace with Israel Monday said the United States was treating the troubled Middle East peace process like a public relations exercise. </P>
<P> ``We are not asking the United States to put pressure on Israel but it must use another style of negotiation than this mistaken ... style which is more public relations than politics,'' he told the United Arab Emirates official WAM news agency. </P>
<P> Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen, signed the 1993 accord on the White House lawn for the Palestinian Liberation Organization which led to Palestinians taking over Gaza and the town of Jericho from Israel. </P>
<P> He was speaking during a visit to the UAE. Palestinian officials are visiting Western and Arab countries to explain why peace talks with Israel are deadlocked. </P>
<P> Abbas declined to elaborate on how the United States, the main sponsor of the faltering Middle East peace process, ought to act. ``They must look into that,'' he said. </P>
<P> U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is due to make a new peace mission to the Middle East next week. Talks between Israel and the Palestinians have reached a near-impasse and those between Israel, Syria and Lebanon are also stuck. </P>
<P> Abbas said the current situation was ``difficult, but there is no going back from the peace process.'' </P>
<P> Disagreements between the two sides over issues including guerrilla attacks on Israelis and building of Jewish settlements on the West Bank have stalled Palestinian elections and Israeli troop redeployments originally set for last July. </P>
<P> ``The Israelis understand security to mean the Palestinian Authority must prevent military operations against them by some youths, but I see this as impossible,'' said Abbas. </P>
<P> ``The Israelis must understand that there is no authority capable of preventing everything, even if it be a world power (like) America or Russia or Britain,'' he added. </P>
