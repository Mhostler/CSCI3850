<P>  Shoppers should be able to pick up airline tickets along with bread and milk at neighborhood grocery stores this fall when automated vending machines begin offering a wide range of new products. </P>
<P> Mutual funds, concert tickets and money orders are among the new products that will be available on an electronic system that is to work much like automated teller machines which give bank customers access to their cash. </P>
<P> According to the company planning the system, Docunet Inc, purchases will be made by inserting credit or debit cards. </P>
<P> San Francisco-based Docunet will announce Tuesday that it has reached an agreement to install a fleet of the machines in Giant Food stores in metropolitan Washington by year-end. </P>
<P> The four-year-old company said it has also reached an agreement in principle for an early 1995 rollout at 170 stores in the Ralph's supermarket chain in southern California. </P>
<P> Docunet is working with Bell Atlantic Corp to put the machines in office locations on a trial basis. </P>
<P> While purchases of airplane tickets and some other products will need to be arranged by telephone or personal computer before they can be retrieved at the market, the system could eliminate the need to pick up tickets at the airport counter. </P>
<P> Several large travel agencies are also planning to deliver tickets on the system. </P>
