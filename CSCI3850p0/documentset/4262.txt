<P>  A key witness who defense attorneys say could help clear O.J. Simpson of double-murder charges pleaded not guilty Thursday to felony fraud charges. </P>
<P> In a case unrelated to the football legend's sensational trial, Mary Anne Gerchas -- who claims she saw saw four men outside Nicole Brown Simpson's home the night she and her friend were murdered -- was arraigned one day after turning herself in to police. </P>
<P> Gerchas is accused of defrauding the J.W. Marriott hotel in Century City by failing to pay a $23,000 credit card bill she built up while staying there after the devastating Jan. 17, 1994, Northridge earthquake damaged her home. </P>
<P> Simpson defense attorney Johnnie Cochran said during his opening statement that Gerchas would testify that she saw four men -- none of them black like Simpson -- rushing from the area of Nicole Simpson's Brentwood townhouse around the time she and Ron Goldman were murdered June 12. </P>
<P> But prosecutors say Gerchas, a jewelry saleswoman, faces numerous complaints for passing bad checks and is also the target of civil suits for failing to pay suppliers. They have called her a ``Simpson case groupie'' and contend that she is lying to get involved in the highly publicized trial. </P>
<P> Cochran, who plans to use Gerchas testimony to show that police overlooked other potential suspects, said Thursday that ''none of what's happened in all the things they've brought up are even admissible here (in the Simpson case).'' </P>
<P> Gerchas' lawyer, William Graysen, said he would be taking a ``hard look'' at whether prosecutors were unfairly expediting her case because of her role as a defense witness. </P>
<P> Gerchas pleaded innocent Thursday to charges of credit card fraud, defrauding an innkeeper and theft of labor, and a preliminary hearing was set for Feb. 24. She remained free on $20,000 bail following her arrest Wednesday. </P>
