<P>  President Clinton formally submitted bills Monday to Congress calling for targetted middle-class tax cuts and an increase in the minimum wage. </P>
<P> White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Democratic congressional leaders would introduce the legislation, which embodies proposals already announced by Clinton. </P>
<P> His $60 billion tax-cut plan would give Americans earning up to $100,000 a year tax breaks to offset child-care, home buying, college tuition and medical expenses Clinton's wage proposal calls for raising the hourly minimum to $5.15 from $4.25 over two years In two 45-cent installments. </P>
<P> But with opposition Republicans in control of Congress, neither plan is likely to pass in the form Democrat Clinton wants. </P>
<P> Clinton's action on the bills, a mere formality, was one of several White House moves timed to concide with the release of his economic report. </P>
<P> He also scheduled his first meeting with the president's export council, a panel established in 1973 to promote U.S. trade and investment abroad, and also was to meet with leaders of the U.S. science and technology industry. </P>
