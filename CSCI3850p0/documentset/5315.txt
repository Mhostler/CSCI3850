<P>  South Korea sought a fresh approach towards its arch rival North Korea on Thursday but ruled out any change in its insistence on South Korean reactors being part of a landmark U.S.-North Korean deal. </P>
<P> Prime Minister Lee Hong-koo said South Korea should help the communist North create the right circumstances for reforms and gradual opening to the West. </P>
<P> ``It is time to seek a fresh look and efforts on the question of reunification'' with North Korea, Lee said in a prepared speech at a seminar on inter-Korean relations. </P>
<P> However, top policymakers reaffirmed Seoul's position that it must play a central role in designing, manufacturing and installing light-water nuclear reactors to North Korea. </P>
<P> ``It is the government's uncompromisable basic position that the South Korean-standard light-water reactors should be adopted and our central role be secured in the project building the reactors,'' Unification Minister Rha Woong-bae told a meeting with senior ruling party officials. </P>
<P> ``If we make a concession in this position, we will have to accommodate endlessly North Korea's future negotiation strategy over the project,'' Rha, chief policymaker on the North, said. </P>
<P> North Korea said on Wednesday it submitted what it called an epoch-making proposal in its talks with the United States in Berlin to break the deadlock in a row over the reactors. </P>
<P> The South Korean news agency Yonhap, quoting foreign ministry officials, said the North suggested it could accept the CE-80 type reactor, designed by U.S. firm Combustion Engineering, with some technical modifications. </P>
<P> The South Korean-standard light-water reactors are developed from the CE-80 type under licence. </P>
<P> Yonhap and other South Korean media said North Korea also expressed willingness to accept South Korean participation in the reactor project, but not as the main contractor. </P>
<P> The local media said North Korea suggested it could take a Russian reactor in the form of part payment for an old debt. </P>
<P> The United States has said only South Korea can provide the reactors since only Seoul has agreed to shoulder the huge cost and Washington wants to encourage dialogue between North and South. </P>
<P> Under a U.S.-North Korean deal reached in Geneva last October, Washington promised Pyongyang $4.5 billion in new light-water reactors and alternative energy supplies in return for a freeze and an eventual decommission of Pyongyang's existing nuclear programme. </P>
<P> Seoul's foreign ministry spokesman declined to give details of the North Korean proposal but Yonhap quoted a government official as saying the North also attached about 10 conditions, including financing some projects to generate and distribute electricity. </P>
