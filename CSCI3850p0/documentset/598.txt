<P>  Tax police armed with a search warrant tried Thursday to get into the apartment of the head of Russia's troubled MMM investment fund, Sergei Mavrodi, but he refused to let them in. </P>
<P> The search warrant, read to reporters by a senior tax police official, Vasily Petukhov, said Mavrodi had failed to pay about $12 million in taxes. </P>
<P> It was the first legal action by authorities against the fund, which slashed the price of its shares last week after a crisis of confidence had triggered a run on the securities. </P>
<P> MMM's move left millions holding virtually worthless paper and prompted a fierce debate about whether Russia was doing enough to regulate wild financial markets. </P>
<P> Mavrodi ignored an invitation to meet Finance Ministry and tax officials Wednesday to discuss the issue. He denies that his fund, likened by authorities to a pyramid scheme, has done anything wrong. </P>
