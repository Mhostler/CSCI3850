<P>  Some child safety seats manufactured by Fisher-Price risk burning more quickly than government standards allow, the Transportation Department said Monday. </P>
<P> In a so-called initial decision that is subject to review and comment, the department said separate tests by the government and Fisher-Price showed that the shoulder belt webbing on seven models of the seats burned faster than the four inches per minute government standard allows. </P>
<P> The seat models involved are AO9101, DO9101, 9103, 9149, 9173, 9179 and 9180, manufactured between January 1988 and September 16, 1993. </P>
<P> The department said owners of the seats should continue using them while a final decision is pending. It said a child's greatest risk of injury in a moving vehicle comes from being unrestrained. </P>
<P> The department plans a public meeting on the issue in Washington at 10 a.m. October 21. After reviewing comments, it will make a final decision on whether to order a recall of the seats. </P>
