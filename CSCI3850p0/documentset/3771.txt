<P>  Four radio-collared gray wolves were released into the wilds of central Idaho Saturday, completing the first leg of a project begun in Yellowstone National Park this week to bring the wolves back to the American West, officials said. </P>
<P> The wolves, two males and two females, were released separately, said Phil Million of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife by phone from Salmon, Idaho. </P>
<P> ``We released a large male first, a beautiful 90 pound, black male called Moonstar Shadow,'' he said. ``He just took off and went into the wilderness.'' </P>
<P> Snow and fog prevented wildlife biologists from taking the wolves into the wilderness by helicopter, he said. </P>
<P> The weather was so bad scientists were forced to truck the animals from Salmon, Idaho to another location in the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness Area. </P>
<P> Thursday eight gray wolves were taken to Yellowstone National Park as part of a controversial $6 million program to release 30 wolves a year over the next three to five years to bring the wolf back to an area where it has not roamed for more than 60 years. </P>
<P> Million said scientists will soon begin flying over the area to see how the wolves are faring. </P>
<P> Ranchers vehemently oppose the plan saying the great predators will attack and kill their livestock. </P>
<P> The American Farm Bureau and affiliated farm organizations were unsuccessful this month in getting a federal judge to issue an immediate halt to the plan, but a lawsuit on the merits of the program is still pending. </P>
<P> Wildlife biologists are keen to see the wolves in their new surroundings so they can get acquainted and hopefully mate by mid-to-late February. Pups would be born about nine weeks later. </P>
