<DATELINE>SINGAPORE, April 23 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Singapore said on Sunday it had told the Philippine government it was astonished at criticisms in the Philippines of a joint autopsy the two countries conducted of a murdered Filipina maid. </P>
<P> A Singapore government statement also protested about an accusation that Singapore officials might have tampered with the maid's body shortly after the 1991 murder to simulate strangulation. </P>
<P> At issue is how Filipina maid Delia Maga died and if a woman could have killed her. Relations between the Philippines and Singapore soured last month after Singapore hanged another Filipina maid, Flor Contemplacion, who had confessed to killing Maga and a Singaporean boy in Maga's care. </P>
<P> The Singapore statement said the government had ``conveyed to the Philippine government its astonishment and dismay at certain remarks'' by a Philippine National Bureau of Investigation official and others against the team which conducted the Singapore side of the joint autopsy of Maga on Wednesday. </P>
<P> Singapore said it also protested against a ``baseless accusation that the Singapore forensic experts or 'their minions' might have strangled Delia Maga themselves to justify a predetermined autopsy finding.'' </P>
<P> Singapore said the remarks could contribute to the process the governments have agreed upon, ``which is to establish the truth.'' The two governments have previously agreed to have a third party panel examine the remains, which Singapore said was the ``best course.'' </P>
