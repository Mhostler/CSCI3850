<P>  Rep. Bill Richardson, who negotiated with North Korea for release of two downed U.S. helicopter pilots, called airman Bobby Hall ``a true American hero'' and charged that ``political games'' were played over his release. </P>
<P> ``I am enormously relieved to learn of Chief Warrant Officer Bobby Hall's release,'' Richardson said soon after the State Department announced Hall would be freed within hours. </P>
<P> In his statement Thursday, Richardson, a New Mexico Democrat, called Hall ``a true American hero, who showed a lot of guts and fortitude throughout this painful ordeal.''  Richardson said he believed North Korea honored their commitment made to him Dec. 21 that Hall would be released ''very soon.  But Richardson, who escorted the remains of Hall's fellow pilot, David Hilemon, back to South Korea after five days of negotiations, condemned the North Koreans. </P>
<P> ``However, the North Koreans played unfortunate political games with Hall's release and lost any goodwill from the American people and the United States Congress in the process,'' he said. ``North Korea's prolonged detention and lack of humanitarian access to Hall was inexcusable.'' </P>
<P> Richardson had been in North Korea to discuss a U.S.-North Korea nuclear agreement Dec. 17, the day the Army OH-58 helicopter, carrying Hall and Hilemon, apparently wandered over the demiltarized zone. </P>
<P> The congressman, a close ally of President Clinton, was thrown into the role of a negotiator to gain their release but did not see Hall and did not know immediately that Hilemon was dead. </P>
<P> North Korea said the helicopter was shot down but the United States said it did not know how it was grounded. </P>
<P> Washington also vigorously denied the plane was on a spying mission as North Korea claimed, saying the plane accidently crossed the demilitarized zone set up at the end of the Korean War in 1953. </P>
<P> Despite his criticism, Richardson said that it is important that the U.S. and North Korea learn to live with each other. </P>
