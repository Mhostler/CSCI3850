<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A high-level NATO delegation is scheduled to discuss a tougher air strike policy in Bosnia at the United Nations next week. </P>
<P> The meeting, which will include French Gen. Bertrand Lapresle, the U.N. commander in the Balkans, was originally expected for Thursday. But diplomats said it would not begin until Monday and delegates would arrive over the weekend. </P>
<P> Among the NATO proposals is to allow air strikes without warning to the combatants, increase the number of targets that can be hit and allow NATO pilots to make the final decision on which target to strike. </P>
<P> The United Nations, however, argues that it would consider an increase in targets if they were directly related to the offense that led to the air strike. </P>
<P> ``Suprise is a principle of war and not of peacekeeping,'' one official said, adding that the United Nations could not afford to be associated with any civilian casualties. </P>
<P> Under the current ``dual key'' approach in Bosnia, U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) commanders call in NATO air strikes if U.N. peacekeepers are struck or if Bosnian combatants, mainly Bosnian Serbs, are violating weapons exclusion zones around Sarajevo and Goradze. </P>
<P> But U.N. officials said a possible compromise could include a more rapid response when offenses occurred and more damage to the offending unit and weapons system. </P>
<P> A major fear of the United Nations is that more robust action would mean hitting Serb targets in areas not related to where the offense took place. </P>
<P> This would lead U.N. troops into a confrontation with Bosnian Serbs and thereby make delivery of aid throughout the country impossible. Three Muslim enclaves in eastern Bosnia, Sbrenica, Zepa and Goradze, depend almost exclusively on U.N. assistance, routed through Serb-controlled territory. </P>
<P> NATO's acting secretary-general Sergio Balanzino wrote to U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali on Friday, saying NATO ambassadors wanted: </P>
<P> -- Air strikes should be conducted on a timely basis and as soon as possible after a violation. </P>
<P> -- Strikes should be conducted without warning to the offending party. </P>
<P> -- NATO and UNPROFOR should authorize a minimum of four targets for each violation, but NATO commanders or pilots should determine which targets are actually attacked. </P>
