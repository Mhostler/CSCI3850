<P>  The FBI said Thursday it had put on its ``Ten Most Wanted Fugitives'' list two Libyans charged in the United States and Britain with the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. </P>
<P> The FBI also said the U.S. government would offer a record $4 million reward for information leading to the arrest of Abdel Basset Ali Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, who were charged in 1991 with planting the bomb that destroyed the jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland Dec. 21, 1988, killing 270 people in the plane and on the ground. </P>
<P> Robert Bryant, assisant FBI director for national security, told a news conference the two fugitives currently were in Libya, although they reportedly have traveled to other countries in the past. He said the announcement was designed to show the United States had not forgotten about the case. </P>
<P> ``We will follow them to the ends of the world,'' Bryant vowed. ``We will never quit or leave on this case. We are going to stay with it until it is resolved.'' </P>
<P> Tripoli's refusal to hand over the two suspects for trial in the United States or Britain has prompted U.N. sanctions against Libya. </P>
<P> Bryant said the FBI wanted to get the reward information to the people of Libya and North Africa. It will use posters and matchbooks and will, for the first time, place information about the suspects on the Internet computer network.  ``Any legitimate lead that comes in, we will follow to its logical conclusion,'' he said. </P>
<P> Asked if the FBI would send agents into Libya to kidnap the two suspects, Bryant declined comment. But he said earlier that the United States would use every ``legal, ethical and diplomatic means to get them into a court of law.'' </P>
<P> He also said the decision to offer a reward for the two Libyans was not related to the arrest in February of the suspected mastermind of the 1993 New York World Trade Center bombing, Ramzi Ahmed Yousef. He had been on the FBI's most wanted list and was captured in Pakistan as result of a U.S. reward. </P>
