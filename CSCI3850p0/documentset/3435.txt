<P>  John Osborne, the ``angry young man'' who changed the face of British theater with his blistering social dramas, has died aged 65, hospital officials said Monday. </P>
<P> The playwright, who shot to fame in 1956 with ``Look Back in Anger,'' a blast against the stuffy conventions of English post-war life, died of heart failure in a hospital near his home in Shropshire, central England, a hospital spokeswoman said. </P>
<P> Osborne, a diabetic known for his hard drinking, had been seriously ill in the hospital for more than a week, she said. </P>
<P> ``Mr. Osborne died of heart failure on Christmas Eve. His wife, Helen, was with him,'' she said. </P>
<P> Osborne's agent, Gordon Dickerson, told the Daily Mail: ``We had no hint of any problems until a few weeks ago, but when he went into hospital it became clear that he would not be coming out again.'' </P>
<P> He added: ``It is an enormous loss. He was one of the greatest dramatists and writers.'' </P>
<P> With ``Look Back in Anger'' Osborne introduced the genre of the ``kitchen sink drama,'' then a revolutionary way of writing using everyday settings. Its hero, Jimmy Porter, became a symbol of educated rebellious youth in the fifties. </P>
<P> Osborne's private life was almost as controversial as his drama. Married five times, he gained a reputation as a hard-drinking, irascible character. </P>
<P> His 1992 autobiography ``Almost A Gentleman'' brought him much criticism with its vitriolic comments on colleagues and his ex-wives. He described the suicide of his fourth wife, actress Jill Bennett, as the ``coarse posturing of an overheated housemaid.'' </P>
<P> Author-playwright Sheridan Morley told BBC Radio: ``He was wonderfully vindictive, he was savage about his own mother in his memoirs. He took no prisoners, gave no hostages. He was full of loathing and bile and yet there was a richness of language in John.'' </P>
<P> Osborne also wrote ``The Entertainer,'' ``Inadmissible Evidence,'' and ``A Patriot for Me.'' He won an Oscar for best screenplay with the 1964 film ``Tom Jones.'' </P>
<P> Richard Burton memorably starred as Jimmy Porter in the film version of ``Look Back in Anger,'' and Laurence Olivier took the role of Archie Rice in ``The Entertainer.'' </P>
