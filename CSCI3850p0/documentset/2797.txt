<P>  United States U.N. envoy Madeleine Albright will fly to Haiti Thursday to meet President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and have Thanksgiving dinner with U.S. troops, a U.S. spokesman said Wednesday. </P>
<P> She will be accompanied by Gen. John Sheehan, head of the U.S. Atlantic Command. </P>
<P> In Port-au-Prince, she and Defense Secretary William Perry will confer with President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. They will discuss the U.S.-led operation which began in September to oversee the departure of Haitian strongman Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras and Aristide's return Oct. 15 after three years of exile. </P>
<P> Albright will also meet Haitian Prime Minister Smarck Michel, members of parliament, U.N. special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, and the head of an international civilian monitoring mission, Colin Granderson. </P>
<P> Later, she and Sheehan will visit Jacmel, in the south of the country, and have Thanksgiving dinner with members of a U.S. Special Forces unit. She will also tour a training center for Haiti's new U.N.-organized civilian police. </P>
<P> The U.S. force in Haiti, which at one point numberered about 20,000, is now down to about 10,700. Some 820 police monitors from 20 countries are also part of the multi-national operation. </P>
<P> It will eventually hand over control to a 6,000-member U.N. Mission in Haiti (UNMIH), up to half of which will comprise U.S. personnel. No date for this has yet been announced. </P>
<P> An UNMIH advance guard of about 50 observers is already in Haiti and U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has proposed increasing their number to 500 in preparation for the takeover from the U.S.-led force. </P>
<P> In a written report to the Security Council Wednesday, Albright said there had been continued improvement in the security situation in Haiti, with relatively few reports of violence among Haitians or against the new Haitian government. </P>
<P> She said the U.S.-led force was continuing to assist in restoring democratic government throughout the country, where parliamentary and local elections are due to be held early next year. </P>
