<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A California Latino group called Thursday for a boycott of RJR Nabisco products, saying the company made contributions to politicians who supported a controversial anti-illegal immigration measure. </P>
<P> The boycott call by the California Latino Civil Rights Network is the latest protest over Proposition 187, a measure passed by California voters last month which would cut off most services to the state's 1.7 million illegal immigrants. </P>
<P> Court challenges have blocked implementation of the measure, which has angered and frightened many in California's large Latino community. </P>
<P> The Civil Rights Network alleged that RJR Nabisco, which makes a wide range of food products as well as Camel cigarettes, contributed to Republican state legislative candidates in November's election who supported Proposition 187. </P>
<P> Carol Makovich, a spokeswoman for RJR Nabisco in New York, said the company did not support Proposition 187. </P>
<P> ``As a rule, it is our company policy that we take no position on any issue that is not germane to our business, so we have no position on Proposition 187 whatsoever,'' she said. </P>
<P> Makovich said RJR Nabisco makes political contributions to many candidates around the country based on their stance on issues important to the company's business. </P>
<P> Ortensia Lopez, the Civil Rights Network's chairwoman, said the group was calling an international boycott and hoped people in Latin America would join in. </P>
<P> The group said it selected RJR Nabisco as its first boycott target because the Latino community is a big consumer of the company's products and because it operates throughout Latin America. </P>
<P> But officials of the group, a coalition of more than 600 organizations and individuals in California that works for the Latino community's civil rights, said they planned to call for a boycott of other companies in coming weeks. </P>
<P> ``Proposition 187 was a racist initiative that unfairly singled out and scapegoated the Latino community,'' Mario Salgado, executive director of the Civil Rights Network, said in a statement. </P>
<P> ``We want to let these companies know that they cannot support irresponsible legislation that harms our community and then expect to profit from us,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``We want an apology and a commitment from them not to support this type of legislation or politicians who propose it. In addition, we want them to help remedy the conditions caused by Proposition 187,'' he said. </P>
<P> The group said it was also launching a statewide non-compliance campaign against Proposition 187, but gave no details. </P>
<P> The Mexico-based World Boxing Council last month announced a ban on world title fights in California because of the anti-immigration measure and the National Association of Hispanic Journalists said it would not hold meetings in California in protest. </P>
