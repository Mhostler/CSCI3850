<P>  The Federal Election Commission, which monitors voting, protested Tuesday that congressional budget cuts will hinder its ability to ensure that candidates follow federal election laws. </P>
<P> A House and Senate appropriations conference committee has voted to rescind $1.4 million from the FEC's $27 million budget for this year. </P>
<P> ``I am extremely disappointed the conference committee did not adopt the Senate's initial conclusion (for no cuts) and reject a budget rescission for the FEC,'' chairman Danny McDonald said. </P>
<P> He said any budget cut would make it ``especially difficult'' for the commission to carry out its duties going into a presidential election year in 1996. Even without the cut the agency's budget is stretched thin, he said. </P>
<P> ``The net effect of the recession will be to hamper our ability to train candidate, party, and political action committees in the law, and could prevent us from conducting audits and investigations in some matters that truly may warrent them,'' he said. </P>
<P> He also complained the agency seemed to be singled out among independent regulatorry agencies for a retroactive cut in its 1995 appropriations. </P>
