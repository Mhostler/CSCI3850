<P>  Five New England states are considering holding 1996 presidential primaries on the same day as six Southern states, giving the politically moderate region more clout, a Boston newspaper reported Tuesday. </P>
<P> The secretaries of state from Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Vermont met privately last week at a national convention in Washington, D.C., and agreed to push the idea with their respective state leaders. </P>
<P> Should the plan reach fruition, the five New England states would join six Southern states in holding their primaries on March 12 -- dubbed Super Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``Our concern with the current schedule is that it basically diminishes New England's influence because of the disarray of dates spread throughout March,'' Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin told the Globe. </P>
<P> Under the plan, Connecticut would move its primary back from March 26 -- the same day as the California primary -- to March 12. Maine and Vermont, currently slated to hold caucuses March 5, would switch to primaries and move the date to March 12 -- the same day primaries in Massachusetts and Rhode Island are scheduled. </P>
<P> Primaries in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and Oklahoma are currently scheduled for the same day. </P>
<P> ``The idea is that if we could have a New England regional primary, it would be much more effective than having all of the states do their own things,'' said Maine Secretary of State William Diamond. </P>
<P> The plan would undoubtedly help Massachusetts Governor William Weld, who is mulling a run for the Republican presidential nomination. </P>
