<DATELINE>NAPLES, Italy (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Boris Yeltsin said Sunday he had promised President Clinton to make another attempt to negotiate a withdrawal of Russian troops from Estonia by the end of August. </P>
<P> Speaking at a joint news conference after a brief bilateral summit, Yeltsin said there was no agreement so far and accused the Estonians of ``gross violations of the human rights of Russian-speakers'' living there, especially military pensioners. </P>
<P> Asked whether the troops would be gone by August 31, Yeltsin initially surprised Clinton with an outright ``No.'' But he modified his response in later comments. </P>
<P> He said Clinton -- who met Estonian President Lennart Meri in Riga, Latvia, last Wednesday -- had urged respect for human rights and added that he expected Meri to take note. </P>
<P> ``I promised Clinton that I would meet him (Meri) personally and discuss this question and somehow try to resolve this quarrel,'' Yeltsin said. </P>
<P> Clinton earlier told the news conference, held after a summit here of the Group of Seven industrial nations and Russia as a partial member, that he was confident an agreement could be reached. </P>
<P> ``I believe the differences between the two countries have been narrowed and that an agreement can be reached in the near future so that the troops will be able to be withdrawn by the end of August,'' he said. </P>
<P> Clinton urged agreement, saying it would remove one of the last bitter legacies of World War Two. </P>
<P> Estonia is the last of the three Baltic republics to negotiate a withdrawal of Russian troops, left there from the Soviet era. </P>
<P> August 31 is a deadline agreed to earlier, but subsequently suspended. </P>
<P> Yeltsin noted that Russia had already removed it troops from Lithuania, and was about to pull its last troops out of both Germany and Latvia. </P>
<P> Moscow is angered because most Russian-speakers in Estonia have no right to Estonian citizenship or to vote. It demands a commitment from the Tallinn government to change the rules before pulling out the last 2,500 troops. </P>
<P> Estonians argue that the Russian-speakers, the vast majority of whom were brought into the country after it was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1941, should not have the same rights as ethnic Estonians. </P>
<P> They are particularly concerned about several thousand former army officers, many in their 40s and 50s, who some Estonians see as a potential fifth column. </P>
<P> ``With Estonia we have some serious complications concerning the gross violations of the human rights of the Russian-speaking population, especially military pensioners,'' Yeltsin said. </P>
<P> ``When he met the Baltic leaders in Riga, Bill Clinton expressed his opinion that they should respect these rights. I think that after that the president of Estonia will pay attention.'' </P>
