<P>  South Korea welcomed the release Friday of a U.S. helicopter pilot detained in North Korea for 13 days and called for renewed dialog between the North and South, which are still technically at war. </P>
<P> ``It is fortunate that Chief Warrant Officer Bobby Hall has been repatriated,'' the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. </P>
<P> Hall, looking pale and drawn, crossed the heavily fortified border into South Korea after being released by Pyongyang. He had been held since his helicopter crashed in North Korea Dec. </P>
<P> Pyongyang says it shot down the aircraft and that Hall's co-pilot, David Hilemon, whose body was handed over last week, was killed in the crash. </P>
<P> The North also accused the Americans of espionage and issued Thursday what it described as a confession by Hall to ``illegal intrusion'' into its territory. Washington says the helicopter strayed accidentally into North Korean airspace. </P>
<P> The South Korean statement said the downing of Hall's helicopter and his detention ``reconfirmed the reality of military confrontations on the Korean peninsula.'' </P>
<P> It urged the North to resume inter-Korean talks at an earliest date and try to make progress in South-North ties, ``in order to remove an extraordinary situation like this.'' </P>
<P> North and South Korea are still technically at war after their 1950-53 conflict and relations are kept in line by a fragile U.N.-brokered armistice. </P>
<P> ``The armistice agreement should remain valid until the present situation (on the peninsula) is turned into a peaceful one,'' the statement said. </P>
<P> North Korea has described the armistice as ``a worthless piece of paper'' and demands it be replaced with a peace agreement. </P>
