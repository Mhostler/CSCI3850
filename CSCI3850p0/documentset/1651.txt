<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Sinn Fein leader Jerry Adams called Wednesday for all sides in the Northern Ireland conflict to halt continued violence and urged that peace talks begin soon. </P>
<P> Adams is on a two-week U.S. tour a month after the Irish Republican Army (IRA) declared a cease-fire in its 25-year war against British rule of Northern Ireland. </P>
<P> ``It's been a month into cessation and we still don't have peace,'' Adams told reporters shortly after meeting with a group of Wall Street bankers. </P>
<P> Despite the historic step, Adams said 30,000 British troops are still on duty in Northern Ireland, loyalist death squads are still active and offices of the Sinn Fein had been bombed. He called on all sides to cease the violence. </P>
<P> ``If there is one message, it is that peace talks should begin now,'' he said, proposing that Britain grant him travel rights to visit London and hold negotiations. </P>
<P> He made the brief remarks after New York City Comptroller Alan Hevesi presented Adams with the city's freedom award for ''making the peace process work.'' Adams was then brought to the mayor's office for a formal ceremony. </P>
<P> During the morning he met privately with the group of bankers, saying he was laying the groundwork for investment in Northern Ireland. </P>
<P> Adams is seeking to get deep-pocketed Americans to invest in Northern Ireland and help create jobs in a land where the unemployment rate runs at 13 to 14 percent. </P>
<P> The meeting was hosted by Comptroller Hevesi, who holds the purse strings to $51 billion in public pension funds. He proposed an initiative which he said could pump millions of dollars into Northern Ireland's peactime economy -- Ireland Peace Bonds. </P>
<P> The program would tap into the wallets of 40 million Irish Americans who claim Irish heritage, giving them a chance to invest in a land to which they have an emotional attachment, Hevesi said. </P>
<P> The province is supported with large subsidies from the British government -- about $11.6 billion this year alone, of which $1.4 billion is security related. </P>
<P> Economists have said that investment, tourism and a more positive climate will be the main prize of peace, but it unclear how much money will flow into the area and how long it will take. Hevesi declined to make any predictions on how much money the bond program would raise. </P>
<P> The trip is Adams' second to the United States this year and the first since the IRA called the cease-fire on August 31. His last visit to the United States was for two days last February, after having been kept out for 20 years. </P>
<P> Adams' brother, Domenic, was recently arrested and deported from Canada because officials there believe he has a criminal record. </P>
<P> The Immigration Department said Wednesday that Adams was arrested September 21 in Toronto. He was taken to a detention center near Pearson International Airport and a hearing was held September 23, immigration spokesman Kevin Sack said. </P>
<P> Sack said Adams was deported on a scheduled charter flight to Belfast the following day. </P>
