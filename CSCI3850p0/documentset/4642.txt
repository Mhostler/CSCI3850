<P>  North Koreans Wednesday paid funeral tributes to their late Defense Minister O Jin-u, number two in the communist state's hierarchy, who died of cancer last weekend. </P>
<P> ``Endless were the ranks of mourners visiting the February 8 House of Culture where the bier of the deceased is lying in state, feeling deep sorrow at the loss of O Jin-u, the most faithful revolutionary soldier of the Great Leader President Kim Il-sung,'' said the official Korean Central News Agency. </P>
<P> ``The mourners paid a moment's silent tribute to the memory of the deceased,'' KCNA, monitored in Tokyo, added. </P>
<P> However, it did not say whether Kim Jong-il, the eldest son and heir of late President Kim Il-sung, appeared at the funeral. </P>
<P> Radio Pyongyang had said Kim Jong-il would head the 240-member funeral committee, which included senior party and state officials. The state funeral was to start Wednesday morning. </P>
<P> The death last Saturday of O, head of North Korea's 1.1-million-strong military, compounds the mystery over developments in the corridors of power of the secretive state, which is already reeling from the shock of losing its founder Kim Il-sung last July. </P>
<P> O, one of Kim's closest allies, was a staunch advocate of the autocratic leader's decision two decades ago to groom his son Jong-il for succession. </P>
<P> The late defense minister spent nearly six weeks late last year at a Paris hospital for treatment of lung cancer. South Korea's intelligence officers said then that, although he had received both radiation treatment and chemotherapy, the cancer was too far advanced. </P>
