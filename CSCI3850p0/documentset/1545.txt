<P>  Writers attending an international conference on freedom of expression launched a campaign Thursday for the release of four imprisoned colleagues and the lifting of Iran's death sentence on Salman Rushdie. </P>
<P> The international PEN Club urged the 300 delegates at the symposium to mail printed appeals to the authorities of Iran, South Korea, Cuba, Nigeria and Yemen. </P>
<P> Iran's revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in 1989 issued a fatwa, or death edict, on the British author for his book ``The Satanic Verses'' because it was deemed blasphemous to Islam. Rushdie has been under protection by British authorities ever since. </P>
<P> ``My hope is that you, President Rafsanjani, will show the necessary courage to stop further bloodshed by immediately lifting the fatwa,'' the appeal said. It said the fatwa should also be lifted on others connected with the book. </P>
<P> ``Enough innocent people have already been killed or mutilated because of this religious feud,'' the appeal added. </P>
<P> The fatwa extends to all connected with ``The Satanic Verses,'' such as publishers and translators. </P>
<P> In October last year the Norwegian publisher of the book, William Nygaard, was shot and wounded by unknown gunmen. The Japanese translator, Hitoshi Igarashi, was stabbed to death in 1991. Ettore Capriolo, who translated the novel into Italian, was injured in a knife attack the same year. </P>
<P> PEN also asked for the release of Hwang Suk-yong in South Korea, Yndamiro Restano in Cuba, Ken Saro-Wiwa in Nigeria and Yemeni writer and poet Mansur Muhammad Ahmad Rajih -- all of whom were invited to the two-day conference hosted by the Norwegian Authors' Union. </P>
<P> Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin, who fled to Sweden last month after Muslim fundamentalists threatened to kill her, was among those attending the symposium which ended Thursday. </P>
<P> ``I will continue my fight against fundamentalism, against darkness, ignorance (and) blindness of people,'' she told reporters. </P>
<P> Nasrin was in hiding in Bangladesh for two months after the government ordered her arrest for allegedly insulting Muslim religious feelings by telling India's Statesman newspaper that Islam's holy book, the Koran, should be ``revised thoroughly.'' </P>
<P> Nasrin, a 32-year-old physician-turned-writer, has said she was misquoted. </P>
