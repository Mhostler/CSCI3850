<P>  The following is a transcript of a letter, as shown to the jury in the O.J. Simpson double murder trial, written by Kathleen Bell to defense attorney Johnnie Cochran last July, in which she accused Detective Mark Fuhrman of making racist remarks. </P>
<P> ``Between 1985 and 1986 I worked as a real estate agent in Redondo Beach for Century 21 Bob Maher Realty (now out of business). At the time. My office was located above a Marine recruiting center off of Pacific Coast Highway. </P>
<P> ``On occasion I would stop in to say hello to the two Marines working there. I saw Mr. Ferman (sic) there a couple of times. I remember him distinctly because of his height and build. </P>
<P> ``While speaking to the men I learned that Mr. Ferman was a police officer in Westwood, and I don't know if he was telling the truth but he said he had been in a special division of the Marines. </P>
<P> ``I don't know how the subject was raised, but Officer Ferman said that when he sees a ``nigger'' (as he called it) driving with a white woman, he would pull them over. I asked would (sic) if he didn't have a reason and he said that he would find one. </P>
<P> ``I looked at the Marines to see if they knew he was joking, but it became obvious to me that he was very serious. </P>
<P> ``Officer Ferman went on to say he would like nothing more than to see all the ``niggers'' gathered together and killed. He said something about burning them or bombing them. I was too shocked to remember the words he used.'' </P>
