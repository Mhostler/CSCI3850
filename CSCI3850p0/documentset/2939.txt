<P>  Under the shadow of the crisis in Bosnia, NATO foreign ministers met Thursday for a meeting they hope can heal an open rift and set the alliance on a new path. </P>
<P> ``This conflict in the heart of Europe poses a paramount challenge not only for our alliance, but also for the entire international community,'' NATO Secretary-General Willy Claes said in an opening statement. </P>
<P> With the U.N.'s peacekeeping mission increasingly questioned, the ministers will review NATO's support role which has pulled the alliance into a damaging public dispute between Washington and the European allies. </P>
<P> ``The crisis in Bosnia is about Bosnia and the former Yugoslavia. It does not diminish NATO's enduring importance,'' said Secretary of State Warren Christopher. </P>
<P> ``The allies remain committed to NATO's irreplaceable role as the key to European security,'' he added in his opening speech. </P>
<P> Christopher has in his bag proposals to revive Bosnian peace talks which go a long way toward meeting European insistence that diplomatic not military means should be used to end the 32-month conflict. </P>
<P> Alliance solidarity has fallen apart on whether to use NATO air power to protect the U.N.'s so-called safe haven of Bihac falling to a ferocious Serb onslaught, with the Europeans opposed to plans that may bring reprisals on their peacekeepers. </P>
<P> Arriving for the meeting, British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd again stressed London's view of a need to negotiate an end to the conflict. </P>
<P> ``The alternative is withdrawal of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), the lifting of the arms embargo, and renewed savagery,'' he told waiting reporters. </P>
<P> A new message has come out of Washington in recent days, apparently bringing the administration closer to the European position. </P>
<P> ``There is a consensus NATO is too important to lose over Bosnia,'' said one NATO source. </P>
<P> The U.S. administration dismayed its the allies just over two weeks ago by deciding, under strong Congressional pressure, not to enforce an arms embargo on the Muslims. </P>
<P> Political analysts said the new U.S. attempt to broker talks between the factions, with the possible follow-up of an international conference, would be accompanied by fresh diplomatic pressure on all sides. </P>
<P> Earlier, both Hurd and Christopher said they might travel to Belgrade during the weekend to meet Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. </P>
<P> The two men, meeting before a NATO foreign ministers' session, told reporters their trip would depend on talks due to take place in Brussels Friday evening by the five-country ``contact group'' on the Bosnian war. </P>
<P> The so-called ``contact group'' comprises the United States, Russia, Germany, Britain and France. </P>
<P> Washington originally wanted the NATO meeting to focus on enlarging the alliance to absorb its former Warsaw Pact foes from eastern Europe to solidify its Cold War victory. </P>
<P> But that issue too is fraught with problems with several European nations anxious the exercise should not alienate Russia. </P>
<P> The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was due to consider terms for admitting the eastern European states but was not expected to set a definite timetable for doing so, diplomats said. </P>
