<P>  An army general in charge of a military crackdown on organised crime in Rio said his aim is to arrest the big players who control the drug trade in the city, Brazilian newspapers reported on Thursday. </P>
<P> ``The priority ... is not the visible action at the entry points to the shanty-towns but rather the investigative work to identify the traffickers in the rest of the city,'' General Roberto Camara Senna was quoted as saying. </P>
<P> ``There are police officers and possibly public figures involved in the drug trade,'' he said. </P>
<P> Senna's comments were passed to the press by representatives of Viva Rio, an influential anti-violence group, who met behind closed doors with the general on Wednesday. </P>
<P> Brazil must also improve border control if it is to reduce drug traffic, Senna told the group. </P>
<P> An estimated 2,000 troops backed by tanks and helicopters raided two shanty-towns in Rio last weekend to search for drug traffickers and arrested some 130 people, mostly for failing to carry identification. </P>
<P> Since then, the military has set up checkpoints at entry points to hillside shanty-towns which drug gangs use as their strongholds. </P>
<P> A leading Roman Catholic bishop in Brazil warned against excessive use of force by the military during the operation, newspapers said. </P>
<P> ``The (armed forces) ... cannot pass judgment on people, nor can they take away their lives,'' said Bishop Luciano Mendes, president of the Brazilian Confederation of Bishops. </P>
<P> Those arrested by the military have complained of being stripped naked during searches. One man was wounded in the arm when he was shot by mistake during a raid. </P>
<P> Brazilian President Itamar Franco ordered the military to head a crackdown on organised crime and corruption in Rio on October 31 in response to growing concern about the power of drug gangs and their influence over police in the city. </P>
