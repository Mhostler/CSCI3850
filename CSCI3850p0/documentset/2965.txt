<P>  The United Nations urged NATO Friday to hold back on enforcement of a no-fly zone over Bosnia, saying it was too dangerous, western military sources said. </P>
<P> The move risked sparking a fresh political row with NATO which maintains it can easily deal with any threat from Serb anti-aircraft positions, they said. </P>
<P> The sources said NATO was angered by suggestions its planes could be threatened by Serb surface-to-air missile (SAM) sites. </P>
<P> ``The SAM sites are being blamed, but that is not the reason for the (U.N.) action,'' said one western military source. ``NATO could deal with any threat.'' </P>
<P> He said the U.N. request had been made for political reasons. U.N. officials, keen to boost the prospects for reviving Bosnian peace talks, want to try to lower the temperature on the ground, the sources said. </P>
