<P>  The purchasing power of black consumers is growing faster than that of Americans as a whole, according to a University of Georgia study released Wednesday. </P>
<P> But one of the experts who conducted the study says that while the results underscore the growing importance of the black consumer market, figures do not indicate that a stubborn gap in prosperity between blacks and whites is narrowing. </P>
<P> Based on U.S. Census data for all 50 states, the study says black purchasing power will have surged 33.9 percent to $399 billion over a five-year period ending in 1995. </P>
<P> That is double an anticipated inflation rate of 16.4 percent for the period and compares favorably with a 29.5 percent growth rate for total U.S. spending power. </P>
<P> The study also points to a gain in the black community's share of commercial spending from 7.4 percent to 7.6 percent. </P>
<P> But rather than illustrating a rise in living standards for black Americans, the aggregate data largely reflect the impact of population growth and inflation on total personal income after taxes for the black community as a whole. </P>
<P> ``If you look at the data over a long period of time, say, since 1980, you'll see that everybody's incomes are rising. But the relative gap between black and non-black income has remained pretty constant,' Jeff Humphreys, the University of Georgia's director of economic forecasting, said. </P>
<P> ``Not much progress has been made in eliminating that gap,'' he said. He estimates the gap in purchasing power at about 33 percent, he said. </P>
<P> Humphreys said the study's results do provide useful information for companies looking to expand in specific markets. </P>
<P> ``Sales to black consumers are increasingly important in the marketplace, Humphreys said. </P>
<P> ``The spending power African Americans control can be the margin between success or failure for many businesses. So, it just makes sense for retailers to try to appeal to one of the fastest growing segments of the population,'' he said. </P>
<P> The study listed Georgia, Florida and Texas as three states with fast-growing economic power among large black populations. </P>
