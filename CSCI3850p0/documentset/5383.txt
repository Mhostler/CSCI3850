<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Davis Love parred his 18th hole in the dark to take a one-shot lead at the New Orleans Classic Saturday with six players yet to complete the third round. </P>
<P> The more than eight inches of rain which fell on English Turn G.C. from Tuesday through Friday postponed play in the second round, forcing half the field to complete that round on Saturday morning. </P>
<P> The third round began Saturday afternoon, but had to be postponed by darkness. The six players stranded on the course will complete their rounds on Sunday morning, and the final round will then be played as scheduled. </P>
<P> Love was the last to finish, carding a 6-under-par 66 that left him at 13-under 203. Steve Jones was in second place at 12 under, also after a 66. </P>
<P> Three players were at 11 under but only David Peoples had completed play, shooting a 66. The others at 11 under were David Duval and 1993 New Orleans winner Mike Standly, both through 15 holes. </P>
<P> Over the past month Love has had a very public campaign to win a PGA Tour event and thus earn an invitation to next week's Masters. Said Love: ``Whenever I hit a good shot out there, people shout, 'We're going to the Masters.' I don't know where they think they're getting their tickets.'' </P>
<P> He made a good step towards getting his invitation on Saturday, his 66 including eagles on two of the par-5s. On the second hole Love hit a 5-iron to 15 feet for eagle, and on the 11th he landed a 3-wood to six feet for his second eagle. Love also had three birdies and a bogey. </P>
<P> Said Love: ``I told my brother, I wish we could just keep playing, I'm hitting it so good. And I've really got my confidence with my putter. </P>
<P> ``The crowds got a little crazy out there. They are really rooting for me to do well. I've got enough pressure on me without anybody saying anything. I'm blocking them out.'' </P>
<P> Jones, playing this year on a special medical exemption after nearly three years of recuperation from an injury to his left hand caused by a dirt bike accident, is contending for the first time since 1991. </P>
<P> Jones had seven birdies and a single bogey in his round on Saturday. </P>
<P> Said Jones, a four-time winner on the tour: ``I don't know if I ever will be 100 percent back to what I was. My finger is a bit creaky and I have to use a reverse overlap grip. But I've been off for three years, and I'd play left-handed if I had to.'' </P>
