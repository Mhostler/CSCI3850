<P>  Austrian Airlines said Thursday it would resume flying to Belgrade, joining several airlines in restoring service to the Serbian capital after a three-year interruption due to U.N. sanctions. </P>
<P> In a statement, the Austrian national flag carrier said it would fly to Belgrade twice weekly starting Jan. 26. In March, it is to resume daily flights to Belgrade. </P>
<P> The U.N. Security Council voted in September to suspend some sanctions imposed on Serbia and Montenegro in 1992. The move was a reward for Belgrade's new military blockade of Bosnian Serbs who refuse to accept an international peace plan. </P>
<P> International air carriers that have since resumed service to Belgrade include Lufthansa, Swissair, Air France, Aeroflot and Romania's state airline Tarom. </P>
