<P>  A public school system sued by a mother who claims it forced Bible study and school prayer on her five children said Thursday it will go to court to defend its practices as constitutional. </P>
<P> Jerry Horton, superintendant of the Pontotoc County School District, said religious activities are not forced on children by the school system, in spite of allegations by Lisa Herdahl, the mother who filed suit this week claiming otherwise. </P>
<P> Religious activities are ``student-initiated and completely controlled by the students, not the administration or the school,'' he said in an interview. </P>
<P> Herdahl, who moved to the Mississippi town of Ecru from Wisconsin last year, filed suit in federal court Dec. 20. She said the school district broadcasts morning prayers over its intercom system, conducts religious classes, and allows Bible teachers onto school property to lead religious instruction. </P>
<P> And when her children -- baptized as Lutherans -- elected not to participate, Herdahl said in an interview Wednesday they were teased and harassed by other students and teachers. </P>
<P> One teacher said her son left Bible class because he does not believe in God, which is not true, she said. </P>
<P> Horton said the school intercom system is available to any student, teacher or community organization that wants to use it and that students are able to opt out of Bible classes. </P>
<P> ``If a student asks permission to share a short, 30-second devotional or prayer in the morning, we will not refuse them,'' he said, but added that does not mean the school sanctions prayer. </P>
<P> ``My belief is that in order to understand Western civilization, you must have a knowledge of the Bible as history and as literature. Our laws are influenced by Judeo-Christian ideals,'' Horton said. </P>
<P> Mississippi state law allows informal student-led prayer in schools. </P>
<P> A class at the center of the dispute is an elective -- Middle East History. Its only text is the King James Bible. </P>
<P> The North Pontotoc Attendance Center, which has 1,300 students from kindergarten through high school in the northeastern corner of the Mississippi Delta region, is the only public school in its area. </P>
<P> The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled school prayer inconsistent with the Constitution's separation of church and state, but Republican legislators have said they plan to make school prayer a major issue in the new U.S. Congress. </P>
