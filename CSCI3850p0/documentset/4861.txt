<P>  Hosts Argentina made a triumphant return to Pan-American Games baseball by humbling the United States at their own game, 6-4, Saturday. </P>
<P> But they quickly seized the advantage against the Americans, scoring five runs in the first inning to thunderous applause and fireworks at Ezeiza Stadium, and the U.S. collegians never caught up. </P>
<P> ``It was a great deal of pride to play this game,'' said Argentine manager Carlos Siffredi. ``Our first big objective is to a win a Pan-American Games medal. This has been a five-year process.'' </P>
<P> The first five Argentine hitters of the game scored to the delight of the opening day crowd. </P>
<P> The United States, represented by the St. John's University team, rallied for three runs in the bottom of the first inning with Chris Lemonis's double the key hit. </P>
<P> Another U.S. run in the second made it 5-4, but neither team scored again until Argentina collected the game's final run in the eighth inning. </P>
<P> Lisandro Cordoba was the winning pitcher for Argentina, allowing four hits and striking out eight over eight innings. </P>
<P> U.S. starter Mike Maertern gave up nine hits before being replaced in the seventh inning. </P>
<P> ``We're the type of team that will make some mistakes early, and then settle down,'' said U.S. manager Joe Russo. </P>
<P> ``The first inning was our downfall. We got Cordoba on the ropes early, but we couldn't take advantage of it. He settled down and pitched real well for them.'' </P>
