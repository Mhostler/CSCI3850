<P>  Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said Wednesday the Czech Republic would wait to apply for membership to the European Union until 1996, but added it was realistic to expect entry as early as 1999. </P>
<P> ``The negotiations (to enter) will start after the EU's inter-governmental conference in 1996, and we suppose that the reality of our entry into the EU is truly around 1999,'' Klaus told reporters following a cabinet session. </P>
<P> The Czechs, along with Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria, have already signed association agreements with the EU providing for trade and aid, but the EU has repeatedly refused to set any target dates for full membership. </P>
<P> Prague had said earlier it would apply before the major EU review summit planned for 1996, but did not specify when. </P>
<P> Poland and Hungary earlier this year became the first two former Communist countries to apply for full EU membership. </P>
<P> Earlier this year, during a visit to the European Commission in Brussels, Klaus said Czech entry after the year 2000 would be ``too late, unacceptably too late.'' </P>
<P> Klaus has set an ambitiously short period for negotiating entry. Neighboring Austria, which has a far more developed economy, will join the EU only on January 1 next year, more than five years after it applied for membership. </P>
