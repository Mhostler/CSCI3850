<P>  Prime Minister Jean Chretien Wednesday called three special elections in Canada, two of them in Quebec where separatists plan to hold a referendum on secession next year. </P>
<P> The by-elections will be held Feb. 13 and give Chretien's Liberal Party a chance to recruit prominent Quebeckers to help fight off a renewed separatist threat in the French-speaking province. </P>
<P> Former Quebec Cabinet minister Lucienne Robillard will run in the Montreal constituency of St-Henri-Westmount, where the Liberal incumbent resigned Wednesday to make way for her. </P>
<P> Robillard has held health, education and culture portfolios in Quebec and Liberal strategists expect her to play a key role in the referendum campaign expected to take place in the spring. </P>
<P> ``Why separation? What will be the consequences of that?'' Robillard said at a news confrence in Montreal. ``I will put all the energy I can into working for a No.'' </P>
<P> ``In these crucial times for the collective future of Canada and Quebec, I am proud to stand among those who believe that Quebec can and must continue to prosper as part of Canada,'' she said. </P>
<P> The other Quebec by-election is in Brome-Missisquoi, which became vacant in September after separatist member of Parliament Gaston Peloquin was killed in a car crash. </P>
<P> The separatist Parti Quebecois won power in provincial elections in October and will hold a referendum sometime in 1995 to ratify a law declaring Quebec independent from Canada. </P>
<P> The federal separatist party, the Bloc Quebecois, will be handicapped in the by-elections by the absence of its popular leader, Lucien Bouchard. </P>
<P> Bouchard is still recovering from the amputation of his left leg to save his life after he was suddenly struck by a virulent flesh-eating disease early this month.  The third race is in the national capital, Ottawa. </P>
