<P>  Somali faction leader Mohamed Farah Aideed visited Mogadishu's airport Wednesday hours after U.N. troops abandoned the outer perimeter and shooting and looting erupted, his followers said. </P>
<P> Aideed, who was hunted fruitlessly for five months by U.S.-led forces in 1993, toured the airport directly under beach redoubts manned by U.S. and Italian Marines covering the U.N. withdrawal, they said. </P>
<P> ``He went to give moral support to the people,'' said Bourhan Dhalman, a relative and follower of Aideed's. </P>
<P> Aideed lay low for weeks before 1,800 U.S. Marines and 400 Italian soldiers arrived Tuesday. The bold visit Wednesday was his first public appearance this month. </P>
<P> Bourhan said Aideed did not stay at the airport because crowds there were ``uncontrollable.'' Mobs of looters invaded the area and were chased by militias who fired over their heads. </P>
