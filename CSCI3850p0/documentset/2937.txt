<P>  Over 5,000 Latin Americans of German, Italian and Japanese ancestry were taken into custody and detained in U.S. internment camps during World War II, NBC's ''Dateline'' program reported Wednesday. </P>
<P> NBC said its report on ``what might be one of the biggest kidnappings in recent history'' was based on thousands of once-classified documents in the National Archives. </P>
<P> It said the actions were part of a plan carried out by U.S. Army Chief of Staff General George Marshall, who would later be known as the author of the Marshall Plan, which helped rebuild Europe and Japan after the war ended. </P>
<P> It quoted an order from Marshall as saying, ``These interned nationals are to be used for exchange with interned American civilian nationals'' behind enemy lines. </P>
<P> NBC said at least 2,800 Latin American Germans, 2,200 Japanese and an unknown numbers of Italians and other nationalities were ``tagged like baggage and taken away as pawn in a political war game.'' </P>
<P> The network news program said that local authorities in several Latin American countries seized the individuals and then turned them over to U.S. soldiers. </P>
<P> Quoting Justice Department records, it said the U.S. government had evidence that only 140 of those individuals were working as spies for their countries of origin and the rest were innocent civilians. </P>
<P> Nearly half of the civilians taken from their Latin American homes were later placed on ships and sent back to their countries of origin, including many Germans -- and possibly some Jews -- who begged not be sent to Nazi Germany. </P>
<P> Hugo Droege, a German who had moved to Guatemala 20 years before the war and was among those sent back to Germany, said he was forced to leave his wife, who was pregnant with their third child, behind on his farm for five years. </P>
<P> ``We were always locked up as it were bandits,'' he told NBC of his monthlong voyage to the United States. Later, Droege was put on ship to Germany against his will. </P>
<P> ``Those five years a lot happened to me. Every day was a lot. Bombs coming from above,'' Droege said. </P>
<P> The program said there were two exchanges with Japan and six with Nazi Germany. </P>
<P> No comment was immediately available from the Justice Department. </P>
<P> Hundreds of thousands of Americans of Japanese and German ancestry were forced into internment camps during the war. </P>
