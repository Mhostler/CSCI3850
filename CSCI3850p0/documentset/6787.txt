<P>  All-party negotiations on a deal to avert a round of politically-charged referendums on Italian television broadcasting collapsed Tuesday, the politician acting as mediator announced. </P>
<P> The breakdown means Italians will now almost certainly vote in the June 11 referendums. The key referendum would, if passed, compel media mogul and former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi to sell two of his three private networks. </P>
<P> ``Given the various statements and having evaluated the various positions, it is not possible to conclude negotiations to avoid the television referendums,'' the mediator, Giorgio Bogi, told reporters in parliament. </P>
<P> Under Italian law, a referendum can be avoided only if parliament agrees beforehand to revise or repeal the legislation to which it refers. </P>
<P> Berlusconi's Forza Italia party said Monday it was pulling out of negotiations and accused leftist and centrist parties of attempting to ``demolish'' the tycoon's Fininvest empire. </P>
