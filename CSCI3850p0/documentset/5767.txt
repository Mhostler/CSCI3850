<DATELINE>ZAGREB, Croatia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A Croatian policeman patrolling a river border with Bosnia was shot and killed by Bosnian Serb forces, the state news agency HINA said Saturday. </P>
<P> The policeman died instantly from a head wound when he and a colleague came under machinegun fire Friday night on the Sava River 100 miles east of Zagreb, a police spokesman told HINA. The second officer escaped injury. </P>
<P> Local officials gave no further details and the U.N. peacekeeping force said it had no information about the incident. </P>
<P> The Sava River border with Serb-held northern Bosnia has been generally calm since fighting in the region in 1991 and 1992 ended. It remains a closed military zone and shootings across the waterway occur only sporadically. </P>
