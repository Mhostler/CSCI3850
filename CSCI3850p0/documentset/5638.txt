<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Ga (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  U.S. Rep. Nathan Deal switched his party affiliation from Democratic to Republican Monday, giving the Republicans 231 members in the 435-member house. </P>
<P> ``I have come to the conclusion that my conservative North Georgia principles are not shared by today's national Democratic Party,'' said Deal. </P>
<P> Deal has often voted with the Republicans on economic issues, but favors abortion rights. </P>
<P> The change leaves Democrats with 203 members in the House, along with one independent. </P>
<P> Deal, 52, a second term Democrat, is from Lula, Ga., and becomes the third member of Congress to switch parties since last November's election. Senators Richard Shelby of Alabama and Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado also switched to the Republican Party. </P>
<P> Deal's decision, which gives Georgia eight House Republicans and three Democrats, means he will not face a Republican challenger. </P>
<P> House Speaker Newt Gingrich used the news to invite Sen. Sam Nunn, an old-line Georgia Democrat, to join the GOP as well. </P>
<P> ``I do not see how any common-sense conservative can feel comfortable in the Democratic Party,'' said Gingrich. </P>
<P> ``I'd also like to see Sen. Nunn to know he doesn't have to be the last remaining rational conservative in the Democratic Party from Georgia ... we would be glad to talk to him ... the door is open and we would certainly hold a big party for him.'' </P>
<P> A spokeswoman for Nunn in Washington said the senator had no immediate comment on Gingrich's remarks. </P>
