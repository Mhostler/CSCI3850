<P>  Two Dutch doctors who killed gravely ill new-born babies face criminal trial in the Netherlands in a test case of liberal Dutch euthanasia policy, the justice ministry said Thursday. </P>
<P> One of the doctors, a gynaecologist, has admitted killing a three-day-old severely handicapped girl at her parents' request. Her brain was only partly developed, she had spina bifida and partial paralysis, her limbs were malformed and she faced a life of constant pain. </P>
<P> Justice Minister Winnie Sorgdrager ordered the doctors to be prosecuted -- in what will be the first cases of their kind -- to determine what the law prescribes for cases when a doctor ends the life of a person who is unable to ask for death. </P>
<P> ``Neither of these cases are actually euthanasia as we understand the term,'' said Johan Legemaaten, a legal expert for the Royal Dutch Medical Association. ``Euthanasia as we understand it has to be asked for by a patient.'' </P>
<P> Parliament last year set down guidelines under which doctors will not be prosecuted for killing their patients. </P>
<P> Doctors must be able to show that a patient was terminally ill, in unbearable suffering, and had repeatedly asked to die. </P>
<P> This would mean killing a baby, or any patient unable to request death, should lead to prosecution. But the public prosecutors decided not to press charges in either of the separate baby-killing cases. </P>
<P> ``The minister sees the cases as a sort of test of the law through the findings of a judge,'' said a justice ministry spokeswoman. ``She needs to know where the law stands.'' </P>
<P> The Supreme Court in effect broadened Dutch euthanasia policy this summer by not punishing a doctor who killed a woman who was severely depressed and suicidal, but not terminally ill. </P>
<P> Officials said it will probably be some months before either of the latest cases comes to court. </P>
