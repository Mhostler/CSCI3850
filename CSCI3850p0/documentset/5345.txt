<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A federal judge Thursday struck down parts of a Pennsylvania state law which he ruled conflicted with the 1993 federal voting reform law. </P>
<P> The state must comply with the easier registration terms of the so-called ``moter-voter'' law, he ruled. </P>
<P> It was the third enforcement victory on the law for the Justice Department. </P>
<P> Pennsylvania is one of five states that has yet to comply with the federal deadline of Jan. 1, 1995, for allowing residents to register to vote while dealing with the state on driver's licenses, welfare or food stanps. </P>
<P> California and Illinois have already lost their cases, and South Carolina's has yet to be heard. No suit has been filed against Michigan as yet. </P>
<P> At a hearing March 20, Pennsylvania authorities said the federal law imposed a needlessly costly system and that the state law was not discriminatory, merely a safeguard against voter fraud. The Justice Department said the arguments were a pretext for keeping poor people off the voting lists. </P>
<P> Pennsylvania came under special criticism for its provision to purge the rolls of anyone who has not voted in three elections, or over a 2 3/8 year period. </P>
<P> U.S. District Judge Ronald Buckwalter struck down that provision, as well as another requiring illiterate people to get mail-in applications notarized. </P>
<P> He ordered state and federal authorities to confer on compliance measures and report to him April 10. </P>
<P> Human Serve, an advocacy group for the law, says that the motor-voter law resulted in some 500,000 new voter registrations during its first month and could bring 20 million new registrations by the 1996 elections. </P>
