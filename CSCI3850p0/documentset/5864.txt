<P>  Quebec province plans to require the mandatory reporting of cases of a severe bacterial infection that has been associated with the so-called flesh-eating disease. </P>
<P> Under proposals made public by Quebec's health minister Tuesday, physicians and laboratories will be required to report all cases of invasive group A streptococcal infection. In its most virulent form, the infection has been linked to necrotizing fasciitis, which destroys muscle and other tissue. </P>
<P> If the proposals are accepted, Quebec will be only the second Canadian province after Ontario to require mandatory reporting of the infection. Health authorities in several U.S. jurisdictions, including New York State, are considering the institution of similar reporting requirements. </P>
<P> Since the beginning of the year, about 30 cases of invasive group A streptococcal infection have been reported in Quebec. Eight of those, including a mother and her daughter living in a Montreal suburb, resulted in death. </P>
<P> Dr. Christine Colin, Quebec's assistant deputy minister of health and social services, said the disease must be monitored carefully to better understand its evolution. ``It's a disease that remains rare, but which possibly could be increasing slightly since the end of the 1980s,'' she said. </P>
<P> Authorities are also concerned that although severe group A streptococcal infection is unlikely to be transmitted from one person to another, that risk exists and one of every four or five cases is fatal, Colin said. </P>
<P> In December, Lucien Bouchard, the leader of the official opposition party in Canada's national Parliament, almost died from the disease. To stop its spread through Bouchard's body, physicians had to amputate one of his legs. </P>
<P> Colin said there are indications the incidence of the disease in Canada is slightly lower than the estimated U.S. rate of about four cases per 100,000 population. </P>
<P> ``It is not an epidemic in the sense that the number of cases is still low. Making it a disease requiring mandatory reporting will help us compare its development over time,'' she said. </P>
<P> Health falls under provincial jurisdiction in Canada, so a national reporting system for the disease has not been officially established. Other Canadian provinces, however, are expected to consider similar measures in the months ahead. </P>
