<DATELINE>PARIS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A week after Paris mayor Jacques Chirac swept past fellow conservative Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and into the lead in France's presidential election race, former rivals are jumping onto his bandwagon. </P>
<P> In a telltale sign of shifting winds, Charles Millon, parliamentary floor leader of the center-right Union for French Democracy (UDF), endorsed Chirac in a television interview Wednesday night. </P>
<P> Millon, who briefly toyed with running himself and plans to run for mayor of Lyon in June, said Chirac was not only a more energetic leader and reformist than the prime minister but also a more enthusiastic European. </P>
<P> Most of Millon's movement has backed Balladur, and five of the UDF's six component parties immediately demanded he resign as floor leader. He retorted that some of his critics were secretly making their own approaches to Chirac. </P>
<P> About 20 undecided UDF deputies were due to join him in supporting Chirac Thursday following the decision of their leader, ex-president Valery Giscard d'Estaing, not to run, party sources said. </P>
<P> In another trend indicator, Pierre Poujade, 75, leader of a right-wing populist movement of small shopkeepers, influential in the 1950s, announced his support for Chirac, saying the Paris mayor was closer to the people than Balladur. </P>
<P> Poujade has backed the eventual winner each time since 1974. </P>
<P> An equally significant sign came when Interior Minister Charles Pasqua, Balladur's chief Gaullist supporter, highlighted his long friendship with Chirac and said he envisaged no problem in uniting behind the leading conservative candidate after the April 23 first ballot. </P>
<P> In an interview with the newspaper Le Figaro, Pasqua implicitly criticizd Balladur's campaign, saying the prime minister should ``speak more about France and the French people and probably a bit less about his record, even if is good.'' </P>
<P> Saying the May 7 run-off would be between one of the two conservative Gaullist rivals and Socialist candidate Lionel Jospin, he said, ``From the night of the first round, we will need reconciliation against the candidate of the Left. That will not be difficult. </P>
<P> ``A few bitter people may perhaps fall by the wayside but the great majority of us will have no problem either way,'' he said. </P>
<P> More surprising has been the defection of some members of outgoing Socialist President Francois Mitterrand's entourage to the Chirac camp. </P>
<P> Fashion and opera impresario Pierre Berge, one of Mitterrand's closest friends, said Tuesday that he would vote for Chirac rather than Jospin. </P>
