<P>  Finance police searched the headquarters of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest company in the early hours of Friday morning, company officials said. </P>
<P> The media group is caught up in a number of investigations into possible corruption. Officials declined to give further details on the police action. </P>
<P> ``We can confirm that police searched our offices, but we are unable to disclose the reason because it is a judicial question,'' a company spokeswoman said. </P>
<P> Milan's chief prosecutor Francesco Saverio Borrelli, who heads the city's team of anti-graft magistrates, stirred up a storm Wednesday when he said investigations into Telepiu, a pay TV channel part-owned by Fininvest, risked reaching ``high levels'' in politics and finance. </P>
<P> Borrelli's remarks were seen as a hint that Berlusconi himself could soon come under investigation, although he subsequently denied that the prime minister was about to be questioned. </P>
<P> The government struck back Thursday by announcing that it would file an official complaint against Borrelli accusing him of seeking to interfere in the running of the government. </P>
