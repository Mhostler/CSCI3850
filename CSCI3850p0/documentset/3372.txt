<P>  European Union ministers Thursday formally cleared the GATT world trade pact for ratification, diplomats said. </P>
<P> ``Yes it has been cleared,'' one diplomat told Reuters. </P>
<P> The agreement was rubber-stamped by EU health ministers at a regular meeting, having been approved in principle Monday by foreign ministers. </P>
<P> Thursday's move allows the bloc to take the final formal step in ratifying the Uruguay Round General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade treaty, known as depositing the instruments, in Geneva December 30. </P>
<P> Each EU member state must also complete national ratifications of the GATT deal. </P>
