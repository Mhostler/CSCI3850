<P>  A former foreign subsidiary of Dow Corning Co distributed silicone breast implants overseas -- a disclosure that could open the company to liability, the Wall Street Journal reported in Friday's editions. </P>
<P> Frank Popoff, Dow Chemical's chairman and chief executive, acknowledged that a former Italian subsidiary, Gruppo Lepetit, had been a distributor of the implants outside the United States, the paper said. </P>
<P> The admission, which came in recent court depositions, could lead attorneys to compel Dow Chemical to contribute to the $4.2 billion global settlement of breast implant litigation, the paper said. </P>
<P> Earlier claims by Dow Chemical's attorneys have kept the company exempt from the implant liability, the Wall Street Journal said. </P>
<P> Plaintiffs in the settlement told the paper the fund may eventually become depleted because as many as 150,000 women have signed up to participate. </P>
<P> Dow Chemical told the paper it remains confident that the company will be found to have no liability in the litigation, the paper said. </P>
<P> Dow Corning, a joint venture between Dow Chemical and Corning Inc, was the leading manufacturer of silicone-gel breast implants, it said. </P>
