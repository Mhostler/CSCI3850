<P>  Police issued an all-points bulletin Tuesday for two teen-age skinheads accused of killing their parents and a younger brother. </P>
<P> Police found the bodies of Dennis Freeman, 54, his wife Brenda, 48, and their son, Erik, 11, in the family home in this semi-rural suburb of Allentown. </P>
<P> The family had been having trouble with the boys, who adopted the skinhead lifestyle, said a Jewish activist who had been contacted by the family. </P>
<P> The cause of death was not released, but Lehigh County District Attorney Robert Steinberg called the killings a ''brutal, premeditated beating.'' </P>
<P> The boys were at first sought for questioning, but are now being charged in the killings, according to a police press statement. </P>
<P> They were identified as Bryan Freeman, 17, a 6-footer dressed in Army fatigues with his red hair close cropped and the word ``Berserker'' tatooed on his forehead, and his brother, David, 15, who is 6-foot, 3-inches and 245 pounds. His forehead is tatooed with the Nazi slogan ``Sieg Heil.'' </P>
<P> Steinberg said a 12-gauge shotgun is missing from the family home. Police said the suspects might be driving the family car, a 1988 black Pontiac Sunbird convertible. It is believed they might be heading south. </P>
<P> Barry Morrison of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith's Allentown chapter told local media the Freemans had sought help in dealing with the two boys, but ``there isn't much we can do until they break the law.'' </P>
