<P>  A two-year test drive of vans powered by a variety of alternative fuels was declared a success and sponsors said Thursday it proved consumers now have other alternatives to gasoline-powered cars. </P>
<P> The CleanFleet project, sponsored by a group of federal and state agencies, oil companies and carmakers, ran tests on a group of Federal Express vans fitted to run on a variety of alternative fuels, including methanol, propane gas, natural gas and electricity. </P>
<P> The vans ran routine FedEx deliveries, in what is considered the most comprehensive test yet of the operating costs, performance qualities and environmental benefits of alternative fuel vehicles. </P>
<P> ``Just a few years ago, when we spoke of alternative fuel vehicles, we spoke of the future. But now the future has arrived and these vehicles are ready to leave the research labs and appear on our roadways,'' said Harvey Klein of Ford Motor Co, which participated in the test. </P>
<P> Thousands of clean fuel vehicles are already in use in the United States, but they have not yet entered the mainstream. </P>
<P> Alternative fuel vehicles are mostly used in government or corporate fleets, and confined to driving within a relatively small radius where they can be closely monitored. </P>
<P> But increasingly, stringent pollution rules in California and around the United States will require a more dramatic shift away from gasoline-powered cars, air quality officials say. </P>
<P> Government agencies in Southern California, which has not only the worst air quality in the nation, but also a depressed economy, are trying to build the region into a center for cutting-edge clean fuels technology they say will eventually be needed around the world. </P>
<P> ``The lessons we are learning here are our best hope for many new industries and businesses in the region,'' said James Stroock of the California Environmental Protection Agency. </P>
