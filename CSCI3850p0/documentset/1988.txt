<P>  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said on Thursday he hoped a peace accord with Jordan could be signed even earlier than a year's end deadline he had recently predicted. </P>
<P> ``I hope very much what I said, that by the end of this year a peace treaty would be signed between Israel and Jordan. I hope we will make it a little earlier,'' Rabin said after meeting U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Tel Aviv. </P>
<P> Rabin and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres made their first public visit to Amman Wednesday for surprise talks with Jordan's King Hussein, Rabin's spokesman said. </P>
<P> King Hussein had previously twice held talks with Rabin at his palace in Jordan's Red Sea resort of Aqaba. </P>
<P> Israel and Jordan signed a declaration in July ending the 46-year-old state of war between them and have since been negotiating a peace treaty. </P>
