<P>  Ross Perot's endorsement may provide an edge to Texas Gov. Ann Richards in her race with GOP challenger George W. Bush, some political analysts said Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``My sense is it will have an impact because of the closeness of the race,'' said Bob Stein, a political scientist at Rice University. </P>
<P> University of Houston professor Richard Murray said: ``It's not a big deal because to some extent it's anticipated. But it's helpful to Richards clearly. She's in an extremely tight race.'' </P>
<P> Perot, a billionaire Dallas businessman who received almost 19 percent of the presidential vote as an independent two years ago, declared for Richards at a news conference with her Tuesday. He called the Democrat ``one of the greatest governors'' in Texas history. </P>
<P> Richards said Perot's support ``just adds to the movement of the campaign.'' A Houston Post-KHOU TV poll released Wednesday and taken before the endorsement showed Richards edging further ahead of Bush, but with a statistically insignificant 2.8 point lead. </P>
<P> Bush is the eldest son of former President Bush and has campaigned with his parents. </P>
<P> Perot said his support for Richards was unrelated to his 1992 independent presidential campaign against the elder Bush. Besides winning 19 percent of the national vote, Perot won 22 percent in Texas. </P>
<P> But Karl Rove, a political consultant for George W. Bush, said that ``nobody ever expected Perot to endorse anyone whose last name is Bush. </P>
<P> ``We're confident Perot is not in step with United We Stand (America),'' said Rove. </P>
<P> Perot founded United We Stand America to provide a grass-roots forum for political issues. A Perot spokeswoman said his appearance with Richards had no connection with the group. </P>
<P> Stein said that while Perot's endorsement is unlikely to influence most voters, it could be a deciding factor among some of the estimated seven percent of likely voters who remain undecided. </P>
<P> The poll released Wednesday, which Stein conducted, found that 13.3 percent of respondents would be less likely to vote for a Perot endorsed candidate, while 9.9 percent would be more inclined to do so. </P>
<P> Perot was viewed unfavorably by 45.5 percent of poll respondents, versus 27.1 percent who saw him favorably. </P>
