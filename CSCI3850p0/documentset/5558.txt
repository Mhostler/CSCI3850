<P> But Clinton, who said in a generally conciliatory speech that he had not been elected to ``pile up a stack of vetoes,'' made clear he firmly opposed the sweeping $189 billion tax cut approved by the Republican House Wednesday. It faces a rougher road in the Senate, with Democrats and some moderate Reublicans claiming it gives too many breaks to the rich. </P>
