<P>  Israel said Monday it was close to signing a trade accord with Jordan which both sides hoped would lead to a free trade agreement after three years. </P>
<P> Foreign ministry spokesman Danny Shek said Israeli and Jordanian negotiators worked late into the night Sunday. </P>
<P> ``There was apparently an atmosphere of great goodwill on both sides and each side gave way a little bit and we are now in the phase of the final drafting of the language of the agreement,'' Shek told a briefing for foreign journalists. </P>
<P> ``In its general guidelines this is what is called an MFN -- Most Favored Nation -- agreement with additional trade benefits for both sides, but mainly for the Jordanian side,'' he said. </P>
<P> Israel and Jordan in April signed an agreement on tourism, the first accord to regulate bilateral ties under their 1994 peace treaty. </P>
<P> The accords are part of a series of agreements covering everything from trade and tourism to security and energy which are to be signed by August. </P>
<P> Shek said the draft agreement gave the much smaller Jordanian economy more benefits than Israel's. </P>
<P> He said that the agreement called for negotiations on a free trade agreement to be signed after three years. </P>
