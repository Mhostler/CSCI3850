<DATELINE>BAGHDAD (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Iraqi children, lying in comas or shivering in pain on grubby hospital beds, are the innocent victims of Baghdad's confrontation with the West. </P>
<P> U.N. sanctions have brought severe shortages of medicines. Children are suffering and dying from illnesses that could easily be treated if drugs were available, doctors say. </P>
<P> Pneumonia and diarrhea are the worst killers and malnutrition is on the rise. </P>
<P> Mortality rates have risen threefold in recent months at the Saddam Central Teaching Hospital for Children, Iraq's main pediatric hospital, said its director, Dr Qassim Ismail. Last month 85 children died. </P>
<P> ``We have shortages of everything -- plaster, syringes, medical equipment, insulin. And this is the best supplied hospital in the country. You can imagine the suffering elsewhere, especially outside Baghdad,'' he said. </P>
<P> During a tour of the wards, Dr. Othman al-Rawi tells a reporter: ``A nine-year-old boy died of meningitis two days ago in this bed. We did not have the right medicine.'' </P>
<P> In the next bed 15-month-old Taha Salim lies in a coma on a dirty quilt. She is suffering from gastro-enteritis, diarrhoea and fevers which have brought on frequent convulsions. She has been in a coma for days. </P>
<P> Her 23-year-old mother Nadia Abas wiped her child's brow with a flannel. ``I feel my baby is leaving me. I feel helpless,'' she said. </P>
<P> In another ward five-year-old Haidar Hamas sits on his bed playing with plastic farm animals. He suffers from tuberculosis. </P>
<P> His father was killed in the Gulf War -- the conflict which brought on the sanctions. His mother Amina gets a pension of 500 dinars (about a dollar) a month. </P>
<P> ``Before sanctions medicine was easy to get free. This bottle of pills cost 150 dinars. It lasts one week,'' she said. </P>
<P> Health care was free and Iraq was proud of its welfare system before the war and sanctions. Now relatives often have to find their own medicine and bring food to their sick children. </P>
<P> A U.N. aid official supported the doctors' assertions of the crisis afflicting their health system. </P>
<P> Under the sanctions, imposed by the United Nations following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, trade in medicine and food are not banned. But with no oil revenue, the government is running out of money to import them and the cost for such supplies are beyond the means of the average Iraqi family. </P>
<P> President Saddam Hussein has demanded an easing of the sanctions, pointing to the suffering of the people, but he has yet to comply with the Gulf War cease-fire terms. </P>
<P> He has turned down a U.N. offer for the sale of a limited amount of oil to provide cash for humanitarian needs on the grounds that it impinged Iraq's sovereignty. </P>
<P> The list of the hospital's woes goes on. About 30 Cuban and Vietnamese nurses have gone home during or since the war, Dr Ismail said. Iraqi staff are leaving for the growing private sector, which ministers to those members of the elite who can afford better treatment. </P>
<P> The hospital can no longer afford to give free milk and baby formula to the children -- one can of milk costs 400 dinars on the open market. </P>
<P> Bed linen is changed every three days but even the soap to wash it properly is in short supply. Three of the 11 wards have been closed and incubators and other equipment have broken down. </P>
