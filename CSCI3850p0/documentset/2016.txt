<P>  Haiti's deposed military leaders will regain access to $79 million in frozen American bank accounts after the return of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the New York Times reported Friday. </P>
<P> The report quoted Treasury Department officials as saying the money is held in individual accounts by the 600 Haitian military officers and supporters whose assets were frozen in the United States earlier this year as part of the U.S. campaign to restore Aristide. </P>
<P> Bank secrecy laws made it impossible to say how much belongs to Lieutenant General Raoul Cedras and his number two, Brigadier General Philippe Biamby, The New York Times said. </P>
<P> Cedras, Biamby and a number of their relatives went into exile in Panama o Thursday on a plane chartered by the United States. Cedras resigned as commander of the Haitian military Monday. </P>
<P> The newspaper said that as part of the deal approved by the White House, the U.S. will also lease three houses that Cedras owns in Haiti, bringing in at least $3,000 a month for the General denounced by President Clinton. </P>
<P> White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers told reporters Thursday that all of the assets belonging to the military leaders would become available to them after the restoration of Aristide, who is scheduled to arrive in Port-au-Prince Saturday, three years after the military overthrew him. </P>
