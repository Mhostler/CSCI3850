<P>  The earthquake that devastated Kobe in January raised serious questions about the efficiency of Japan's emergency medical system, a government report released on Tuesday said. </P>
<P> ``The earthquake exposed many issues in terms of quantity, quality, promptness and efficiency of Japan's medical care in time of disaster,'' the report on health and welfare said. </P>
<P> The report did not say how the system should be improved. </P>
<P> On January 17, an earthquake measuring 7.2 on the Richter scale devastated the port city of Kobe in central Japan, killing about 5,500 people. </P>
<P> The earthquake left about 300,000 people homeless, forcing them to spend months in cramped, makeshift evacuation centres with primitive sanitation. </P>
<P> The report said more attention needed to be paid to ``mental care'' for those suffering from traumatic stress. </P>
<P> Traumatic stress hit hundreds of the homeless survivors in Kobe but there were not enough psychiatric workers to help. </P>
