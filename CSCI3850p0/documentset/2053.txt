<DATELINE>MOSCOW (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The leader of Russia's breakaway Chechnya region said Sunday that an attack on the capital Grozny had been repulsed but Moscow-backed opposition forces insisted that they could take the city at any time. </P>
<P> Confusion and tension over the situation in Chechnya mounted as both government and opposition forces claimed to have gained the upper hand in the fighting in the capital. </P>
<P> Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev appeared on local television to announce that the overnight attack had been repulsed, Itar-Tass news agency said. </P>
<P> But Tass also quoted sources within the frail coalition of opposition groups as saying the assault had been a reconnaissance mission which had demonstrated that the city could be captured any time. </P>
<P> Dudayev has been a thorn in the Kremlin's side since he declared independence in the small Caucasus mountain region three years ago. </P>
<P> A Chechen journalist contacted by telephone from Moscow said a large crowd of Dudayev supporters was gathering in the center of Grozny. ``The crowd are urging Dudayev to take more decisive measures against the rebels,'' he said. </P>
<P> The security ministry announced that three opposition saboteurs had been arrested near the presidential palace carrying weapons and explosives. </P>
<P> Moscow is openly backing an anti-Dudayev provisional council set up in Chechnya's northern Nadterechny region. </P>
<P> Russian authorities accuse Dudayev, a former Soviet air force general, of turning his republic into a safe haven for criminals but deny direct involvement in the conflict. </P>
<P> Both sides often make exaggerated statements of military successes that are hard to check independently. </P>
<P> Tass quoted the Provisional Council as saying it had lost two men in the attack. The agency said 18 government troops were killed, but gave no source for the report. </P>
<P> Russian television quoted the Chechen armed forces press center as saying the opposition had lost about 40 men while Chechen troops had captured 12 Russian officers. </P>
<P> Colonel Musa Yusupov, Dudayev's military commandant, told Interfax news agency that Russian helicopters were supporting the opposition forces and had fired about 20 missiles. </P>
