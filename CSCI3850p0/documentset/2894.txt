<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  the U.S. Postal Rate Commission is expected to approve an increase Wednesday in the first class stamp to 32 cents from 29 cents, with the higher price stamp likely to go on sale Jan. 1. </P>
<P> The 32-cent stamp, part of an across-the-board 10.3 percent increase, was sought by the Postal Service to help cut operating deficits and further its modernization effort. </P>
<P> Mailing industry officials say the hike is likely, especially given a Postal Service pledge to continue to hold down costs, increase productivity and not seek another rate increase for two years. </P>
<P> The last increase in postage for the first ounce of a first class letter was Feb. 3, 1991, when the rate rose to 29 cents from 25 cents. </P>
<P> The Postal Service had asked for a 30-cent stamp. </P>
<P> Under law, the Postal Service must submit its rate requests to the independent commission for approval, and the panel can either approve them, reject them or change them. </P>
<P> The Postal Service's Board of Governors then must act on the commission's decision before new rates can go into effect. </P>
<P> A 10.3 percent rate increase would give the Postal Service an additional $100 million a week in revenue. </P>
<P> Postal officials earlier this year estimated the service would lose about $1.3 billion in the financial year that ended Sept. 30, but officials said the loss would turn out to be considerably less when figures are released next month. </P>
