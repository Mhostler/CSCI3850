<P>  Federal agents stormed a house and arrested a second suspect in the Oklahoma City bombing Sunday, but Justice Department officials said they were still seeking the dark-haired, tattooed man known as ``John Doe II''. </P>
<P> Acting on a tip from the U.S. Army, FBI agents captured David Iniguez near the city of San Bernardino, about 50 miles east of Los Angeles, on an outstanding warrant for military desertion, Justice Department sources said. </P>
<P> Justice Department officials said he did not resemble the bombing suspect known as ``John Doe II'' who has been described as ``armed and dangerous'' and whose sketches have been circulated to police agencies around the world. </P>
<P> They said Iniguez had not been charged and was being questioned in connection with Wednesday's bomb attack on a federal office building that killed at least 81 people. </P>
<P> Following his arrest, Iniguez was airlifted by military helicopter to a federal building that houses the FBI office in Los Angeles, where he was to undergo further interrogation. </P>
<P> Several onlookers yelled ``Coward!'' as Iniguez, handcuffed, wearing a bullet-proof vest and with a white jacket draped over his head, was led inside under heavy guard. Reporters shouted questions at him but he did not answer. </P>
<P> FBI spokesman John Hoos said he was ``unsure'' whether Iniguez would ultimately be considered a suspect or a witness in the bombing. </P>
<P> Iniguez was arrested Sunday morning when FBI agents raided a modest, single-story house in a working-class neighborhood in the small town of Muscoy, about four miles north of San Bernardino, witnesses said. </P>
<P> Neighbors said Iniguez did not live there. They said he was apparently a visitor at the home, where two women and their children lived. </P>
<P> The first suspect, Gulf War veteran Timothy McVeigh, 27, was charged with the bombing Friday after being arrested for a traffic violation shortly after Wednesday's blast. </P>
<P> Two friends of McVeigh's, brothers James and Terry Nichols, are being held as possible material witnesses in the case. </P>
<P> White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta, who heads the government investigation into the bombing, said Sunday he believed ``the investigation is making good progress.'' </P>
<P> ``I think they are narrowing in on the subject,'' Panetta told CNN. </P>
