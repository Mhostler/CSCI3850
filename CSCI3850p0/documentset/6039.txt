<DATELINE>PARIS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The rival candidates in France's presidential election vied Tuesday to win over the voters who gave strong backing to extreme rightist Jean-Marie Le Pen in the first round of balloting. </P>
<P> Conservative favorite Jacques Chirac, playing on Le Pen's strongest themes, warned in a hard-line campaign speech that some of France's depressed immigrant suburbs were in a state of secession, escaping police control. </P>
<P> ``If we continue on this slippery slope, we will continue to see law and order confiscated by ethnic or religious groups who will push people further into separation and the ghetto,'' Chirac told a rally in Orleans, south of Paris. </P>
<P> ``The need for security was one of the main messages of the first round. The French people aspire to live in peace. And I understand the exasperation displayed by some of our fellow citizens,'' he added. </P>
<P> Socialist candidate Lionel Jospin, surprise leader after last Sunday's first ballot, said he favored introducing partial proportional representation for parliamentary elections -- a key demand of Le Pen's anti-immigration National Front. </P>
<P> He said his position was not new and denied it would play into the hands of the hard right by giving Le Pen, who polled 15 percent Sunday, a potentially pivotal role in parliament. </P>
<P> The move would enable fairer representation of women and ecologists, Jospin said. In a reference to the National Front, he added: ``In a democracy, you cannot pick and choose.'' </P>
<P> Hard-line Interior Minister Charles Pasqua urged Chirac, who has not taken a stance on the issue, to take the same position. </P>
<P> Seeking to unite the conservative camp, Chirac invited Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, his fellow Gaullist rival, to meet him privately to seal reconciliation after a bitter first round battle. </P>
<P> But the conservative premier, eager to have his followers recognized as a political force in their own right, said he was happy to meet Chirac provided he could bring a delegation of party leaders who had backed his campaign. </P>
<P> A senior Chirac aide said that was out of the question, noting that many Balladur followers had already jumped on the Chirac bandwagon to save their own political skins. </P>
<P> Chirac's campaign spokesman, Francois Baroin, told reporters: ``There are no longer Balladuriens and Chiraquiens. Today there are only people who identify with the coalition and support Jacques Chirac.'' </P>
<P> Le Pen's chief aide, Bruno Megret, told reporters Chirac would have to prove he had abandoned a ``leftist bent'' displayed in the first-round campaign to earn Le Pen's endorsement at the National Front's traditional May 1 ``Joan of Arc Day'' rally. </P>
<P> ``There is now in our country a fourth political family, just as important as the Socialists or the (Gaullist) Rally for the Republic or the (centrist) Union for French Democracy,'' he said. </P>
