<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Organization of American States Tuesday ended its ban on commercial flights to Haiti and international financial transactions with the country. </P>
<P> But the OAS said assets of the regime that ousted Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide would remain frozen for now. </P>
<P> A spokesman said the decision was made late Monday by OAS Ministers of Foreign Affairs in consultation with Secretary General Cesar Gaviria. </P>
<P> Aristide is due to return to Haiti Saturday after the resignation Monday of Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras. </P>
<P> In a statement released in Washington, Gaviria also urged Panama to honor a request by the United States and Aristide that it take in Cedras, who has agreed to leave Haiti. </P>
<P> ``This would be a generous contribution by the Panamanian nation to the effort made by all the countries of the hemisphere...to ensure the return of the constitutional president of Haiti,'' Gaviria said. </P>
<P> Washington has asked Panama to grant asylum to Cedras and some of his senior officers to help pave the way for Aristide's return. Aristide said a Panamanian exile for Cedras would ``help bring peace to Haiti.'' </P>
<P> A spokesman for the OAS said the organization's recommendation on a trade embargo against Haiti, as well as a measure freezing the assets of the de facto government, would remain in effect for now. </P>
<P> ``Once Aristide is back in the country and the ministers know everything is okay, the other sanctions will also be lifted,'' said one diplomatic source. </P>
<P> The ban on commercial flights and financial transactions, first adopted after the 1991 coup that ousted Aristide, was rescinded after the Governors Island Accord in 1993. </P>
<P> It was reinstated in May 1994. </P>
