<P>  An aide to a French minister who set off a dispute with Washington last month over alleged American spying in France has accused the United States of trying to undermine Paris's position in Algeria. </P>
<P> Bernard Guillet, diplomatic adviser to Interior Minister Charles Pasqua, told the Algerian newspaper Le Matin that Washington had publicly suggested France had a one-sided policy on Algeria's civil war, backing the government and supplying weapons. </P>
<P> Some French officials have said Washington is trying to forge ties with Muslim fundamentalists to replace France, Algeria's former colonial ruler, as the north African country's main economic partner if the fundamentalists succeed in overthrowing the government. </P>
<P> Guillet's comments could cause new tension with Washington and arouse controversy in the French presidential election campaign. Pasqua supports Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, one of the leading presidential candidates. </P>
<P> Pasqua's office was widely reported to have been behind the February accusations of purported espionage and subversion of French officials by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. </P>
