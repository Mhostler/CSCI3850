<P>  An African bishop stunned a Roman Catholic synod Monday with a call for nuns to be made ``lay cardinals'' and given top positions in the Church. </P>
<P> Bishop Ernest Kombo of the Congolese diocese of Owando told an audience which included Pope John Paul II that with God's help nuns could be an ``incandescent light that would illuminate the world and be the true salt of the earth.'' </P>
<P> Kombo's address, a summary of which was made available to journalists, was received in silence. </P>
<P> ``May God inspire a prophetic attitude which would consist in naming women, who quantitatively and qualitatively form an important part of the consecrated life, to positions of responsibility, to the highest positions in the hierarchy, if possible as lay cardinals,'' he said. </P>
<P> Cardinals, the red-hatted ``princes of the Church,'' are appointed by the Pontiff from the upper ranks of the priesthood. Up to 120 of them under the age of 80 elect a new pope from among their number on the incumbent's death. </P>
<P> Nuns are members of minor orders of the church and are not ordained as priests. </P>
<P> Historians say the rank of cardinal differs from that of bishop or archbishop in so far as precedent exists for appointments to the position from outside the priesthood. </P>
<P> The month-long gathering, called to discuss the life of priests, nuns and friars in the modern world, has heard calls from a number of delegates for a more prominent role for women in the Roman Catholic Church. </P>
<P> The calls, including Kombo's, have stopped short of seeking priesthood for women -- banned in the Roman Catholic Church -- but the Jesuit bishop's proposals were by far the most radical since the synod opened on October 2. </P>
<P> A preparatory synod document published in June said there was an urgent need to meet growing grass-roots pressure for a more influential role for women in the Church. </P>
<P> Women's groups hope the synod, only 59 of whose 348 delegates are women, will support demands for qualified women to be allowed to hold decision-making jobs in local churches and in the Curia, the Vatican's staid central administration. </P>
