<P> (Eds: Adds reaction from the Hague, details)  A 59-year-old Dutchman was hanged at Singapore's Changi prison Friday morning, a Dutch embassy spokeswoman said. </P>
<P> Johannes van Damme was the first Westerner executed by the city-state for violating its tough anti-drug laws. Van Damme, convicted of heroin trafficking, went to the gallows after last-ditch legal and diplomatic appeals to win a stay were rejected by Singapore authorities. </P>
<P> Singapore prison officials had informed the embassy of the execution, aide D.J. Koekkoek told Reuters. </P>
<P> Van Damme was hanged in the pre-dawn hours here. Reporters outside the prison described the scene as quiet on a windless morning marked by a smoky haze. </P>
<P> The Dutch Foreign Ministry announced hours earlier that Singapore authorities had rejected a last-ditch legal appeal by van Damme's lawyers, and then a final diplomatic appeal for clemency. </P>
<P> In The Hague, the Dutch government said it felt ``horror and disappointment'' at the hanging. </P>
<P> Foreign Minister Hans van Mierlo told Dutch television the the government had done everything in its power to stop the execution. </P>
<P> ``I do not think there is anything we could have done to prevent this,'' he said. </P>
<P> Asked if the Netherlands would break off diplomatic ties with Singapore, Van Mierlo said that would be inappropriate. </P>
<P> ``You feel a need to show your indignation ... but you also realize that measures such as breaking off relations are not adequate or appropriate ways of dealing with the shock.'' </P>
<P> Van Mierlo said Dutch concern focused on the death penalty itself and not on Singapore's justice system. </P>
<P> ``The death penalty is so alien to us that it is difficult for the Dutch to accept that this can be the outcome of an otherwise perfectly fair trial,'' he said. </P>
<P> Van Damme, an engineer, was arrested at Singapore airport in September 1991, with 9.4 lbs of heroin in his suitcase. Drug trafficking is a capital offense in Singapore. </P>
