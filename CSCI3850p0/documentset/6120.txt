<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Jailed Mafia boss John Gotti was reported Friday to have made organized crime an offer it couldn't refuse. </P>
<P> The New York Post quoted underworld and law enforcement sources as saying Gotti has issued a $1 million cash contract for the assassination of ``Sammy Bull'' Gravano, the mobster who turned state witness and helped put him behind bars. </P>
<P> Gotti ordered a nationwide search for Gravano, believed to be free after serving less than five years of a 20-year sentence for 19 murders and other crimes, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> Gotti, known as the ``Teflon Don'' for his ability to escape prosecution, was finally convicted and sentenced to life without parole in 1992, thanks to Gravano's testimony. </P>
<P> Gravano was facing life in prison when he was indicted along with Gotti in 1990 on murder and racketeering charges, but he made a deal with prosecutors in 1991, agreeing to become an informer. His maximum sentence of 20 years without parole was reduced last November. </P>
<P> Gotti passed word of the contract through his son John ''Junior'' Gotti, acting head of the Gambino crime family, the Post said. Gotti's son recently visited him at the maximum security prison in Marion, Ill. </P>
<P> The newspaper quoted its sources as saying Gotti Junior made it clear the $1 million cash reward for killing the 50-year-old Gravano was not restricted to Gambino members. </P>
<P> The FBI declined to comment on the alleged contract or whether Gravano had been released. Officials had previously said they expected Gravano to be freed by May 1, 1995. </P>
<P> Gravano, who also helped convict the top two men in the Colombo crime family and the number two man in the Genovese family, is believed to be in the federal witness-protection program, where he would assume a new identity. </P>
