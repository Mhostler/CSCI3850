<P> In her resignation letter submitted to Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, Hanson said her decision to leave government ``is not an easy one'' and said she was rejoining a New York law firm. She made no direct mention of Whitewater. </P>
<P> Bentsen, in accepting her resignation, said in a letter of reply that he had been ``impressed by the strength of character you displayed in recent weeks'' and praised her commitment to the Treasury department's agenda. </P>
<P> Bentsen was moving swiftly to dispel the cloud of controversy that has hung over his department because of the Whitewater affair. He said he has recommended to President Clinton that Treasury's Exexutive Secretary Edward Knight replace Hanson. </P>
<P> On Wednesday, within hours of Altman's quitting, Bentsen recommended Frank Newman, Treasury Under Secretary for Domestic Finance, to replace him as Deputy Treasury Secretary. </P>
