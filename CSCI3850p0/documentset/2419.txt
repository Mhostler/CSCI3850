<P> JONESBORO, Ga. - A mistrial was declared Friday in the trial of a doctor charged with hastening the death of a premature baby when jurors became deadlocked after four days of deliberations. </P>
<P> Dr. Eva Carrizales, a neonatologist from Fayetteville, Ga., was accused of deliberately putting her hand over the mouth of a 2-pound infant and cutting off the blood flow to his brain by tightly holding his neck. </P>
<P> The case highlighted the question of when life support should be removed from terminally ill infants. </P>
<P> The jury of six men and six women reported being deadlocked, 7 to 5 in favor of acquittal. Clayton County Superior Court Judge Deborah Benefield asked jurors to try again to reach a decision. After two more hours of deliberations, the jury was still deadlocked. </P>
<P> ``This particular jury is not going to be able to reach a decision in this case,'' Benefield said. ``The jury is hung.'' Benefield declared a mistrial, and a new trial was tentatively scheduled for Jan. 23. </P>
<P> Before the mistrial was declared, Carrizales' attorney unsuccessfully sought to have one female juror replaced with an alternate, arguing that the juror had commented during jury selection that Carrizales had ``done something only God could do in killing that child.'' </P>
<P> Defense attorney Doug Peters urged replacement of ``a woman I still contend would commit perjury to get on this jury to control it.'' Benefield denied Peters' request for a mistrial because of the juror's comment. </P>
<P> Carrizales was charged with the death of Omar Jiminez 39 days after he was born at the Southern Regional Medical Center on Sept. 13, 1993. The infant was in the last stages of kidney failure and also suffered from heart and respiratory problems. </P>
