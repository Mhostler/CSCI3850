<P>  A tiny number of separatists have carried out isolated bomb attacks in China's Muslim far west Xinjiang region, but the Muslims have won scant popular support, its acting Communist Party chief said Thursday. </P>
<P> However, China faced a long battle to crush the movement demanding independence for a region that borders the former Soviet Central Asian republics and the Islamic states of Pakistan and Afghanistan, Wang Lequan said in an interview. </P>
<P> ``This movement does not enjoy mass support in Xinjiang,'' Wang said. ``But we cannot extinguish it in the short term.'' </P>
<P> The separatists were behind bombings at a bus station in the regional capital of Urumqi on Feb. 5, 1992, at a hotel in the western city of Kashgar on June 17, 1993, and in the western town of Aksu in 1994, Wang said. </P>
<P> Several people were killed and injured in the first two incidents and most of those responsible had been arrested, he said. </P>
<P> Xinjiang, more than four times the size of California, has a population of 16.2 million, of whom six million are Han Chinese and the rest ethnic minorities. Of the minorities Uighurs are the largest group at 7.6 million. It has eight million Muslims. </P>
<P> Since taking over Xinjiang after Communist China was established in 1949, Beijing has settled the region with millions of Han Chinese to try to develop its economy and bind it closer with the rest of the country. </P>
<P> Xinjiang has rich reserves of oil, which Beijing is counting on to fuel its economic boom for the next decade. </P>
