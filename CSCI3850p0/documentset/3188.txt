<P>  Former South African guerrillas, who fought for the ruling African National Congress, were ordered Wednesday to hand over liberation-war weapons and ammunition by the end of January. </P>
<P> Defense force acting chief-of-staff Lt. Gen. Siphiwe Nyanda, a former commander of the ANC's disbanded armed-wing Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), did not say what would happen to anyone disobeying his orders. </P>
<P> ``The MK regional commands have been ordered to inform all MK units and members in their respective regions of this instruction and to ensure that the instruction is carried out,'' Nyanda said in a statement. </P>
<P> The defense force has sacked for indiscipline more than 2,000 rebellious former ANC guerrillas who were being integrated into South Africa's post-apartheid defense force. </P>
<P> It was not clear whether the instruction was addressed to the rebels or at former guerrillas in general. </P>
<P> The defense force would not elaborate. </P>
<P> Thousands of rounds of ammunition and weapons from dozens of rebel caches have been handed over by former guerrillas since the ANC came to power in the April elections, but large numbers of firearms, particularly AK-47 assault-rifles, are still in circulation. </P>
<P> South Africa, which is going through a violent crime wave, is offering a nationwide amnesty for the hand over of illegally-held weapons Friday. </P>
