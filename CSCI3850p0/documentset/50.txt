<DATELINE>ATLANTA (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A Georgia woman who was charged with a felony last month for slapping her nine-year-old son in public is now, along with her family, facing another challenge to personal freedom -- international media attention. </P>
<P> Lynn Kivi, her husband Dale, son Chuck, and daughter Sarah have appeared on Australian television, been stalked by U.S. camera crews and had their case taken up as talk-radio fodder by conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh. </P>
<P> The family also has received an offer for a made-for-TV movie and recently turned down a $1,000 bid by the National Enquirer tabloid newspaper to photograph mother and son kissing in front of the supermarket where the alleged felony occurred. </P>
<P> ``This thing has exploded,'' Dale Kivi was quoted as saying in an article in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution Sunday. ``The calls start at 6 a.m. and go until midnight . We had to take the phone off the hook.'' </P>
<P> Even the neighbors are complaining about the daily media onslaught that has descended on their street. </P>
<P> ``It's turned out to be a liberal-conservative thing,'' next-door neighbor Karen Stanton told the newspaper.adlines after an exasperated Lynn gave up telling her son to stop picking on his sister in a Winn-Dixie supermarket and slapped him across the face. </P>
<P> An employee who witnessed the act phoned the police, who took her into custody where she was charged with cruelty to children, a felony. </P>
<P> She remained in jail until her husband could cash in his 401K pension fund to pay a $22,050 bond -- bail being extremely difficult to raise in cases involving child abuse. </P>
<P> The case is now being investigated by Cherokee County family counselors in Woodstock, Georgia, a rural town located 50 miles north of Atlanta, where the family recently moved from Illinois. </P>
<P> The newspaper said Cherokee County prosecutors also are trying to decide whether to bring the case to a grand jury. </P>
