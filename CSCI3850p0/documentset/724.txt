<P> At a rare evening news conference, Reno said the United States would not permit a repeat of the 1980 Mariel boatlift, which brought 125,000 Cubans, along with crime and social upheaval, to south Florida. </P>
<P> ``We want to take all steps that are prudent, that are consistent with our policy, to ensure that that does not happen,'' she said. </P>
<P> She said that if federal law enforcement officers found probable cause to believe a vessel was being used in an attempt to bring undocumented migrants to the U.S. in violation of U.S. law, the vessel will be seized. </P>
<P> During the Mariel boatlift, a flotilla of vessels manned mainly by Cuban exiles picked up those leaving, many of them common criminals. </P>
