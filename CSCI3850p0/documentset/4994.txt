<P>  A Rio de Janeiro hospital made a plea for donors Friday -- not for blood but for breast milk. </P>
<P> The Fernandes Figueira Institute has only enough stock to feed the 31 newborn babies in its wards for another four or five days, the coordinator of the institute's breast milk bank said. </P>
<P> ``I need 20 liters (5.2 gallons) of milk a day and yesterday, for example, we had three liters donated,'' said Joao Arprigio, the coordinator. </P>
<P> ``For 20 liters, we need to have around 50 donors a day; at the moment we get an average of 10 to 12,'' he added. </P>
<P> Some mothers may be unable to nurse after they have given birth or may be on medication, which would affect their own breast milk. Donated mother's milk can keep for up to 21 days. </P>
<P> The breast milk center is the largest of five in the city of Rio de Janeiro and of 78 such centers across Brazil. </P>
