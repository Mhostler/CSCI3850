<P>  Firefighters battled a blaze in Berlin's 18th century ``German Cathedral'' Thursday but said they had the flames under control and had averted the collapse of the cathedral's dome. </P>
<P> The fire had caused millions of dollars' worth of damage, Gerhard Zodtner of the Federal Buildings Office told national ZDF television. </P>
<P> Some 120 firefighters struggled to quench the flames, largely inaccessible between the dome's inner and outer shells. The blaze belched black smoke over the neo-classical Gendarmenmarkt square. </P>
<P> The cathedral is one of a matching pair which, together with the Schauspielhaus concert hall, form three sides of the square just off the grand Unter den Linden avenue in historic east Berlin. </P>
<P> The cathedral had been undergoing a long-term restoration program and was due to reopen in 1996 as a museum. </P>
