<DATELINE>SLEPTSOVSK, Russia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Ingush peoples, who are tied to Chechens by language, religion, history and geography want to draw the line at war. </P>
<P> ``Everybody is afraid the Chechen war will spread to Ingushetia because the Russians have already bombed places like Achaluki and Gazi-yurt,'' said 25-year old Fatima as she walked through a park in Sleptsovsk. </P>
<P> Both places are inside Ingushetia, some miles away from the border with Chechnya. </P>
<P> ``People in these Caucasian nations take revenge for every house destroyed and every relative killed. For that reason I believe the war will spread and last a long time,'' she added. </P>
<P> Joined together as a single republic in the former Soviet Union, tiny Ingushetia and Chechnya were designated separate republics in post-Soviet Russia. </P>
<P> While the Ingush reluctantly accepted that Russian reality, their feisty Chechen neighbors rebelled, declaring independence and tweaking Moscow's nose by closing vital railways and borders. </P>
<P> Having tolerated the revolt for nearly four years, Russian President Boris Yeltsin sent the army into Chechnya in December last year to reclaim the breakaway republic. </P>
<P> Two months later the Chechen capital of Grozny is finally in Russian hands, but a ruin. </P>
<P> A four-day cease-fire -- timed conveniently for Yeltsin's annual state of the nation address to the Russian parliament -- expired Sunday evening, leaving many in Ingushetia convinced war is about to lap across their border. </P>
<P> ``It wasn't a real cease-fire anyway, just an opportunity to collect some bodies and regroup troops,'' said 54-year old Alahudin, an Ingush who fled Grozny when the Russians came in December. </P>
<P> ``Yeltsin needed a cease-fire for his speech to the parliament, but the war is going to start up in Chechnya again and spread to Ingushetia.'' </P>
<P> Ingush and Chechen peoples are mostly Muslims speaking the same language, separated by temperament more than anything else. </P>
<P> While Chechens revel in their reputation as fierce fighters unafraid of death, the Ingush seem inclined to work around unpleasant situations rather than confront them suicidally. </P>
<P> Most Ingush make no secret of their dislike for the Russians and admit to having helped the embattled Chechens with food and transport in recent months while trying to avoid outright confrontation with Russia. </P>
<P> The consensus here seems to be that Russian military commanders will find a pretext to suck Ingushetia into the conflict even if this is not explicit policy from Moscow. </P>
<P> Ingush President Ruslan Aushev has imposed a curfew since Saturday in villages and towns near Chechnya following Russian ``provocations,'' Itar-Tass news agency reported. </P>
<P> Aushev's assistant told Tass the move was in response to ``provocations that have become frequent of late.'' </P>
<P> The curfew will be in force from midnight to dawn in Karabulak and Nesterovskaya towns and Ordzhenikidzovskaya and Troitskaya villages, the agency said. </P>
<P> ``Russian generals are behind the war in Chechnya and they'll get it going here in Ingushetia too,'' said Magomet, a taxi driver who plys both sides of a Chechen-Ingush border lined with Russian armor. </P>
<P> ``War is always in the interest of generals. They use their position to make lots of money out of the misery of the people. I can imagine the day when Sleptsovsk will look just like Grozny does today -- completely destroyed.'' </P>
