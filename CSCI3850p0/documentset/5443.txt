<P>  Opposition leaders in Kazakhstan Tuesday said a referendum this month on extending President Nursultan Nazarbayev's term of office to the year 2000 was a threat to democracy and appealed for a massive ``no'' vote. </P>
<P> Nazarbayev called for the referendum last month. He was urged to do so by leaders of ethnic groups who see the 56-year-old leader as a guarantor of peace and stability and the only man capable of carrying out economic reforms. </P>
<P> ``A real danger has emerged of one man, the president, seizing power,'' said an appeal by a group of opposition politicians, including some former members of the recently disbanded parliament. </P>
<P> ``We call on all voters to go to the polls on April 29 and cast their ballots against extending the powers of the president until the year 2000,'' said the appeal, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters. </P>
<P> The poll comes hard on the heels of a constitutional crisis last month when Nazarbayev disbanded parliament after elections last year were ruled illegal by the constitutional court. </P>
<P> Nazarbayev has since taken on special executive powers and launched a crackdown on crime. </P>
<P> Kazakhstan, a vast former Soviet republic stretching from the Caspian Sea to the Chinese border, has attracted hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign investment in its oil and gas sector and billions more are likely under new deals. </P>
<P> Nazarbayev backers say the country cannot afford disruptive elections in 1996, when his current term is due to expire. </P>
<P> The opposition groups said the referendum could be rigged, although international observers are expected to monitor the vote and Nazarbayev has trumpeted it as a test for his commitment to democracy. </P>
<P> He is due to make a whistle-stop tour of Kazakh regions in the run-up to the poll. It follows a similar vote last month in Uzbekistan that gave hardline leader Islam Karimov unanimous backing for staying in office until the end of the century. </P>
