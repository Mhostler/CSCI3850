<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  More than seven million Belgians vote Sunday in a general election dominated by voter indecision and predictions the far-right will make gains. </P>
<P> Under electoral law, politicians did not appear on television or radio on the eve of the election, but mainstream parties appealed strongly in the build-up to the poll for disgruntled voters not to cast a protest ballot to the right. </P>
<P> An opinion poll just days before the election indicated that one in three people had not yet decided who to vote for, a striking statistic in a country where voting in compulsory. </P>
<P> Het Nieuwsblad newspaper said the big number of undecided voters made it difficult to predict the outcome. </P>
<P> ``Many are saying that a spectacular surprise is hanging in the air,'' said the Dutch-language paper in its weekend edition. </P>
<P> Het Nieuwsblad echoed other weekend newspapers by urging voters not to show their discontent by turning to the right. </P>
<P> A string of scandals implicating the country's two socialist parties has dented the image of the four-party coalition in which the socialists serve with the Christian Democrats. </P>
<P> Social concerns such as 13 percent unemployment and fears the generous social security system and pensions will be slashed to pay off the heavy public debt have also left voters unhappy. </P>
<P> Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene's Dutch-speaking Christian Democrat party and its francophone equivalent are expected to stay in the coalition, but political analysts say the Socialists' position is less certain. </P>
<P> Either way, there will probably be months of political horsetrading before a new coalition government is announced. </P>
<P> The far-right is expected to make the most gains in Dutch-speaking Flanders where the strongly anti-immigrant Vlaams Blok hopes to get 15 percent of the vote against the 10.3 percent it had in the 1991 election. </P>
<P> In the French-speaking Wallonia region, the extreme right is more divided. The biggest far-right francophone party, the National Front, is seen getting six percent of the vote there. </P>
<P> Belgians vote according to their linguistically-divided regions. The process is more complicated this time following reforms in 1993 which granted more autonomy to the regions. </P>
<P> Voters cast their ballots three times, once for the lower house of parliament, then for the senate and finally for regional councils in Dutch-speaking Flanders, francophone Wallonia, bilingual Brussels and a German-speaking zone. </P>
<P> Under the new system, more power has been granted to the regions in areas such as foreign trade and the environment while federal government controls key dossiers such as finance, defense, foreign affairs and justice. </P>
<P> The number of seats in the federal parliament will be slashed after the poll. In the lower house, or decision-making chamber, there will be 150 members against 212 now. The Senate is downgraded to a ``chamber of reflection,'' with 71 seats against the current 184. </P>
