<DATELINE>LUANDA, Angola (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Opposition UNITA forces have consistently violated the cease-fire in Angola's civil war and government troops are advancing on their positions in central Bie province in response, a military communique said Sunday. </P>
<P> The communique, from the army military chief's office, said UNITA ``must now suffer the consequences of their actions, which will be given a prompt response by our troops.'' </P>
<P> A source at the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM) told Reuters: ``These are difficult times. The tone of the announcement is hostile and anything like this is of concern to us and to the peace process.'' </P>
<P> But the source added: ``It may be less serious than we expect considering it was issued by the chief of military and not the chief of staff.'' </P>
<P> The communique, broadcast on state radio, accused UNITA (the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola) of breaking the Lusaka protocol, the U.N.-sponsored peace accord signed last November in the Zambian capital to try to end 19 years of war. </P>
<P> Angola's civil war, Africa's longest, has claimed many thousands of lives since it erupted in 1975 when the southern African country gained independence from Portugal. </P>
<P> The communique said the military action in Bie was prompted by incidents throughout January and February in the provinces of Huambo, Benguela, Malange and Lunda Norte and Lunda Sul. </P>
<P> Government troops were apparently moving to the border withHuambo province, a troop disengagement site agreed to by generals from both armies earlier this month to try to accelerate the peace process. </P>
<P> Villagers in the northern Uige province, the second troop disengagement site, said UNITA and government forces had both regularly invaded a UNIVAM-monitored 10-mile disengagement buffer zone. </P>
<P> A UNIVAM observer in Uige said: ``When it's not UNITA, it's the government army.'' </P>
