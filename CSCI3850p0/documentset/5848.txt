<P>  A Russian official accused Germany on Wednesday of staging a plutonium-smuggling affair which fanned concern that material for nuclear bombs was freely on sale to terrorists or criminals. </P>
<P> ``The whole thing was thought up from beginning to end,'' Moscow's Nuclear Energy Ministry spokesman Georgy Kaurov wrote in an article for the German weekly magazine Die Woche. </P>
<P> Germany's BND intelligence service denied a news report earlier this month that it staged the spectacular deal last year to buy weapons-grade plutonium smuggled out of Russia. </P>
<P> But Kaurov said the plutonium was not made in Russia as German officials say, but in Germany itself. </P>
<P> ``It came in a Lufthansa plane from Munich to Moscow and was flown straight back again. In Munich they were already waiting for it,'' he said, calling the transport of plutonium on a civilian plane an act of idiocy bordering on a crime. </P>
<P> German police seized 363 grams (12.8 ounces) of plutonium from couriers arriving at Munich airport last August on a flight from Moscow. Three men arrested will go on trial in May. </P>
<P> Moscow has accused the BND of stealing nuclear material and spreading it to force closer Western supervision of its plutonium stores -- to which Russia agreed after the incident last year. </P>
<P> On Thursday a German parliamentary committee is to question Bernd Schmidbauer, the government official who oversees the BND, over the affair at a special hearing. </P>
<P> Spiegel magazine, which broke the story, said the BND had commissioned the purchase via undercover agents to help justify its existence in the post-Cold War era. </P>
<P> It said the BND used underground agents in Spain to spread the word that a German customer was eager to buy plutonium at any price. It eventually found sellers in Russia via a Spaniard and a Colombian with good contacts in Moscow. </P>
<P> The seizure sent shock waves around the world as fears grew that a ``nuclear mafia'' was trading fissionable material from the former Soviet bloc, putting the nuclear bomb within reach of criminals, terrorists or non-nuclear governments. </P>
