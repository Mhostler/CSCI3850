<P>  An American Eagle commuter plane with 20 people aboard crashed Tuesday evening as it prepared to land in rain and fog at Raleigh-Durham International Airport, killing 13 people, officials said. </P>
<P> Flight 3379, a Jetstream Super 31 turboprop en route from Greensboro, N.C., crashed around 6:40 p.m. as it was approaching a runway at the airport, American Eagle said in a statement. </P>
<P> There were 13 confirmed deaths, according to Assistant Airport Director Teresa Damiano. </P>
<P> The North Carolina State Highway Patrol said all but two passengers were accounted for. </P>
<P> American Eagle said the preliminary passenger list showed 18 passengers plus a crew of two on the British-built plane. </P>
<P> ``The accident site is approximately four miles southwest of the Raleigh-Durham International Airport,'' airline spokesman Al Marucci said in a telephone interview. </P>
<P> The aircraft broke apart, airport officials said. </P>
<P> ``The wreckage is in two distinct parts in a concentrated area, and each of the parts is approximately 25 feet apart,'' said Damiano. </P>
<P> She said each part was spread over roughly 500 yards. </P>
<P> ``Our priority was to locate the survivors and injured and remove them. A search is under way,'' she said. Survivors were taken to a hospital. </P>
<P> Access was difficult for rescuers because of dense woods and mud from the rain. Tractors and jeeps were being used to get to the area. </P>
<P> A spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates airplane crashes, said it was sending a team to the crash site Tuesday night. </P>
<P> At the time of Tuesday's crash, the weather was rainy and foggy with a temperature of 37 degrees, news reports said. </P>
<P> Allied Pilots Association spokeswoman Kelly Cannon, whose union represents American Eagle's pilots, said one of the pilots was based in Miami and the other in Raleigh. </P>
<P> It was not known whether they were alive, Cannon said from the airport. </P>
<P> Tuesday's crash was the latest in a series of U.S. air disasters this year. </P>
<P> An American Eagle French-Italian-built ATR 62 crashed in northern Indiana Oct. 31, killing 68 people. The FAA last week banned the plane from flying in icy conditions. </P>
<P> More than 130 people were killed in a USAir Boeing 737 crash near Pittsburgh International Airport in September. </P>
<P> That crash came just before public hearings into a USAir crash in Charlotte , N.C., in July which killed 37 of the 57 people aboard. </P>
<P> In addition, commuter airline crashes in Columbus, Ohio, and Hibbing, Minn., took more than a dozen lives late last year and earlier this year. </P>
<P> Last Saturday, American Eagle suspended all service out of Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, from where it had been operating the bulk of its ATRs, and began shifting the planes to service in warm-weather areas. </P>
<P> The carrier Saturday halted service from Raleigh to 15 cities and planned to end all service from Raleigh in early January. </P>
<P> Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said there were more than 300 Jetstream 31s flying worldwide. American spokesman Tim Smith said the carrier had 54 of the planes that were an average of three years old. </P>
<P> American Eagle had been one of the biggest carriers at the Raleigh hub with nearly 100 scheduled departures a day, reports said. </P>
<P> The airline Tuesday ferried the first of several Saab aircraft to O'Hare to resume service later in the week to major Midwestern cities from Chicago. </P>
