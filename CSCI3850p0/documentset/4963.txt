<DATELINE>LONDON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A woman who died aged 92 had been carrying her dead baby -- long since calcified -- for 60 years, two Austrian doctors reported Thursday. </P>
<P> In a letter to the Lancet medical journal, they described how they treated the woman, who was suffering from pneumonia, and found she also had the a ``stone baby'' in her uterus. </P>
<P> ``She had a large abdominal mass extending from the pelvis to the right upper abdomen,'' Dr Paul Speiser and Dr Konrad Brezina of the University of Vienna Medical School wrote. </P>
<P> ``Radiography of the woman showed a stone child,'' they added. </P>
<P> The woman died a week later and an autopsy revealed a dead child that had reached 31 weeks gestation. </P>
<P> Her son told the doctors that the woman had become pregnant at the age of 32, developed abdominal pain and then recovered. </P>
<P> Her menstrual periods resumed. ``Since then she had been doing exceptionally well without any serious illness, apart from infertility,'' he was reported as saying. </P>
<P> Cases of ``stone babies'' occur in about one in 250,000 pregnancies, the Lancet said. It noting that a fossilised stone baby was found in a 3,000-year-old grave in the United States. </P>
<P> But the doctors said this was the first case of a woman carrying a calcified fetus for such a long time. </P>
