<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory committee Thursday recommended the agency approve further trials for an AIDS vaccine. </P>
<P> The endorsement of the vaccine developed by Immune Response Corp. is a major step toward eventual FDA market approval of the AIDS treatment. </P>
<P> The vaccine -- the idea of Jonas Salk, who developed the first vaccine for polio in the 1950s -- would fight AIDS by stimulating the antibody immune system response to HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. </P>
<P> Unlike other AIDS drugs which try to destroy the virus, the so-called ``Salk-Immunogen'' seeks to build up the immune response in AIDS patients. </P>
<P> The Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, after a 12-hour meeting, found the earlier limited trials had warranted new large-scale therapeutical trials. </P>
<P> It voted 6 to 3, with one scientist undecided, for the expanded trials, which would encompass about 1,000 AIDS patients. </P>
<P> Several committee members thought there was not enough positive evidence from the earlier smaller trials with about 200 patients to warrant the greatly expanded trial, and opted for an intermediate-sized trial. </P>
<P> Commenting on the close vote and his ballot to endorse further trials, committee Chairman Stanley Lemon, of the University of North Carolina, said, ``There's enough smoke that there might be a fire here.''  Immune Response said that the earlier limited trials showed the vaccine was effective in prompting the immune system response without serious side effects. </P>
<P> Earlier this month, Immune Response was given a ``warning letter'' by the FDA, criticizing it for the methods it used in conducting the trials and analyzing the results. </P>
<P> It also cited the firm for its handling of consent agreements with patients, which included making a statement that its experimental vaccine was effective, and for discounting the effectiveness of other AIDS treatments. </P>
<P> Answering the FDA, Immune Response President Dennis Carlo said the FDA's observations did not affect the integrity of data submitted to the agency, nor did they impact materially on judgments about the safety and activity of the vaccine. </P>
