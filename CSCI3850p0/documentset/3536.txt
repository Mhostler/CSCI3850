<P>  Bosnian Croats Monday signed a four-month countrywide cease-fire already agreed to by Serbs and Muslims, a United Nations spokesman reported. </P>
<P> ``Federation President Kresimir Zubak signed the cease-fire today on behalf of the Croats in presence of (U.N. commander in Bosnia) Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Rose,'' U.N. spokesman Thant Myint-U told Reuters. </P>
<P> The agreement was signed in the Croat stronghold of Mostar in southern Bosnia, after the U.N. repeatedly voiced its concern over reports that Bosnian Croat troops were still fighting the Serbs despite the truce. </P>
<P> ``We were very anxious to secure the agreement for the Croat side as well, given the reports of recent fighting in Livno-Glamoc area (in southwestern Bosnia),'' Thant said. </P>
<P> ``We hope the agreement will put a stop to fighting in that area as well,'' he said. </P>
<P> Bosnian Muslims and Serbs Saturday signed an agreement on a four-month cease-fire that U.N. officials hope will form the basis for a political settlement to the 33-month-old war. The truce appeared to be holding despite minor violations, U.N. officials said. </P>
