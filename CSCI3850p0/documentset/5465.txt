<P>  China has lodged a protest with two of its diplomatic allies, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, against a recent visit by the president of arch-rival Taiwan, the Xinhua news agency said on Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``We have already stated China's solemn and just position to and lodged a protest with the governments of the countries involved,'' Xinhua quoted Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Chen Jian as saying. </P>
<P> Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui said on Tuesday his first tour of the Middle East was a diplomatic triumph over China's objections and would result in greater commercial links. </P>
<P> Beijing and Taipei have been bitter rivals since the Nationalists of late Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek lost a civil war to the communists and fled to Taiwan in 1949. </P>
<P> China has sought to isolate Taiwan diplomatically and only 29 countries have formal diplomatic ties with the island. The 29 do not include the United Arab Emirates or Jordan, which recognise Beijing. </P>
<P> Lee's so-called ``private visit'' to the United Arab Emirates and Jordan was aimed at carrying out ``political activities there,'' Chen was quoted as saying. </P>
<P> The attempt by Taiwan authorities to create ``two Chinas'' or ``one China, one Taiwan'' was bound to end in failure, Chen said. </P>
<P> Beijing views Taiwan as a renegade province and has refused to grant Taipei legitimacy, which would create ``two Chinas.'' Both Beijing and Taipei say they hope to reunify one day. </P>
<P> ``One China, one Taiwan'' is China's euphemism for Taiwan declaring itself an independent nation. </P>
