<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The United States and South Korea are likely to decide next week whether to go ahead with military exercises postponed as a conciliatory gesture to North Korea, a Seoul Defense Ministry spokesman said Wednesday. </P>
<P> Seoul and Washington suspended the Team Spirit joint exercises earlier this year but said at the time they would go ahead in November unless the North agreed to open its suspect nuclear sites to international scrutiny. </P>
<P> Defense Secretary William Perry and South Korean Defense Minister Rhee Byoung-tae will attend security talks in Washington on October 6 and 7. </P>
<P> ``Team Spirit will be a major topic of discussion during the Korea-U.S. Security Consultative Meeting,'' the spokesman said. </P>
<P> ``A firm decision is expected be made on how and when to conduct the annual exercises, which were suspended early this year to encourage nuclear cooperation by the North,'' he said. </P>
<P> The exercises, which normally involve tens of thousands of troops from both sides, were due to take place in February and March. North Korea brands them a rehearsal for invasion. </P>
<P> The United States said Tuesday no progress had been made in five days of talks with North Korea in Geneva on reshaping Pyongyang's nuclear-power program to prevent it from producing atomic weapons. </P>
<P> The two sides agreed last month on an outline accord under which Pyongyang would switch from graphite-moderated to safer, although more costly, light-water reactors. </P>
<P> But they remain far apart on implementing the accord and on the question of special inspections to check whether North Korea has already diverted plutonium from its reactor. </P>
<P> Pyongyang has been angered by the U.S. deployment of warships in the Sea of Japan, a move the commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet said last week was aimed at bolstering Washington's hand in the negotiations. </P>
<P> The Stalinist state accused the United States of seeking a military showdown and threatened to break off the talks. </P>
