<DATELINE>KUWAIT, March 23 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A strike in Kuwait's Gulf War oilfields went into a sixth day on Thursday with no early end in sight to a walkout aimed at shutting off three percent of global production. </P>
<P> Workers and management remained deadlocked over ways of ending what diplomats call an ineffective but potentially embarrassing stoppage in a major OPEC member that only recently rebuilt its industry from damage in the 1991 war with Iraq. </P>
<P> ``We are still on strike. There are no talks, nothing has changed,'' Mohammad al-Sarhan, chairman of Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) Labour Union, told Reuters. </P>
<P> State-owned KOC says output of two million barrels per day (bpd), the maximum permitted Kuwait by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), is unaffected and sufficient staff are managing the desert installations. </P>
<P> KOC says the strike launched in support of demands for a reshuffle of employment grades is illegal and executives say they will not negotiate until it ends. ``We have told them we will not talk to them in conditions of illegality,'' one said. </P>
<P> Sarhan said no negotiations were scheduled although he understood parliament Speaker Ahmad al-Saadoun might hold talks on the strike with Oil Minister Abdul-Mohsen al-Mudej. Mudej is due in South Africa on Monday for an oil conference. </P>
<P> Saadoun, who met Sarhan on Wednesday, is the most senior figure the union has so far contacted in pursuit of its demands. </P>
<P> Saadoun has refused a request for an assembly debate on the strike and says he will deal with the matter personally. </P>
<P> The dispute appeared to take on political overtones when two opposition Islamist MPs who have waged campaigns against government policy on a range of issues in recent months visited the union earlier this week to express support. </P>
<P> Oil exports provide about 90 percent of government income. </P>
<P> Asked about industry talk that Kuwait has streamlined its production network because of the strike, KOC production manager Bader al-Kashti Kashti said KOC was using the same wells and gathering centres as before the stoppage began on Saturday. </P>
<P> He added: ``We have good control, good management of the system. We are therefore prepared for any circumstance.'' </P>
