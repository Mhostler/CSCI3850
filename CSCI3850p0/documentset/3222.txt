<P>  U.S. Transportation Secretary Federico Pena on Wednesday ordered a special safety examination of every commuter plane in the United States after the second fatal crash in six weeks of an American Eagle plane. </P>
<P> Airline officials, meanwhile, defended the records of the two pilots of the British-built Jetstream Super 31 that crashed in the woods Tuesday evening on its approach to Raleigh-Durham International Airport, killing 15 of the 20 people aboard. </P>
<P> Five crash survivors were hospitalized in critical or stable condition after the turboprop plane went down in fog and drizzle about three miles short of the runway. </P>
<P> Pena ordered the Federal Aviation Administration to instruct ``FAA inspectors to conduct a special safety procedures audit of every carrier in the country.'' </P>
<P> ``This will be in addition to their already beefed-up inspections and current responsibilities,'' he said. </P>
<P> National Safety and Transportation Board inspectors and FAA officials combed through the debris of the plane as Pena spoke to reporters. </P>
<P> Pena expressed ``deep concern'' over the string of commercial airplane accidents during the past year. </P>
<P> ``We will immediately convene a meeting in Washington, D.C., of senior flight operations officers and their chief pilots of all air carriers in the country,'' Pena said. </P>
<P> He also announced the FAA will hire an additional 300 safety inspectors and will accelerate a program already under way to bring commuter airlines into line with the tougher standards that already apply to large airliners. </P>
<P> The Air Transport Association, which represents major U.S. carriers, said the U.S. airline industry remained the safest in the world but pledged to cooperate with Pena on the summit. </P>
<P> ``The recent accidents have had tragic results, which have, unfortunately, obscured the industry's outstanding record,'' association President Jim Landry said, saying the industry welcomed the opportunity to discuss their commitment to safety. </P>
<P> Captain Randolph Babbitt, president of the Air Line Pilots Association, welcomed Pena's decision to expedite efforts to standardize safety rules for commuter and major airlines. </P>
<P> ``If the FAA follows through on its commitment, millions of passengers no longer will be needlessly exposed to a dual set of safety standards,'' he said in a statement. </P>
<P> The crash was the fourth serious airline accident in the United States in recent months. </P>
<P> An American Eagle plane crashed Oct. 31 in northern Indiana, killing 68. In September, a USAir jet plunged to the ground on its approach to Pittsburgh International Airport, killing 132. </P>
<P> Another USAir jet crashed in July near Charlotte-Douglas International Airport in North Carolina, killing 37. </P>
<P> American Eagle spokesman Marty Heires told a news conference later Wednesday that the pilots, who both died in the crash, were ``eminently qualified,'' noting that they had flown more than 3,000 hours each. </P>
<P> ``There's no question about the pilots that I'm aware of,'' Heires said. ``They were trained on the equipment, they had many hours on this particular equipment. These were experienced pilots, experienced in this aircraft, and experienced flying in this area.'' </P>
<P> Capt. Michael Hillis, 29, had flown the Jetstream for 457 hours since joining American Eagle in January 1991. First Officer Matthew Sailor, 25, had flown the Jetstream for 677 hours since joining the company in December 1993. </P>
<P> They had flown only one previous flight Tuesday to Greensboro, N.C., from Raleigh before the crash, which occurred around 6:30 p.m. EST Tuesday. </P>
<P> The type of commuter airplane involved in the Raleigh crash, a Jetstream Super 31, was not the same kind of plane grounded by American Eagle last week, the French-built ATR. The company grounded its fleet of ATRs after the government ordered the plane to stop flying in icy weather. </P>
<P> At the crash site, investigators cut a road through the heavily wooded area where the wreckage was strewn. </P>
<P> AMR Corp., the parent company of American Eagle, said it would ``aggressively investigate'' the crash. A spokesman for the Dallas-based airline expressed confidence in the Jetstream, which has been part of its fleet since 1989. </P>
<P> Two of the survivors were identified as Don Merkel, 60, from Windsor, Ill., and John Ciulla, 31, of Mannerville, N.Y. Both were at Wake Medical Center in Raleigh with various broken bones and other injuries. </P>
<P> Officials have not yet released the names of three other survivors, also hospitalized with various injuries. </P>
