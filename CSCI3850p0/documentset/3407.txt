<P>  Rep. Bill Richardson told President Clinton Friday he expected a U.S. army pilot whose helicopter strayed into North Korea to be freed ``very soon,'' possibly before Christmas. </P>
<P> Richardson, a New Mexico Democrat who was in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang when the incident occurred and negotiated with officials there, spoke with reporters after briefing Clinton at the White House. </P>
<P> ``Basically what I told the president was No. 1, that Bobby Hall, in my judgment, would be released, No. 2, that he would be released very soon, that was the agreement I made with the North Koreans, and thirdly, that there was a decent chance that he would be released before Christmas,'' he said. </P>
<P> Richardson left North Korea Thursday with the remains of Chief Warrant Officer David Hilemon, who was killed in the helicopter incident. He said he believed the United States should temper its public statements about the affair until Hall is released because ``North Koreans don't like to be pressured.'' </P>
<P> He added: ``I believe that Bobby Hall is in relatively good condition'' and will be released soon.'' </P>
