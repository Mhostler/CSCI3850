<P>  Russian and Chechen forces exchanged shell and tank fire overnight near the Chechen capital of Grozny, Interfax news agency said Friday. </P>
<P> The agency, reporting from Grozny, said Russian troops had shelled separatist Chechen positions at Stariye Atagi, 20 miles south of the city, and the Chechens had replied with tank fire. </P>
<P> The new fighting appeared clearly to violate a 48-hour general cease-fire running from midnight Wednesday and provided a grim backdrop for a new round of truce talks due to take place Friday. </P>
<P> Interfax said Chechen forces loyal to separatist leader Dzhokhar Dudayev were shelling Russian armored positions along a line from Gikalo to Chechen-Aul south of Grozny. </P>
<P> It said there had also been small arms fire overnight in the capital. </P>
<P> Interfax said preparations were still going ahead for a fresh round of cease-fire talks Friday scheduled to be held between military leaders of the two sides in the Ingushi settlement of Sleptsovsk on the Chechnya border. </P>
