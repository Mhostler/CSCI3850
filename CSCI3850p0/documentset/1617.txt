<P>  Officials from the United States and North Korea began a fifth day of talks Tuesday to defuse their nuclear stand-off despite a threat by Pyongyang to break off the negotiations. </P>
<P> North Korea's Deputy Foreign Minister Kang Sok-ju was received by Washington's ambassador-at-large Robert Gallucci at the U.S. diplomatic mission in Geneva. </P>
<P> The two sides agreed last month on an outline accord under which Pyongyang, suspected by Washington of using its nuclear power program to develop atomic weapons, would switch to safer light-water reactors with outside help. </P>
<P> They appear far apart on the details of the accord and on the issue of ``special inspections'' to check whether Pyongyang has already diverted plutonium from its one existing nuclear power station. </P>
<P> The United States' deployment of a carrier battle group in the Sea of Japan, said by the commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet to be aimed at bolstering the Geneva negotiations, has also angered Pyongyang. </P>
<P> The latest outburst came Tuesday when a spokesman for the Ministry of the People's Armed Forces said North Korea might have to withdraw from the talks. </P>
<P> ``Now that the United States is seeking a military showdown, we cannot stick to talks indefinitely,'' the spokesman said in a statement carried by Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). </P>
<P> ``Our People's Army pins no hope on any dialogue accompanied by pressure,'' he said. </P>
<P></P>
<P> ``Behind the curtain of talks, the United States has all along watched for a chance to swallow up the DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), while extensively reinforcing its aggression forces in South Korea.'' </P>
