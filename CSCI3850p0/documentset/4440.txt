<DATELINE>LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Pakistan's archbishop Armando Trindado Sunday appealed for prayers for two Christians sentenced to death on the charge of blasphemy against Islam's Prophet Mohammad. </P>
<P> The archbishop made the appeal in a joint statement with Bishop Alexander John Malik of the Punjab province capital Lahore, the local Christian community said. </P>
<P> A two-judge bench of the Lahore High Court is due to resume Wednesday hearing an appeal by the pair against a lower court ruling early this month sentencing them to death. </P>
<P> Muslim fundamentalists chanted ``death for blasphemists'' on the last hearing Thursday when more than 50 demonstrators shouted slogans outside the court and damaged the car of a defense lawyer. </P>
<P> ``We appeal to all to observe Wednesday, February 22, as a day of prayer and fasting for the success of (the Christian convicts') appeal, the safety of (accused) Rehmat Masih and Salamat Masih in jail and the repeal of all unjust laws,'' a joint statement by Trindado and Malik said. </P>
<P> One lawyer filed an application last week accusing Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of committing contempt of court by expressing shock at the death sentence. </P>
<P> The sentence on the two Christians -- 40-year-old Rehmat Masih and 14-year-old Salamat Masih -- was passed by the lower court last week in Lahore on the charge, which they denied, of blasphemy against Islam's prophet Mohammad. </P>
<P> They were arrested in May 1993 after a village imam, or prayer leader, in the nearby Gujranwala district accused them of throwing into his mosque pieces of paper bearing blasphemous remarks. A domestic human rights commission said there appeared to be local personal grievances in the case. </P>
<P> A third Christian accused of the offence was shot dead as the defendants walked out of a Lahore court in April 1994. Rehmat and Salamat Masih were wounded in the attack. </P>
<P> The village imam, Hafiz Fazal-e-Haq, and two others were charged with murder. Fazal-e-Haq is out on bail. </P>
<P> The death sentence was the second of the kind pronounced by any court after the parliament amended the Pakistan Penal Code in July 1992, raising the penalty for blasphemy from life imprisonment to death. </P>
<P> An earlier conviction of a Christian by another court in the Punjab province town of Sargodha was overturned last November by the Lahore High Court, which acquitted the convict. </P>
