<DATELINE>WASHINGTON, (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The United States Thursday announced the appointment of a top international lawyer to arbitrate growing disputes within the U.S.-backed Muslim-Croat federation in Bosnia. </P>
<P> The arbitrator, Roberts Owen, was State Department legal adviser during the Jimmy Carter administration in the late 1970s and negotiated the Algiers accords which resolved the 1979-81 crisis over U.S. diplomats held hostage in Iran. </P>
<P> At U.S. urging, the Bosnian Muslims and Croats ended more than a year of fighting last year and formed a federation largely aimed at isolating the remaining party to the Bosnia conflict, the Serbs. </P>
<P> But the federation has grown increasingly fractious with the Muslims and Croats failing to integrate their military forces, police and schools, as originally foreseen. </P>
<P> The appointment of Owen stemmed from a nine-point plan to shore up the federation agreed on by Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke, who mediated between the Muslims and Croats in Munich last month. </P>
<P> Owen was the personal choice of Secretary of State Warren Christopher, with whom he has a long-time personal and professional association. </P>
<P> ``He was an outstanding legal adviser to (former Secretary of State) Cy Vance and (then Deputy Secretary) Warren Christopher in the Carter period and we're very lucky that he agreed to take this position,'' Holbrooke said in an interview. </P>
<P> The State Department said in a statement that Owen would be able to decide all matters referred to him by either side and his decisions would be binding on the parties and based on federation agreements, its constitution and ``equitable principles''. </P>
<P> He was appointed by Christopher at the request of the federation's Croat president, Kresimir Zubak, and Muslim Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic. </P>
<P> ``He does not work for the U.S. government ... He's doing this on behalf of the federation ... He will not take instructions from us. They (Muslims and Croats) will bring issues to him, like a dispute over the authority of police in areas like Mostar,'' Holbroke said. </P>
<P> He added that Owen, currently a partner at the Washington law firm of Covington & Burling, would be performing this mission ``pro bono'', which is to say without being paid except by his law firm, and that he was expected to visit Sarajevo next week. </P>
<P> Holbrooke said he was still looking for a military expert to advise the federation and was also considering other ways to strengthen the federation, which has been seen as a potential anchor of stability in a Balkan crisis that officials fear is near to spinning out of control. </P>
