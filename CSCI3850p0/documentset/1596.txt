<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A Canadian pilot detained in South Korea since the crash of a Korean Air Lines Airbus last month has left for Canada, a Canadian embassy official said Monday. </P>
<P> ``The pilot left South Korea yesterday,'' the official told Reuters. She said further details were not available. </P>
<P> On Friday South Korea lifted a 90-day travel ban on Barry Woods, 52, who faces a criminal charge of occupational negligence. A government official in Canada said Woods was released on condition he return for his trial. </P>
<P> An official at the Seoul Prosecutors' Office said no trial date had yet been set for Woods but it was likely to be toward the end of next month. </P>
<P> The Airbus crashed and burned while landing on the southern resort island of Cheju on August 10. All 160 passengers and crew escaped serious injury after the jet skidded off a runway, crashed into a barricade and burst into flames. </P>
<P> Cockpit recordings show Woods and his Korean co-pilot argued about whether to land the plane in bad weather. Woods said his co-pilot panicked. </P>
<P> The Canadian Air Line Pilots Association demanded Woods be released, saying he should be considered a hero since no one was killed in the crash. </P>
<P> Canadian diplomats in Korea as well as Canada's foreign affairs minister intervened to urge that the travel restriction be lifted. </P>
<P> Woods' wife said last week her husband's health was deteriorating because of the detention. </P>
