<P>  A standard international treatment for premature babies has been linked to deaths and brain damage, a New Zealand researcher said Thursday. </P>
<P> A form of chest physiotherapy may be the cause of death and disability among 13- to 16-week-old premature babies with low blood pressure, Jane Harding, a pediatrician at Auckland's National Women's Hospital, said in a telephone interview. </P>
<P> Her research suggests the treatment -- tapping babies' chests with a soft latex cup to clear secretions -- caused the previously unexplained damage and deaths. </P>
<P> ``My research suggests the possibility that in very small, very premature infants, low blood pressure may result in injury to the brain, making it susceptible to further injury caused by the chest physiotherapy,'' Harding said. </P>
<P> ``The results are particularly worrying because the physiotherapy is standard practice around the world.'' </P>
<P> She said it seemed likely that more examples of the physiotherapy-caused brain damage would now be recognized around the world. </P>
<P> Intensive care of the new-born is a relatively recent speciality, but Harding said the suspect practice had been used for more than five years. Available evidence suggested that in most circumstances the therapy was safe. </P>
<P> Harding said that every neo-natal unit in Australia and New Zealand and most units in the Western world used the practice. </P>
<P> The National Women's Hospital was alerted to a possible problem when it found that between May 1993 and December last year, 13 babies with birth weights between 23.6 ounces and 38.8 ounces suffered an unusual form of brain damage. Five subsequently died. </P>
<P> The number with brain damage represented three percent of the babies born in that weight range. The time period coincided with an increase in frequency of the new therapy method. </P>
<P> Extra staff at National Women's had been trained to use the technique, resulting in the premature babies receiving more treatment than had previously been given. </P>
<P> A British hospital in Birmingham had also reported a series of babies with unusual brain injuries in 1992. </P>
<P> Harding said it had taken the very high volume of births at National Women's -- over 9,000 annually -- for the existence of the pattern to be recognized. </P>
<P> National Women's hospital stopped the practice at the start of 1994 when it was first suspected there were problems. </P>
<P> Since stopping the practice, there have been no instances of this form of brain damage at the hospital. </P>
<P> Harding said pediatricians contacted had reacted to the discovery with surprise and horror. </P>
<P> The hospital had contacted some of the affected parents. </P>
<P> ``It stirred up a lot of painful memories but most of them reacted with relief that there was a cause found,'' she said. </P>
<P> There is no question of malpractice as it was an internationally accepted form of treatement, she said. </P>
<P> Harding said her research had not yet been published or verified. She had released it at this stage in an attempt to stop damage being caused to other babies. </P>
