<P>  Major League Baseball club owners, who seem to be in no particular hurry to settle the five-month-long players strike, expressed eagerness Friday to proceed with expansion. </P>
<P> The Major League Expansion Committee unanimously recommended to the Executive Council that baseball go ahead with an expansion of four teams, the office of the commissioner announced. </P>
<P> ``Expansion continues to be on a fast track,'' said Allan (Bud) Selig, the Milwaukee Brewers owner who is chairman of the Executive Council and acting commissioner. </P>
<P> The present total of 28 major league teams, with the exception of the Baltimore Orioles, are racing to assemble replacement teams in order to begin the 1995 season in the event no settlement is reached with the striking big leaguers. </P>
<P> Orioles owners Peter Angelos has said he would not field a team with replacement players despite being warned by American League officials that he could face fines of up to $250,000 a day, suspension, or forfeiture of his franchise if he refuses to go along with the rest of the clubs. </P>
<P> The Expansion Committee recommended that two new teams be awarded in an ``expeditious'' manner with two more franchises to be added in a ``reasonable'' amount of time thereafter. </P>
