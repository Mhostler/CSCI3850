<P>  A Republican bill to repeal last year's ban of 19 types of semi-automatic weapons may be one of the casualties of the Oklahoma City bombing. </P>
<P> House and Senate Republican leaders had promised to act on the bill soon, but a spokesman for the House Judiciary Committee said Tuesday the panel's vote on the measure this month would probably be put off due to the bombing. </P>
<P> ``It's very likely that (repeal of the ban) will be delayed,'' the spokesman said. Asked how long the delay might be, he replied: ``Months.'' </P>
<P> Links between bombing suspects and right-wing paramilitary militias, which ofen use the rapid-fire weapons, have led gun control groups to step up efforts against the repeal, which already faced a tough fight in Congress. </P>
<P> ``I believe that bringing this issue up at this time would be a terrible mistake. It would send the wrong message to paramilitary extremists on one side and ordinary people on the other,'' Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a gun control supporter, said Monday in a letter to House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., and Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan. </P>
<P> ``It would only result in giving state-of-the-art weaponry to violent extremists,'' added the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. Dole replied that there was no connection between the bombing and assault weapons. </P>
<P> ``In my view, the best response to last week's tragedy is not overheated rhetoric about gun control -- it is the rapid adoption of anti-terrorism legislation which will improve the U.S. government's ability to deal with the threat of domestic and international terrorism,'' Dole wrote Schumer. </P>
<P> Dole last month promised the National Rifle Association that he would try to pass a repeal of the assault weapons ban by this summer because he believed law-abiding citizens had a right to defend themselves with the guns. </P>
<P> Gun control supporters accused Dole of pandering to the NRA and other gun control opponents to help his bid for the 1996 Republican presidential nomination. </P>
<P> Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., author of the assault weapons ban amendment to the 1994 crime bill, said she would lead a filibuster against Dole's bill and President Clinton promised to veto any repeal legislation that passed. </P>
<P> It would take 60 votes in the Senate to stop a filibuster and a two-thirds majority in both chambers to overturn a veto. Republicans have a 54-46 Senate majority and control the House, 231-203, with one independent. </P>
