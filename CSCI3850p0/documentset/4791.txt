<P> Through his questioning, Cochran suggested that Resnick had been free-basing cocaine at Nicole Brown Simpson's condominium while she was living there and left June 8 to enter a drug rehabilitation program as a result of a ``intervention'' by her friends. </P>
<P> ``If you learned that to be a fact, would that change your opinion about this possibly being a drug-related killing?'' Cochran asked. </P>
<P> ``If I had that information, that would probably be a consideration if I had no other direction to go,'' Lange replied. </P>
<P> Cochran further suggested that Resnick, who wrote a book about Nicole Brown Simpson's final days, had no job and no way to pay for her drugs. </P>
<P> ``And sometimes in your experience you know that when drugs are not paid for that have been gotten and used there are repercussions, isn't that correct?'' Cochran asked? </P>
<P> ``Certainly,'' Lange answered. </P>
<P> Lange also acknowleged that he would have considered it ''relevant'' had he known that Resnick had called Nicole Simpson from the treatment facility last June 12, the night she and Ronald Goldman were killed. </P>
<P> Cochran asked Lange about a murder technique used by drug dealers called a ``Colombian necklace,'' in which they will ''slice the neck of a victim including the carotid artery'' to send a message to others who have not paid for their drugs. </P>
