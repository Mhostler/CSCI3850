<DATELINE>KHARTOUM (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Muslim delegates from over 80 countries Sunday rejected normalization with Israel and declared support for armed struggle against the Jewish state. </P>
<P> Delegates to the Popular Arab and Islamic Conference (PAIC) also called for an ``Islamic United Nations'' to be set up and a shakeup of the current membership of the U.N. Security Council. </P>
<P> The four-day meeting ended in a marathon and chaotic final session during which angry delegates urged PAIC secretary- general Hassan al-Tourabi, reading a draft text of the final resolution, to toughen its condemnation of Israel. </P>
<P> But after three days of sometimes vitriolic condemnations of Western attacks on Islam, the draft resolution stressed efforts to open a Muslim dialogue with the West. </P>
<P> Western diplomats attending the final session of the conference, which has attracted Muslim fundamentalists and representatives of militant and maverick groups from around the world, said the tone appeared less confrontational than the last meeting in December 1993. </P>
<P> The conference has attracted delegates from Hizbollah, Algeria's Islamic Salvation Front, Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other Palestinian groups opposed to the Palestinian-Israeli self-rule accord. </P>
<P> Its draft resolution, as in previous meetings, described the Israeli-Palestinian issue as the 'pivotal' concern of the conference, but it drew the ire of the Hizbollah (party of God) delegation for not specifically opposing the 1993 Oslo accord for Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and the West Bank. </P>
<P> Tourabi, a prominent Sudanese Islamist widely believed to be the power behind Khartoum's military government, said many of the requests made by delegates would be included in the meeting's final declaration, to be published later. </P>
<P> The draft resolution stated the conference's support for Muslims in Iraq, Libya, Chechnya, Sudan, Algeria, and Bosnia -- seen as victims of either Western aggression or indifference. </P>
<P> It called for the lifting of U.N. sanctions against Libya and Iraq and for solidarity with Bosnian Muslims. </P>
<P> Proposals by sub-Saharan African representatives to drop the word 'Arab' from the title of the conference, which upset Palestinan and Syrian delegates, also caused confusion. </P>
<P> African delegates said Arabs had 'hijacked' Islam, and won a majority in a vote on the issue Saturday. But Tourabi, apparently anxious not to lose support from pan-Arabist elements of the conference, said delegates needed to reach full consensus on the issue before it was adopted. </P>
<P> Its draft resolution also condemned in a section on women the campaign against the hegab (Islamic headscarf) in France and called on delegates to set up branches of the Khartoum-based PAIC, set up in 1991, in their countries. </P>
