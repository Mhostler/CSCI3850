<P>  European Commission President Jacques Santer said on Sunday that recent monetary turbulence was largely due to the effects of ``benign neglect'' of the dollar and said the Group of Seven (G7) industrialised nations should be more involved in stabilising currencies. </P>
<P> ``We must act on the causes of monetary turbulence, which are not so much fundamentals as the effects of benign neglect vis-a-vis the dollar,'' Santer told a news conference after an EU foreign ministers' meeting in the southern French town of Carcassonne. </P>
<P> He noted that G7 finance ministers had acted in the 1980s with the so-called Plaza and Louvre accords to counter currency instability. </P>
<P> ``I think the G7 has to be involved much more than it has been in the last months,'' he said. </P>
<P> The recent turbulence has been largely caused by the dollar's drop to post-war lows as investors seek safety in the mark and yen. </P>
<P> Santer said EU economy and finance ministers would discuss currency turbulence at a lunch during a meeting in Brussels on Monday. </P>
<P> Monday's meeting will be the ministers' first since the Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo were forced to devalue within the EU's semi-fixed exchange rate mechanism (ERM) -- the community's vehicle to a single currency -- two weeks ago. </P>
<P> Both those currencies were hit by a new wave of selling last Friday, prompting speculation that they may be forced to devalue yet again or even quit the ERM. </P>
<P> The Irish, French and Belgian currencies also suffered, as did former ERM members the British pound and the Italian lira. </P>
<P> Santer said the EU monetary system had resisted the recent crisis well and had overcome a more serious threat to its survival in August 1993, when the ERM currencies' fluctuation bands were prised wide open by forces of market speculation. </P>
<P> The only conclusion, he said, was that the faster the EU moved towards a single currency the better, while still respecting the timetable and economic convergence criteria of the Maastricht treaty on closer union. </P>
