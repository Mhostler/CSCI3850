<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A young Lebanese prisoner held 10 years without trial in an Israeli-controlled jail in south Lebanon has died of torture, a support committee for Lebanese in Israeli jails said. </P>
<P> Haitham Dabaja, 28, was the third prisoner from Khiam detention camp in Israel's south Lebanon occupation zone to die since December, the committee said in a communique published in Lebanese newspapers Thursday. </P>
<P> He died Monday in a hospital at the Marjayoun, headquarters of the South Lebanon Army militia which helps Israel control the zone. </P>
<P> Some 250 Lebanese and 100 Palestinians and other Arabs are held at Khiam, established in 1983 and run by the SLA under Israeli supervision. </P>
<P> Israel and the SLA have barred visits by prisoners' families, the International Red Cross and all humanitarian and outside agencies since the camp's creation. </P>
<P> French human rights activist Monique Picard-Weyl said in Beirut last month Khiam was ``a death camp similar to the Nazi camps'' but later withdrew the charge saying she had never been permitted to enter the camp to see for herself. </P>
<P> Picard-Weyl heads a sub-committee within the French Communist Party's ``Committee for the Defense of Freedoms and Human Rights.'' </P>
<P> The families of the prisoners asked her to act on their behalf to obtain access to their relatives and improved conditions for them. </P>
<P> The ``Support Committee for Lebanese in Israeli prisons'' said in its communique that two other prisoners, Salim Awada and Ali al-Ghoul, died last month in Beirut hospitals days after their release from Khiam. </P>
<P> It said a fourth ex-prisoner, 85-year-old Moustapha Hassan Ramadan, who was freed from Khiam on October 24 on health grounds after six years detention without trial, had reported that most inmates were sick. </P>
<P> He said more than 80 percent of the prisoners had heart, pulmonary or nervous disorders due to the extreme dampness of cells. They were only allowed outside once every three days. </P>
<P> A communique issued by residents of Bint Jbeil, a predominantly Shi'ite Muslim town on the edge of the nine-mile wide occupation zone, also said Dabaja died as a result of torture. </P>
<P> ``We call on humanitarian and international bodies to put an end to Israel's aggression and negligence of human rights. We call on them to check on the physical and psychological conditions of the detainees, so that they get the minimum rights of human beings,'' the communique said. </P>
