<P>  Europe and the United States must work together more closely to solve problems of global dimensions, but do not need a new trans-Atlantic framework for cooperation, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said Thursday. </P>
<P> In a column for the International Herald Tribune newspaper, Kinkel broke with leading politicians in Germany, France and Britain who want a new trans-Atlantic partnership that would transcend NATO and create an alliance for world stability. </P>
<P> ``The question...is not primarily one of reshaping the trans-Atlantic partnership,'' Kinkel wrote. ``The main objective is to find solutions to a range of problems that Europe and the United States can master only by working together.'' </P>
<P> He said the NATO alliance would remain the principal forum for carrying out the trans-Atlantic agenda, but security concerns had to be complemented with action on the political, environmental and economic fronts. </P>
<P> The European Union and the United States needed early warning on trade conflicts, liberalized investments and coordinated approaches to competition, copyrights and rules of origin, he suggested. </P>
<P> ``The economic policy agenda should be inspired by the vision of a trans-Atlantic free-trade zone,'' he wrote, noting that Europe was not included in some major economic blocs of which the United States was a part. </P>
<P> Kinkel said the trans-Atlantic community's challenges were to develop a common policy toward Russia as it implemented reforms, to integrate the new democracies in Eastern Europe and to merge the defense roles of NATO and a united Europe. </P>
