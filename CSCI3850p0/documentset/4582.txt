<P>  The whiz kid who gambled away the assets of Britain's oldest and most presitigious merchant bank was a 28-year-old British man from a modest background, British tabloids said Monday. </P>
<P> They named the Singapore-based trader believed to have triggered the crisis which sent international share prices and the pound reeling in early Far East trade as Nick Leeson, from Watford, North London. </P>
<P> ``If you knew Nick like we do, you'd know he couldn't have done anything wrong,'' the Daily Mirror quoted his sister as saying. ``I think he's just very scared -- he couldn't cope with what is happening.'' The paper did not name the woman. </P>
<P> The Daily Mail described Leeson, who wore expensive suits and traded complex derivative instruments at Baring's Singapore office, as a losing roulette player who had hoped he would still win the next spin. </P>
<P> The despairing Leeson took on more and more contracts from investors over a period of ten days until he had accumulated a staggering 40,000 -- each with a potential loss of $190,800, the paper said. </P>
<P> The demise of the bank which counted Queen Elizabeth among its clientele will fuel calls for stricter regulations to curb the fast-growing derivatives business, which bankers say is almost impossible to monitor. </P>
<P> Desperate last-minute attempts by the Bank of England to put together a rescue package for Barings have failed because potential British buyers said it was impossible to quantify the losses while the derivatives contracts were still open. </P>
<P> BBC radio said early Monday that Barings directors were literally in tears at news that the banks losses amounted to more than $795 million. </P>
<P> Leeson was believed to be on the run in Malaysia, the Today newspaper said. </P>
<P> ``Nick has worked hard for what he's got and he deserves it all,'' the Daily Mirror quoted his sister as saying. </P>
<P> ``He wasn't one of those public (private) school types which has had it all handed to him on a plate.'' </P>
