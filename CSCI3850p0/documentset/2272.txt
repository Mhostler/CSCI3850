<P>  More than 7,000 Serb civilians have fled a Bosnian government army offensive that has penetrated deep into separatist Serb territory in the past few days, Western relief officials said Thursday. </P>
<P> U.N. observers said Bosnian Serb soldiers had abandoned tanks and mortars in a headlong retreat from government troops charging out of a northwest enclave long besieged by Serb forces and into a Serb stronghold to the south. </P>
<P> Some 5,000 Serbs had fled Bosnian government forces surging out of the Bihac enclave in the northwest, said Alex Braunwalder, a senior official in the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) mission in Bosnia. </P>
<P> Another 2,500 had escaped a Muslim thrust into the mountainous Kupres region in west-central Bosnia, according to Alemka Lisinski, a spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). </P>
<P> U.N. military monitors said the Bosnian army advance on both fronts slowed Thursday because of rain, fog and a need to consolidate gains made over so much territory so fast. </P>
<P> U.N. sources said government units seemed to have pushed east of Bosanska Krupa, a long-divided town on the Una River that marked the eastern front of the Bihac pocket. </P>
<P> They had also advanced some six miles on the main road from Bihac town toward Serb-held Bosanski Petrovac, 30 miles south of the Muslim-populated enclave. </P>
<P> U.N. military spokesman Lt. Col. Tim Spicer said observers believed Bosnian troops had taken 40-60 square miles of terrain -- a battlefield coup against the Serbs unprecedented in the 30-month war. </P>
<P> Muslim forces also appear to have sallied west from their central stronghold of Bugojno up into mountains toward Kupres, a town at an important supply road junction long in Serb hands. </P>
<P> Braunwalder told Reuters that up to 4,000 Serbs, some of them ill and injured, had streamed into Bosanski Petrovac and were put up in public buildings such as schools. </P>
<P> Bosnian Serb forces, with a huge edge in tanks and artillery supplied from Serbian-led rump Yugoslavia, overran 70 percent of the ex-Yugoslav republic early in the war and had held it since. </P>
<P> But the Bosnian Serbs may now be starting to feel the impact of a blockade imposed by their former patrons in Belgrade. </P>
