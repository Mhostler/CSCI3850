<P>  Team New Zealand, confident of superior boat speed, brushed aside Stars & Stripes' attempt at a fight and swept away to a 1 minute 51 second victory in the America's Cup finals Tuesday to take a daunting 3-0 lead in the best-of-nine series. </P>
<P> Like a little dog pestering a big one, Dennis Conner's Stars & Stripes team, with Paul Cayard at the helm of Young America, drew Peter Blake's Team New Zealand into the most interesting tacking duel of the series partway up the first leg after a dead-even start. </P>
<P> But the Kiwis, trying to bring yachting's greatest prize to their country for the first time, broke off to the right, and pulled away. </P>
<P> ``It looked like we were gaining in that (tacking duel) and they broke it off and obviously went back to their straight-line game away from the standard tactics of match racing,'' said Cayard, whose tactician Tom Whidden had said the day before that the Americans would have to be more aggressive in Race 3. </P>
<P> Still, the Kiwis' lead in Black Magic I, helmed by Russell Coutts, was just 20 seconds at the first mark, the smallest at that point of the three races so far. </P>
<P> But early in the second leg the New Zealanders' big black boat simply sailed away from Conner's borrowed Young America yacht, and their margin at the second mark was 1:20, the largest at that point of the first three races. </P>
<P> ``It was a boat speed kind of day and the faster boat won,'' said Conner. </P>
<P> The Kiwis never lost ground, leading by 1:24 at both the third and fourth marks and 1:39 at the fifth heading for the finish line. </P>
<P> The New Zealanders, remaining characteristically low-key, did allow themselves a few smiles as they approached the line, and shook hands and patted one another on the back after the victory. </P>
<P> The winds built from a moderate 7 knots to a steady 14 knots on the final leg. The earlier conditions may have favored the Kiwis, or they may simply have been sailing conservatively with the lead in hand in the higher winds. </P>
<P> Conner and Cayard differed on what conditions they would need to try to climb back into the so-far one-sided contest. </P>
<P> ``All we can hope for is to get a little more boat speed and get some shifty San Diego conditions,'' said Conner, a San Diego native whose forte has been reading the light and changeable winds here. </P>
<P> ``Pray like hell for 17 knots of wind and smoother water,'' said Cayard, who stayed at the wheel the whole race this time. In previous races, Conner has taken the helm for occasional downwind legs. </P>
<P> Team New Zealand became just the second challenger to go up 3-0. Conner himself swept Australia 4-0 in 1987 after becoming the only American ever to lose the Cup in its 144-year history. </P>
<P> Whidden lodged a protest during the first leg which was immediately denied by the umpires, and Cayard, who called the protest ``reactionary'' and routine, agreed with the decision. ''Everything was correct and the umpires made the right call.'' </P>
<P> Wednesday is a lay-day ahead of Thursday's Race 4. </P>
