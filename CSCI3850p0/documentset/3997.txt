<P>  Six policemen and four suspected Islamic militants were killed in two clashes in southern Egypt Friday, security sources said. </P>
<P> They said four suspected militants were killed at dawn when police stormed a flat opposite a mosque of the Muslim fundamentalist al-Gama'a al-Islamiya (the Islamic Group), in the town of Minya, some 160 miles south of Cairo. </P>
<P> Security sources said police exchanged fire with the militants when they resisted arrest and all four were killed on the spot. No policemen were injured. Police found three revolvers and bullets in the flat. </P>
<P> Three hours later six policemen were killed and five wounded when gunmen fired on a police patrol in the nearby town of Abu Qurqas. The patrol was on its way to escort tourist boats when the men, believed to be militants, struck. </P>
<P> Friday's attacks took the number of militants and policemen killed this month to 52. </P>
<P> The militants, hit hard by arrests and executions, have made a vigorous revival this year, undermining the government's repeated claim that it has broken the back of the movement, which seeks to turn Egypt into a strict Islamic state. </P>
<P> On Jan. 2, in four operations, militants disguised as police dragged policemen off buses and summarily executed them in public. </P>
<P> Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Interior Minister Hassan Alfi this week pledged more action against the militants, saying there would be no mercy on those ``threatening the country.'' </P>
<P> Since 1992 at least 600 people have been killed in the conflict, which has also cost Egypt's tourist trade billions of dollars in losses. </P>
<P> In Washington Tuesday President Clinton froze U.S. assets of 12 Middle East groups deemed terrorist, including the Gama'a al-Islamiya and the Jihad group, Egypt's most active militants. </P>
