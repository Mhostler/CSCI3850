<P>  Spain's former Civil Guard chief, Luis Roldan, wanted on corruption charges for 10 months, was arrested by Spanish police in Laos, a Spanish Embassy official in Bangkok said Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``I can tell you with all assurance that he was detained by the Spanish police ... with the help of the Lao and Thai police forces,'' the official told Reuters. </P>
<P> The official, who asked not to be identified, could not confirm reports that Roldan was in Thailand, which borders Laos, before being sent back to Spain later Tuesday. </P>
<P> Thai police said they were aware of the case but did not have further details. </P>
<P> The embassy official said the Spanish police had been working through Interpol to find Roldan, who disappeared from Spain last April after failing to appear before a judge on charges of illegally amassing a personal fortune while heading the country's paramilitary police force. </P>
<P> In Madrid, a brief Justice and Interior Ministry statement said only that Roldan had been arrested by Spanish police in a foreign country. It said further details were being withheld for security reasons. </P>
<P> Roldan, 51, was the first civilian to head the Civil Guard. He led the force for seven years before stepping down in 1993. </P>
