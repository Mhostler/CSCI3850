<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  South Korea is concerned about indications Kim Jong-il, son and political heir of late North Korean leader Kim Il-sung, faces problems consolidating his power, a senior presidential aide said Wednesday. </P>
<P> The aide said Seoul had obtained information ``through a diplomatic channel'' that leaflets calling for the overthrow of Kim Jong-il had been scattered around foreign missions in Pyongyang last week. </P>
<P> But diplomats at several Western embassies and other foreign sources in Seoul said they were extremely skeptical of reports on the leaflets, which appeared in the South Korean press Tuesday and Wednesday. </P>
<P> The reports said an unnamed, highly-placed source had quoted a Western diplomat in Seoul as saying a considerable number of leaflets saying ``Down with Kim Jong-il'' were found all over the diplomatic compound in Pyongyang Friday night. </P>
<P> The Yonhap domestic news agency attributed its story on Tuesday to an unnamed Western diplomatic source. </P>
<P> A diplomat at the German embassy, which has representation in Pyongyang, said he had no information about the leaflets. </P>
<P> Russia's Itar Tass news agency also reported from the North Korean capital that there had been no sign of any such leaflets. </P>
<P> One Western diplomat in Seoul said the reports could be South Korean disinformation. </P>
<P> ``My hunch is don't trust this. I don't think you can exclude the possibility that someone here is trying to rock the boat in North Korea,'' he said. </P>
<P> The South Korean reports connected the story to a North Korean radio commentary Sunday that hinted at opposition to Kim Jong-il's takeover. </P>
<P> The commentary, broadcast by North Korea's domestic Central Radio and monitored in Tokyo, said the country's revolutionary work should not end with just one generation. </P>
<P> ``Historical experience shows that if the succession issue involving takeover of great revolutionary works of the leader failed to be resolved correctly, it could result in damaging the party and revolution through acts of betrayal by ambitious people and conspirators,'' it said. </P>
<P> The South Korean presidential aide said it appeared North Korea's transfer of power was not progressing well. ``The government is concerned about prospects of instability in the North,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``It is quite abnormal that the North remains without a formal head of state more than six weeks after the death of Kim Il-sung,'' he added. </P>
<P> Kim Jong-il has not appeared at official functions for over a month and was rumored to be suffering serious health problems, he said. </P>
<P> The aide quoted President Kim Young-sam as telling ruling party members Tuesday night that there had been a number of ``significant movements'' in North Korea. </P>
<P> ``Our people should be well prepared to cope with any eventuality ,'' he quoted Kim as saying. </P>
<P> Kim Jong-il, 52, was groomed for over 20 years as his father's successor and has been hailed as such by Pyongyang's official media. But he has yet to be confirmed in key positions the elder Kim held until his death on July 8 -- state president, general secretary of the ruling Korea Workers' Party and head of the party's military commission. </P>
