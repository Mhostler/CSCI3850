<P>  Compaq Computer Corp. Saturday searched for the cause of fumes that sent 48 workers to area hospitals last night complaining of headaches and nausea. </P>
<P> The company was forced to evacuate 200 workers from one of six manufacturing buildings at its Houston complex because of the fumes, a Compaq spokesman said. </P>
<P> ``Forty-eight employees were transported to area hospitals, but none was admitted,'' spokesman Mike Berman said. </P>
<P> The gymnasium-sized computer-assembly building remained closed Saturday. Production work continued on assembly lines in five other buildings at the plant, Berman said. </P>
<P> Compaq last year produced 4.8 million units at plants in Houston, Singapore, Scotland, Brazil and China, Berman said. </P>
<P> Houston fire department investigators and company officials took air samples early Saturday to identify the source of the fumes, which seemed to come from an area in the rear of the building, Berman said. </P>
<P> ``Those tests have been negative as to the source of the irrritant,'' Berman said. </P>
