<P>  China's navy chief of staff, Vice Admiral Zhao Guochen, died of an unspecified illness in Beijing last month, official media said Saturday. He was 59. </P>
<P> Zhao died September 27, the People's Daily newspaper and the Xinhua news agency said. It gave no explanation for the delay in reporting his death and did not say if a replacement had been named. </P>
<P> ``He made an important proposal on improving the quality of the navy and being well-prepared for future military struggle,'' the agency said. </P>
<P> Zhao joined the navy in 1956 and the Communist Party four years later. </P>
<P> The Central Military Commission conferred the rank of rear admiral on him in September 1988 and promoted him to vice admiral in July 1993. </P>
<P> He was elected as an alternate member of the Communist Party Central Committee in November 1987. </P>
