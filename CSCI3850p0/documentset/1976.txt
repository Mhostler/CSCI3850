<P>  The United States Wednesday proposed a Security Council resolution that would forbid Iraq from deploying any more troops in southern Iraq than it had there before the recent crisis. </P>
<P> British and French officials backed the proposal, which falls short of some earlier American concepts of an exclusion zone that might have barred all troops or heavy weapons. </P>
<P> ``The Iraqis have to go back to where they were before the recent crisis when they moved large numbers of troops to the Kuwaiti border,'' said one diplomat. </P>
<P> ``The second part of the U.S. proposal is that the Iraqis can't reinforce troops that were already in the south,'' he added. </P>
<P> U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright presented the proposal to a meeting of the four other permanent members of the Security Council -- Russia, Britain, France and China. </P>
<P> Russia's Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev plans to travel to Baghdad shortly and then come to New York Monday to brief Security Council members, diplomats said. </P>
<P> Until then Russia would prefer the Security Council not take any action, they added.  A U.S. official, briefing reporters, said: ``We want to return to the status quo ante.'' </P>
<P> He said before the crisis last week, when Iraq moved about 80,000 troops toward Kuwait, there were three divisions -- none of them elite Republican Guard units, in the southern part of Iraq. They would have numbered about 30,000 troops, most of them guarding Iraq's southern city of Basra, he said. </P>
<P> The official denied that the United States had proposed exclusion zones for Iraqi troops and weapons ``of the nature reported in the press.'' </P>
<P> Diplomats said an exclusion zone had been just one of several American concepts. But strong French objections earlier Wednesday to the phrase ``exclusion zone'' apparently played a role in the new proposal, which no longer carries the suggestion of dismembering or partitioning Iraq. </P>
