<DATELINE>PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Largely hated and feared by Haiti's poor, military leader Raoul Cedras thumbed his nose at the international community which before the 1991 coup saw him as a supporter of the nation's fledgling democracy. </P>
<P> Known to wealthy Haitians as an articulate, erudite and even charming man, Cedras reluctantly agreed last month to relinquish power no later than Oct. 15 in an agreement brokered by former President Jimmy Carter. </P>
<P> Cedras, 45, had insisted that he would never leave his homeland. But international pressure for his departure mounted after another member of the military junta, Port-au-Prince police chief Lt. Col. Josef Michel Francois, fled to the Dominican Republic last week. </P>
<P> On Monday Cedras resigned and announced he was leaving Haiti. </P>
<P> Behind Cedras's silken demeanor was the iron fist of a man who ruled while more than 4,000 people, virtually all of them unarmed civilians, were killed and thousands more of Haiti's poor were raped, tortured and beaten, according to human rights groups. </P>
<P> He is widely reported by foreign diplomats to have accumulated considerable wealth, and owns property in Spain and in the Dominican Republic. </P>
<P> The lantern-jawed lieutenant general, who seized power in a bloody coup on Sept. 30, 1991, is all contradiction. </P>
<P> He is light-skinned in a country that is 90 percent black, Methodist in an overwhelmingly Catholic state and sits in a study filled with well-thumbed books amid a population in which the overwhelming majority cannot write their own names. </P>
<P> Before the coup, Cedras seemed a secure and even admired figure in the world community. </P>
<P> He was handpicked by the United States and France to oversee security for voters in Haiti's first free elections, in December 1990. And Cedras was appointed to the nation's top military post, commander-in-chief of the Haitian armed forces, by a grateful President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who won the elections with a huge majority. </P>
<P> But Cedras' appointment was a decision Aristide would live to regret. </P>
<P> Within eight months of Aristide's swearing-in, the man known as ``The General'' remained atop the armed forces. But he also headed a military regime that overthrew the popular Roman Catholic priest and sent him into exile. </P>
<P> Cedras has been portrayed in many coup accounts as an unwilling participant forced into the limelight by the real plotters, Francois and Philippe Biamby, a boyhood friend who was Cedras' chief of staff. </P>
<P> Despite widespread human rights abuses and intractable resistance to Aristide's restoration, many diplomats swallowed Cedras' image as the reasonable leader of the ruling trio. </P>
<P> ``I genuinely believe he knows he made a mistake,'' said one senior diplomat who met regularly with Cedras, referring to his decision to go along with the September 1991 coup. </P>
<P> But Cedras' image in the international community as a moderate faded last October when, amid a rash of vicious pro-military violence, he reneged on a U.N.- mediated deal in which he had agreed to resign and allow Aristide's return. </P>
<P> For the past 11 months, Cedras ignored an increasingly exasperated international community to the point where President Clinton called him a killer and mobilized thousands of troops to invade his tiny, impoverished homeland. </P>
<P> Born July 9, 1949 to wealthy merchant parents in the southern town of Jeremie, Cedras aimed early for a military career. His father was a supporter of brutal dictator Francois ''Papa Doc'' Duvalier and when Duvalier's son Jean-Claude took over as president in 1971, Cedras was one of the first cadets to enroll at the capital's newly opened military academy. </P>
<P> He graduated in the class of 1973 along with Biamby and Jean-Claude Duperval, who became his second in command at army headquarters. Shortly after graduation, Cedras married a hard-headed businesswoman described by those who know her as power-hungry. The couple has three children. </P>
<P> Cedras rose through the ranks until he was promoted to colonel in January 1989. </P>
<P> He is fluent in French and Spanish and speaks passable English, but refuses to speak English, saying the time it takes for his interpreter to translate questions allows him vital seconds to think. </P>
<P> Among journalists he is famous for indirect answers to even innocuous questions. </P>
<P> An avid volleyball player and scuba diver, Cedras often spends weekends at his gorgeous beachfront home just north of Port-au-Prince. Accompanying him during these interludes are other officers and a group of personal bodyguards. </P>
<P> ``The army is condemned to serve the people,'' Cedras said a few months before Aristide was elected. ``The victories we have to respect will not be the battles won by machineguns but by those who fight to make our society more humane.'' </P>
