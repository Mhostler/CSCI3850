<P>  Senate Minority Leader Thomas Daschle Friday denied charges he improperly interfered with a Forest Service inspection of a plane that later crashed, killing three doctors. </P>
<P> ``The senator did what he thought, and continues to believe, was right,'' the South Dakota Democrat's office said in a 31-page statement accompanied by supporting documents. ``Others may disagree, but the existence of disagreement is not a scandal or evidence of ethical misconduct.'' </P>
<P> The controversy arose after three government doctors died in the crash of a light plane on Feb. 24, 1994, in Minot, N.D. </P>
<P> ``The widows have raised questions about whether Mr. Daschle acted improperly to help B&L (the charter service operating the plane), whose owner, Murl Bellew, has been a longtime friend of Mr. and Mrs. Daschle,'' The New York Times reported Feb. 5. </P>
<P> Similar reports were carried on the CBS television program ''60 Minutes'' on Feb. 5. </P>
<P> Bellew's service was subject to inspection by both the Federal Aviation Administration and the Forest Service because it flew Forest Service employees. It repeatedly ran into trouble with the Forest Service in its inspections. </P>
<P> Starting in June 1992 Daschle tried to strip the Forest Service of authority to inspect planes, saying it duplicated FAA responsibility. </P>
<P> The widows of the pilots contend Daschle was actually trying to protect what was an unsafe charter service, The Times reported. </P>
<P> Daschle said The Times' reporting leaves the reader ``with the impression that, had the Forest Service not allegedly been blocked by Sen. Daschle from conducting appropriate inspections of B&L and its aircraft, the fatal flight would never have taken place.'' </P>
<P> Daschle said the flight in question was not a Forest Service flight and the plane had passed both Forest Service and FAA inspections. </P>
<P> He said an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board showed the crash was caused by pilot error and bad weather, not faulty equipment. </P>
<P> The charges also noted that Daschle's wife, Linda, is second in command at the FAA. </P>
