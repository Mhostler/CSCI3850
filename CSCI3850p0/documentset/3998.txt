<DATELINE>BONN, Germany (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Remorseful commentaries and sombre warnings set the tone Friday as Germany recalled its dark past on the 50th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz. </P>
<P> Commemorations at the death factory in southern Poland and in the nearby Polish city of Krakow received wide media coverage and most newspapers and television stations ran heart-wrenching pictures of the skeletal inmates who were still alive when the Soviet Army freed them on Jan. 27, 1945. </P>
<P> Auschwitz dominated newspaper commentaries. Editorials reflected on the horror of Nazi concentration camps and warned Germans never to allow racism to re-emerge. </P>
<P> Laying a wreath at a Jewish memorial in Berlin, a leading Catholic activist said Auschwitz stood for the lowest point in the long history of Christian-Jewish relations. </P>
<P> ``We Christians can never go back to the time before Auschwitz and we cannot get beyond it alone, but only together with the victims of Auschwitz,'' said Rita Waschbuesch, president of the Central Committee of German Catholics. </P>
<P> A justice official said Germany was still hunting for at least a dozen old Nazis to try them for wartime crimes but doubted whether any more spectacular trials would be held. </P>
<P> ``There may be a case here or there, but it won't be much,'' said Alfred Streim, a public prosecutor for wartime crimes. ``But as long as it is possible, we cannot give up.'' </P>
<P> Several newspapers recalled that a tiny minority of Germans deny that the Holocaust, in which six million Jews died, ever took place. </P>
<P> ``Apart from a few incorrigibles, Auschwitz has been burned into the historical consciousness of the Germans like a mark of Cain,'' the daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung commented. </P>
<P> Speaking to those who want to close the book on Auschwitz, the Berliner Zeitung warned: ``Nobody should feel that the commemoration of this day is a burden and nobody should be allowed to call for an end to remembering this. </P>
<P> ``This would be the beginning of the forgetting. And what would it be the start of?'' </P>
<P> Another Berlin newspaper, Der Tagesspiegel, linked the ideology behind Auschwitz with outbreaks of racism today. </P>
<P> ``Thinking that life has a different value according to which race, religion or background it comes from did not stop after Auschwitz. It marks the war in the Balkans as much as it determines the racist attacks in Germany.'' </P>
<P> A clear undertone of unease ran through reports of the dispute between the Polish organizers of the commemoration and Jewish groups who accused them of failing to stress the full extent of suffering and death their community endured. </P>
<P> About 90 percent of the 1.5 million victims in Auschwitz were Jews, many brought there from neighboring countries as part of Hitler's ``Final Solution'' to destroy European Jewry. </P>
<P> ``The dispute between Poles and Jewish organizations about the commemorations was so prominent that the actual occasion itself almost disappeared behind it,'' the daily Die Welt said. </P>
<P> ``It would be tragic if this is what the younger generation remembers as the message of Auschwitz.'' </P>
<P> A prominent literature critic said the abstract way German schools have taught pupils about the Holocaust might no longer mean much to young people who cannot imagine its horror. </P>
<P> ``Millions were gassed, but I can't get young people to understand millions,'' Walter Jens told Suedwestfunk radio. </P>
<P> ``I'll get the message across much better by talking (to pupils) about little Hansi Kohn who was deported.'' </P>
