<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The White House criticized incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich Thursday for signing a book contract worth more than $4 million, saying the deal raised serious ethical questions. </P>
<P> The charge followed a Washington Post report that Gingrich, who will assume the most powerful post in Congress in two weeks, will get a seven-figure advance from a New York publishing firm owned by Rupert Murdoch to write two books. </P>
<P> ``A $4 million advance for a member (of Congress) who is soon to be speaker raises questions,'' White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said at her final briefing before she returns to private life after two years on the hot seat as President Clinton's press secretary. </P>
<P> Myers prefaced her comments with a politically-charged wisecrack, telling reporters: ``I wish I knew that I didn't have to leave to cash in.'' </P>
<P> Asked if she was suggesting that media magnate Murdoch was buying influence with the advance, Myers replied: ``I'm not drawing any conclusions, but I do think there are a number of questions that need to be answered.'' </P>
<P> Clinton, in a brief appearance to bid a public farewell to Myers, brushed aside questions about the $4 million advance. But he said, referring to his former job as Arkansas governor: ``I made $36,000 a year for 12 years and was glad of it. I don't even know how to think in these terms.'' </P>
<P> The Post said Gingrich's book deal was similar to a publishing contract signed by former President Ronald Reagan after Reagan left office and that nearly all the money was for a tome on his conservative political vision. Gingrich, the administration's often controversial scourge, tentatively plans to call his book ``To a New America,'' the newspaper said. </P>
<P> Asked earlier Thursday what was wrong with the deal, Myers said: ``The size of the advance. The timing of the advance ... I think it's unprecedented in nature and raises very serious questions.'' </P>
<P> Gingrich's office dismissed the White House criticism. ``The Democrats seem to be suffering from book envy,'' Gingrich spokesman Tony Blankley said in a statement. </P>
<P> ``The public has read Al Gore's book, and now they are ready for something completely different. I would suggest that the Democrats join us in putting pen to paper, and may the best ideas win,'' he said. </P>
<P> Myers said Gore had received a $100,000 advance for his book and ``all the details of that were fully disclosed.'' </P>
<P> In addition, she said, Gore cleared the arrangement with the Senate Ethics Committee before accepting the book deal. </P>
<P> White House officials, saying books by political figures often do not earn back their advances, questioned why Gingrich could command more than $4 million. The officials, who asked not to be identified, also noted that Gingrich led a campaign that drove former Democratic House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas from office because of an ethically questionable book deal. </P>
