<P>  Much has been said about President Clinton's admission that he once smoked marijuana but didn't inhale, and Thursday he made clear to teen-agers where he stands on the subject. </P>
<P> ``A stupid thing to do,'' he told students at Framingham High School at an event where he signed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act that, among other things, addresses the problems of school violence and drug abuse. </P>
<P> Clinton cited a new survey that said ``in a modest but very clear way'' that drug use is going up again among young people in America. </P>
<P> ``More and more young people simply don't believe it's dangerous to use marijuana for example,'' Clinton said. ``Let me tell you something, every single scientific study that has been done in the last several years shows alarming increases in the toxicity and the danger of using marijuana, especially to young women and what might happen to their child-bearing capacity.'' </P>
<P> Clinton has been accused of being disingenuous for having stated during the 1992 presidential campaign that he once smoked marijuana as a Rhodes scholar at Oxford University but didn't inhale. </P>
<P> ``All illegal drugs are dangerous,'' he said Thursday. ``We have to drive down usage again. It's got to be not a good thing to do, not a cool thing to do. It is a stupid thing to do, as well as an illegal thing to do, and I want you to help bring it back down.'' </P>
