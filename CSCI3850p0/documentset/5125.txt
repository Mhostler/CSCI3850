<P>  A British court Thursday ordered the detention of a 29-year-old woman engineer from Lebanon in connection with last year's car bombing of the Israeli embassy in London. </P>
<P> Samar Alami, who is charged with conspiring with others to cause an explosion likely to endanger life, was ordered held in custody by magistrates until March 30 pending police enquiries. </P>
<P> Alami was arrested Wednesday with a second person, who was later released. </P>
<P> Fourteen people suffered minor injuries in the bomb attack on the embassy July 26. </P>
<P> Hours later, a second bomb exploded at an Israeli information center in north London, slightly injuring four people. </P>
