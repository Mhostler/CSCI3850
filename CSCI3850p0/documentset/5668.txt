<P>  While major league baseball players have returned to work, there may still be picket lines when spring training games begin Thursday. </P>
<P> Locked out major league umpires plan to picket selected spring training games unless a new collective bargaining agreement is reached with owners before then. </P>
<P> Richie Phillips, the head of the Major League Umpires Association, said the picket lines will not be formed to keep anyone out of the ballpark, but rather to provide information. </P>
<P> Owners have said the regular season will begin April 26 with replacement umpires unless an agreement can be reached. The umpires' collective bargaining agreement expired December 31 and management instituted a lockout January 1. </P>
<P> ``There's no progress in negotiations, and if there isn't a settlement, it is our plan to open with the umpires who worked the replacement spring-training games,'' National League President Leonard Coleman said. </P>
<P> Phillips has reduced his original request for a salary increase from 60 percent to 53 percent. The owners offered a 13 percent increase. </P>
<P> Umpires union official Jerry Crawford said the umpires were willing to work while negotiations continue. </P>
<P> If no agreement is reached, major league games would be played without its regular umpires for the first time since the 1984 playoffs, when the umpires staged a short strike over postseason compensation. </P>
