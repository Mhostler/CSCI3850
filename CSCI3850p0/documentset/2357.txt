<P>  Israel has issued orders to seal three homes belonging to the families of Palestinian gunmen who took part in the kidnapping of an Israeli soldier last month, police and a relative said Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``Officers came here and gave (my husband) a paper in Hebrew and he took it to the lawyer,'' Umm Walid, mother of one of the two guerrillas, told Israel Radio in Arabic. The houses are in Arab East Jerusalem. </P>
<P> A police spokesman said the families were given 48 hours to appeal the closure orders issued by the army. </P>
<P> ``If the appeals are rejected, or if the families choose not to appeal, the closures will be carried out by the army, but the police will secure the areas,'' said spokesman Eric Bar-Chen. </P>
<P> Three guerrillas from the Islamic resistance movement Hamas -- two from East Jerusalem and one from the Gaza Strip -- were killed during a failed Israeli commando operation to rescue Cpl. Nachshon Waxman. A fourth person from East Jerusalem was captured alive. </P>
<P> The army said the gunmen shot dead their bound captive when the troops burst into their West Bank hideout. </P>
<P> Israel, using laws inherited from British colonial rule some 50 years ago, regularly closes or destroys the homes of Palestinians suspected of carrying out lethal attacks against Israelis. </P>
<P> Last month the Israeli army sealed the West Bank house of a suicide bomber who killed 23 people on a Tel Aviv bus. His family has launched an appeal in the Israeli high court. </P>
