<DATELINE>TEHRAN, Iran (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Tehran's ambulance service had the easiest phone number in town, but had to give it up when 1-2-3 proved too alluring for children learning numbers. </P>
<P> Pre-school children practising arithmetic on telephone dials jammed the switchboard, Resalat newspaper said Thursday. </P>
<P> ``Three out of every five calls we used to receive were nuisance calls, and mostly by children,'' a veteran of the ambulance service told Reuters. </P>
<P> ``They have considerably reduced since the number was changed to 115 a couple of months ago.'' </P>
