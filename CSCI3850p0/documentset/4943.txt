<P>  The Yugoslav army has arrested three of its officers on charges of spying for Croatia, the official Tanjug news agency said Wednesday. </P>
<P> Tanjug named the three as Enver Cavkusic, a captain, and Zoltan Kovac and Benjamin Zuban, both lieutenants, and said they were being interrogated after their arrests Saturday. </P>
<P> Croatia fought a war for independence from Yugoslavia in 1991 against Serb rebels within its borders who were backed by the Yugoslav federal army. </P>
<P> Although relations between Belgrade and Zagreb have thawed, Yugoslavia, comprising Serbia and Montenegro, refuses to recognize Croatia until a deal is worked out to safeguard the rebel Serb minority who control a third of Croatia. </P>
