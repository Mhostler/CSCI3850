<P>  Israeli warplanes attacked a post of the pro-Iranian Hizbollah guerrilla group in south Lebanon Tuesday after its guerrillas wounded two Israeli-allied militiamen, security sources said. </P>
<P> They said at least one rocket was fired at a Hizbollah (Party of God) position on Mlita hill in Iqlim al-Toufah, a ridge 15 miles south of Beirut used by the group to launch attacks on Israel's occupation zone in the south. </P>
<P> There was no immediate word on casualties in the air strike, the first into Lebanon this year. </P>
<P> A Hizbollah spokesman in Beirut confirmed the air raid. </P>
<P> Earlier Tuesday, guerrillas attacked a series of posts of Israel's proxy South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia, wounding two militiamen, SLA sources said. </P>
<P> They said guerrillas fired mortar shells, rocket-propelled grenades and machineguns at eight SLA posts in the Jezzine area in a finger of territory jutting north of Israel's occupation zone in south Lebanon. </P>
<P> Hizbollah said in a statement its fighters at around midnight assaulted 11 Israeli army and SLA positions in the Jezzine area and in the border zone, inflicting several casualties. </P>
<P> In retaliation, Israeli and SLA artillerymen fired about 150 shells near Mashghara and Ain el-Tineh villages, prompting many villagers to flee to safer areas, the sources added. </P>
