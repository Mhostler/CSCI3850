<P> The Chargers threatened to make a game of it when they pulled back to 14-7 on a one-yard touchdown plunge by Natrone Means, capping a 13-play, 78-yard drive. </P>
<P> But the 49ers were having none of it as Young found fullback William Floyd for a five-yard touchdown pass, making them the first team to score on their first three possessions in Super Bowl history. </P>
<P> The biggest surprise of the game may have been that the Niners failed to score on their next possession. </P>
<P> ``The first time we didn't score, we came off the field disappointed,'' said veteran lineman Jesse Sapolu, who earned his fourth Super Bowl ring. </P>
<P> It turned out to be a momentary aberration. </P>
<P> The charged up 49ers defense stopped the Chargers cold and Young and company were soon back in business. </P>
<P> Young found Watters with a short swing pass and he turned the corner and raced eight yards untouched into the end zone to make it 28-7. </P>
<P> The Chargers were only able to answer with a 31-yard John Carney field goal after Mark Seay dropped a pass in the end zone and San Francisco took a 28-10 lead into halftime. </P>
<P> The second half was more of the same for the demoralized Chargers as San Francisco scored the first time they had the ball when Watters scampered nine yards for his third touchdown. </P>
<P> That 62-yard drive gave the 49ers a 35-10 lead and you could almost hear the sound of television sets turning off all across America. </P>
<P> Each team scored twice more, but for the Chargers it was too little and far too late. </P>
<P> Tight end Brent Jones, who also played on the last two 49ers' championship teams, said: ``We feel that we are the greatest team of all time.'' </P>
