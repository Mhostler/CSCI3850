<P>  Secretary of State Warren Christopher on Monday said the United States will join South Korea in supporting North Korean membership in Asian economic groups if Pyongyang fulfills a nuclear deal with Washington. </P>
<P> But he also warned that North Korea would never be fully welcomed into the ``community of civilized nations'' until it ended state-sponsorship of terrorism and the sale of destabilizing missiles to countries like Iran. </P>
<P> Christopher spoke to reporters on his U.S. Air Force jet en route to Seoul where he will hold talks Tuesday through Thursday with South Korean President Kim Young-sam and other officials. </P>
<P> The secretary praised Kim's decision, announced in a speech Monday, to lift a ban on business contacts with North Korea and give the green light for Pyongyang to establish economic links with the south and the rest of Asia. </P>
<P> ``This is a very significant step forward,'' he said, adding: ``It indicates that President Kim recognizes how the entering into this agreement makes it possible to make other progress with North Korea of a very significant kind.'' </P>
<P> Christopher referred to last month's deal between the United States and North Korea in which Pyongyang promised to dismantle its nuclear program in return for more than $4 billion in international aid for new nuclear technology and interim energy supplies. </P>
<P> The secretary said a major goal of his Seoul visit is to reaffirm the U.S. commitment to South Korea's security and the continued presence of 37,000 American troops in that country. </P>
<P> Kim, in a landmark change, said in his speech that South Korea would back any application by the economically devasted north to join the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC), the emerging key regional economic group. </P>
<P> Christopher said the South Koreans did not tell their U.S. allies in advance about the decision. </P>
<P> Despite support for Kim's APEC move, Christopher struck a cautious note, saying, ``This process will take time and patience, just as will implementation'' of the nuclear accord. </P>
<P> He also warned: ``North Korea will not become a full member of the community of nations ... until they deal with a number of problems, including support for terrorism ... and other problems like missile proliferation.'' </P>
<P> Christopher stressed that APEC has placed a three-year moratorium on new members as the forum, which holds a summit in Indonesia Nov. 14-16, lays ground rules for its future. </P>
<P> ``I would certainly share the views of President Kim that as this (nuclear) agreement between the United States and North Korea is implemented, as the North-South talks go forward, it would be entirely appropriate to consider North Korea for membership in APEC and other regional institutions,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``After all, one of the principle purposes of this agreement is to bring North Korea into the company of civilized nations and show them the ... economic opportunities ... that go with better relations.'' </P>
<P> Christopher refused to detail what steps the United States and North Korea may have taken to begin implementing their potentially sweeping nuclear accord. </P>
<P> He is due to give a speech in Seoul, and said this will be the vehicle to ``unveil some important implementation steps that will be taken in the near future.'' </P>
<P> Christopher assured reporters, however, that North Korea is ``moving on an implementation path. ... We don't have any apprehension at the present time that they're not moving forward. They seem to be taking this agreement and the need to implement it in the same serious way as we are.'' </P>
