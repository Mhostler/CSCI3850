<DATELINE>CAIRO, April 9 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  U.S. envoy Dennis Ross arrived in Egypt on Sunday to brief President Hosni Mubarak on results of his meetings with Syrian and Israeli leaders, officials said. </P>
<P> They said Ross, on a Middle East shuttle aiming to advance Israeli-Syrian talks on the Golan Heights, was expected to return to the United States after a short meeting with Mubarak. </P>
<P> A U.S. diplomat said Ross's stopover was ``a response to a request from the Egyptian government for readout of his talks in Israel and Syria.'' </P>
<P> He said Mubarak and Ross would meet at a presidential residence in the Suez Canal city of Ismailia, about 100-km (60 miles) east of Cairo. </P>
<P> Syria's ambassador to Cairo said on Friday Mubarak was expected to travel to Damascus to meet Syrian President Hafez al-Assad 'very soon'. </P>
<P> Diplomats said that while in Syria Ross discussed with the President expanding Syrian-Israeli negotiations to include military officials. </P>
<P> But after meeting Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin Ross said that further preparations were needed before talks could be held between military chiefs of the two countries. </P>
<P> After more than three years of sparring, negotiations between Syria and Israel have stalled over the Golan Heights, captured by Israel from Syria in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. </P>
<P> Damascus demands a full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan. Israel says it will not discuss the scope of a pullout before Syria agrees to establish full normal diplomatic relations. </P>
