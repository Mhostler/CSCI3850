<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  South African President Nelson Mandela Sunday met senior members of the African National Congress Women's League (ANCWL) who quit because of what they called bad leadership in the organization, which is headed by his estranged wife Winnie. </P>
<P> ``This is not a matter for me to speak on. I will be briefed by the women,'' Mandela told Reuters on his arrival for the unscheduled meeting. </P>
<P> Mandela's spokesman, Parks Mankahlana, said the meeting with the 25-member executive of the ANCWL was called at short notice. ``It was not on his program, it was unscheduled.'' </P>
<P> Eleven top members of the league of which Winnie Mandela is president resigned Saturday, citing bad leadership. </P>
<P> Among those who resigned were Adelaide Tambo, widow of ANC president Oliver Tambo who died in 1993, and South Africa's Health Minister, Nkosazana Zuma. </P>
<P> The 11 said they had decided to resign because of poor leadership, undemocratic decision-making and practices and the lack of accountability, but none specifically mentioned Mrs. Mandela. </P>
<P> But Tambo, who indicated she would resign Friday, said she had resigned over a joint tourism venture between the league and actor Omar Sharif, launched last Thursday by Mrs. Mandela, deputy minister of arts and culture in her estanged husband's ANC government of national unity. </P>
<P> Another executive member who resigned Saturday, Lindiwe Zulu, said the league would call an urgent conference. </P>
<P> ``We want to sort this problem out; we don't want division in the women's league,'' she told Reuters before the start of Sunday's meeting with President Mandela. </P>
<P> The women's league has considerable influence in the ANC, which swept to power in South Africa's all-race elections in April last year. </P>
<P> Mrs. Mandela was elected president of the women's league in May 1993 and her choice marked a dramatic political comeback after she resigned all political posts after being sentenced to five years' jail in 1991 on kidnapping charges. </P>
<P> On appeal, her sentence was reduced to a fine of $4,237. </P>
<P> Last week the Canadian government refused her an entry visa because of her criminal background, but said she could enter under another provision. </P>
