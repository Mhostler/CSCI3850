<P>  Cuba and the United States, which have no formal diplomatic relations, will begin a second round of talks in Havana later this month on the issue of migration. </P>
<P> Cuba's foreign ministry spokesman, Miguel Alfonso, said Thursday that ``the continuity of these contacts is of great importance.'' </P>
<P> The first round of talks in early September ended in an agreement that put a stop to the Cuban exodus on flimsy rafts and small boats in an effort to reach U.S. shores. </P>
<P> Washington had previously announced that the ``rafters'' would be intercepted at sea and sent to U.S. detention camps at the U.S. Naval Base in eastern Cuba or to an army base in Panama. </P>
<P> This move by the Clinton administration signalled an abrupt change of U.S. policy which for more than three decades gave safe haven to hundreds of thousands of Cubans who fled the island nation. </P>
<P> In the accord signed in New York last month the United States agreed to accept at least 20,000 Cuban immigrants a year. Under a previous migration accord signed in 1984, Washington agreed to take ``up to'' 20,000 Cuban immigrants. In effect, the number of visas issued never amounted to more than a few thousand each year. </P>
<P> Alfonso said that the thousands of Cuban rafters now being detained indefinitely at the U.SS Guantanamo Naval Base and at a U.S. military camp in Panama is essentially ``an American problem.'' He indicated that Cuba would be willing to discuss the matter if it was raised by the U.S. delegation at forthcoming talks. </P>
