<P>  President Clinton said Saturday that ''violent, extreme interests'' were blocking his efforts to pass health care reform covering all Americans. </P>
<P> Clinton, who flew here to help raise money for Michigan Democrats, spoke briefly about health care reform and the crime bill pending before Congress to a group who greeted him as Selfridge Air National Guard base. </P>
<P> He said it was time for Congress to vote on the crime bill and ``stop fooling around with it.'' </P>
<P> The bill authorizes more than $30 billion to hire up to 100,000 additional police, build prisons and fund crime prevention programs. </P>
<P> The bill, however, has been held up by opponents of a measure that would ban 19 types of assault weapons. Liberals especially black members, are balking because the bill does not allow appeals of death sentences if racial bias can be proven, a provision the House approved. </P>
<P> On health reform, Clinton said it was being caught up in partisan politics and complained bitterly about opponents to his plan. </P>
<P> ``It's the violent, extreme interests in this country that are trying to keep health care out of the reach of ordinary American working people are a disgrace to the American dream,'' Clinton told the crowd of about 300. </P>
<P> At the air base to greet Clinton was a Michigan woman whose husband was shot and died at a local hospital. He was uninsured and the small business owner's widow, Linda Roster Clark, was given medical bills totaling more than $24,000. </P>
<P> Clinton is pressing for health care benefits for all Americans financed mostly by requiring employers to pay part of their workers' health benefits. </P>
<P> The Senate is set to begin debating a health care reform bill next week that seeks to cover at least 95 percent of the population by turn of the century. The House is scheduled to take up its version of the bill, which would cover all Americans, on August 15. </P>
