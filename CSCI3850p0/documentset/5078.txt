<P>  A bill linking U.S. aid to Turkey to Ankara's human rights performance, including actions against Kurdish citizens, was introduced in Congress Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``The simple truth is that Turkey is run by a group of thugs who systematically abuse the human rights of its own citizens, and those of neighboring nations, as cruelly and viciously as the world's most tyrannical regimes,'' Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., said in introducing the bill in the Senate. </P>
<P> His legislation, announced as Turkey conducted major offensives against rebel Kurds in northern Iraq, states that before Turkey can receive any U.S. aid in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1 it would have to take action in several areas of human rights. </P>
<P> Turkey would have to allow international human rights monitors on Turkish soil, cease any military action toward its 15 million Kurdish citizens and recognize their rights and take steps toward withdrawing troops from Cyprus. </P>
<P> Turkey would also have to remove a blockade of U.S. and international assistance to Armenia, remove restrictions on Christian churches and schools and protect Christian clergy and property from acts of violence. </P>
<P> D'Amato said that under the bill, for every day Turkey failed to comply with these conditions $500,000 would be held from any U.S. grant or loan. The president could waive the restrictions by citing U.S. national security interests. </P>
<P> The current-year U.S. budget authorized $365 million in loans for Turkey. </P>
<P> A companion bill to D'Amato's was being introduced in the House by Rep. Robert Andrews, D-N.J. </P>
