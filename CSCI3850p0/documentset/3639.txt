<P>  Cowboys All-Pro running back Emmitt Smith aggravated a hamstring injury in Dallas's 35-9 victory over the Green Bay Packers Sunday and his status for next Sunday's NFC championship game is uncertain. </P>
<P> ``It's frustrating,'' Smith said after being sidelined for most of the National Football Conference divisional playoff game. ``I've just got to take it in stride. I'll have to treat the injury well.'' </P>
<P> Looking ahead to next week's long-awaited showdown with the San Francisco 49ers for a Super Bowl berth, Smith added, ``I feel good about coming back next week, hopefully.'' </P>
<P> Smith left the game in the first quarter and did not return. He had already rushed for 44 yards on seven carries and scored on a five-yard run before reinjuring his left hamstring. Blair Thomas replaced Smith and scored a pair of touchdowns. </P>
<P> Asked how the team was different without him, Smith said, ''We're the same team. There's no difference.'' </P>
<P> Smith, the NFL's leading rusher the previous three years and runner-up to Detroit's Barry Sanders this season, returned to full practice last Wednesday for the first time since pulling his hamstring against the New Orleans Saints on Dec. </P>
<P> He did not play in the Cowboys' final regular-season game against the New York Giants on Dec. 24, ending his games-played streak at 85. </P>
<P> Smith gained 1,484 rushing yards and scored a league-best 22 touchdowns this season. </P>
