<DATELINE>BOSTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A U.S. federal grand jury filed two new charges of racketeering and fraud against hockey czar Alan Eagleson, and U.S. prosecutors said they will now focus their efforts on having him extradited from Canada. </P>
<P> Eagleson is charged with using the U.S. mail service to defraud former National Hockey League players Andre Savard and Michael Gillis of the Boston Bruins out of disability payments, U.S. Attorney Donald Stern said in a release. </P>
<P> ``Today's superceding indictment brings to a close the grand jury investigation of R. Alan Eagleson,'' Stern said. ``The new charges further reflect an abuse of power and trust.'' </P>
<P> Eagleson headed the NHL's Players' Association (NHLPA) for 25 years until 1991. He also was the chief negotiator of Hockey Canada and headed international hockey events, including the Canada Cup tournaments, and was one of the most powerful individuals in the game. </P>
<P> Eagleson allegedly used the U.S. mail service to defraud Savard out of more than $100,000 he was entitled to after a knee injury ended his career in December 1984. Eagleson then billed Savard C$8,500 ($6,160) for ``professional services rendered'' even though he was obligated to supply those services as part of his job as NHLPA director, Stern said. </P>
<P> The former players' representative also allegedly used the U.S. mail service to cheat Gillis out of $41,250. </P>
<P> Eagleson allegedly misled Gillis into believing that a disability payment he claimed for a career-ending injury in September, 1984 was still contested, the Boston office of the U.S. Attorney said. Eagleson had Gillis sign a contract giving him 15 percent of the claim, then told billed him for $41,250 for allegedly negotiating a resolution to the claim. </P>
<P> ``This office and the FBI will now focus our efforts on submitting a formal extradition request to Canada to require Eagleson to come to the United States and face the serious charges which have been brought against him,'' Stern said. </P>
<P> The new charges are in addition to 32 charges of racketeering, fraud and embezzlement filed against Eagleson in March. </P>
<P> Eagleson, who lives in Toronto, has denied the charges and said he would seek an extradition hearing to obtain more specific information on the charges. </P>
<P> Eagleson's lawyer Brian Greenspan declined to comment on the new charges. ``I haven't even seen them,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``We're anxiously awaiting to review the material to determine the basis upon which any allegations are being advanced,'' he told Reuters from Toronto. </P>
