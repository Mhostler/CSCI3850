<DATELINE>TEHRAN, Iran (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A plane crash killed Iran's air force commander with four generals and seven other officers, delivering a severe blow to the Iranian military. </P>
<P> The plane carrying the commander, Brig. Gen. Mansour Sattari, and his senior aides crashed Thursday night when trying to land at Isfahan in central Iran after developing technical problems, Tehran Radio said Friday. </P>
<P> Armed Forces Chief of Staff Gen. Ali Shahbazi told the radio the officers had taken off in a Lockheed C-140 JetStar from Isfahan's Shahid Babaei air base for a destination he did not specify. </P>
<P> ``The plane developed a technical fault after a short while. They decided to land in Isfahan again. The plane crashed on the tarmac when landing,'' Shahbazi said. </P>
<P> All 12 passengers and crew were killed, he added. </P>
<P> ``This is a great loss to their co-fighters,'' Shahbazi said. </P>
<P> Asked about the cause of the crash, Shahbazi said an investigation was launched and he hoped results would be announced soon. </P>
<P> The plane was heading from Isfahan to Tehran, 200 miles to the north, according to Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati who was delivering a sermon at Tehran's Friday prayer meeting. </P>
<P> Iran's IRNA news agency named the four brigadier generals killed along with Sattari as: Chief of Air Force Staff Alireza Yassini, Deputy Commander for Operations Mostafa Ardestani, head of the engineering department Ahmad Shojaei, and head of the controller department Hassan Razzaqi. </P>
<P> The other victims were two colonels, a major, a captain and three lieutenants. Tehran Radio said a funeral was held in Isfahan Friday. </P>
<P> The incident is the second time since the 1979 Islamic revolution that Iran's air force chief and senior officers have died in a plane crash. </P>
<P> Sattari was appointed commander of the air force in January 1987 in the last stages of the eight-year Iran-Iraq war. </P>
<P> Then a colonel, Sattari was not a fighter pilot like his predecessors, but a radar expert commanding Iran's air defense systems. </P>
<P> He oversaw the overhaul of the air force after the end of the war with Iraq in 1988, when Iran acquired Russian-built MiG-29 and Sukhoi Su-24 fighter planes to boost its pre-1979 fleet of U.S.-built F-4, F-5 and F-14 aircraft. </P>
<P> The accident is the latest in a series of air crashes in the past two years involving civilian and military planes which have not been fully explained by Iranian authorities. </P>
