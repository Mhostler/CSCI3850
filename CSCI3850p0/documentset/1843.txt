<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek of Slovenia said Thursday progress has been made in settling a border dispute over the Istrian peninsula with Croatia, but that a full agreement has not yet been reached. </P>
<P> ``We negotiated this year with Croatia and I can say we made some progress, but a full agreement has not been reached. I expect a new round of negotiations next month,'' Drnovsek told Reuters in an interview. </P>
<P> The discussions with Croatia will also include financing of the jointly owned Krsko nuclear power plant, and deposits that were frozen by Ljubljanska Banka after both countries seceded from the former Yugoslavia in 1991. </P>
<P> ``These are three problems that we will discuss,'' said Drnovsek, referring to the border row, the nuclear power plant and the dispute on the bank obligations. </P>
<P> While resolution of these disputes will not be easy, Drnovsek said he is confident that an agreement will be reached with Croatia by year-end. </P>
<P> ``The financial problem and nuclear problem are technically complicated,'' Drnovsek said. </P>
<P> But he added, ``I am optimistic that in the forthcoming months we can complete these negotiations. My intention is to try to solve this by the end of the year.'' </P>
<P> Drnovsek also said he will be meeting with Italy's Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi in October to discuss a property dispute, which Slovenia claims had been solved with agreements between Italy and the former Yugoslovia. </P>
<P> Slovenia's Prime Minister denied a news report Wednesday from Belgrade that said the government had been involved in the selling of arms to Croatia and Bosnia-Herzogovinia. </P>
<P> Drnovsek said the Slovenian Government is against the selling of arms and has set up a special commission to investigate such matters. </P>
<P> ``We wanted to see if there was some traffic on the Slovenian territory and we decided to take further investigations to find out such things.'' </P>
<P> ``It was not the government but individuals trading arms with Bosnia and Croatia. So we are very decided we do not allow such things.'' </P>
<P> He said the Slovenian government is still awaiting the final reports on these investigations. </P>
