<P>  Republican Conrad Burns won Montana's Senate race, defeating Democrat Jack Mudd in a contest that symbolized the growing conflict in the West between environmental and business interests. </P>
<P> Burns, a former livestock auctioneer and farm news broadcaster, is a vocal opponent of new regulations on mining and ranching, and helped block a proposal to designate as wilderness 1.7 million acres of Montana land. </P>
<P> Mudd, a former law school professor, supported the Clinton administration's environmental reforms and gun-control legislation, which has been derided my many long-time residents of the Rocky Mountain region as a ``War on the West.'' </P>
<P> Despite strong oppostion in Montana to federal laws restricting logging, ranching and mining, the ranks of those favoring environmental reform has swelled in recent years with a surge of refugees into the state from urban centers around the country. </P>
<P> Burns was dogged by a remark he made during an informal talk with a newspaper editor on the campaign trail, that living with blacks in Washington, D.C., was a ``hell of a challenge.'' </P>
<P> Blacks account for just 0.3 percent of Montana's population, according to 1990 Census data. </P>
<P> Burns later apologized for the remark and defended his civil rights record. </P>
