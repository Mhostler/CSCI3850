<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Burma's military government Monday celebrated its 50th Armed Forces Day with the commander in chief calling for a strong army that can keep fighting to safeguard Burma's independence and sovereignty. </P>
<P> Gen. Than Shwe, who is also Burma's prime minister and chairman of the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), made the comments in an address to about 4,500 troops and guests in Rangoon's Resistance Park. </P>
<P> Thousands of people lined streets around the park from soon after dawn to watch a military parade and hang jasmine garlands around the necks of 3,300 singing soldiers, airmen and sailors as they marched past the golden Shwedagon Pagoda into the park. </P>
<P> ``Just as the Tatmadaw (army), in concert with the people, regained the nation's independence, it is also duty-bound to continue to preserve independence and sovereignty,'' Than Shwe said in a 40-minute speech under a blazing morning sun. </P>
<P> ``With the changing situation in the international arena today, it is essential to remain ever vigilant and safeguard independence and sovereignty. Therefore it has become necessary to build up the Tatmadaw to be modern and strong.'' </P>
<P> Burma's armed forces have in recent years been expanded to some 300,000 men, equipped with arms from China and elsewhere. </P>
<P> Speaking at the same spot as independence hero General Aung San did when he rallied the troops against a Japanese army of occupation 50 years ago, Than Shwe also said the army and the SLORC, formed in 1988, must play a key political role in Burma. </P>
<P> The SLORC, formed in 1988, gave Burma the name Myanmar following the brutal suppression of nationwide pro-democracy protests that left thousands dead or imprisoned. </P>
<P> Ironically, Burma's most prominent political prisoner is the daughter of independence martyr Aung San, Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. She lives under house arrest just a few miles from where Than Shwe spoke. </P>
