<DATELINE>INDIAN WELLS, Calif., (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Unranked Carlos Costa of Spain upset ninth-seeded Jim Courier 7-6 (8-6) 6-3 in 98 minutes in the second round of the $1,800,000 Newsweek Champions Cup Wednesday. </P>
<P> Sixth-seeded Michael Stich of Germany used his serve-and-volley game to rally from a set and a service break down in the second set and beat Richey Reneberg of the U.S. 1-6 7-6 (7-4) 6-3 in a second-round match at the hard court tournament. </P>
<P> Second-seeded Andre Agassi of the U.S. crushed former top-ranked player Mats Wilander of Sweden 6-2 6-0 in his second-round match at the 56-player tournament, where the top eight seeded players received first round byes. </P>
<P> Top-seed Pete Sampras of the United States who plays his first match on Thursday could lose the number-one ranking this week if Agassi wins the tournament and Sampras loses before the quarterfinals, according to ATP Tour officials. </P>
<P> Sixteenth-seeded Petr Korda of the Czech Republic was also upset by Thomas Enqvist of Sweden in a 6-2 7-5 baseline duel in the second round. </P>
<P> Courier, eleventh in the world, was playing his sixth match in seven days after winning the ATP Tour event in Scottsdale, Arizona, last Sunday, his second singles title in 16 months, and 34th-ranked Costa took advantage of that throughout the match. </P>
<P> The players again traded service breaks in the second set and then Costa scored the decisive break in the eighth game on two tired-looking backhand errors from Courier. </P>
<P> Courier, the former top-ranked player, admitted that he was fatigued but said that the loss was not as tough to take as it might have been. </P>
<P> ``Losing is never easy, but I'm at a stage right now where I feel like I can handle it,'' Courier said. ``I feel good about the way I am playing in general. I know that there are going to be bumps along the way and I think that I need some rest.'' </P>
<P> Stich, eighth in the world, struggled with his first serve throughout the first set and fell behind 1-4 in the second set against 46th-ranked Reneberg, but the German forced a second set tiebreak, which he won by keeping Reneberg pinned to the baseline with his strong service returns. </P>
<P> Reneberg's confidence seemed to deflate in the third set, as he groundstrokes began landing shorter, allowing Stich to constantly win points at the net. </P>
