<P>  U.S. and North Korean officials held seven hours of talks Thursday in a new round of high-level negotiations on reshaping Pyongyang's disputed nuclear program. </P>
<P> U.S. ambassador-at-large Robert Gallucci and North Korean First Deputy Foreign Minister Kang Sok-ju, heading the two delegations, met at Pyongyang's mission in Geneva in the morning and later resumed talks with the Americans as hosts. </P>
<P> A North Korean spokesman described the morning talks, which lasted three-and-a-half hours, as ``businesslike and serious,'' but gave no indication if the two sides had narrowed their outstanding differences. </P>
<P> A U.S. statement after the afternoon session, which also lasted three-and-a-half hours, said the two sides had had ``intensive discussions'' but did not elaborate. </P>
<P> It said technical experts of the two delegations would meet Friday -- leaving open the possibility that Gallucci and Kang might come together again at the weekend or postpone further encounters until next week. </P>
<P> The negotiations were suspended last Thursday after a week in which no signs of progress emerged, but the technical experts have been meeting in an attempt to close the gap. </P>
<P> The negotiators are trying to build on an outline accord reached in August under which Pyongyang agreed to freeze its graphite nuclear reactor program and switch to a safer, light-water version with international financing. </P>
<P> Asked if U.S. officials had put forward any new proposals to resolve outstanding differences, a North Korean spokesman said: ``Everything is on the table. We will engage in a very serious discussion.'' </P>
<P> U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry said Wednesday there was still ``significant disagreement'' between the two sides and diplomats held out little hope of a quick breakthrough. </P>
<P> The session was held a day after North Korea announced to the United Nations that Kim Jong-il, son of the late President Kim Il-sung, was the communist state's new supreme leader and supreme commander of its armed forces. </P>
<P> Gallucci, who returned to Geneva Wednesday after weekend consultations in Washington, said his delegation was prepared to make ``a very serious, energetic effort to resolve the issues that are outstanding.'' </P>
<P> Perry, speaking on PBS television, said one major stumbling block was Pyongyang's demand for Washington to provide extra funds to replace North Korea's graphite reactors with light-water technology. </P>
<P> The change is to be financed by an international consortium including the United States, Japan, South Korea, Germany and Russia. </P>
