<P>  Israel ordered four West Bank mosques shut for periods ranging from three to six months this week for ``inciting'' against Israel, the army said Wednesday. </P>
<P> It said the mosques, all in the area of the town of Ramallah, had received warnings they could be shut. Subsequent searches later uncovered material authorities considered ``inciting'' and the mosques were ordered closed. </P>
<P> Israel has cracked down on people it suspects of supporting militant Islamic groups in the occupied West Bank in the wake of bombings by Islamic guerrillas opposed to the Israel-PLO peace deal that have killed scores of Israelis since last April. </P>
