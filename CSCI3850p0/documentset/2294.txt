<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A niece of former Indian prime minister Rajiv Gandhi has accused her husband and wealthy father-in-law of abusing her because she did not bring enough dowry into the family, local newspapers said Saturday. </P>
<P> Radhika Tikkoo filed a police complaint in New Delhi against father-in-law Ravi Tikkoo, a British-based Indian shipping tycoon, and her husband, Vikram Tikkoo, alleging ``harassment and torture'' over dowry since their marriage in 1988, the newspapers said. </P>
<P> The Asian Age newspaper quoted Radhika as saying her husband often called her ``a fat bitch'' before their son. </P>
<P> Hundreds of Indian women, mostly from Hindu families, are burned by their husbands or their families every year over dowry. </P>
<P> Though dowries are outlawed in India, the practice flourishes. The government, yielding to pressure from women's groups over the growing incidence of ``bride-burning'' deaths, is considering tougher laws to end the dowry system. </P>
