<DATELINE>PALE, Bosnia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic told the United States Saturday that it risked ``another Vietnam'' by sending Marines to the Balkans. </P>
<P> The U.S. Defense Department said Friday it planned to deploy three amphibious vessels with Marines on board in the Adriatic sea because of the worsening situation in Bosnia, where Serb forces are attacking the northwestern Muslim town of Bihac, a U.N.-designated ``safe area.'' </P>
<P> Karadzic, criticizing the U.S. role in peacekeeping efforts in the Bosnian conflict, told a news conference in the Bosnian Serb capital Pale that the U.S. decision ``seems to me quite natural. The U.S. is involved already.'' </P>
<P> ``(They) send 2,000 Marines, then they have to send 10,000 more to save the 2,000 ... That's the best way to have another Vietnam,'' he added. </P>
<P> He said Bosnian Serb forces which have advanced into the Bihac safe zone did not want to capture it but to destroy the Bosnian government army 5th Corps which is defending it. </P>
<P> ``Bihac is not our objective,'' he said. ``Our objective is to neutralize the 5th Corps. One thing is for sure, we are not going to stop chasing them. We'll destroy the 5th Corps for good ... We are not going to give them room to breathe.''  The Serb assault on Bihac began as a counter-offensive to recover Serb territory in northwestern Bosnia lost to the 5th Corps last month. </P>
<P> The Serb advance has continued in spite of NATO air strikes against them and their commanders gave the Muslims an ultimatum to surrender by 8 p.m. (2 p.m. EST) Saturday. </P>
