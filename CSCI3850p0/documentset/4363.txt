<P>  The Israeli army sealed off the Hebron area Wednesday ahead of planned memorial ceremonies planned by ultranationalist Jewish settlers for the gunman who killed 29 Muslim worshippers in the Hebron mosque a year ago. </P>
<P> An army statement declared the entire area, including the Kiryat Arba Jewish settlement, a closed military area until just before midnight Thursday. </P>
<P> The statement added, however, that Arab and Jewish residents of the area in the occupied West Bank would be allowed entry, along with journalists. </P>
<P> The settlers vowed to honor gunman Baruch Goldstein, who was beaten to death by survivors of the Feb. 25, 1994 massacre, in ceremonies Thursday at Kiryat Arba where he is buried. </P>
<P> The Hebron area, always a flashpoint of Arab-Israeli violence, has been rocked by clashes since Tuesday, date of the massacre on the Muslim calendar. Israeli troops killed one Palestinian youth in clashes Tuesday. </P>
