<P>  Authorities called a general alert in Sarajevo and streets emptied Tuesday after mortar bomb explosions shook the old town area of the Bosnian capital. </P>
<P> Bosnian government soldiers said several mortar rounds fell close to a front line with Bosnian Serb forces. U.N. officials said two government soldiers were killed by a blast, thought to be from a rocket-propelled grenade. </P>
<P> A four-month cease-fire between the Muslim-led government and Bosnian Serbs expired Monday, prompting U.N. fears of a sharp rise in violence. </P>
<P> Sniping and shelling had already increased in Sarajevo as both sides increasingly disregarded the truce. The Serb-besieged city is technically protected from attack by a NATO- enforced U.N. ban on the use of heavy weaponry. </P>
<P> Both sides have flouted the ban and residents fear that shelling, previously mainly at night, will now erupted more frequently during the day, inflicting heavier casualties. </P>
<P> U.N. officials Tuesday described the city as tense after ``a noisy night'' with explosions on front-line areas near the Jewish cemetary. </P>
<P> Hospital sources said sniper fire injured three men, including two soldiers on duty, and one woman was killed. U.N. officials said a man and a women were injured by sniper fire on the Bosnian Serb side of the divided city. </P>
<P> Outside Sarajevo, U.N. spokesman reported shooting along northern confrontation lines in Bosnia but no indications of any offensives. ``Although tension is high, the level of military activity is relatively moderate,'' said Maj. Herve Gourmelon. </P>
