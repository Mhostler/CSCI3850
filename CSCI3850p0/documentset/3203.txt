<P>  The German manufacturer of Mercedes-Benz cars is considering buying the home where Margaret Mitchell wrote ``Gone WIth The Wind'' and restoring it before the 1996 Olympics, a newspaper reported Wednesday. </P>
<P> The home would be renovated and used to entertain guests of Daimler-Benz during the Olympics, according to the Atlanta Constitution. </P>
<P> Afterward, the company would give the house to either the city or the non-profit group trying to renovate it, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> Officials with Mercedes-Benz North America and the non-profit group, the Margaret Mictchell House, could not be reached for comment on the report Wednesday. </P>
<P> The plan was first proposed by the German-based newsletter Sport Intern in an issue released this week at the National Olympics Committee meeting in Atlanta. </P>
<P> ``The city's citizens will regard it as a likeable gesture if the Daimler managers push through a plan that has a great sentimental appeal,'' the newsletter reported. </P>
<P> Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell told the newspaper he was aware of the company's interest in renovating the old home. </P>
<P> ``I have heard they (Daimler-Benz) are considering sponsoring it, and we would be interested in their participation, but I don't know where they are in the process right now,'' Campbell said. </P>
<P> Mitchell lived in the modest two-story apartment home, which she nicknamed ``The Dump,'' in the 1930s while she was writing ''Gone With the Wind,'' her first and only novel. The home was damaged in an arson fire in September. </P>
