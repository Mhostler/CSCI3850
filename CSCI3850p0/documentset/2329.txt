<P>  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Monday he had ``considerable hopes'' that the Arab League would ease or even lift altogether its 47-year-old economic boycott of Israel at its next meeting. </P>
<P> Christopher, attending a Middle East and North African economic conference, told reporters that many Arab governments believed the boycott was inconsistent with their attendance at the conference where Israel is also represented. </P>
<P> Saudi Arabia and its five partners in the Gulf Cooperation Council said last month they would no longer enforce the boycott's so-called secondary and tertiary provisions that ban trade with firms doing business with Israel. </P>
<P> They also said, at a meeting in New York, that they would support the lifting of the primary boycott -- on direct trade with the Jewish state -- by the whole Arab League if this was proposed by a state bordering Israel. </P>
<P> ``I have considerable hopes that at the next meeting of the Arab League there will be a strong move to terminate the secondary and tertiary effects completely and perhaps even the boycott,'' Christopher said. </P>
<P> No date has been set for the next meeting of the Arab League's council of foreign ministers, but Christopher said it was expected early next year. He said it was possible there could be a special meeting to debate the issue. </P>
<P> ``More and more nations are indicating that they would support that (lifting the boycott) if it comes up,'' the secretary of state said. </P>
<P> ``I see a growing recognition that the primary boycott, as well as the secondary and teriary boycott, is really a relic of the past.'' </P>
<P> Up till now, Syria and its ally Lebanon have said they oppose lifting the boycott, once a major weapon in the Arab struggle against Israel, until there is a comprehensive Middle East peace settlement. Those two countries have yet to sign peace agreements with Israel. </P>
<P> At a news conference earlier, Christopher also said he was confident an Israeli and U.S.-backed proposal to create a regional development bank would be supported in the final communique of the Casablanca conference Tuesday. </P>
<P> Getting the green light for the bank, which would include both Israel and Arab states and would aim to fund manufacturing ventures by medium-sized businesses, has been a key U.S. aim at the three-day gathering. </P>
<P> Neverthless, in a speech to the conference, Saudi Arabian Commerce Minister Sulaiman al-Sulaim poured cold water on the project, calling it a waste of time and effort. </P>
<P> The failure of oil-rich Saudi Arabia to support the bank would remove a major potential source of funding, but U.S. officials have said the United States, Western Europe and Japan would also be asked to help capitalize it. </P>
<P> One U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, declined to specify the amount of capitalization needed but said it would be less than a widely mentioned figure of $10 billion. </P>
<P> Christopher, who appeared unaware of Sulaim's remarks, denied that Riyadh had taken a lukewarm attitude to the conference and said Saudi as well as other Gulf businessmen had been meeting Israeli government leaders in Casablanca. </P>
