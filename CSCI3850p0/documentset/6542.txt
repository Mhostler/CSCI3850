<P>  The U.S. Coast Guard Sunday intercepted a 30-foot powerboat headed for Florida in an apparent attempt to smuggle two dozen Cubans. </P>
<P> The vessel's passengers included the body of a 22-year-old dead woman, a Coast Guard spokesman said. </P>
<P> Two Florida men who were driving the boat and were described as Cuban-Americans were being questioned by U.S. Border Patrol officials, he said. </P>
<P> ``The woman's body, the two Florida men and the Florida- registered boat were taken into custody for investigation,'' said Coast Guard Petty Officer Dan Waldschmidt. </P>
<P> The 23 other Cubans, who included four children and eight women, were held aboard a Coast Guard ship in the Florida Straits late Sunday. The Immigration and Naturalization Service has not yet decided their fate, he said. </P>
<P> The group stands a good chance of being returned to Cuba within a few days under a new Clinton administration policy to send all Cuban rafters back to their communist-ruled homeland. The policy change ended more than three decades of granting political asylum to virtually all Cuban refugees who made it to Florida shores. </P>
<P> The new policy, which went into effect earlier this month, has been the target of daily protests in Miami's large Cuban-American community. </P>
<P> Protest organizers have called for a citywide work stoppage Tuesday to protest the Clinton policy, but it was unclear how many sympathetic employees would participate in the strike. The U.S. Justice Department has sent a team of community relations experts to Miami to mediate between protesters, local authorities and irate community groups. </P>
<P> In recent years as tens of thousands of Cubans have taken to the seas on inner tubes and small rafts, a growing number of exiles have begun hiring powerful boats to collect family members making the 90-mile journey. Those caught by the Coast Guard or other officials have been subject to modest fines and punishment. </P>
