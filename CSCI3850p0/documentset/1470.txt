<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The United States will begin sending a ``well-armed'' force of about 15,000 troops into Haiti on Monday to uphold an agreement ending that nation's military dictatorship, the Pentagon said Sunday. </P>
<P> ``Our entry plan is not based on trust. We are going in with a very large and well-armed force,'' Defense Secretary William Perry told reporters at the White House. </P>
<P> He said U.S. officials believed that the risk of sniping and other acts of violence against U.S. forces ``is minimized'' by the agreement between the Haitian military and a delegation headed by former President Jimmy Carter. </P>
<P> But Perry and Army General John Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that Washington was taking no chances. Several thousand troops will go in quickly by helicopter from U.S. warships offshore and in aircraft from Caribbean bases. </P>
<P> Shalikashvili said that the first U.S. troops would probably arrive in Haiti on Monday afternoon and would be under the command of Army Lieutenant-General Henry Shelton, commander of the 18th Airborne Corps at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. </P>
<P> The announcement that the troops would go in under a ''permissive'' atmosphere came after the United States had already begun an invasion by 61 C-130 planeloads of paratroopers. The troops were recalled to Pope Air Force Base, North Carolina, Sunday night after the agreement was reached. </P>
<P> Pentagon officials, who asked not to be identified, also said that helicopters loaded with troops had also taken off from the aircraft carrier America near Haiti and that AWACS radar planes were already airborne when the invasion was called off. </P>
<P> The officials added that the first U.S. ``democracy transition'' troops would probably land in Haiti on Monday in helicopters from the carriers America and Eisenhower and that the full force of 15,000 troops was expected to be in Haiti within a week. </P>
<P> Some troops are also expected to fly in from the U.S. Navy Base at Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico. </P>
<P> ``We want there to be a calm transition to democracy and the best way to do that is with a large force,'' said one official. </P>
<P> A U.S. armada of 20 warships and 6,000 Army, Marine and special forces troops had been standing by off Haiti awaiting orders from President Clinton to launch an invasion when a deal was struck by a U.S. delegation led by former President Jimmy Carter and Haitian military leaders. </P>
<P> Shalikashvili denied that the invasion was begun Sunday night to bring added pressure on Haitian Lieutenant-General Raoul Cedras as he negotiated with Carter. </P>
<P> ``This operation was scheduled to begin Sunday evening for a number of days now,'' said Shalikashvili. </P>
<P> ``I am absolutely convinced that it was being aware of the preparation of such an overwhelming force that caused him (Cedras) to blink,'' he said. </P>
<P> Shalikashvili said early Sunday in an appearance on the NBC television ``Meet the Press'' program that U.S. troops had been preparing for ``hit-and-run'' attacks by Haitians, especially in any invasion, that could cause American casualties. </P>
<P> ``In any operation of this size we have to be prepared for casualties,'' he added. ``We have to be prepared for hit-and-run situations. ... We have been preparing for it.'' </P>
<P> Among ships off Haiti are the Eisenhower with 2,000 Army troops from the 10th Mountain Division at Fort Drum, New York, and 50 attack and transport helicopters. </P>
<P> The America, carrying 2,000 troops from the 82nd Airborne Division and additional special forces troops and helicopters, is also in the fleet. </P>
<P> Off northern Haiti is the big U.S. helicopter assault ship Wasp, which is expected to send as many as 1,800 Marines into Haiti as part of a U.S.-led multinational force. </P>
