<P>  Japanese police investigating a religious cult over gas attacks in Tokyo have found tons of chemicals sufficient to make explosives including gunpowder, TNT and dynamite, the Asahi newspaper reported Tuesday. </P>
<P> They found glycerine, sulphur, sulphuric and nitric acids, toluene and other materials at facilities owned or rented by the Aum Shinri Kyo (Aum Supreme Truth) sect around Mt. Fuji, west of Tokyo, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> Police suspect the cult was involved in sarin nerve gas attacks on Tokyo commuters on March 20 that killed 12 people and injured more than 5,000. They have already found large quantities of dangerous chemicals at its facilities, including all the ingredients of sarin. </P>
<P> A police spokesman declined to comment on the Asahi report, which appeared in the paper's evening edition. Police have made few official comments during the investigation, although information seeps out to the media from police sources. </P>
<P> At the cult's headquarters in Fujinomiya, police discovered about five tons of sulphur and four tons of potassium nitrate, the paper said. Ground up finely and mixed with charcoal, these can easily be made into black gunpowder, used to fire bullets from guns. </P>
<P> If these ingredients were used carefully, about six tonnes of gunpowder could be made -- equivalent to two percent of the amount produced annually in Japan, and enough for 20,000 bullets for small guns, or 3,000 for guns with a four-inch projectile, the report said. </P>
<P> Police also found evidence the cult was capable of making dynamite, the Asahi said. </P>
<P> In a warehouse in Fujinomiya they found about 11,000 gallons of glycerine. They arrested a senior Aum member, who is president of two sect-affiliated chemical companies, on charges of storing it without a licence. </P>
<P> At a warehouse in Kofu they found nitric acid and sulphuric acids, and at another in Fujinomiya they found paper pulp. Pulp and nitric and sulphuric acids can react to make nitrocellulose. Mixed with nitroglycerine, made from glycerine, they can make dynamite. </P>
<P> Police also found toluene in Fujinomiya. Reacted with sulphuric and nitric acids, this can be made into TNT, used throughout the world to produce bullets, bombs and land mines. </P>
