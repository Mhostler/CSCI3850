<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH, Pa (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The remains of victims of USAir flight 427 will be released to family members beginning Monday, but as many as 40 percent of those who died may never be identified, authorities said. </P>
<P> ``This is the first day we will be releasing the victim remains to families,'' Beaver County coroner Wayne Tatalovich told Reuters. </P>
<P> Tatalovich is supervising the process of identifying and preparing the remains of the 132 people who died in the September 8 crash outside Pittsburgh of a USAir Boeing 737-300, which killed all on board. </P>
<P> Tatalovich, who is working out of a makeshift morgue at an Air Force Reserve hangar at the old Pittsburgh airport, declined to say how many remains would be released Monday or how long the process would take. </P>
<P> The severe impact of the crash has hampered the process of identifying many victims. </P>
<P> ``There will be some that will not be able to be identified. We expect to identify at least 60 percent of the victims,'' Tatalovich said. </P>
<P> He said remains of in-state victims would be transported by hearse, while those from out of state would be flown home. </P>
<P> Denise Varisco, wife of crash victim Bernie Varisco, of Tarentum, Pennsylvania, said she was awaiting the release of her husband's remains, but so far had heard nothing from the coroner. </P>
<P> ``It would be nice to be able to go through the (funeral) service. It would make it easier for us,'' she said. </P>
