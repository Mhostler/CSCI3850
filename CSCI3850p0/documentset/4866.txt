<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Western allies and Croatia have agreed to a tentative deal that would allow a sharply reduced contingent of U.N. peacekeepers to remain in the country, The New York Times reported. </P>
<P> The newspaper said in its Sunday editions that Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, who earlier threatened to deny the 12,000 U.N. troops an extension of their mandate when it expired March 31, had agreed to allow a replacement U.N. contingent of 5,000 to 6,000 soldiers. </P>
<P> About 10 percent of this force will guard border crossings into Bosnia and Serbia, the paper said, quoting administration sources. </P>
<P> The officlals said they hoped Tudjman would announce his decision Sunday when he meets Vice President Al Gore in Copenhagen, where both are attending a U.N. conference on social development. </P>
<P> But the officials said the agreement could still collapse over details, the Times said. </P>
<P> ``It's fair to say Tudjman will announce on Sunday that the peacekeepers can stay, but in dealing with the Balkans you always worry that things can still go wrong,'' the newspaper quoted a senior American diplomat as saying. </P>
<P> The U.N. peacekeeping force was put in place to separate Croatian government soldiers and rebel Serbs in early 1992 after six months of war in which 10,000 people were killed. </P>
<P> But Tudjman complained the peacekeepers failed to disarm secessionist Serbs and in effect consolidated the Serbs' control over 30 percent of Croatia. </P>
<P> The U.S. and several Western allies have warned Tudjman that Croatia's call to expel the U.N. peacekeepers could set off a new war in Croatia and worsen the war in Bosnia, where Bosnian Serbs are allied with those in Croatia. </P>
<P> Diplomats fear the situation could spiral out of control, that the war could spread to Macedonia and to the predominantly Muslim region of Kosovo in Serbia, the paper said. </P>
<P> The Times said the tentative deal, pushed by the United States and Germany, would keep most of the remaining U.N. troops along a 1,000 mile cease-fire line that separates Croatian troops and Serbs in Croatia. </P>
<P> Tudjman demanded, the paper said, that more than 500 peacekeepers would be stationed at two dozen border crossings along the Sava and Danube Rivers that connect Croatia with Serbia and Bosnia. </P>
<P> The newspaper said Tudjman seemed to have changed his mind about a U.N. withdrawal after intense diplomacy this week from Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke, who visited Zagreb Monday and had two meetings with Tudjman. </P>
<P> The United States had been concerned that a U.N. withdrawal from Croatia would cut off supply lines to the 23,000 U.N. peacekeepers in Bosnia and ultimately force their withdrawal, the paper said. </P>
<P> ``Tudjman is very eager to have his country integrated into the West,'' an American diplomat told the Times. ``We were sending signals that we would help him do this, but that this wouldn't be possible if he took a dangerous step that we were trying to avoid.'' </P>
