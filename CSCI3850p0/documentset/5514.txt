<P>  South Korea said Thursday it would press for ``swift and effective'' sanctions against the communist North if Pyongyang made good a threat to scupper a deal with Washington to freeze its nuclear program. </P>
<P> ``If North Korea...did break a nuclear freeze by refuelling a five-megawatt reactor, we will push for swift and effective sanctions...after consultations with our allies and the International Atomic Engergy Agency (IAEA),'' South Korean Foreign Minister Gong Ro-myung told parliament. </P>
<P> IAEA Secretary-General Hans Blix arrived in South Korea Thursday to attend a symposium and to hold talks on the North Korean issue with President Kim Young-sam and senior officials. </P>
<P> Under a $4.5 billion pact agreed to last October in Geneva, the United States promised to arrange the supply of less threatening light-water reactors to replace North Korea's existing graphite-moderated type. The deal also provides for alternative energy supplies. </P>
<P> Gong said U.S. and North Korean experts would meet next Wednesday or Thursday in Berlin to resume discussions to try to settle a dispute over the type of light-water nuclear plant. </P>
<P> Gong reaffirmed Seoul's position that it would not provide any financing for the nuclear deal if Pyongyang continued to resist U.S. demands that it accept two South Korean reactors. </P>
<P> Last month, the two sides ended fruitless talks ahead of schedule. They have set April 21 as the target date for the signing of the contract on the provision of the plant. </P>
