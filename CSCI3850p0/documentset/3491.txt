<DATELINE>BROOKSVILLE, Fla.(Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Members of downed U.S. Army helicopter pilot Bobby Hall's family wept and hugged one another Thursday night after learning that he was out of North Korean hands and safely back in South Korea. </P>
<P> The family had no immediate statement, but Pentagon spokesman Harvey Perritt met with family members earlier to discuss the options for reuniting Donna Hall with her husband. </P>
<P> In the pilot's hometown of Brooksville, Fla., Perritt met with Mrs. Hall, and reported plans were to take Hall from the Korean truce village of Panmunjom to the 121st Medical Evacuation Hospital in Seoul for a checkup. </P>
<P> Hall will then be flown to MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, where he could receive any follow-up medical treatment needed. Brooksville is about 40 miles north of Tampa. </P>
<P> Donna Hall, meanwhile, was believed to be considering flying to meet her husband at some intermediate point such as Travis Air Force Base near San Francisco. </P>
<P> The oak trees along the narrow brick streets of Brooksville, columns on the county courthouse and the town's water tower have been festooned with yellow ribbons for the last 12 days as the community showed their support for the Hall family. </P>
<P> Donna and Bobby Hall's parents have remained secluded at the couple's home for almost two weeks, surrounded by television station vehicles. </P>
<P> According to Washington, Chief Warrant Officer Hall was on a routine training flight Dec. 17th when his U.S. Army Kiowa helicopter strayed across the demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea and crashed. </P>
<P> The North Korean government maintains the helicopter was shot down while on a spying mission. Hall's co-pilot, Chief Warrant Ofifcer David Hilemon, was killed in the incident. </P>
