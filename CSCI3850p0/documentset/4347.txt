<P>  The struggling Miami Heat Tuesday fired head coach Kevin Loughery and replaced him with assistant coach Alvin Gentry, one day after a change in team ownership. </P>
<P> The team said that Loughery has been offered the job of vice president of player personnel but has not decided if he will accept the position. </P>
<P> The firing comes a day after the NBA Board of Governors approved an agreement by which the Arison family purchased all of the remaining interest in the team from minority owners Billy Cunningham and Lewis Schaffel. </P>
<P> The Heat are currently in fifth place in the Atlantic Division with a 17-29 record. They have made the playoffs in two of the last three seasons and are currently two games out of the final berth in the Eastern Conference. </P>
<P> Loughery, who was in his fourth season with the Heat, had compiled a 133-159 record with the expansion team and guided it to playoff appearances in 1992 and 1994. </P>
<P> Loughery was in his 20th season as a head coach. He coached the New York Nets in the old American Basketball Association (ABA) and Philadelphia, the New Jersey Nets, Atlanta, Chicago and Washington in the NBA. </P>
<P> The 39-year-old Gentry, who will coach his first game Tuesday night against the Milwaukee Bucks, has been a Miami assistant for 3 3/8 seasons. He joined the Heat after two seasons as an assistant for Larry Brown in San Antonio and one with the Los Angeles Clippers under Mike Schuler. </P>
