<P>  Laura Tyson's ascendancy to take over President Clinton's National Economic Council immediately made her one of the most influential women in the Clinton White House. </P>
<P> The move puts her in charge of overall coordination of Clinton's economic policies, meaning she must mesh the activities of the Treasury Department, Office of Management and Budget, Commerce and Labor departments and the Council of Economic Advisers. </P>
<P> She joins Hillary Rodham Clinton and White House budget director Alice Rivlin as powerful female voices in Clinton's inner circle. </P>
<P> ``I'm honored and I have to admit, a little unnerved by President Clinton's faith in my ability to take on the task of managing this economic team,'' Tyson said in her announcement ceremony with the president. </P>
<P> The 47-year-old mother of one son -- and wife to a Hollywood screenwriter, Eric Tarloff -- had been chair of the president's Council of Economic Advisers for two years prior to Tuesday's appointment. </P>
<P> The council analyzes economic trends and tries to predict how the economy will perform in the future. </P>
<P> In that job, Tyson held back from criticizing the independent Federal Reserve over a series of interest rate increases that threatened the U.S. economic boom. Past administrations have been less circumspect, but she once noted that their complaints were often counterproductive. </P>
<P> Comfortable with the arcane language of economists, Tyson can often confuse the less-than-expert, but her analyses of U.S. economic preformance nonetheless have proved to be extremely accurate. </P>
<P> Tyson becomes the first woman to head the National Economic Council, which has been a new office in the Clinton White House. The only person to have the job was her predecessor, Robert Rubin, who recently replaced Lloyd Bentsen as Treasury secretary. </P>
<P> Rubin handled the job in low-key fashion to avoid turf battles, and Tyson made clear she would do the same by modeling herself after Rubin. </P>
<P> Clinton praised Tyson for ``an exceptionally analytic mind'' and her understanding of underlying global economic and political realities. </P>
<P> ``She has been a very credible voice for us on the economy and I have appreciated especially her unfailingly frank, direct and principled advice,'' Clinton said. </P>
