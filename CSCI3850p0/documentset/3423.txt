<P> The four hijackers, whose leader has been identified as Abdul Abdallah Yahia of the Armed Islamic Group (GIA), seized the Air France Airbus 300 destined for Paris's Orly Airport at Saturday morning. </P>
<P> The GIA is Algeria's most violent and radical fundamentalist group, and two passengers were killed in the bold Christmas Eve attack. </P>
<P> France Info said the hijackers demanded the release of Abassi Madani and Ali Belhadj, the two top leaders of the outlawed Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), a more moderate fundamentalist group. </P>
<P> Madani and Belhadj are being held by Algerian authorities under house arrest after being released earlier this year from Blida prison where they were serving 12-year sentences for activities against the state. </P>
