<DATELINE>PHNOM PENH (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Cambodia's outlawed Khmer Rouge rebels have demanded $1 million from Australia, France and the United States as compensation for damage by Cambodian government forces to a guerrilla base where three Western hostages are being held. </P>
<P> The demand was enclosed in a handwritten letter dated August 7 and given to an employee of Indochine Television productions who gained entry to the rebel commune Sunday. </P>
<P> Referring to the Khmer Rouge base at Vine Mountain (Phnom Vor), about 93 miles south of Phnom Penh, the letter signed by ``Commander Brin'' said government forces had engaged in a series of recent air and ground assaults against the base that killed and wounded a number of people. </P>
<P> Some of these attacks, it said, had occurred during recent roundtable discussions in Pyongyang, North Korea, and Phnom Penh between the various parties in the Cambodian conflict. </P>
<P> ``This resulted from the alliance between the U.S, France and Australia and they have to take full responsibility and pay a fine of one million U.SS dollars,'' the letter said. </P>
<P> Meanwhile negotiations have continued to free the three men taken hostage during a Khmer Rouge train ambush on July 26 -- Mark Slater, 28, from Corby in Northamptonshire, Britain; Jean-Michel Braquet, 28, from Nice, France; and David Wilson, 29, from Melbourne, Australia. </P>
<P> They are part of a group of 17 hostages being held by the Maoist-inspired rebels, including three ethnic Vietnamese and 11 Cambodians. </P>
<P> A Cambodian captive who was released from the camp last week said Sunday that conditions for the three Westerners and Vietnamese were harsh, with the three being shackled and made to undergo forced labor. </P>
<P> Sok Pholy, 23, who was released on August 2, said one of the hostages, David Wilson, had asked him to appeal to the Australian government for help to secure their freedom. </P>
<P> The Khmer Rouge fastened ankle shackles on their hostages at night to prevent any escape attempt, he said. </P>
<P> However, a senior western diplomatic source Monday said the trio were in good health and not ill. </P>
<P> ``The simple fact of the matter is that at the weekend (Saturday) none of them were sick,'' he said, asking not to be named. </P>
<P> The three men were also no longer working in swampy paddies, the diplomat said. </P>
<P> Citing information given by the Khmer Rouge to an official government mediator just returned from the base, the diplomat said a parcel of food, medicine and writing material had been received by the captives. </P>
<P> Asked to comment on the morale of the three, the diplomat replied: ``They appear to be angry and frustrated at being caught in a situation they have little understanding about. Their abduction was totally by chance.'' </P>
<P> British, French and Australian embassy, police, military and consular officials were closely ``coordinating efforts'' to free the hostages, he said. </P>
<P> Two detectives from Britain's Scotland Yard departed Phnom Penh earlier this morning for Kampot, the hostage coordination center for the three embassies. </P>
<P> In a further development, a senior government official said Monday that Khmer Rouge guerrillas and corrupt local officials had conspired to ambush trains in the area where the guerrilla camp is located. </P>
<P> ``The train holdups have been the result of an illegal conspiracy between certain officials at Kompong Trach and the Khmer Rouge under which they have connived to stage the holdups and share freight and other property stolen,'' Tourism minister Veng Seryvuth said in a statement. </P>
<P> ``We are now taking the steps necessary to ensure this type of incident does not happen again. We are also in the process of substantially reinforcing our troops in the area,'' he added. </P>
