<DATELINE>SENDAFA, Ethiopia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Millions of Ethiopians voted in their first multi-party general election Sunday, with an opposition boycott almost certainly ensuring a landslide victory for their former guerrilla ruling coalition. </P>
<P> The stream of voters swelled throughout the day from a first trickle strolling up the capital's mist-shrouded hills at dawn past joggers and churchgoers. Officials reported no violence. </P>
<P> In rural areas illiterate voters came by foot, car and on horseback to polling stations flying the green, yellow and red national flag and guarded by police to tick off their choices. </P>
<P> The Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) led by President Meles Zenawi ended four years of transitional rule with the polls to divide one of Africa's oldest empires into a federation of nine new ethnic states. </P>
<P> Most opposition parties boycotted the election, making an EPRDF victory almost inevitable across Ethiopia, twice the land size of France with 55 million people from 80 ethnic groups. </P>
<P> Western diplomats among more than 280 foreign monitors said polling in Addis Ababa appeared to go smoothly and noted the EPRDF had even greater support in most of the countryside. </P>
<P> Officials at three randomly-chosen centers some 25 miles north of the capital reported turnouts of between 60 and 75 percent of registered voters hours before most polls closed. </P>
<P> ``It's possible 90 percent will have voted if there were no problems,'' said Samson Gethaun, spokesman for the National Electoral Board, adding results would be announced in two weeks. </P>
<P> Gethaun said voting was ``fine'' compared to the size of the operation with a total of 49,000 polling stations but ``procedural technicalities'' such as ballot papers not being first signed by officials had surfaced throughout the day. </P>
<P> Voting was postponed in three of the nine new regions until May 27 because of what officials said were logistical problems. </P>
<P> The electoral board said 2,832 candidates including more than 900 independents stood for a 548-seat national parliament and regional councils. The EPRDF took 89 percent of the seats in a constituent assembly which was elected in June last year. </P>
<P> Boycotting opposition parties dismissed Sunday's election as a farce to put the EPRDF, dominated by the northern Tigrayan minority, back in power and complained they were never free to campaign and activists had been detained by the authorities. </P>
<P> The EPRDF seized power in 1991, ending 17 years of brutal, centralised Marxist rule under dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam. </P>
