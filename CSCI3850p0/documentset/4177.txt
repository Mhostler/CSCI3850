<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Puerto Rican ``Dream Team'' of major leaguers exploded for 17 hits with five runs in the fifth inning and six in the sixth to rout the defending champion Dominican Republic 16-0 Monday. </P>
<P> Roberto Alomar had five hits and three runs batted in, Edgar Martinez three hits and five RBI, and Carmelo Martinez a solo homer and three RBI. </P>
<P> Carmelo Martinez, a 37-year-old first baseman, now has 11 Caribbean Series home runs, tying the record previously held by Tony Armas of Venezuela. </P>
<P> Martinez, a major league veteran who played in the Mexican League last year but whose rights are owned by the Houston Astros, said: ``I just want to keep playing. Yes, the record means an awful lot to me.'' </P>
<P> The result gave Puerto Rico a perfect 3-0 record, and dropped the Dominican Republic to 2-1. In an earlier game, Venezuela defeated Mexico 3-0, leaving Venezuela with a 1-2 record and Mexico still without a win at 0-3. </P>
<P> The Puerto Rican position players all have major league experience. </P>
<P> The outfield consists of Juan Gonzalez of the Texas Rangers in left, Bernie Williams of the New York Yankees in center and Ruben Sierra of the Oakland A's in right. </P>
<P> Chicago Cubs shortstop Rey Sanchez, the Puerto Rican batting champion, is joined by Cleveland Indians second baseman Carlos Baerga, bumped to third by Alomar, the Toronto Blue Jays' second baseman. </P>
<P> Catching is Toronto up-and-comer Carlos Delgado. </P>
<P> The winner for Puerto Rico was right hander Doug Brocail, who wsa added to the roster of the Puerto Rican champion San Juan Senators after he logged a 7-1 record for Mayaguez in the Puerto Rican playoffs. Brocail allowed only three hits through seven innings. </P>
<P> The loser was Montreal Expos right hander Pedro Martinez, who gave up three runs on four hits in four innings. </P>
<P> Carmelo Martinez slammed a third-inning homer off Pedro Martinez to get Puerto Rico on the board. Alomar singled, stole second and scored on an RBI single by Edgar Martinez. </P>
<P> ``Carmelo Martinez's home run got us going,'' Sierra said. </P>
<P> ``We have a packed lineup of hitters who were trying to hit everything into the bay in the first two games. We got a couple of lucky hits and it all fell into place. If you gave us the Dominican pitching and our hitting, we could challenge for a major league pennant.'' </P>
<P> In the fourth, Carmelo Martinez drove home a second run with a sacrifice fly to make it 3-0. </P>
<P> Then in the fifth, against Alberto Reyes, Puerto Rico exploded with six hits and five runs. Alomar, Delgado and Gonzalez all had RBI singles and Sierra drove in two runs with a base hit. Eleven men batted in the inning. </P>
<P> It got worse in the sixth as Puerto Rico sent ten men to the plate, with six of them scoring. Carmelo Martinez and Sanchez both walked with the bases loaded, forcing in runs. Alomar singled home another run and Edgar Martinez drove in three with a bases clearing triple. </P>
<P> Puerto Rico added two more runs in the eighth on RBI base hits by Alomar and Edgar Martinez. </P>
<P> Said Edgar Martinez: ``Well I had two bad games before this. I guess I got it done today. It was important and I focused.'' </P>
<P> The two teams play again Thursday. </P>
<P> Dominican Republic - P. Martinez, Reyes (5), C. Perez (5), DeLeon (6), Y.PPerez (7) Castillo (8) and Mercedes, Brito (8). </P>
