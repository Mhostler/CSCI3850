<P>  Mexico is prepared to take in Cuban citizens who wish to leave their island nation if they have family members already in Mexico ready to support them, the foreign ministry said Thursday. </P>
<P> ``The necessary measures have been taken to document via the Mexican embassy in Havana those people who can show they have family members in Mexico who are prepared to take financial responsibility for their stay in Mexico,'' the ministry said in a statement. </P>
<P> Mexico took its decision in order to ``contribute to the smallest number possible of Cubans risking their lives by leaving in an irregular manner by sea,'' the statement said. </P>
<P> It was not immediately clear how many Cubans would be able to take advantage of the offer. </P>
<P> President Clinton recently reversed the long-standing U.S. policy of accepting Cuban refugees in a bid to stem the flow of Cubans leaving in small fishing boats and leaky rafts made of inner tubes and plywood, for the United States. </P>
<P> Mexico is the only Latin American nation not to break off diplomatic relations with Cuba 30 years ago after Communist leader Fidel Castro came to power and the United States imposed a trade embargo. </P>
<P> It said in the statement it was in favor of dialogue between the Clinton and Castro governments. </P>
<P> ``Mexico reiterates its offer to the government of Cuba and the United States, as far as it can, to help dialogue to reduce tensions and reestablish normality in relations between Cuba and the United States,'' the statement said. </P>
<P> The United States Thursday rejected Cuba's call for talks, blasted Castro as the leader of a failed regime and pleaded with Cubans to stop their largest sea-borne exodus in 14 years. </P>
