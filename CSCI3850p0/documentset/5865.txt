<P>  Mexico's government and Maya Indian guerrillas return to the negotiating table for the first time in more than a year Thursday to thrash out a peace deal easing the country's political and economic woes. </P>
<P> Masked rebel leaders of the Zapatista National Liberation Army were to be escorted by the International Red Cross from their jungle bases to this impoverished highlands town late Wednesday with formal negotiations starting Thursday morning. </P>
<P> Mediators said the first round of talks will focus on measures to reduce tensions in the southern state of Chiapas, where the Zapatistas took up arms on New Year's Day 1994, and set the formal agenda for the peace process. </P>
<P> The government late Tuesday ordered an army post at San Andres Larrainzar, one of the 40 poorest communities in the country and a Zapatista stronghold, to be pulled back several miles in a conciliatory gesture to the rebels. </P>
<P> President Ernesto Zedillo hopes the talks will help his young government restore some stability to Mexico after 16 months of uninterrupted political turmoil and, more recently, a deep economic crisis. </P>
<P> ``We are entirely disposed to talk and reach agreements,'' Marco Antonio Bernal, the head of the government team, told reporters in Mexico City before heading to Chiapas. </P>
<P> Zedillo's negotiating position is now far stronger than at any time since taking office last December, thanks to a military offensive two months ago which drove the Zapatistas deep into the Lacandon jungle and saw army troops seize control of rebel-held villages across the conflict zone. </P>
<P> On the other side, rebel leaders aim to push their demands for democratic reforms at a national level, a string of judicial and land reforms inside Chiapas and greater autonomy for Mexico's indigenous groups. </P>
<P> The vast majority of Zapatista rebels are poor Maya Indian peasants but they are led by the light-skinned Subcommander Marcos. It was not clear if Marcos would attend the talks. </P>
<P> At the last round of peace talks in March 1994, the Zapatistas were offered judicial reforms, wider autonomy and massive investment in Chiapas' indigenous communities but later rejected the deal as insufficient. </P>
<P> Most analysts believe the rebels are too weak to force the government into discussing democratic reforms with them. </P>
<P> At least 150 people were killed in the first days of the uprising but there has been little fighting since then. </P>
