<DATELINE>ISRAEL-JORDAN BORDER (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Jordanian and Israeli negotiators met for a second day Tuesday at a gap in their desert border after reporting progress toward peace in their first round of historic talks on home territory. </P>
<P> ``With God's help we will continue to progress,'' chief Israeli negotiator Eliakim Rubinstein told reporters outside the tent straddling the cease-fire line between the two countries still officially at war. </P>
<P> Rubinstein and Jordanian delegation head Fayez al-Tarawneh revealed few details after the initial day, indicating that hard bargaining lay ahead over Jordan's demands for the return of occupied land and a better share of scarce water supplies. </P>
<P> But both sides have said their goal was the signing of a peace treaty that would end a 46-year-old state of war. </P>
<P> The talks, eight miles north of the Red Sea port of Aqaba, Jordan and Eilat, Israel, were due to be wrapped up in the early afternoon. </P>
<P> An Israeli Foreign Ministry official said the negotiators would deal with the modalities of future talks, which take on a higher profile Wednesday when U.S., Israeli and Jordanian foreign ministers convene at a Jordanian hotel on the Dead Sea. </P>
<P> It will be the first public visit to Jordan by an Israeli cabinet minister. Jordanian and Israeli leaders have held numerous secret talks in the past -- Israeli media reports have said that Jordan's King Hussein has even been to Tel Aviv. </P>
<P> In Washington next Monday the king will hold a White House summit with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, their first public meeting. </P>
<P> Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres has invited King Hussein to make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem and pray at the al-Aqsa mosque on the Temple Mount. </P>
<P> ``He will be a most honored guest,'' Peres said Monday, in sharp contrast to lukewarm statements from Israel that its other peace partner, PLO chairman Yasser Arafat, had a right like any other Muslim to visit Jerusalem. </P>
