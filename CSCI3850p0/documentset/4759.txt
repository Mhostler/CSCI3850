<P>  China has hailed the results of a 10-year research project aimed at lengthening the life of high-altitude bamboo, staple food of the 1,000 giant pandas surviving in the wild, Xinhua news agency said Tuesday. </P>
<P> Shortages of the arrow bamboo, the panda's favorite food, caused more than 100 of the endangered black and white mountain animals to starve to death in China's western mountain ranges in the late 1980s. </P>
<P> The research results will enable experts to lengthen the bamboo's life and to delay its flowering period, it said. The arrow bamboo blossoms about once in 10 years and then withers and dies, depriving pandas of their staple diet. </P>
<P> Results of the research, budgeted in 1985 at $118,000, were accepted by the Ministry of Forestry, it said. </P>
<P> More than four-fifths of China's 1,000 wild giant pandas live in the Gongga, Minshan, Daliang, Xiaoliang and Xiangliang mountains in China's western provinces, where most casualties of the 1980s famine occurred, it said. </P>
<P> The results of the 10-year project would be applied to a 100 square mile area of affected bamboo, it said. </P>
