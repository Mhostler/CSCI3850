<P>  Chairman Mao Tsetung, the architect of modern communist China, was a lecher and believed more in Chinese history than in Marxist theory, according to a doctor who stayed at his side for 22 years. </P>
<P> Dr Li Zhisui told reporters Monday that Mao spent years in a specially-built bed that had to be ferried around China with him, that he believed sex with legions of young women would prolong his life, and that he had no friends -- only enemies to be conquered by any means at hand. </P>
<P> Li said Mao made his young male attendants administer a nightly massage to help him sleep and liked to have several young women in bed at the same time to restore his declining yang, or male essence, with their yin, or female essence. </P>
<P> Li has chronicled Mao's life based on dozens of diaries he kept as his personal physician until Mao died in 1976. Random House is publishing Li's ``The Private Life of Chairman Mao'' in English, and the Chinese version will be released soon. </P>
<P> In his rampant sexuality, Li said, Mao was copying China's legendary first emperor, the ``Yellow Emperor'' from whom all Chinese are supposed to have descended and who is said to have achieved immortality by making love to 1,000 young virgins. </P>
<P> Much like China's ancient rulers, Mao thought of himself ''as the Supreme One'' and surrounded himself with bodyguards, young peasants to whom he gave advice on their love lives, according to Li. He even wrote their love letters. </P>
<P> Mao never bathed or brushed his teeth and ``never had to raise a hand, put on his own socks and trousers or comb his own hair,'' Li said. </P>
<P> Fearful of assassination, he traveled around China constantly in a special train that brought all other traffic to a halt and across a countryside where thousands of peasants moved tons of crops close to the railroad so it would look as though there were bumper crops. </P>
<P> Yi said Mao was an admirer of Stalin, and liked former President Richard Nixon better than leftist contemporaries who he regarded as ``untrustworthy.'' </P>
<P> ``He speaks forthrightly,'' Li quoted Mao as saying of Nixon. ``No beating about the bush. He is much better than those people who talk about high moral principles while engaging in sinister intrigues.'' </P>
<P> The sweeping purges of the Cultural Revolution promoted by Mao meant little to him, Li said, but he became depressed by the accompanying famine. His solution: ``He stopped eating meat.'' </P>
