<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Many women who juggle being a mother and having a career would not have it any other way, according to a new survey released Wednesday. </P>
<P> Fifty-six percent of the women surveyed would not give up some of their responsibilities, said the poll conducted for the Families and Work Institute and the Whirlpool Foundation. </P>
<P> But women working outside the home were more willing to give up some responsibilities than those working at home, the survey said. Women over 45 were more willing to give up responsibilities than were younger women, it said. </P>
<P> If money were not an issue, 15 percent of the women said they would work full-time, 33 percent would opt for part-time work, 20 percent would do volunteer work and 31 percent would work at home caring for their families, it said. </P>
<P> More than two-thirds of the women in the study between ages 18 and 55 are employed, with 45 percent of them working full-time and 15 percent part-time, it said. </P>
<P> Twenty-four percent said they expect their jobs to provide more financial security than their partners' jobs, it said. </P>
<P> A majority of the women -- 55 percent -- said they provide half or more of their household's incomes. </P>
<P> Asked if they would prefer more time or more money, 44 percent of the U.S. women went for the time and 50 percent for the money. Canadian women chose more time by 34 percent and more money by 54 percent, while Mexican women chose more time by just 12 percent and more money by 69 percent. </P>
<P> The study was conducted by Louis Harris Associates for the Families and Work Institute, a nonprofit research group, and Whirlpool Foundation, a philanthropic arm of Whirlpool Corp., based in Benton Harbor, Mich. </P>
<P> The pollsters conducted random telephone interviews with 1,502 women between ages 18 and 55 in the United States between Nov. 18 and Dec. 8, 1994; 1,005 women in Canada between Feb. 9 and 18, 1995; and 499 in-person interviews in Mexico between March 24 and 26, 1995. The margin of error was two to three percentage points. </P>
