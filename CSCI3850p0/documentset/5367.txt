<P>  A former American Honda Motor Co. official, testifying in one of the biggest bribery cases in the history of the U.S. auto industry, admitted Friday he lied to company management in 1992 about car dealer payoffs and later lied to the FBI. </P>
<P> In testimony in federal court, Stanley Cardiges, once the most powerful sales executive with American Honda, estimated he received cash and gifts worth as much as $5 million in the late 1980s. </P>
<P> Cardiges, 49, of Laguna Hills, Calif., is the government's key witness at the trial of his former boss, John Billmyer, and a former colleague, Dennis Josleyn. </P>
<P> Cardiges pleaded guilty last month to racketeering and other charges in connection with one of the biggest bribery schemes in the American auto industry. Nineteen others have also pleaded guilty. </P>
<P> Cardiges estimated his current worth at $500,000 to $1 million, all of which he stands to lose because of fines and forfeitures related to the case, he said. He also faces up to 35 years in jail. </P>
<P> He admitted lying to a company official in 1992 when questioned about a $162,000 check. The payment represented interest in a dealership Cardiges took as a payoff, he said. </P>
<P> He was forced to resign a few days later. Later he lied to American Honda attorneys as he continued to try to cover up bribes and keep them secret from Japanese management, he said. </P>
<P> He also admitted lying when questioned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1993. The FBI started a year-long probe after a Concord, N.H., dealer sued American Honda. </P>
<P> When Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Connolly asked why he pleaded guilty, Cardiges said, ``Because I've been denying I've been doing this for 18 years now and I'm tired of doing that.'' </P>
<P> Prosecutors have charged that Cardiges and others received over $15 million in kickbacks in return for granting dealerships of hot-selling Honda cars. </P>
<P> Defense lawyers began cross examining Cardiges Friday and are expected to continue Monday. Billmyer is charged with conspiracy and faces five years in jail if convicted. Josleyn faces a maximum sentence of 35 years if convicted on racketeering and other charges. </P>
