<P>  U.N. military observers said the Iraq-Kuwait border was quiet after daybreak Tuesday following an Iraq announcement it was withdrawing a large force it had deployed near the Gulf War frontier. </P>
<P> ``Everything is okay. Everything is quiet,'' a spokesman for the U.N. Iraq-Kuwait Observer Mission (UNIKOM) told Reuters from the demilitarized zone. </P>
<P> Iraq said Monday it was withdrawing tens of thousands of troops who have deployed as close as 12 miles from the border since Friday and raised fears of a repeat of Baghdad's 1990 invasion. </P>
<P> The United States and Kuwait said they had no evidence of such a withdrawal and a large buildup of military power in the region was continuing. </P>
<P> The spokesman added that a UNIKOM helicopter was making a regular morning observation flight over the zone along the 130 mile border. </P>
<P> Observers would make a report based on its flight at about 9.30 a.m. EDT, the spokesman said. </P>
