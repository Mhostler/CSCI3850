<P>  An elderly British couple canceled a vacation in the picture-book Oxfordshire village of Woodstock after seeing people on television dancing to pop music at New York's Woodstock '94 anniversary festival. </P>
<P> The pensioners called the Marlborough Arms Hotel to cancel after confusing the sleepy English village with the American rock festival held to mark 25 years since the original hippy gathering in 1969. </P>
<P> ``They said they couldn't put up with the crowds and the loud pop music,'' hotel duty manager Mike Davis said Friday. </P>
<P></P>
<P> ``No, we've seen it on the telly. It's a huge pop concert. There's no way we're coming this weekend; we couldn't put up with all the louts.'' </P>
<P> The music festival in Saugerties, New York last weekend attracted at least 200,000 people. </P>
