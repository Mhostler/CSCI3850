<P>  President Lyndon Johnson feared that his successor would be pressed to drop an atomic bomb on North Vietnam to end the war, his widow, Lady Bird Johnson, said in an interview to be broadcast Friday. </P>
<P> Asked if he ever considered using the bomb, the former first lady told ABC television's ``20/20'' program: ``Not by his order, but he kept on thinking that was a danger lurking on the sidelines and that there was a part of the country who wanted to do it that way and get it over with. And he was scareder of that than he was of people on the left.'' </P>
<P> Mrs. Johnson said her husband, who died in 1973, was afraid that pressures from other forces in the country to drop the bomb would mount on his successor. </P>
<P> Johnson began the conventional bombing of North Vietnam in 1965 and by 1969 had increased U.S. forces in South Vietnam to over half a million troops. President Richard Nixon later increased bombings and amid increasing U.S. opposition to American involvement in the war, withdrew troops before the United States completely pulled out of the conflict in 1973. </P>
<P> Speaking to Barbara Walters at the LBJ Ranch in Stonewall, Texas, the 82-year-old widow also discussed her feelings about Jacqueline Kennedy's ``shadow'' dogging her at the White House -- a shadow that lifted only when the glamourous widow of slain president John F. Kennedy married shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis. </P>
<P> ``Nothing against that shadow. But you don't quite escape from that feeling,'' said Johnson, whose first name was Claudia but was universally known as Ladybird. </P>
<P> Walters read an entry from Mrs. Johnson's diary at the time: ``As a result of this wedding, I feel strangely free. No shadow walks beside me down the halls of the White House.'' </P>
<P> Johnson said that her husband's Great Society programs of social and economic welfare and civil rights advances may be changed by Republican House speaker Newt Gingrich's conservative crusade, but she does not believe they will be abolished. </P>
<P> ``Maybe they need some adjustment. Don't think they're going to get thrown out,'' she said. </P>
<P> She said that she was too close to death to ``harbor anger'' against Gingrich. </P>
