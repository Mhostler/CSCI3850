<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Indonesia, indicating it is still sensitive to foreign press coverage, has withheld the distribution of two editions of the International Herald Tribune newspaper, an industry official said Tuesday. </P>
<P> An official from NV Indoprom, which distributes most leading foreign publications, said the weekend and Monday's editions of the newspaper had been withheld. The official declined further comment. </P>
<P> The weekend edition of the International Herald Tribune included a story on East Timor. The Monday edition carried an editorial from the New York Times criticizing the June crackdown on Indonesia's press and events in East Timor. </P>
<P> In recent weeks, Indonesia has delayed or withheld from distribution copies of Newsweek, Time, the Singapore Straits Times, the Bangkok Post, along with earlier editions of the Herald Tribune. </P>
<P> Foreign diplomats said the move highlighted the government's sensitivity to some coverage of Indonesia, especially June's media ban and the situation in East Timor, a former Portuguese colony that Jakarta invaded in 1975 and annexed a year later. </P>
<P> The government banned Tempo, Detik and Editor magazines for their coverage of sensitive political issues, including a row over a $1.1 billion deal to purchase 39 ex-east German warships and a corruption scandal. </P>
