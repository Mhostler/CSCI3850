<P>  With its agricultural heritage overrun by urban sprawl, Dan Balch's U.S. Department of Agriculture field office is feeling the force of massive closings as part of the federal agency's cost-cutting efforts. </P>
<P> ``Big ice storm moving in from Salina, that's the story in this office,'' Balch said as he processed copies of agricultural statistics. ``I don't want to talk about much more than that.'' </P>
<P> The office, in a strip mall in this suburban city 35 miles southwest of Kansas City, Mo., is in many ways a prime example of what critics say is the wasteful 60-year USDA practice of maintaining an office in every county in the country. </P>
<P> On a day yet to be determined by USDA officials in Washington, the Johnson County, Kan., branch of the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service will be melded into the Miami County ASCS office in order to streamline the agency. </P>
<P> In all, outgoing Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy said Tuesday he will close 1,274 field offices across the country, which would result in taxpayer savings of $3.6 billion over the next five years. </P>
<P> The bulk of those closings are in the Southeast. Georgia alone loses 101 offices under the plan, while 12 of the 116 USDA offices in Kansas will be closed. </P>
<P> But that was little consolation for Balch and two other employees in the doomed ASCS bureau and some of the farmers they serve. </P>
<P> ``They said we're too urban,'' Balch said. </P>
<P> In addition to overseeing a variety of agriculture programs, including the Conservation Reserve Program, the ASCS offices help farmers choose which crops they should plant for maximum benefit and what forms they need to fill out to qualify for federal subsidy payments. </P>
<P> ``We've been kind of expecting it for a couple of years,'' said Mike DeGrande, a Gardner, Kan., farmer who will have to drive another 25 miles to Paola, in the neighboring county, after the Olathe office closes. </P>
<P> ``It's terrible but not a real surprise,'' DeGrande said. ''The city is growing all around us.'' </P>
<P> Although the Olathe office boasts serving 620 farms, the reality is that the base of Johnson County's population of 355,054 is suburban. Its population is the second highest in the state, according to the 1990 census. </P>
<P> The city of Olathe is no longer the sleepy Kansas farm town is used to be. Today it is an affluent bedroom community for Kansas City. </P>
<P> Some of the richest neighborhoods in the metropolitan area, such as Mission Hills, Kan., lie within Johnson County lines. Joe Montana, the superstar quarterback for the Kansas City Chiefs, lives in the exclusive Hallbrook Farms subdivision that is only a few miles from the office. </P>
<P> ``About the only thing you did call them for was if you were having trouble with your lawn,'' Olathe resident Jim Lammle said of the ASCS office. </P>
<P> The office is just one of many examples of field offices operated by the USDA that either duplicate operations of other offices in their area or have lost their agricultural roots to expanding metropolitan areas. </P>
<P> ``Some have been duplicate offices and we've been supportive of the USDA reducing its cost,'' said Dave Miller, a spokesman for the American Farm Bureau Federation, one of the largest private farm organizations in the world. </P>
<P> He said Farm Bureau will probably disagree with the closure of a few offices, but that overall, the powerful organization is in favor of a more efficient system of USDA offices. </P>
<P> ``I used to have to go to Miami County, but I got all my stuff transferred to Johnson County a few years ago,'' said DeGrande, the farmer. ``I guess I have to go back now, but at least now I know how to get there.'' </P>
