<P>  Romance is to remain alive and well in a rural English village called Lover. </P>
<P> The Post Office said Monday it had overturned a decision made last year to stop hand-cancelling Valentine's Day cards in Lover after a barrage of complaints from all over the world. </P>
<P> ``We are really pleased,'' said village postmistress Lynda Cooper who was preparing for the sackfuls of cards which arrive before Feb. 14. ``Although I have to stamp all the cards myself and by hand it is a wonderful service,'' she said. </P>
<P> Outcry over the Post Office's original decision was intensified when it emerged the cards were to be diverted to a nearby sorting office with the unromantic name of Slough. </P>
