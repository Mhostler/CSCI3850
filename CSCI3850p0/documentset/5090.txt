<DATELINE>ARKALYK, Kazakhstan (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Russian cosmonaut Valery Polyakov returned to earth on the snowy steppes of Kazakhstan Wednesday after a record-breaking 438 days in space. </P>
<P> He and two other crew members from the Russian space station Mir landed (about 11 p.m. EST Tuesday) aboard a Soyuz TM-20 craft about 30 miles northeast of Arkalyk in the former Soviet republic. </P>
<P> ``Everything went okay but I will give my final 'okay' when they get into the plane and take off for Moscow. Then I can say everything went perfectly,'' said air force Col. Yuri Shurov, one of the leaders of the space module recovery mission. </P>
<P> Polyakov, 52, broke the endurance record of one year in space when he spent his 366th day in orbit Jan. 9. </P>
<P> But he stayed aboard the Mir station until a joint Russian-U.S. crew took over on March 16. </P>
<P> Polyakov, a doctor who joined the cosmonaut training center in 1979, studied the effects of long-term weightlessness on the human body, using himself as a guinea pig. </P>
<P> The data he has brought back will help scientists assess if humans could live permanently in space or fly to Mars and back. </P>
<P> He and his fellow space travellers, Alexander Viktorenko and Yelena Kondakova, looked pale and slightly disoriented as they were helped from their module shortly after touchdown. </P>
<P> None of them was allowed to walk -- despite Polyakov's plea to doctors that he wanted to take just a few steps on his own. But they recovered quickly and began chatting and joking with friends and relatives. </P>
<P> Sipping tea and half-reclining on a chair brought out to the module, Polyakov said: I am very glad we have landed on the friendly land of Kazakhstan.'' </P>
<P> Referring to the Muslim Novruz holiday being marked in Kazakhstan, Polyakov said: ``The Koran doesn't allow the drinking of alcohol but I'll drink this cup of tea to this holiday.'' </P>
<P> Russian officials have said Polyakov's triumph could help pave the way for manned rocket trips to Mars. </P>
<P> U.S. space officials say Polyakov's record stint in space is a significant achievement that will shed light on the effects of long-duration missions in space. </P>
<P> Polyakov is one of only five people to spend over 300 days in space. In his orbits in Mir, he traveled some 250 million miles -- the equivalent of a return trip to the sun or seven times the distance to Mars. </P>
<P> European Space Agency and NASA scientists say long-term weightlessness causes bones to lose calcium and become brittle while the backbone gets longer. Legs shorten and muscles deteriorate through lack of use. </P>
<P> Recent film of Polyakov shot aboard Mir showed him happy and apparently healthy -- exercising on a cycling machine as a stop watch floated in front of him and climbing into a sauna aboard the station. </P>
<P> A three-month stint on board Mir by U.S. astronaut Norman Thagard will pave the way for future cooperation with the Russians. </P>
<P> Polyakov, speaking to Reuters shortly after touch-down, paid tribute to Thagard as a ``very good, very experienced'' pilot. </P>
