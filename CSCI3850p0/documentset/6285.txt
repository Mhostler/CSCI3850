<P>  Saudi financier Mohammad Khalifah, sentenced to death in Jordan on charges of destabilizing the kingdom, was to be deported from the United States to Amman Thursday, the State Department said. </P>
<P> ``The decision has been made and he will be deported to Jordan,'' department spokesman Nicholas Burns said. ``Thus ends our legal responsibility for him.'' </P>
<P> Jordan had asked the United States to hand over Khalifah, who was sentenced to death in absentia, along with 10 others, by Jordan's state security court last December. He was among 25 Islamic fundamentalists accused of a plot to destabilize the kingdom, including a series of bombings and plans to assassinate leading officials. </P>
<P> Khalifah's lawyers say he will get a new trial in Jordan. He is suspected of providing financial support for the Abu Sayyaf group in the Philippines and the Palestinian Hamas movement. </P>
<P> Jordan's official Petra news agency said on Wednesday that Justice Minister Hisham al-Tell had met with a U.S. judicial delegation on Tuesday that informed Jordan of Washington's willingness to hand over Khalifah. Khalifah, who was taken into U.S. custody on December 16, had been held without bail after his arrest for having an improper visa. </P>
<P> The defendants in the case are mostly Jordanians who fought Soviet forces in Afghanistan in the 1980s. They were seized in a crackdown on Islamic radicals in January 1994. </P>
<P> U.S. immigration officials said last week that Khalifah had agreed to be deported to Jordan to fight the charges of having links with terrorists. Khalifah has contested the charges through his attorneys but said he would rather fight them in Jordan than remain detained in the United States. </P>
<P> The State Department concluded that Khalifah's presence in the United States was against its security interests. </P>
