<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A South Korean soldier in the 1950-53 Korean War has escaped from the communist North and returned home 43 years after being captured, Seoul's internal intelligence agency said Monday. </P>
<P> A statement released by the Agency for National Security Planning (NSP) said Cho Chang-ho, 64, was rescued Sunday by a South Korean fisheries patrol off the western port of Kunsan. </P>
<P> A spokesman for the fisheries office said Cho was found drifting in a wooden boat. </P>
<P> The NSP statement said Cho was exhausted and was being treated at a Seoul hospital, where he had met several relatives, including a sister. </P>
<P> ``I decided to escape (from the North) in 1992 under the belief North Korea was not the place I wanted to be buried and that I must meet my family members alive,'' Cho was quoted by South Korea's Yonhap news agency as telling local reporters. </P>
<P> Although the NSP said it was investigating how and when Cho escaped from the North, Yonhap quoted Cho as saying he crossed the Yalu River into China on Oct. 3 and an ethnic Korean there helped him return to the South by sea. </P>
<P> The NSP statement quoted Cho as saying he volunteered as a second lieutenant in the South Korean army while attending Seoul's Yonsei University and was assigned to an army artillery unit when the Korean War broke out. </P>
<P> It added that Cho was captured by Chinese troops sent to fight alongside North Korean forces during the war and taken to the North in 1951. </P>
<P> Cho is said to have been held in a North Korean detention camp for nearly 13 years and then worked at a mine until 1977, when he quit because of illness. </P>
<P> A cemetery official said Chon's name had been engraved on a memorial tablet for war dead at the National Cemetery in Seoul. In 1977, the government considered him to have died during the Korean War. </P>
