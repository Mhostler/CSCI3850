<P>  The status of a 34-year-old man in a coma for half his life continued to be fought over Tuesday as lawyers considered an appeal of a decision allowing the parents to remove their son's life support. </P>
<P> Barry McKee, an attorney for the Nursing Home Action Group, said he would await a judge's final ruling before deciding whether to appeal Monday's decision by a Ramsey County court referee upholding Jim and Pattie Butcher's right to remove the feeding tube keeping their son Jamie alive. </P>
<P> The legal argument centers on a Minnesota law requiring that disabled or incompetent people have a guardian, usually a relative, approved by the court. </P>
<P> ``We were arguing the court didn't follow the law, because it didn't appoint a guardian to look out for his interests,'' McKee said. ``We said from the very beginning, 'if you want to make these kind of decisions, apply to be his guardian.''' </P>
<P> The Butchers have taken Jamie, who suffered a severe head injury when his car slipped on wet leaves and slammed into a tree the night of Oct. 8, 1977, out of a care facility and back into their home in suburban White Bear Lake. </P>
<P> Court-appointed referee James Finley ruled in favor of the Butchers Monday, saying the Nursing Home Action Group had no standing to interfere in the case. </P>
<P> The Butchers previously won a court decision against Ramsey County, which had said they would be subject to criminal neglect charges if Jamie was allowed to die. </P>
<P> Subsequently, the nursing group entered the case, saying Jamie needed a guardian because he was involved in a lawsuit and needed his interests represented. </P>
<P> ``We said, 'If there's no dispute, it does not belong in court,''' said Barbara Blumer, an attorney for the Butchers. </P>
<P> Pattie Butcher said the family would choose an appropriate time to withdraw the tube providing food and water to Jamie, who has had excellent care and has lived much longer than most comatose patients. </P>
<P> Doctors estimate it could take a week or even longer for Jamie to die. They say he can neither think, hear, experience pain or react to the world around him. </P>
<P> McKee suggested that Jamie's impending starvation was another issue to consider. </P>
<P> ``It would seem to be much more humane to deliver a lethal injection rather than have the patient starve to death,'' he said. </P>
