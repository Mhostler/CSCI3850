<P>  The United States is prepared to use its Security Council veto to block a relaxation of sanctions against Iraq but is confident it will not be necessary, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Madeleine Albright said Sunday. </P>
<P> ``If necessary we will (use the veto),'' she told reporters at the end of a three-hour visit to Kuwait for a meeting with the emir, Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah, on the fourth anniversary of the emirate's Gulf War liberation. </P>
<P> She said she had handed a message from President Clinton to Sheikh Jaber that said Washington was determined to ensure Iraq complied with all its obligations under U.N. resolutions before sanctions could be relaxed. </P>
<P> ``I delivered a personal message from President Clinton in which the President made clear our determination to ensure that Iraq complies with all its obligations before there can be any action to modify the sanctions regime,'' she told reporters. </P>
<P> Albright later left for Prague, continuing a tour to rally support for U.S. efforts to maintain sanctions against Iraq. </P>
<P> Russia and France may introduce a resolution to lift the curbs when a U.N. report on the state of Iraq's weapons is due on April 10. </P>
<P> Albright, who has already visited Oman and Britain, reiterated that Iraq had to demonstrate its peaceful intentions before the United States believed sanctions could be relaxed. </P>
<P> She said the phrase peaceful intentions meant giving a full accounting for all Kuwaitis detained in the occupation and believed still held by Iraq and the return of all property looted during Baghdad's seven-month occupation. </P>
<P> Kuwait alleges Iraq still holds 600 Kuwaitis and third country nationals, a charge Iraq denies. </P>
<P> The United Nations imposed the sanctions over Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Under a 1991 resolution, Iraq has to satisfy U.N. inspectors it has destroyed all weapons of mass destruction before a ban on exports, such as oil, can be eased. </P>
<P> Officials in the Gulf states of Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, concerned about the humanitarian situation in Iraq, have called recently for the lifting of sanctions. </P>
<P> Officials in those and other states have also said fears for Gulf security are being fomented by countries outside the region as a pretext for sales of Western weaponry. </P>
<P> Asked for her reaction to these concerns, Albright replied: ``We are here very clearly with a single mission, to assure not only Kuwait but the countries in the region that the United States is determined not to have Iraq be a threat to the region, since it seems to be our responsibility, whenever there is a problem, to answer the call.'' </P>
<P> Her tour will also take in the Czech Republic, Italy, Argentina and Honduras. Like Oman, all now occupy seats on the Security Council. </P>
