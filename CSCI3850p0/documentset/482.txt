<DATELINE>DAYTON, Ohio (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  As far as Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott is concerned, there's only going to be one baseball team in southern Ohio. </P>
<P> The Reds owner has vowed that nearby Dayton will not become home to a minor league baseball team because she believes the competition would hurt attendance at Reds games, the Dayton Daily News reported Friday. </P>
<P> Dayton, about 50 miles north of Cincinnati, has an effort under way to attract a minor league club. Schott said Dayton-area fans travel regularly to Cincinnati to see her Reds. </P>
<P> ``Major League Baseball will not allow a team in Dayton. The league was against a plan like that once before and I don't see it being any different this time,'' she said. </P>
<P> Schott said she has lost $11 million in baseball this year and believes Major League Baseball, which gives its member clubs territorial rights, would block a Dayton minor league team. </P>
<P> Southern Ohio may soon be without baseball, period, as the Major League Players Association has set August 12 as a strike date if a labor agreement with owners is not reached. </P>
