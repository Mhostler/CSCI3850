<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The State Department said Thursday it assumed Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic had spurned an offer from U.S. and other envoys that could have led to limited relief of sanctions against Serbia and to invigorated peace efforts. </P>
<P> ``It is our assumption that he is not interested in it,'' State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters. ``It's our assumption that it's not going anywhere.'' </P>
<P> Officials of the Contact Group representing the United States, France, Britain, Germany and Russia held a five-hour meeting with Milosevic Tuesday as part of a Balkan tour aimed at reviving a stalled peace process. </P>
<P> On the table was a proposal that Milosevic commit himself to recognizing Bosnia within its present borders in exchange for relief from U.N. sanctions. Ultimately, Milosevic would be expected to press Bosnian Serbs to agree to a peace deal. </P>
<P> Milosevic was offered Tuesday a suspension of some of the trade sanctions imposed in 1992 for Serbia's support of Serbs involved in warfare in Bosnia and Croatia, but not a relaxation of an oil embargo or the unfreezing of Belgrade's financial assets abroad. </P>
<P> Burns said he understood the Contact Group was still awaiting a definitive reply from Milosevic but another senior U.S. official reinforced the pessimistic view. </P>
<P> Milosevic ``has said no repeatedly ... The idea that he is likely to recognize these countries in their present borders right now without getting something far more substantial in return than we in Washington think he should be offered is to my mind a nonstarter,'' the official said. </P>
<P> Burns ducked a question about whether a United Nations international criminal tribunal might implicate Milosevic in war crimes in connection with concentration camps in Bosnia. </P>
<P> The New York Times reported Thursday that a former senior member of the Serbian secret police had come forward with documents that could implicate Milosevic as a war criminal. </P>
<P> One of the documents, dated May 24, 1992, appears to include directions from Serbian state security services on the running of concentration camps in Bosnia, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> At that time, thousands of Muslim civilians in the camps were being tortured and killed and Milosevic was denying active involvement in the Bosnia conflict. </P>
<P> The State Department, which has been hoping to turn Milosevic into a peacemaker, said that by talking to him it was in no way endorsing him or Serbian policies. </P>
<P> Another official said that whether Milosevic is a war criminal in legal terms is up to the international tribunal to decide, but he is definitely ``the man who started this war.'' </P>
<P> Nevertheless, he said: ``Under the circumstances, I see no choice but to talk to him because there's no chance of even considering settling the war without some kind of participation by him and furthermore he has accepted the Contact Group plan'' for dividing Bosnia among rival factions. </P>
<P> Burns said the administration, which has received over 700 first-hand accounts of alleged atrocities in Bosnia, believes war criminals should be held accountable regardless of rank. </P>
<P> Milosevic has always denied responsibility for any such crimes. He and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic have said Serbian militias may have done horrible things to Muslim civilians but the forces were under no political control and were responding to provocations. </P>
