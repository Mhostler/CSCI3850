<P>  Maine Republicans expect to hold a straw poll early in the 1996 presidential nominating process in hopes of having a bigger say in the selection of the GOP nominee, party officials said Tuesday. </P>
<P> The vote, likely to be held several weeks before the important New Hampshire presidential primary expected in February, 1996, echoes a tactic Maine Republicans used in the 1980 race, state GOP director Ben Coes said. </P>
<P> ``We want to play a part in the national election in 1996 and we think this is the way we can be a relevant factor in helping to choose the Republican nominee,'' Coes said. </P>
<P> Maine's last presidential straw poll, in November 1979, helped derail then front-runner Howard Baker and boosted the campaign of Kennebunkport summer resident George Bush. </P>
<P> The move is the latest in jockeying between state parties for more important roles in the presidential race. Arizona has said it plans to vote the same day as New Hampshire, although the move faces legal hurdles. </P>
<P> Maine GOP officials say their straw poll will give candidates an early opportunity to test their strength, although unlike a traditional primary the results are not binding on the state's delegates to the national convention. </P>
<P> The vote's non-binding status avoids a conflict with a New Hampshire law that rquires it to hold its primary at least one week before any other state's primary, officials believe. </P>
