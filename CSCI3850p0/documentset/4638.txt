<DATELINE>INDIAN WELLS, Calif., Feb 28 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Elena Likhovtseva of Kazakhstan upset sixth-seeded Amy Frazier of the United States 7-6 (7-4) 6-4 in the first round of the $430,000 Evert Cup Tuesday. </P>
<P> Fifth-seeded Naoko Sawamatsu of Japan outlasted Shaun Stafford of the United States 6-7 (5-7) 6-1 6-2 in two hours, 30 minutes of the 28-player, hard-court tournament. </P>
<P> Eighth-seeded Mary Joe Fernandez of the United States, the winner here in 1993, beat compatriot Sandra Cacic 6-4 6-0 in another first-round match Tuesday. </P>
<P> The top four seeded players, including Spaniards top- seeded Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and second seeded Conchita Martinez of Spain, received first round byes. </P>
<P> Sanchez Vicario re-took the world's number one ranking from German Steffi Graf in the WTA Tour rankings, and will retain the top spot regardless of her performance this week. </P>
<P> Likhovtseva, 48 in the world, fell behind 1-3 but took the first set from the 13th-ranked Frazier in a tiebreak by pressing the defensive Frazier with her strong forehand. </P>
<P> Likhovtseva opened a 3-1 lead in the second set by breaking Frazier in the third game on a forehand error from Frazier, and then consolidated the lone service break to close out the baseline contest. </P>
<P> Likhovtseva called the victory over Frazier a good omen for the rest of the week. </P>
<P> ``This was a good match for me to get through because there were a lot of long rallies,'' the 19-year-old Likhovtseva said. ''It showed that my game is in good shape when I'm under pressure. These are the kinds of matches I need to win to keep improving my ranking.'' </P>
<P> Sawamatsu, 21 in the world, dropped the 70-minute first set against Stafford when she committed three unforced errors in the tiebreak, but she then won nine of the next 10 games, as a visibly-fatigued Stafford could not keep pace with Sawamatsu in the long baseline rallies. </P>
<P> The 19th-ranked Fernandez scored the lone service break to win the first set from the 74th-ranked Cacic by winning several long baseline rallies and then repeatedly approached the net while capturing the second set 6-0. </P>
