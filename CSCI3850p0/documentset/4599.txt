<P>  Senior Russian officials Monday defended Moscow's planned sale of nuclear reactors to Iran and brushed off threats by U.S. lawmakers to cut off aid if the $800 million deal goes ahead. </P>
<P> ``We are negotiating (the sale) of a peaceful nuclear facility (for a) power plant,'' Sergei Karaganov, a member of the Russian Presidential Council, told reporters. ``We aren't selling anything which can be connected with arms.'' </P>
<P> The Russian officials, here for meetings with Congressional, administration and business leaders, argued that financially strapped Moscow badly needed the money from the deal and could not afford to forego it. </P>
<P> The Clinton administration has accused Iran of being on a crash program to develop nuclear weapons and has objected strenuously to the proposed agreement. </P>
<P> ``We're very concerned about the situation in Iran,'' Secretary of State Warren Christopher told reporters Monday at the start of a meeting with Italian Foreign Minister Susanna Agnelli. ``We oppose any nuclear cooperation with Iran by Russia or other countries.'' </P>
<P> The administration, though, has stopped well short of threatening to cut back aid to Russia if the deal goes ahead. Congressional Republicans, including House Sepaker Newt Gingrich from Georgia, have not been so reticient, however. </P>
<P> President Clinton has proposed spending $788 million in 1996 on Russia and the other ex-Soviet states. Republicans in Congress are reviewing that request. </P>
<P> Russian officials played down the importance of the threatened aid cut-off, arguing that virtually all of the technical assistance provided by the United States ends up benefiting American companies, not Russia. </P>
<P> ``The U.S. Congress should be very careful,'' said Russian Deputy Finance Minister Sergie Aleksashenko. ``Ninety-five to ninety-eight percent of this money ends up going to American firms.'' </P>
<P> The U.S. firms write big reports on Russia after spending only days in the country, he said derisively. </P>
<P> But Russian officials were more upbeat on the prospects for sealing an agreement soon with the International Monetary Fund on a $6.25 billion loan. </P>
<P> ``We are very close to reaching an accord,'' Economics Minister Yevgeny Yasin said, speaking through an interpreter. ''We are optimistic.'' </P>
