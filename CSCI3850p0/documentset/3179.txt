<P>  Canada is considering a ban on trade in human eggs following reports that poor women with reproductive problems are selling their healthy eggs to pay for in vitro fertilization, government officials said Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``It's a serious concern of mine that women ... or couples in vulnerable situations are being exploited,'' Health Minister Diane Marleau was quoted as saying in Tuesday's Toronto Star newspaper, describing the human egg trade as unacceptable. </P>
<P> A spokesman for the minister told Reuters that Marleau was hoping to introduce legislation toward the end of next year, but that the government may consider some short-term measures in the meantime. There is currently no law in Canada dealing with trade in human eggs or sperm. </P>
<P> Late last year, a Royal Commission on Reproductive Technologies recommended a ban on surrogate motherhood and the sale of human sperm and eggs. </P>
<P> Ontario, Canada's most populous province, earlier this year made sharp cutbacks in funding for in-vitro fertilization, making it harder for women unable to have children to qualify for the program. </P>
<P> Since April, the Ontario government has been funding in-vitro fertilization programs only for women with completely blocked fallopian tubes. It does not cover other conditions such as premature menopause and male fertility problems. </P>
<P> The Star reported that one private clinic in Toronto has decided to link egg donors with women without healthy eggs who are prepared to pay for the in-vitro fertilization program. The eggs are harvested and divided, with half of them fertilized by the donor's partner through in-vitro fertilization and the other half by the partner of the recipient. Both women are implanted with the eggs. </P>
<P> Diane Allen of the Infertility Awareness Association of Canada said she was troubled by the plan. </P>
<P> ``Are people really doing this out of free choice or financial pressure?'' Allen said. ``And if you donated eggs and did not get pregnant, would you want to spend the rest of your life wondering if the other woman did and your child was out there with her, yet you had no child?'' </P>
