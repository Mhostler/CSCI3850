<P>  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, on the eve of signing a treaty with Jordan, said Tuesday he hoped peace with archfoe Syria would follow. </P>
<P> Submitting the treaty to parliament, Rabin said: ``We want to believe that the peace treaty with Jordan will push forward the treaty with Syria. We haven't a treaty as yet with Syria. There are talks -- no treaty. </P>
<P> ``The agreement with the kingdom of Jordan which comes after the agreement with Egypt and the agreement with the Palestinians proves there is a point in patience, there is truth in a serious approach,'' Rabin said. </P>
<P> Israel's 120-seat parliament was expected to back the treaty overwhelmingly in a vote late Tuesday. </P>
<P> President Clinton was due to witness the signing in the Arava desert at the Israeli-Jordanian border Wednesday. </P>
