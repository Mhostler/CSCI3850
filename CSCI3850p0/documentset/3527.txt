<P>  Four people died during a fire that broke out on New Year's Eve in a patient care ward of this city's only medical center, a hospital administrator said Sunday. </P>
<P> The blaze sent heavy smoke through the fourth floor of the Southside Regional Medical Center, forcing the evacuation of about 30 patients from that floor and those immediately above and below, said nursing supervisor Violet Walthall. </P>
<P> ``There were four deaths,'' Walthall said. ``But one woman was in very critical condition at the time and we're not sure whether she died because of the fire.'' </P>
<P> She said hospital administrators and fire officials were trying to determine what started the fire in Petersburg, located 25 miles south of Richmond. </P>
