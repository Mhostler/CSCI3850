<DATELINE>TEL AVIV, Israel (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Jordan's new ambassador to Israel, taking the shine off their historic peace treaty, said Tuesday most Jordanians opposed any quick warming of relations with their former enemy. </P>
<P> ``Most Jordanians' support is lukewarm and guarded at best,'' Ambassador Marwan Muasher told foreign journalists in Tel Aviv, referring to the accord Jordan and Israel signed in October. </P>
<P> The ambassador, who took up his post two weeks ago, focused in the Tel Aviv briefing on what he called ``people to people relations'' which he said ``are still opposed by the majority of Jordanians in a lot of ways.'' </P>
<P> His comments, to the international press, appeared aimed at signalling to the kingdom's substantial Palestinian population that Jordanian leaders recognised their reluctance to turn decades of enmity toward Israelis into immediate friendship. </P>
<P> Muasher's words were also a blunt sign to Israelis -- thousands of whom have visited Jordan since peace was forged -- that they could not take the treaty for granted and much work lay ahead in achieving a regional settlement. </P>
<P> Peace with Jordan was greeted by Israelis, across the political spectrum, without reservation -- in stark contrast to attitudes towards Israel's 1993 peace deal with the PLO. </P>
<P> But Muasher said: ``Without successful conclusion of agreements on the Palestinian track in particular, but also on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks, we cannot hope to create the proper environment under which peace between people will prosper.'' </P>
<P> Israel has delayed widening Palestinian self-rule after a series of suicide bombings by Moslem militants. Negotiations with Syria, the main powerbroker in Lebanon, are stalled over the future of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. </P>
<P> In a gesture of support to the PLO, Muasher paid his first visit to Palestinian leader Faisal al-Husseini at his Orient House office in Arab East Jerusalem, regarded as PLO headquarters. </P>
<P> Muasher described the visit as unofficial and not meant to antagonize anyone. Israel claims all of Jerusalem as its capital and frowns on Palestinian nationalist activity in the city. The issue is on their negotiating agenda. </P>
<P> ``When Jerusalem returns to Arab sovereignty, religious sovereignty over the holy places will return to the Palestinians,'' Muasher said, repeating official policy. </P>
<P> He said that on a governmental basis, Jordan sought a ``very warm peace'' with Israel. </P>
<P> But Jordanians, many of whom had relatives in Israeli- occupied areas, first wanted to see how the issue of Palestinian refugees and the future of Jerusalem and Jewish settlements would be resolved, he said. </P>
<P> As if to underscore Muasher's assessments, Jordan's Dentists Association said Tuesday it was sticking to a decision to ban members from treating Israelis other than emergency cases. </P>
