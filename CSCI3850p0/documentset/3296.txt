<DATELINE>VELIKA KLADUSA, Bosnia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Rebel Muslim forces supported by Croatian Serbs captured an important town in the Bihac pocket of northwest Bosnia from government troops Saturday. </P>
<P> Velika Kladusa, the second largest town in the besieged Muslim enclave after Bihac town itself, fell at 1030 a.m. EST after heavy fighting for most of the day, witnesses said. </P>
<P> A spokesman in Bihac for the U.N. Protection Force, Edward Joseph, said forces loyal to local businessman Fikret Abdic, together with their Serb allies from the neighboring Krajina region of Croatia, had taken the town. </P>
<P> ``Our indicators tell us that Krajina Serbs and Abdic's forces are in control of the town proper,'' Joseph told Reuters by telephone from a U.N. base at Coralici. </P>
<P> But a U.N. source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Muslim and Serb rebels had not yet secured full control of the territory in the immediate vicinity of Velika Kladusa. </P>
<P> Stojicic said government 5th corps soldiers defending Velika Kladusa had retreated from the town, which had been under siege for nearly two months. </P>
<P> Bangladeshi U.N. peacekeeping troops stationed about three miles to the south of Velika Kladusa remained at their base and did not intervene. </P>
<P> Abdic rebelled against Bosnia's Muslim-led government in Sarajevo earlier this year, declaring that the part of Bihac under his control was autonomous and signing a peace deal with Bosnian Serbs. </P>
<P> He and some 30,000 followers were forced to take refuge with the Krajina Serbs, who control one third of Croatia in defiance of Zagreb, after losing their former stronghold of Velika Kladusa to the Bosnian army in August. </P>
<P> Abdic was helped in his bid to recapture the town by Bosnian and Croat Serb forces who launched a counter-offensive against Bihac after being attacked by the 5th Corps in October. </P>
<P> The fall of Velika Kladusa was likely to complicate the government's defense of Bihac town, 40 miles to the south. The United Nations has declared that Bihac town is a ``safe haven,'' but it has been regularly shelled by Serb forces. </P>
<P> About 1,200 U.N. Bangladeshi soldiers, poorly armed and without basic supplies, are unable to offer any protection to civilians and have themselves been targeted by the Serbs. </P>
<P> Friday, the Krajina Serbs allowed a humanitarian aid convoy into Bihac, only the second it has received in two months. About 180,000 people there have virtually no food, fuel or medical supplies. </P>
