<P>  Smooth striding Carmen Furtado of Brazil ran away from the field in the last 300 meters to claim the women's 10,000-meter gold on the opening day of track at the Pan-American Games Friday. </P>
<P> The tall 29-year-old clocked 33 minutes, 10.19 seconds despite strong winds as she defeated Canadian Carol Montgomery by more than 20 meters. The fast-closing Montgomery took silver in 33:13.58 and Mexican Maria Diaz took the bronze in 33:14.94. </P>
<P> ``I am very happy,'' said Furtado, who joyously took a lap of honor with the Brazilian flag. ``The competition was good for me.'' </P>
