<P>  Chinese Premier Li Peng, hailing the 45th anniversary of the People's Republic, declared Friday that China could conquer the difficulties facing it. </P>
<P> In a speech before more than 3,000 foreign and Chinese guests at the Great Hall of the People in central Beijing, Li admitted problems ranging from fierce inflation and poorly performing state enterprises to a deterioration in social order. </P>
<P> ``Measures have already been taken to address these problems,'' he said in his speech on the eve of National Day. </P>
<P> ``We have the confidence and the ability to overcome the difficulties and problems cropping up on the road ahead and push for continuous progress in China's reform and opening-up program and its modernization drive.'' </P>
<P> Guests at the reception included North Korean Vice President Li Jong-ok, currently on the highest ranking visit from that country to China since the death of president Kim Il-sung. </P>
<P> China's premier vowed in his speech that Beijing remained unshakable in its positions towards the British colony of Hong Kong, due to return to China in 1997, and the island of Taiwan. </P>
<P> China has viewed Taiwan as a renegade province since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949 and has bitterly fought any attempt by the island to raise its diplomatic profile. </P>
<P> ``Any attempt at creating 'two Chinas'' or ``one China one Taiwan'' or at splitting China will meet with resolute opposition from the Chinese Government and people and is doomed to failure,'' the premier said. </P>
<P> National Day on Saturday will be marked by celebrations and fireworks in Tiananmen Square. </P>
<P> The vast square will be the site of songs and dances, a gun salute from 60 pieces of artillery and a rendition of the national anthem sung by 100,000 people. </P>
