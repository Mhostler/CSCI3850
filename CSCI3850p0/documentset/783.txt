<P>  Iraq has promised to issue a statement about recognition of Kuwait's sovereignty and U.N.-demarcated borders before the Security Council's next review of sanctions against Baghdad, the council president said Monday. </P>
<P> Asked about a report that Iraqi U.N. envoy Nizar Hamdoon had told him Baghdad was reviewing these issues, council president Yuli Vorontsov of Russia said: ``They promised to make a special statement as to sovereignty, borders and the return of citizens'' -- a reference to several hundred Kuwaitis and others reported missing since the 1991 Gulf war. </P>
<P> Council sources said Hamdoon held meetings last week with all the council's permanent members save the United States, focusing on the next review of sanctions imposed on Iraq since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The last review was held July 18; the next is set for mid-September. </P>
<P> Iraq is anxious to resume oil exports, a mainstay of its economy, which has been badly hurt by sanctions over the past four years. </P>
<P> Baghdad has made progress complying with Gulf War resolutions that called for it to scrap its weapons of mass destruction and for long-term monitoring to ensure it does not reacquire forbidden arms. </P>
<P> But virtually all council members insist that, before sanctions can be lifted, Baghdad must also unequivocally recognize the sovereignty of Kuwait and its U.N.-delineated borders. </P>
<P> One council source said the timing of any Iraqi statement regarding Kuwait could prove a problem for Baghdad, since it would probably want such a declaration to form part of a package that would include the easing of sanctions. </P>
<P> But there is virtually no chance that the council will do that at its September review. At most, it might say that arrangements for long-term monitoring of Iraqi facilities with a military potential were now in place and that a trial period, lasting six months or possibly longer, could begin. </P>
