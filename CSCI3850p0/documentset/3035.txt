<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A total of 506 people, including 221 civil servants, have been arrested and charged in a new sweep under South Korea's anti-corruption drive, state prosecutors said Wednesday. </P>
<P> The arrests were made over the past two months when state prosecutors and investigators staged a nationwide purge against irregularities involving government officials, a statement by the Prosecution Office said. </P>
<P> ``Despite a strong anti-graft campaign by the new government ... systematic irregularities continue among mid and low-ranking officials,'' it said. </P>
<P> ``Special investigation teams will continue until March to concentrate on ending corruption.'' </P>
<P> President Kim Young-sam has placed a high priority on rooting out corruption since he took office in February last year, but his government has been embarrassed by a string of tax scandals in recent months. </P>
<P> Most of the 221 arrested civil servants were charged with taking bribes, while others were charged with forging official documents and negligence. </P>
<P> A former tax officer, Cho Ki-sup, was accused of accepting $26,600 in return for illegally reducing a provincial tax bill for a carmaker from $1.27 million to $506,300, prosecutors said. </P>
<P> Tuesday, a Seoul court sentenced former trade minister Ahn Byong-hwa to three years in jail for accepting $1.14 million in bribes from construction companies for favors relating to power plant contracts. </P>
