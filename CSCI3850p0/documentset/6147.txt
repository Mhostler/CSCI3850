<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Russian President Boris Yeltsin has indicated in a magazine interview that he favors creating a new NATO-styled security organization in Europe that could include Russia -- rather than expanding NATO to include East European nations. </P>
<P> Yeltsin, in an interview with TIME in advance of President Bill Clinton's upcoming Moscow summit, said he and the U.S. leader discussed NATO expansion at length in a telephone conversation on Thursday. </P>
<P> ``We are moving closer to finding a solution that could be acceptable to both sides,'' Yeltsin told the weekly news magazine, adding ``this decision should be taken during our personal meeting.'' </P>
<P> Clinton will participate in ceremonies marking the end of World War Two on May 9 in Moscow and will hold private talks with Yeltsin. </P>
<P> Russia, which is not a member of NATO, has been very critical of attempts by Poland, Hungary and other former Soviet bloc countries to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. </P>
<P> ``We do not think the real problems of European security can be resolved by expanding NATO to the east,'' Yeltsin said in the interview in the latest edition of Time which appears on newsstands Monday. </P>
<P> ``The creation of a model of mutual and comprehensive security should become our common aim in Europe. The dialogue on such a model has already begun in the Organization on Cooperation and Security in Europe. I think diplomats should focus their efforts on thisd, rather than discussing terms for the expansion of NATO,'' he added. </P>
<P> Yeltsin reaffirmed his commitment to holding elections in 1996, telling TIME that Russia faces the real danger of slipping back into an authoritarian regime as the nation continues its painful struggle toward the goals of democracy and a market economy. </P>
<P> ``A strong civic society, a middle class and a culture of law are basic conditions for a stable democracy in any country, but these preconditions are only taking shape in Russia,'' he said in the interview. </P>
<P> But Yeltsin said it would be premature for him to declare whether he would run again in the presidential election. </P>
<P> In the interview, he defended his decision to use Russian troops to prevent Moslem-led rebels in Chechnya from breaking away from the Russian Federation.  He compared his actions to a 1787 incident in American history -- when the governor of Pennsylvania ordered the state militia to prevent the population of Wyoming Valley from seceding and forming a separate state. </P>
