<P>  Elvis Stojko had insisted he would be skating ``for my honor and my pride.'' </P>
<P> Both survived intact, along with the 23-year-old Canadian's grip on the world men's figure skating title Thursday night. </P>
<P> Stojko, in second place before the final program, defied the doubts arising from an eight-week physical and mental struggle to deal with a severe ankle injury that prevented him defending his Canadian title in January. </P>
<P> He defied the skeptics, who said that after so many adjustments to his training at such a crucial time in the season, a gold medal-winning performance would be beyond him. </P>
<P> And he defied a powerful line-up of rivals who were looking to depose the Canadian if he came up short. </P>
<P> He even defied his own expectations. ``The biggest thing for me is just being here,'' he said earlier in the week. </P>
<P> Stojko succeeded where many had predicted failure as his rivals made the serious mistakes and the Canadian recovered from a couple of small slips to throw in a title-clinching extra triple jump right at the end of his program. </P>
<P> The triple toe loop, in combination with the triple lutz, decided the result after he had wobbled in landing a triple loop and put a hand down trying his famed quadruple toe loop. </P>
<P> ``I didn't think I needed the last jump to win. I just wanted to put it in because I had missed the quad,'' Stojko said. </P>
<P> ``I don't think anything's impossible if you put your mind to it. Once again I proved to myself I can do it no matter what.'' </P>
<P> Stojko severely damaged ligaments in his right ankle landing a jump two days before the Canadian championships. </P>
<P> The healing process was slow. He could barely jump at all for the first few weeks and some of the tougher triple jumps -- the axel, lutz and flip -- he resumed only 10 days before the competition. </P>
<P> ``But I'm glad I went through those eight weeks to have what I have now,'' he said. ``It's hard to put into words what this means. It is a sweet victory, there has been a lot of doubt and frustration. </P>
<P> ``People didn't think I could come back. I had to learn to trust myself again. I had to prove this to myself.'' </P>
<P> Todd Eldredge's title bid foundered when he plunged to the ice landing a triple axel. </P>
<P> The American, also 23, finished with the silver -- a superb achievement after three years out of the limelight because of fitness and health problems. </P>
<P> He had no complaints. ``Elvis skated great. He had two triple combinations including the one at the end that was just incredible. All the things he's had to go through, he came back real strong.'' </P>
<P> Frenchman Philippe Candeloro lost his chance for a higher place with his final jump, also a triple axel, on which he fell. </P>
<P> That, together with the double axel he fluffed in the short program, left him third -- one down on his position a year ago. </P>
<P> Olympic champion Alexei Urmanov remained fourth, matching his 1994 performance. </P>
