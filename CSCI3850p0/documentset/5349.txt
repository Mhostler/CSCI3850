<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Moderate Republican Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania declared his candidacy for president Thursday with assaults on ``the intolerant right'' of his own party and ''the incompetent left'' of President Clinton's party. </P>
<P> Standing between the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial on Washington's central Mall, behind the White House, the 65-year-old son of Jewish immigrants became the fifth declared Republican candidate, a moderate among conservatives. </P>
<P> ``Today I offer my ideas, my experience and my energy to the American people to lead this great nation into the 21st century as the next president of the United States,'' he said to cheers from several hundred people, including his family. </P>
<P> His declaration groups him with vocal conservatives who have formally declared -- Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, commentator Pat Buchanan and talk show host Alan Keyes of Maryland. </P>
<P> But the field is incomplete. The current heavyweight among those running, who will announce formally April 10, is Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, way ahead in polls. </P>
<P> A self-declared conservative on fiscal matters but a ''social libertarian'' on personal rights, Specter is ''pro-choice'' on abortion and made a point of stressing that. </P>
<P> ``I pledge to lead the fight to strip the strident anti-choice language from the Republican national platform and replace it with language which respects human life, but also respects diversity of opinion within our own party on this issue,'' he said. </P>
<P> Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League (NARAL) welcomed Specter's entry into the race and said his candidacy ``may help the pro-abortion Republican majority reclaim their party.'' </P>
<P> California Gov. Pete Wilson, expected to announce his candidacy soon, is the only other prospective Republican candidate who favors letting women decide on abortions. </P>
<P> Specter's strategy is clearly to paint himself -- not his conservative rivals -- as the champion of mainstream values. </P>
<P> A new CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll issued Thursday backed him up, at least on abortion. Seventy percent wanted a 1996 presidential candidate who would keep abortion laws the way they are. Twenty-one percent wanted to make abortion illegal in most cases. </P>
<P> ``Neither this nation or this party can afford a Republican candidate so captive to the demands of the intolerant right that we end up by re-electing a president of the incompetent left,'' he said -- and then said again, word for word. </P>
<P> He singled out Christian Coalition leaders Pat Robertson and Ralph Reed as well as nomination rival Buchanan. </P>
<P> But Specter bashed Democrat Clinton -- expected to win renomination despite lackluster poll ratings -- as well. </P>
<P> ``My commitment to America is to replace a president who has been inattentive, inactive, and indecisive when it comes to America's vital foreign policy interests,'' he said. </P>
<P> A former racket-busting Philadelphia prosecutor, Specter starts out far behind Dole and others in poll support and in money. An aide said he has raised about $1 million in a race some expect to cost at least $20 million. </P>
<P> Dole leads in the latest Times-Mirror poll with 45 percent of 930 Republicans surveyed. Gramm was second with 13 percent, followed by Buchanan at 11 percent. Specter, Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana and Alexander tied at a lowly 3 percent. </P>
<P> Outlining his agenda, Specter proposed a ``flat'' income tax plan to ``move America toward unprecedented prosperity,'' a tough crime program and a balanced budget goal. </P>
