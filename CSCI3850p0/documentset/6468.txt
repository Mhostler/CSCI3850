<DATELINE>PARIS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A young French skinhead has confessed to drowning a Moroccan immigrant in the River Seine during a May Day march by the extreme-right National Front in Paris, justice sources said Thursday. </P>
<P> The skinhead, identified as Mickael Freminet from the suburbs of Reims in northeastern France, and aged either 19 or 20, acknowledged slapping and pushing Brahim Bouarram, 29, as the North African stood on the towpath along the Seine but said he did not mean to kill him, the sources said. </P>
<P> National Front security chief Bernard Courcelle told Reuters his party had conducted its own investigation into Bouarram's death, and had led police to the suspect and to two alleged accomplices, also in police custody. </P>
<P> Numerous politicians had linked the drowning to the anti-immigration Front and its fiery leader Jean-Marie Le Pen after eyewitnesses identified the assailants as skinheads who had broken away from the Front's march through central Paris. </P>
<P> Critics accuse Le Pen, who won 15 percent of the vote in the first round of last month's presidential election, of inciting violence against immigrants. </P>
<P> But Courcelle called them ``little hooligans ... that even the skinheads in Reims wanted nothing to do with.'' </P>
<P> Police said they were members of a little-known far-right organization, L'Oeuvre Francaise (France's Work). </P>
<P> The National Front said the suspects were neither members nor supporters of their movement. </P>
<P> ``Their obvious goal was to sabotage the National Front's demonstration,'' it said in a statement. </P>
<P> Marie-Therese Freminet, mother of the main suspect, said her son had left the military, where he was a paratrooper, just a month ago. He had been one of 80 people from the area to travel to Paris by National Front bus for the march. </P>
<P> She and her husband, Emile, told French television their son had denied involvement in the killing and was not a skinhead. </P>
<P> Asked by the TF1 channel if their son was an extreme rightist, the father replied: ``Not very much. We are not racist.'' </P>
<P> Freminet was one of five arrested in Reims Wednesday in a probe into the death, which has provoked outrage in France. </P>
<P> Four of the five detained Wednesday were still in police custody in the capital Thursday, justice sources said. They included Freminet and his two suspected accomplices. </P>
<P> Another person was taken into custody in Reims Thursday, French radio said. </P>
<P> Police last week detained 30 skinheads but later released all but one, who was held on an unrelated weapons charge. </P>
<P> The drowning occurred less than a week before last Sunday's presidential election run-off, won by Jacques Chirac, the conservative mayor of Paris. </P>
<P> More than 10,000 anti-racist protesters marched through the city after the killing, many chanting slogans against Le Pen and his anti-immigrant political movement. </P>
<P> Bouarram, who had worked in a small grocery shop in Paris and had two young children, was buried last Saturday near Tiznit in southern Morocco. </P>
