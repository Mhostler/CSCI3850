<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Gunshots were fired at the White House early Saturday and a bullet landed on a balcony below President Clinton's family quarters. It was the second shooting incident at the mansion in less than two months. </P>
<P> No injuries or damage resulted and Clinton and his family slept through the incident, White House chief of staff Leon Panetta said. </P>
<P> Secret Service agents and U.S. Park Police officers reported hearing between four and six shots fired at about 2:05 a.m. EST from near the Ellipse, a grassy, open field across the street from the rear of the White House. </P>
<P> Two spent 9mm bullets, believed fired from the same weapon, were recovered in good condition, indicating to investigators that they had traveled a long distance. </P>
<P> One round landed on the first-floor balcony of the White House, one floor below the family living quarters, and the other was found on the South Lawn driveway, said Secret Service spokesman Dave Adams. The White House is protected by bullet-proof windows. </P>
<P> Clinton, his wife, Hillary, and their daughter, Chelsea, were asleep in the White House during the shooting. Aides informed the president about the incident when they woke him to make sure he was all right, Panetta said. </P>
<P> He said the bullets appeared to have been fired from a distance because they ``fell short'' of the White House. </P>
<P> ``We don't know whether it was someone firing haphazardly from the Ellipse, whether it was someone who was driving by and firing, but obviously the matter continues to be under investigation,'' he said. </P>
<P> Secret Service spokesman Carl Meyer said that since the bullets were in good shape authorities were exploring the possibility ``that this was just a couple of stray bullets that came in'' in a violent city where gunfire is rampant. </P>
<P> Agents said they may have been fired from a semi-automatic handgun but that ballistics tests would tell for sure. Other than that information was skimpy. </P>
<P> Authorities interviewed potential witnesses, including a number of homeless people who sleep on park benches in the Ellipse, but Adams said ``nothing concrete'' to provide leads for a suspect had resulted. </P>
<P> The shooting marked the second time this fall that the White House had come under gunfire and raised further questions about whether security around the White House complex should be extended. </P>
<P> Meyer said he was reminded of an incident involving former President Bush when a stray bullet landed harmlessly near a motorcade in Washington. </P>
<P> Panetta said authorities have to strike a balance between protecting the president and providing access to the American people ``because you don't want to turn the White House, the United States of America, into a fortress.'' </P>
<P> He said the incident would be added to a Treasury Department review of presidential security. The Secret Service already wants to close off Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House and take other measures to extend the security perimeter. </P>
<P> The incident altered Clinton's routine. With the rear lawn and driveway cordoned off as a crime scene, his limousine departed from a protected part of the front of the house when he traveled to suburban Virginia to deliver his weekly radio address. </P>
<P> He did not respond to reporters' questions when asked whether he heard the shots and whether he felt safe at the White House. </P>
<P> Authorities cordoned off the streets immediately around the White House and were using metal detectors to search for other bullets or spent shells. </P>
<P> ``We don't know who did this,'' a Park Police spokesman told WTOP radio. ``We don't know if the White House was the target or if they were shooting at each other and the White House got in the way. We don't know how many, whether they were on foot, whether they were in a car ...'' </P>
<P> Adams said: ``Whether or not it was intentional is too soon to say because the investigation is continuing.'' </P>
<P> A Colorado man, Francisco Duran, is accused of strafing the north side of the White House with 29 bullets from a semi-automatic assault weapon Oct. 29. He was arrested and charged on 11 counts, including attempting to assassinate the president. He has pleaded not guilty. </P>
<P> On Sept. 12, an unemployed truck driver was killed when he crashed a small airplane onto the White House South Lawn. Clinton and his family were not at the White House at the time of that incident. </P>
