<P>  Mexico reacted angrily Wednesday to California's passage of a proposal that will cut off welfare and social benefits to illegal immigrants. </P>
<P> In a statement rejecting ``all open and undercover forms of discrimination and any xenophobic practices,'' the Mexican government said Proposition 187, which was accepted by Californian voters in Tuesday elections, undermined the human rights of immigrants. </P>
<P> ``Mexico remains loyal to its traditional respect for the principle of non-interference in internal affairs (of other countries), but it is equally respectful of international law that protects the fundamental rights of migrants,'' it said. </P>
<P> Most of the estimated 1.7 million illegal immigrants in California targetted by Proposition 187 are Mexicans. </P>
<P> If it survives expected legal challenges, 187 would cut off welfare, education and non-emergency health care to illegal immigrants and require teachers and doctors to report people they suspected of being in the country illegally. </P>
<P> The measure, supported by California Gov. Pete Wilson, who was relected Tuesday, caused outrage in California's large Latino community and has been attacked by all sectors of Mexican society. </P>
<P> Leading Mexican businessmen have threatened economic boycotts against California-based companies. </P>
<P> In its statement, the Mexican government said it would continue to offer consular protection to all Mexicans abroad. </P>
