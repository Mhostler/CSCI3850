<P>  Idled National Hockey League players are considering lacing up their skates for charity as the lockout by team owners continues, a players' union spokesman said Monday. </P>
<P> Several players, including superstar Wayne Gretzky, have expressed an interest in participating in a series of exhibition games in cities where there are no NHL franchises. </P>
<P> ``It would give the players a chance to play during the lockout,'' said NHL Players' Association spokesman Steve McAllister. ``It would include the superstars as well as the other players.'' </P>
<P> McCallister said proceeds for the games would go to charity, but details on locations and the number of games was still being worked out. He said they hoped to play the first game next month. </P>
<P> The NHL season, that was originally to have started on October 1, has been on hold due to a labor impasse. NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said the season would not start until the league and players' union reach a new collective bargaining agreement. </P>
<P> An exhibition hockey game is already planned for October 30 at an arena in Sarnia, Ontario, but it is independent of the players' association effort. </P>
<P> Dino Ciccarelli and Shawn Burr, two Detroit Red Wings players who are part owners of a minor league team in Sarnia, have signed up a group professional players for a game in the industrial city for Saturday. </P>
