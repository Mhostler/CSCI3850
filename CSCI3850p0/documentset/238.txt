<DATELINE>GOMA, Zaire (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Waves of refugees fleeing Rwanda's civil war poured into Zaire for a second day early Friday along with the retreating army of the collapsed government. </P>
<P> Columns of people with bundles and cooking pots piled on their heads trudged into Goma. Truckloads of soldiers, some wounded, joined the exodus -- possibly the largest in Africa. </P>
<P> Aid agencies estimate 800,000 to one million people to pour across the border by the weekend. At least 200,000 were believed to have crossed Thursday. </P>
<P> The refugees are mostly Hutus fleeing the rapid advance of the Tutsi-dominated Rwanda Patriotic Front whose well- equipped and disciplined army has routed the government in three months. </P>
<P> The U.N. Security Council, warned by France of another humanitarian catastrophe, demanded an immediate cease-fire in Rwanda Thursday and urged the international community to supply relief for refugees fleeing rebel troops. </P>
<P> Zaireans said rebel forces were closing in on Gisenyi, the lakeside resort on Zaire border where members of the rump government met in a luxury hotel before reportedly fleeing southwards Thursday into the French-declared protection zone in Cyangugu. </P>
<P> But the French military in Goma, main base for its humanitarian Operation Turquoise, has not confirmed that the president, prime minister and other officials had reached Cyangugu. </P>
<P> The French foreign ministry said in a statement Thursday the officials were unwelcome in the French zone, indicating that some members of the Hutu government are likely to be wanted by a U.N. war crimes tribunal on charges of organizing the systematic genocide of the Tutsi minority. </P>
<P> The ministry said it was up to the United Nations and the international community -- not France -- to determine what to do with the officials. </P>
<P> But a senior French official said Friday that French troops will detain the Rwandan officials if they are found in the safe zone. </P>
<P> ``We would put them not quite in prison but under the guard of French soldiers to prevent them eventually continuing their activities and to hand them over to the United Nations if this is requested,'' the official said. </P>
<P> The official said ministry's statement was prompted by the Rwandans requests for asylum. </P>
<P> On Monday, the commander of French forces in Rwanda, Brigadier General Jean-Claude Lafourcade, told reporters in Goma that he would allow members of the government into the zone as refugees. Paris must then decide what to do with them, he said. </P>
<P> President Clinton is expected to break ties with Rwanda's Hutu rump government shortly and ask its ambassador in Washington to leave the country, sources at the United Nations said Thursday. The sources said an announcement could be made Friday. </P>
<P> The Rwanda government, nearly defeated by the rebel Tutsi-dominated rebels, still occupies embassies around the world and is represented in the U.N. Security Council. </P>
<P> France and aid agencies made desperate appeals to the international community to send supplies for the refugees and urged the rebels to halt their advance. </P>
<P> In the Rwandan capital of Kigali, the rebels' prime minister-designate, Faustin Twagiramungu, returned from exile Thursday, saying his priority was to reassure Rwandans fleeing the rebel advance. </P>
