<P>  Cuban leader Fidel Castro conceded Saturday that part of his Communist-ruled island's population was unhappy but said the ``immense majority'' of Cuba's people were solidly behind him and his government despite recent unrest. </P>
<P> Castro was asked by reporters on arrival at Bogota airport for Colombia's presidential inauguration Sunday of Ernesto Samper about clashes Friday between stone-throwing protesters and Cuban police in Havana. </P>
<P> The incidents were described by some Colombian media as the most serious protests against Castro's Communist government since the 1959 revolution that brought him to power. </P>
<P> ``We are not happy with the difficulties and we fight against them and we make progress but we really are going through a difficult moment and it's true that there is what you are calling dissatisfaction, discontent in a part of the population,'' Castro said. </P>
<P> ``But we must also take into account an immense patriotism in the immense majority of the population which understands the causes of the problems which we have and which is firm in its defense of the fatherland, the revolution and socialism.'' </P>
<P> Castro has repeatedly blamed the severe economic crisis of his island and its food shortages on the United States trade embargo against Cuba. </P>
<P> He is due to return to Cuba late Sunday after attending the inauguration of Samper, who has staunchly defended Colombia's decision last year to re-establish diplomatic relations with Havana and wants to strengthen ties between the two countries. </P>
