<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Defense Secretary William Perry's plan to cut U.S. defense spending another $6 billion next year hit immediate opposition Wednesday in the new Republican-controlled Congress. </P>
<P> Perry defended the cut in his first testimony in Congress on his $258 billion defense request for next year, telling the House National Security Committee it will maintain a stong U.S. military force. </P>
<P> But the committee's chairman, Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., told Perry the $6 billion cut in his request for new money would translate into a $10 billion cut in actual military spending next year, and said he did not believe U.S. forces can stand such hemorrhaging. </P>
<P> ``I have a hard time believing that an outlay reduction of this magnitude is fully consistent with maintenance of a capable, ready force -- particularly after a decade of declining defense budgets and ... last year's revelations of readiness problems throughout the force,'' Spence said. </P>
<P> He said Perry plans to increase defense spending in about the year 2000, but said ``I believe that the hemorrhaging must be stopped earlier than next century.'' </P>
<P> The ``Contract With America'' that Republicans say helped them win control of Congress in elections last year includes a promise to halt defense cuts it says have dangerously weakened military forces. </P>
<P> But both Perry and General John Shalikashvili, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, told the committee the continuing post-Cold War defense cuts will maintain a strong U.S. military and denied the force has combat readiness problems. </P>
<P> They said combat readiness is as high as it has ever been, Shalikashvili blaming readiness problems late last year on a temporary shortage of money because of the costs of U.S. military operations in Haiti, Rwanda and Kuwait. </P>
<P> Perry said if Congress approved more money for defense, he would not spend it on military force strength or readiness. He said he would spend it on housing for troops and families, and possibly new equipment. </P>
<P> Perry and Shalikashvili also said they and military chiefs agree that U.S. forces will be able to carry out President Clinton's strategy of being able to fight two Gulf-like wars at nearly the same time. </P>
<P> But Shalikashvili said that will only continue to be true if Congress approves requested training money and enhancements, particularly ships and C-17 transport planes needed to move forces quickly to a war. </P>
<P> When asked for an overall assessment of threats, Perry said potential threats ``posed by extremists in the Middle East and North African countries,'' presumably Algeria, has grown worse since early last year.  ``It was understood to be a problem then but the problem I think is more worrisome today even than it was at that time.'' </P>
<P> He also said the danger of a spread to nuclear, chemical and other weapons of mass destruction has ``if anything intensified in the last year and a half.'' </P>
