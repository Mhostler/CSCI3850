<P>  John Kennedy Jr., a former assistant district attorney in Manhattan, has received a summons for illegally walking a dog without a leash in a New York City park, the Daily News reported Saturday. </P>
<P> The incident occurred Thursday when the son of President John Kennedy was walking a large black dog in Madison Square Park near 23rd Street in midtown, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> It said that a park patrol officer, summons book in hand, confronted Kennedy, asking, ``Did you know that you are violating the law?'' </P>
<P> Kennedy nodded, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> After a brief exchange, the officer then wrote Kennedy a summons. </P>
<P> ``Kennedy was pretty good about it,'' the newspaper quoted a witness to the incident as saying. ``There was no hassle.'' </P>
<P> Kennedy faces a $100 fine. </P>
<P> If he decides to fight the summons, he may have to appear in court. But if he loses, the fine would escalate to at least $1,000, the newspaper reported. </P>
