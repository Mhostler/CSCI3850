<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  An explosion rocked the headquarters of the U.S. Naval Ordnance Center 25 miles south of Washington on the Potomac River late Monday night, officials said. </P>
<P> There were no reported injuries at the base in Indian Head, Maryland, which houses Navy weapons and ammunition. </P>
<P> The blast, which occured about 10:45 p.m. EDT , was contained in a single building, the base spokeswoman, Jennifer McGraw, said. Area firefighters offered their services, but base personnel were able to cope by themselves. </P>
<P> ``We have offers from the local fire department to come in and help, and we do not need it,'' McGraw said. </P>
<P> A Navy spokesman at the Pentagon said the explosion involved conventional ``cartridge-activated devices'' such as those that propel a pilot's ejection seat from a Navy aircraft. </P>
<P> ``We're not talking large explosive shells here,'' Navy Commander Stephen Pietropaoli said by telephone. He said the aftermath of the blast was ``more a question of a smolder than a real fire.'' </P>
<P> The Sheriff's Department of Charles County, where the weapons center is located, said there had been no need to evacuate anyone and that no injuries were reported. </P>
<P> There was no immediate indication of what caused the blast, Cathy Rickett of the Sheriff's Department added in a telephone interview from nearby LaPlata, Maryland. </P>
