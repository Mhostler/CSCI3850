<P>  The United Nations special envoy to Angola said Thursday there were problems implementing a November peace accord aimed at ending Africa's longest war. </P>
<P> ``There are some problems, which make the peace process slow down, but none are considered catastrophic or bombastic,'' U.NN special representative Alioune Blondin Beye told a news conference in the Angolan capital Luanda. </P>
<P> He said attacks on civilians, illegal troop movements and build-up of military equipment were some of the violations of the accord signed between the Angolan government and the UNITA rebels in the Zambian capital Lusaka last November. </P>
<P> ``These incidents make us look more closely at what either or both sides are doing, but the absence of actual cease-fire violations keeps me optimistic as to the completion of the Lusaka protocol,'' Blondin Beye added. </P>
<P> He expressed confidence that the second phase of troop disengagement would be completed by the April 10 deadline. </P>
<P> Blondin Beye said government and UNITA -- National Union for the Total Independence of Angola -- claims of cease-fire violations were being investigated. </P>
<P> UNITA says government troops are still within firing range in Cafunfo, the diamond center in northern Lunda Norte province, and in Leua and Cameia Lumege in central Moxico province. </P>
<P> The government says the rival sides are at least 25 miles apart. </P>
<P> The United Nations plans to send about 7,000 peacekeeping troops to Angola but is first seeking a clear commitment to peace from both sides in the conflict. </P>
<P> UNITA has been fighting a bush war against the ruling MPLA (Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola) almost continuously since independence from Portugal in 1975. </P>
