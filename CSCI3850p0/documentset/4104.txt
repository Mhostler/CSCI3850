<P>  Burma's Karen guerrillas say their 46-year war for autonomy from the central Rangoon government is not over despite the loss of their Manerplaw headquarters last week. </P>
<P> But the guerrillas admit they also face a battle on a different front as disillusionment with the war grows within the Karen community. </P>
<P> Karen commander Gen. Bo Mya, speaking to Reuters on the Thai side of the border last Friday, vowed the fight for greater autonomy would continue. </P>
<P> ``The Karen revolution will never die, it will never collapse,'' he said while Burmese troops entered his abandoned headquarters, torched by retreating guerrillas on his orders the previous evening. </P>
<P> The Karen would now adopt mobile guerrilla tactics and move deeper into Burma, he said. </P>
<P> The speed with which Manerplaw fell, just four days after the Burmese began their final push, was partly due to a decision not to waste lives defending it when the final outcome was inevitable, guerrilla sources said. </P>
<P> Speaking privately, some guerrillas welcomed the loss, saying they would no longer be burdened with defending a fixed position and could now fight like real guerrillas. </P>
<P> But another decisive factor in the fall of Manerplaw was the help Burmese forces got from several hundred Buddhist Karen rebels who in December mutinied against Bo Mya and the other Christian leaders of the Karen National Union (KNU). </P>
<P> The mutineers, who formed their own Democratic Kayin (Karen) Buddhist Army, provided the key to the capture of Manerplaw by guiding Burmese forces to the weakest points in its defences, KNU leaders said. </P>
<P> The mutiny rocked the KNU to the core and guerrilla leaders were quick to blame the Rangoon junta, the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), for instigating the split. </P>
<P> Many observers, while not doubting that SLORC played a part in fomenting the division and is now driving the wedge in deeper at every opportunity, say the KNU leadership should have seen trouble coming and done more to head it off. </P>
