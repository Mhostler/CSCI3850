<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Air Jordan ruled in New York City, but out west in Sacramento, the Magic failed. </P>
<P> Michael Jordan scored an NBA season-high 55 points and hit Bill Wennington with a perfect pass under the hoop for the winning basket with 3.1 seconds to go as the Chicago Bulls edged the New York Knicks 113-111 Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``Everyone was hopping to the ball the whole game,'' said Wennington, who scored his only basket of the game after Knicks center Patrick Ewing left him to double-team Jordan. </P>
<P> ``So we gave the open side to Michael to create. He was going to look from wherever the rotation came from and I knew Patrick would leave me. I just stepped under the basket and put it in.'' </P>
<P> Jordan, in his fifth game back in the NBA, hit 21-of-37 from the field to surpass the 53 points Willie Burton of the Philadelphia 76ers tallied against Miami on December 13. </P>
<P> ``My attitude was to just relax and let the game come to me,'' said Jordan. </P>
<P> Scottie Pippen collected 19 points, nine rebounds and eight assists and B.J. Armstrong scored 16 points as the Bulls won their second straight. </P>
<P> Ewing led New York with 36 points, 27 in the second half. </P>
<P> ``I know what will be written about is what Michael did but let's also remember from this game how Patrick went off in the second half,'' Knicks coach Pat Riley said. ``He was very active, blocking shots, helping out on defense. He made seven or eight incredible plays.'' </P>
<P> In Sacramento, Mitch Richmond scored 35 points and Walt Williams added 26, including four in a 12-2 game-ending run, as the Kings upset the Orlando Magic 117-106. </P>
<P> The Kings rallied from a 10-point fourth-quarter deficit, outscoring the Magic 36-18 in the final period. </P>
<P> Shaquille O'Neal scored 32 points, Horace Grant had 22 and Anfernee Hardaway 21 for the NBA-best Magic (52-18), who hvae lost 10 of their last 13 road games. </P>
<P> Sacramento has a one-game lead over Denver for the eighth and final Western Conference playoff spot. </P>
<P> In Phoenix, Jeff Hornacek scored 31 points to lead the Utah Jazz to a 111-102 victory over the Suns. </P>
<P> Karl Malone had 26 points and 16 rebounds and John Stockton added 22 points and 12 assists for the Jazz, who surpassed San Antonio for the best record in the Western Conference (52-19). </P>
<P> Dan Majerle scored 20 points and Kevin Johnson 19 for the Suns, who shot just 36 percent (31-of-86) from the field and lost their third straight for the first time this season. </P>
<P> Charles Barkley scored 18 points on 7-of-23 shooting and failed to lead Phoenix in scoring and rebounding for the first time in 12 games. Barkley was ejected with 3:02 left after receiving his second technical for arguing with the referees. </P>
<P> In Houston, Cedric Ceballos and Elden Campbell scored 17 points apiece to lead six Lakers in double figures as Los Angeles beat the undermanned Rockets 106-96. </P>
<P> Carl Herrera scored 22 points and Clyde Drexler had 20 for Houston, which played without sidelined starters Hakeem Olajuwon and Vernon Maxwell. The Rockets lost for the fifth time in five games. </P>
<P> In Miami, Dee Brown tied a career high with 41 points and Dominique Wilkins added 19 to help the Boston Celtics to a 126-115 victory over the Heat. </P>
<P> Dino Radja added 18 points and 12 rebounds for Boston, which moved into the eighth and final Eastern Conference playoff spot despite winning just their third in 12 games. </P>
<P> Glen Rice scored 39 points and rookie Khalid Reeves had a career-high 24 for Miami, which lost its second straight and fell a half-game behind Boston, along with New Jersey and Milwaukee. </P>
<P> At New Jersey, Chris Mullin scored 25 points to lead seven Warriors in double figures as Golden State defeated the Nets 127-113 to end a four-game losing streak. </P>
<P> Kenny Anderson collected 22 points and 14 assists and Derrick Coleman also scored 22 for the Nets, who were without injured starting forward P.J. Brown. </P>
