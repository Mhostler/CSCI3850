<P>  A Dutch U.N. soldier was killed Wednesday evening when a mortar bomb or artillery round hit a U.N. post near an area of recent heavy fighting in northern Bosnia, a United Nations spokesman said. </P>
<P> ``A Dutch soldier was killed when his observation post was targeted by mortar or artillery fire at 2140 hours, 2:40 p.m. EST, about ten kilometres (6.2 miles) south of Stolice,'' said Maj. Herve Gourmelon, a U.N. spokesman. </P>
<P> ``One round landed ten metres (about 30 feet) south of the observation post and the other scored a direct hit. The origin of fire is unknown at this time.'' </P>
<P> Despite an agreement for a country-wide truce, Muslim-led Bosnian government forces launched an offensive in the Stolice area and a key Serb communcation tower there 11 days ago. </P>
<P> Fierce fighting in the area about 19 miles east of Tuzla had subsided somewhat Wednesday, U.N. sources said. Two other U.N. observation posts recorded near-misses in shelling incidents around Tuzla during the day. </P>
<P> Gourmelon said there had been no other casualties in Wednesday evening's incident. He reported the Dutch soldier's body had been recovered and that the observation post was still manned by Dutch peacekeepers. </P>
