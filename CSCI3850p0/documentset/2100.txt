<P>  Police shot dead eight Muslim militants who opened fire on them in southern Egypt Tuesday evening, security sources said. </P>
<P> Police were searching fields near the town of Mallawi, about 130 miles south of Cairo, when they came under fire. </P>
<P> The police fired back, killing eight people who later turned out to be members of the Gama'a al-Islamiya (Islamic Group), they said. There were no casualties among the police. </P>
<P> Police found one automatic rifle and five primitive firearms at the scene, the sources said. </P>
<P> A few hours later three gunmen shot and wounded two civilian village guards and a civilian in the nearby village of Nuway, possibly in revenge for the police killing the eight, the sources said. The gunmen escaped. </P>
<P> Police named the eight dead and said they were wanted for attacks on policemen and civilians in the Mallawi area, one of the main regions of conflict between the Gama'a and the Egyptian security forces. </P>
<P> The Gama'a has been fighting since 1992 to overthrow the government and set up a strict Islamic state. </P>
