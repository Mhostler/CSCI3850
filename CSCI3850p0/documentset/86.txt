<P>  Prosecutors for the first time accused former Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti of being a member of the Mafia, Italian media reported Wednesday. </P>
<P> The reports said the prosecutors, who want Andreotti put on trial, have hardened their charges against him from Mafia association to full-fledged membership of the crime organization. </P>
<P> The move, which the reports said was the result of new investigations, was yet another setback for the 74-year-old life-senator who was prime minister seven times. </P>
<P> In an interview with the Rome newspaper La Repubblica, Andreotti again denied all charges against him and said he did not fully understand the change in the indictment. </P>
<P> Andreotti's lawyer Odoardo Ascari called the changes ``idiotic.'' </P>
<P> Prosecutors last month asked a judicial superior to have Andreotti, a Christian Democrat, tried on charges that he had helped the Mafia during his long political career. A senior judge will now decide if there is sufficient evidence to try him. </P>
<P> Andreotti has said the charges, based on testimony from turncoats, were part of a Mafia plot to punish him for crackdowns on organized crime by governments he headed. </P>
