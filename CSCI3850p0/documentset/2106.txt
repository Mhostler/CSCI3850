<P>  Eight daily newspapers in Algeria started a three-day strike Wednesday to protest the killing of journalists. </P>
<P> At least 17 journalists have been killed in Algeria since May 1993 in attacks blamed by the authorities on Muslim fundamentalists. </P>
<P> ``The list of press freedom martyrs gets longer daily .. At this rate, editorial staffs will be decimated,'' editors said in a statement anouncing the strike. </P>
<P> The striking newspapers are six leading French language dailies -- El Watan, Liberte, le Matin, Soir d'Algerie, La Tribune, L'Opinion -- and two Arabic papers, al-Khabar and al-Hayat. </P>
<P> Muslim militants launched a guerrilla war against Algeria's military-backed authorities after the government cancelled a general election in January 1992 which Islamists were poised to win. </P>
