<P>  The House delayed a vote on the balanced budget amendment as backers scurried for votes, an aide to House Majority Leader Richard Armey, R-Texas, said Tuesday. </P>
<P> The House vote will take place during the week of Jan. 23, instead of Jan. 19, Ed Gillespie said. </P>
<P> He said the measure was being delayed so the House can consider a bill next week to limit ``unfunded mandates'' -- the federal practice of telling states what to do without giving them the money to do it. </P>
<P> The ``unfunded mandates'' measure is designed to ease the concern of states that they will have to bear a large part of the spending cuts -- estimated at from $1.2 trillion to $1.7 trillion -- necessary to balance the budget by 2002 when the amendment is to take effect. </P>
<P> ``Some governors wanted the unfunded mandates bill first and the states have to ratify this,'' he said. Although the governors have no direct voice in the amendment, Gillespie noted: ``They talk to House members.'' </P>
<P> A constitutional amendment requires a two-thirds vote of each house of Congress and ratification by the legislatures of 38 states. </P>
<P> The House version is a tougher sell than the Senate version of the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution because of its tax provisions. </P>
<P> The Senate version requires three-fifths votes of all members in each house to raise the nation's credit limit or permit an annual budget deficit, replacing the current majority with the same margin required to close a filibuster in the Senate. </P>
<P> The House version is the same except it also requires a three-fifths vote of all members to raise taxes. Gillespie said that a majority of House Republicans favor the tax provision. </P>
<P> Although that is a far cry from the two-thirds of each house required to approve a constitutional amendment, Gillespie was optimistic the amendment will pass the House. </P>
<P> Even if it should pass, Senate leaders said their members will never pass the House version. </P>
<P> ``We don't see any way we can pass it over here,'' Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, told reporters. </P>
