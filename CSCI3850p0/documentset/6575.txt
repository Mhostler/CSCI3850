<DATELINE>KAMIKU ISSHIKI, Japan, May 16 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Japanese police, some carrying caged canaries to warn of lethal gas, started a raid here on Tuesday on the headquarters of a doomsday cult responsible for the Tokyo subway poison gas attack. </P>
<P> Hundreds of police were involved in the raid which began at about 5.35 a.m. (2035 GMT on March 15). </P>
<P> The raid was mainly aimed at arresting mystic guru Shoko Asahara, founder of the Aum Shinri Kyo (Supreme Truth) sect, who was believed to be hiding in the headquarters in this small village at the foot of Mt Fuji 65 miles (100 kms) west of Tokyo. </P>
<P> A senior police officer said similiar raids were in progress at 130 locations throughout Japan, including the sect's offices in the capital Tokyo. </P>
<P> The raid started when police used a circular saw to cut through a steel door on the first floor of a three-storey building which was Asahara's living quarters. </P>
<P> There were no signs of resistance in the first minutes from sect members inside the sprawling complex of buildings where the cult has lethal chemicals stored and operates a laboratory. </P>
<P> Police involved in the raid carried gas masks in pouches strapped to their waist and wore riot helmets. </P>
<P> Hours earlier police were granted warrants to arrest Asahara and 40 followers for suspicion of mass murder in the March 20 sarin nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway which killed 12 people and injured more than 5,000. </P>
<P> All major Japanese television networks switched to live coverage of the event. </P>
<P> ``Guru Asahara, at last it's X-day,'' one television commentator said. </P>
