<NOTES>    MONTREAL (Reuter) - Pierre Turgeon, welcome to Montreal.</NOTES>
<DATELINE></DATELINE>
<P> Turgeon, acquired in a blockbuster trade earlier in the day, keyed a three-goal third-period rally with a goal and two assists to lead the Montreal Canadiens to a 6-5 victory over the Quebec Nordiques Wednesday. </P>
<P> Turgeon and Vladimir Malakhov were traded from the New York Islanders for Kirk Muller, the Montreal captain, Mathieu Schneider and Craig Darby. </P>
<P> ``What a start,'' said Turgeon. ``To play for the Canadiens in the Forum and beat Quebec... I'm very happy about today. I never even had a chance to practice with this team.'' </P>
<P> Quebec took a 5-3 lead 2:42 into the third period on a goal by Scott Young but Turgeon and Vincent Damphousse went to work just 17 seconds later, setting up Bryan Fogarty's second goal of the game, a 60-foot shot from above the left point. </P>
<P> Turgeon's first goal in a Montreal uniform came 9:36 into the final stanza when he tied the game 5-5 with a tap-in from the right doorstep. Damphousse put Montreal ahead to stay 3:26 later when Turgeon fed him behind the net and Damphousse came out to jam the puck in. </P>
<P> ``I'll do well with Turgeon on my line,'' said Damphousse. ''I can see that we're going to play well together.'' </P>
<P> He added: ``I didn't even have much of a chance to talk to Turgeon. I only saw him 25 minutes before we went on the ice.'' </P>
<P> ``It was a thrill to hear the way the crowd accepted me,'' said Turgeon. </P>
<P> ``I knew it was a big game, the battle of Quebec. I felt so good when I walked into the dressing room and all the players welcomed me.'' </P>
<P> Joe Sakic had a goal and two assists for Northeast Division-leading Quebec (24-8-3), which is 1-6-1 in its last eight meetings with the Habs. </P>
<P> In San Jose, former Sharks captain Bob Errey had two goals and two assists to lead the Detroit Red Wings to a 5-3 victory over the team he was traded from earlier this season. </P>
<P> Jeff Friesen had a power-play goal and an assist for the Sharks, who fell to 2-6 in their last eight games. </P>
<P> The Wings, who equalled Quebec for best points total in the league with 51 points, are 11-1-2 in their last 14 games. </P>
<P> In Pittsburgh, Igor Chibirev got his first NHL hat trick to pace Hartford to an early lead and the Whalers answered a Penguins rally with goals by Geoff Sanderson, Paul Ranheim and Kevin Smyth in a third-period span of 82 seconds to win 8-4. </P>
<P> The Whalers won for the first time in four games and halted Pittsburgh's home winning streak at six games. </P>
<P> Pittsburgh defensemen Ulf Samuelsson and Kjell Samuelsson left the game with injuries after a collision in the second period. </P>
<P> In Winnipeg, Alexei Zhamnov scored his 23rd and 24th goals and Tie Domi and Randy Gilhen each added a goal and an assist as the Jets halted their 10-game winless slide (0-6-4) with a 4-1 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks. </P>
<P> Terry Simpson got a win in his debut behind the Winnipeg bench. He took over the coaching duties from John Paddock, who will concentrate on his duties as general manager. </P>
<P> Chicago is mired in a five-game winless streak (0-4-1). </P>
<P> In Toronto, Brett Hull scored two goals, Greg Gilbert added a goal and two assists and Curtis Joseph made 26 saves as St Louis defeated the Maple Leafs 6-4, extending the Blues' unbeaten streak to seven games (6-0-1). </P>
<P> Dave Andreychuk had a goal and an assist for Toronto, which lost both ends of the home-and-home series. </P>
<P> At Florida, Mike Richter made 17 saves to earn his second straight shutout against the Panthers as the New York Rangers scored four times in the third period to win 5-0. </P>
<P> Mark Messier, Pat Verbeek and Alexei Kovalev, who scored twice, broke open a 1-0 game with three goals in a 3:39 span of the third period as New York won for only the second time in its last 10 games but moved a point ahead of Florida into the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. </P>
<P> Lebeau broke out of his own zone on a 3-on-2 rush, skated around a defenseman and from just to the right of the goal, flipped the puck past Bill Ranford. </P>
<P> Shayne Corson scored the tying goal with 24 seconds left in regulation to send the game into overtime. </P>
<P> In Ottawa, Martin Brodeur made 21 saves for his fifth career shutout and Neal Broten had a goal and an assist as the New Jersey Devils extended their unbeaten streak to six games with a 2-0 victory over the Ottawa Senators. </P>
<P> The Senators lost their ninth straight. </P>
