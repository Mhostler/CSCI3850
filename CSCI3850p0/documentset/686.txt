<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska, (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Cambior Inc's Valdez Creek Gold Mine has been cited for 12 state environmental violations and ordered to launch a cleanup, officials said Tuesday. </P>
<P> The citations resulted from a surprise inspection earlier this summer at the Interior Alaska mine that was prompted by employee complaints to state officials, said Paul Pinard, district supervisor for the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC). </P>
<P> The violations include illegal leaks of oil and hazardous materials into the soil, failure to notify state officials about discharges, illegal open burning, failure to post notices about hazardous waste storage and improper disposal of oily wastes and sludges, according to DEC documents. </P>
<P> Cambior could be fined $500 to $100,000, plus up to $5,000 a day, for each of the 12 violations, Pinard said. </P>
<P> DEC plans a meeting next week with Cambior to discuss remedies, he said. </P>
<P> ``They will have to hire a third-party environmental consultant to do the sampling, to do the inspection work and to write up either a cleanup plan or an assessement of the activities to date,'' Pinard said. </P>
<P> He described the enforcement action as overdue. Budget cuts had curtailed DEC mine inspections in the region until mounting worker complaints prompted the surprise visit to Valdez Creek, he said. </P>
<P> He said he believes the oil leaks and other problems existed for a long time before any official action was taken. </P>
<P> ``They had not had a lot of oversight from the department. These complaints, I think, were received over a period of time,'' he said. ``In my judgment, these violations did exist over some time. </P>
<P> Cambior officials were unavailable for comment Tuesday. </P>
<P> But in a five-page letter to DEC, the mine's general manager detailed several changes he said have been made to fix the problems, and he promised new steps to prevent further pollution. </P>
<P> ``Cambior is committed to a policy which assures compliance with all applicable environmental requirements and it is taking this matter very seriously,'' George Bell, Cambior Alaska Inc's general manager, wrote in the letter. </P>
<P> The Valdez Creek mine is North America's top producing placer gold mine, according to state officials. </P>
<P> The mine produced 86,052 ounces of refined gold in 1992 and launched production in a new area in 1993, according to the most recent Alaska state mining summary. </P>
