<P>  President Nelson Mandela's government presented its budget to parliament Wednesday, pursuing South Africa's post-apartheid spending shift toward poor blacks and trying to attract investors. </P>
<P> ``We've tried to create a budget that is economically sound and politically responsible,'' Finance Minister Chris Liebenberg told reporters before he presented the country's first budget crafted by a democratic government. </P>
<P> Liebenberg, who took over from former mining magnate Derek Keys last September, increased spending for the fiscal year beginning April 1, by an inflation-matching 9.5 percent to $42.9 billion. </P>
<P> ``In view of our commitment to reducing the budget deficit and in the context of the economic recovery in progress, the government has decided to budget for a deficit of about 29.1 billion rand ($8.2 billion), or 5.8 percent of the estimated GDP,'' he told parliament. </P>
<P> In line with Mandela's promise to address apartheid backlogs in housing, health care, education and employment, he allocated $1.4 billion to the second year of the government's flagship Reconstruction and Development Program (RDP). </P>
<P> Apart from the RDP allocation, he increased the share of state expenditure allocated directly to police, housing, education, health and social welfare and set aside $695 million to narrow the wage gap between black and white civil servants. </P>
