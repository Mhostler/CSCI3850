<DATELINE>SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Bosnian capital Sarajevo, host of the Winter Olympics only a decade ago, Saturday marks its 1,000th day under siege by separatist Serbs. </P>
<P> A precarious cease-fire engineered by former President Jimmy Carter took effect around Sarajevo and the rest of Bosnia Dec. 24, significantly curbing fighting everywhere. </P>
<P> But the Serbs and Muslim-led Bosnian government remain far apart on terms for reviving peace talks, which have been stalled since the summer, raising doubts the cease-fire could stick. </P>
<P></P>
<P> March 1 - Bosnia chooses independence from Yugoslavia in majority vote by Muslims and Croats. Vote boycotted by Serbs who, anticipating secession, have already armed themselves with help of Yugoslav army and declared their own ``republic.'' </P>
<P> March 2 - Serb gunmen erect barricades around capital as anti-war protests fill the streets. </P>
<P> April 6 - European Community and United States recognize independent Bosnia. Pro-independence Bosnians storm rebel Serb headquarters in Sarajevo's Holiday Inn hotel. Yugoslav army and Bosnian Serb irregulars seal off city. Siege begins. </P>
<P> April 21 - Serbs launch artillery bombardment of Sarajevo. </P>
<P> May 27 - Twenty killed and 70 wounded in mortar attack on bread line, first of a series of atrocities against civilians. </P>
<P> Attack generally blamed on Serbs who are bombarding city from surrounding hills. Serbs claim Bosnian troops fired at own people in effort to pin blame on Serbs and provoke NATO intervention, the first of many accusations of this kind. </P>
<P> June 27 - European Community leaders agree United Nations can use force to break siege. No action taken as major powers reluctant to send troops into ``Vietnam-style quagmire.'' Attitude unchanged to date. </P>
<P> June 28 - French President Francois Mitterrand makes impromptu visit to Sarajevo to open way for U.N. aid airlift. </P>
<P> June 30 - Relief flights start with consent of Serb forces who have turned over Sarajevo airport to the United Nations. </P>
<P> July 12 - Aid reaches front-line suburb of Dobrinja, held by government troops, for the first time in 71 days. </P>
<P> July 17 - Warring factions sign two-week cease-fire. </P>
<P> July 19 - Cease-fire broken. Many more collapse in future. </P>
<P> Aug. 18 - United Nations suspends flights to Sarajevo after Serbs threaten British planes, the first of many disruptions. </P>
<P> Aug. 19 - Serbs agree to put heavy weapons in and around Sarajevo under U.N. supervision. Measure never implemented. </P>
<P> Sept. 4 - Italian plane flying aid to Sarajevo is shot down and four crewmen killed. United Nations believes culprits may have been Bosnian Croats at odds with the mostly Muslim government. </P>
<P> Jan. 8 - Hakija Turaljic, Bosnia's deputy prime minister, shot dead through open door of U.N. armored car by Serb soldier after convoy halted at Serb checkpoint. </P>
<P> Jan 20 - Bosnian Serbs vote to accept Geneva peace plan but fighting continues in many regions. </P>
<P> May - Young couple, one a Muslim and the other a Serb whose love transcends war, shot to death on front line while trying to flee Sarajevo. Their bodies cannot be retrieved for days because of heavy gunfire. </P>
<P> May 30 - Sixteen Sarajevans die in intense Serb artillery bombardment of densely populated city neighborhoods. </P>
<P> July 9 - Serbs refuse to let UNPROFOR bring diesel fuel into the capital which no longer has any utilities. </P>
<P> July 12 - Twelve civilians die in mortar attack on residents lining up at a water well in Dobrinja because power outages have knocked out water pumps. </P>
<P> July 22 - Sarajevo weathers one of worst bombardments in 24-hour period since war began as 3,777 shells pummel city. About 10 civilians killed and scores wounded. </P>
<P> Early August - UNPROFOR staves off Serb invasion of Sarajevo from south by having Serbs withdraw from Mount Igman to be replaced by peacekeepers in a ``demilitarized zone.'' DMZ violated almost from outset, mainly by Muslims. </P>
<P> Sept. 16 - Bosnian Muslim and Serb leaders sign declaration providing for end to fighting by weekend. Peace ceremony set for Sept. 20 is canceled when fighting continues. </P>
<P> Oct. 29 - Sarajevo erupts in internal Muslim warfare when security forces crush crime gangs in street battles. </P>
<P> Nov. 9 - Mortar round lands just outside Sarajevo school, killing nine children and a teacher. </P>

<P> Feb. 5 - Mortar round hits crowded central market, killing 68 people and wounding around 200 in worst single atrocity of war. </P>
<P> Serbs deny responsibility; blame never definitively fixed since shell was fired from front-line zone, but carnage finally galvanizes U.N.-NATO action to end siege. </P>
<P> Feb. 9 - Rose brokers cease-fire in Sarajevo and end to Serb artillery siege. Under NATO ultimatum, Serbs avert air strikes by withdrawing heavy guns 12 miles from city by Feb. 20, or put them in U.N. depots inside exclusion zone. </P>
<P> Shelling ceases but snipers, exempted by agreement, continue to shoot sporadically at civilians. </P>

<P> July 29 - Serbs target vehicles on sole government supply road into Sarajevo in response to Muslim offensives elsewhere and Big Power pressure on Serbs to cede land for peace. British soldier killed in Serb attack on U.N. convoy. </P>
<P> Aug 5 - NATO jets destroy Serb armored vehicle violating exclusion zone around Sarajevo. Serbs block U.N. aid to city. </P>
<P> Sarajevo airlift suspended for weeks at a time over last five months of year because of Serb threats to shoot down planes in reprisal for NATO sorties in Bosnia. </P>
