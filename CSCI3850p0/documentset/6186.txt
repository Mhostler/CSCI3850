<P>  Gov. John Rowland plans Monday to endorse Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole's campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, Rowland's office said. </P>
<P> ``The governor feels if there is a candidate out there who most closely matches his philosophy, it is Senator Dole,'' said Marc Ryan, a spokesman for the governor. </P>
<P> Rowland, a former congressman, will be joined by the Kansas senator Monday for the announcement, after which the two will attend the annual Prescott Bush Dinner, a major fundraiser for the state's Republican party. </P>
<P> ``The governor has worked closely with Senator Dole over the past several years,'' Ryan said. ``Senator Dole was a strong supporter of Governor Rowland during his recent gubernatorial run. And in Congress and later in private life, the governor has worked closely with Senator Dole on a number of issues, particularly the military industry in the state.'' </P>
