<P>  A Chilean arms maker who sold weapons to Iraq in the mid-1980s, allegedly with the aid of the CIA, said Wednesday new testimony will show he had full U.S. support in selling cluster bombs to Saddam Hussein. </P>
<P> Carlos Cardoen, a well-known arms manufacturer with clients around the world, has admitted selling cluster bombs to Iraq while it was at war with Iran. He said he has nothing to hide in a U.S. investigation into the sales. </P>
<P> ``We had nothing and have nothing to hide from the CIA, nor the United States government, nor anyone,'' Cardoen, whose arms business specializes in selling low-cost but lethal weapons to often roguish regimes, said in an interview Wednesday in the evening paper La Segunda. </P>
<P> The New York Times reported Sunday that the Central Intelligence Agency helped Cardoen sell sophisticated cluster bombs to Iraq in the mid-1980s. </P>
<P> Quoting a court affidavit by former U.S. National Security Council official Howard Teicher, the paper said the deals took place while President Ronald Reagan's government was professing neutrality in the war then raging between Iraq and Iran. </P>
<P> Cardoen, indicted by federal prosecutors in 1993 in Miami for selling weapons to Iraq, said he was visited often by U.S. embassy staff in Santiago in the mid-1980s to discuss the deals. </P>
<P> ``They visited me and told me they were happy that I could supply Iraq because they couldn't,'' said Cardoen. </P>
<P> He said Teicher's testimony, which the Times said made grave allegations about the U.S. role in Iraq's military buildup, would be ``tremendously favorable'' to his defense. </P>
<P> ``This is the first time that a former high official of the U.S. government testifies that the issue of manufacturing cluster bombs in Chile and their sale to Iraq was not only known and supported by the CIA, but promoted by it,'' said Cardoen. </P>
<P> He said U.S. officials were persecuting him ``not only because I am competing with their big companies, but also because I am closing them out of a vital sphere of influence.'' </P>
<P> Teicher's affidavit may rekindle the debate over whether the Reagan and Bush administrations' efforts to give military aid to Iraq inadvertently created the military machine that invaded Kuwait in 1990 and started the Gulf War. </P>
<P> Teicher's allegations of CIA involvement were placed in the court record in a Miami conspiracy case against two executives of Teledyne in Los Angeles. </P>
<P> Teledyne has pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges stemming from allegations it violated federal export laws by shipping 130 tonnes of the metal zirconium to Chile, where Cardoen's factory used it to make the bombs. </P>
