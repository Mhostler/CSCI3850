<P>  The path to sainthood in the Roman Catholic church is, like Pope John Paul's grueling Asia-Pacific tour, a long and exhausting journey. </P>
<P> The world's 960 million Catholics have hundreds of saints, a list which has taken centuries to compile, and many of those canonized spent their lives close to the church's power base in Europe. </P>
<P> Pope John Paul, credited with doing more than any other Pontiff this century to internationalize sainthood, has tried to redress the imbalance. He has canonized 250 people, including 100 Korean martyrs, during his 17-year reign. </P>
<P> Tuesday, he placed a Papua New Guinean martyr on the road to sainthood, beatifying Peter To Rot before 5,000 people in Port Moresby. </P>
<P> The pope also plans during his tour to beatify two other prospective saints: a nun who defied Australian church leaders in the 19th century to set up her own Josephite order devoted to the poor, and a Goanese missionary who worked with Sri Lanka's Catholics in the 17th century. </P>
<P> ``This pope is anxious that places like Australia, where there are not any canonized saints, get priority treatment,'' said Father Paul Gardiner Tuesday. </P>
<P> He has worked for 11 years on a 70-year campaign for sister Mary MacKillop's beatification. </P>
<P> Sister MacKillop, To Rot and Father Vaz will all soon carry the title ``blessed'' and their names can enter the Catholic liturgy in their own countries -- the first to do so. But they will remain one miracle away from sainthood. </P>
<P> To Rot's death at the hands of occupying Japanese troops in World War II was enough to seal his beatification. </P>
<P> MacKillop and Vaz died natural deaths and needed to have performed a miracle each -- the curing of a cancer victim in MacKillop's case and a miraculous birth for a woman who prayed at Vaz's birthplace. </P>
<P> A church board of medical experts ``cleared'' each miracle after failing to find a scientific explanation. ``I heard they reject more than they accept,'' Gardiner told Reuters. </P>
<P> But candidates for sainthood need at least two miracles before the Pope will canonize them and enshrine their names into the liturgy worldwide. </P>
<P> ``It's a very serious business,'' Gardiner said. ``What you are doing is putting the person's name into the most solemn prayers of the church ... and you've got people there who are the great saints of the church's history. </P>
<P> ``They (the saints) are big time.'' </P>
