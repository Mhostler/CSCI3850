<P>  The National Hockey League Players' Association expects to resume negotiations with the National Hockey League Monday and offer a new proposal, union chief Bob Goodenow said Friday. </P>
<P> ``Our bargaining committee is continuing to study the issues and develop another proposal for the league,'' Goodenow said. </P>
<P> ``We'll be working through the weekend and I told (NHL Commissioner) Gary Bettman that I would probably be in telephone contact with him over the weekend with the objective of our meeting again on Monday.'' </P>
<P> Talks on a new collective bargaining agreement have stalled since the players rejected two proposals from the owners Wednesday. </P>
<P> In New York, a spokesman for the NHL said Bettman has set up a meeting with the league's Board of Governors to review the union's expected collective bargaining proposal and decide on an appropriate course of action. </P>
<P> The two sides are trying to work out an agreement in time to start a full season Oct. 15 -- a date set by Bettman two weeks later than the original scheduled start to allow more time for resolving the contract disagreement. </P>
<P> The league has been without a collective bargaining agreement since Sept. 15, 1993. </P>
<P> The owners' last offer came during talks Tuesday. The deal reportedly included a modification of the players' own plan to tax gate receipts and payrolls 5.5 percent each to raise funds to help small market teams. </P>
<P> The league toughened its negotiating stance Tuesday by announcing that injured players would not be paid during the work stoppage. </P>
<P> Last week, the players had said they would guarantee not to strike the regular season and playoffs in return for Bettman's promise not to lock out the players. Bettman, however, announced the next day that the start of the 1994-1995 season would be delayed. </P>
<P> Bettman has said if the season does not start Oct. 15, then there would be a possibility that games would be lost. </P>
