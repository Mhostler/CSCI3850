<P>  Iraq blamed the United States Thursday for a Turkish incursion into its Kurdish north and urged the withdrawal of Turkish troops and an end to patrols by Western warplanes over the region. </P>
<P> ``The situation has occurred due to U.S. interference in the region,'' Mohammad Mehdi Saleh told a news conference. </P>
<P> ``This is an interference in our situation. This situation would not have happened if the Iraqi government was there,'' added Saleh, Iraq's trade minister. </P>
<P> Turkey pressed on with its massive attack on Turkish Kurd guerrilla bases in northern Iraq Thursday for a fourth consecutive day, attacking rebel positions from two sides and penetrating deep into Iraqi territory. </P>
<P> Iraq Wednesday denounced the Turkish attack, saying the raid violated its sovereignty. </P>
<P> Saleh said the Western air-umbrella based in southern Turkey to protect Iraqi Kurds from possible attacks by the Iraqi army was leading to instability in the area and the neighboring countries. </P>
<P> ``They have made an umbrella, and are killing the Kurdish people,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``Turkish troops as well as the U.S. and British (air) umbrella should be withdrawn,'' he added. </P>
<P> Asked if Iraq was ready to make peace with its Kurdish rebel foes, Saleh said: ``Yes, indeed.'' </P>
<P> Early this year the Iraqi government invited the Kurds to enter into a dialogue with Baghdad but the rebels rejected the offer. Previous accords signed between the two sides have broken down over the last 25 years. </P>
