<DATELINE>TOKYO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange dropped nearly 5 percent Monday morning, reaching their lowest level for 14 months under pressure of the collapse of British merchant bank Barings. </P>
<P> The key Nikkei share average was down 802.80 points or 4.59 percent at 16,670.14 at the lunch time bell after two hours of frantic trading. </P>
<P> It was the first time the Nikkei average had fallen below 17,000 in 14 months and the lowest point the Nikkei share average had reached at midday since Dec. 8, 1993. </P>
<P> Barings, London bankers to customers including Queen Elizabeth II, headed for bankruptcy Sunday under losses of more than $750 million that were run up in speculative trade by a maverick Singapore-based trader. </P>
<P> Banking sources said the trader apparently ran up losses on trading in derivatives based on the Nikkei 225 share price. </P>
<P> All the issues selected in the Nikkei 225 average faced selling pressure because of the weakness in Nikkei 225 futures prices, brokers said. </P>
<P> March Nikkei 225 index futures were down 780 points by midday to 16,800. </P>
<P> Derivatives -- futures, options and swaps -- are contracts linked to values of commodities, currencies, shares or bonds. </P>
<P> The Barings collapse unsettled all other Tokyo markets with currencies and bonds also going through roller coaster gyrations. </P>
<P> Cash and futures U.S. Treasuries were particularly sensitive to the Barings' news. </P>
<P> The March T-bond contract jumped to a high of 103-23/32 near the start of the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) night session. </P>
<P> The 7 1/2 percent key 30-year bond rose to a high of 101-20/32 in early Tokyo trade in line with the CBOT's jump, but then fell back to 101-10/32 on dealer profit-taking. </P>
<P> It was trading at 101-17/32 or a yield of 7.50 percent in late morning Tokyo. </P>
<P> The key bond closed at 101-6/32 or a yield of 7.52 percent in New York Friday. </P>
<P> ``Dealers' heavy purchases of the March contract were triggered by the Barings news, but they are also quite willing to take profits, resulting in the high volatility,'' said a U.S. brokerage trader. </P>
<P> The selloff in stocks and bonds rippled on to the yen. </P>
<P> ``There is a definite weakening of the yen as a result of this news, as dealers are worried about possible sales of Japanese stocks and bonds,'' one U.S. bank dealer said. </P>
<P> Japan's Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura said the turmoil was not a sign of mistrust in Japan's own economy. </P>
<P> ``I don't think it will hamper public trust in Japan's economy since it took place in Singapore, and I hope the market will react calmly to it,'' Takemura told Reuters. </P>
