<P>  Colombian President Ernesto Samper is losing public support amid a new investigation into drug corruption among politicians and other public figures, according to a public opinion poll published Sunday. </P>
<P> The Bogota daily El Tiempo said 42 percent of the people surveyed held a good opinion of Samper, a 14-percentage-point drop from the 56 percent who felt the same way in a similar survey conducted last February. </P>
<P> The newspaper, which commissioned the poll, said 56 percent thought Samper was doing a good job, compared to 66 percent in the last survey. </P>
<P> The investigation launched by Prosecutor-General Alfonso Valdivieso two weeks ago has revived earlier allegations that Samper received drug money for his election campaign last year. Samper says he is innocent and that his campaign rejected the money offered by the Cali cartel. </P>
<P> The daily said 39 percent of the people who participated in the survey did not think the latest investigation had harmed the president's image, while 35 percent thought it had and 25 percent thought it had improved it. </P>
<P> Eighty-six percent of the 1,000 adults polled in six cities between April 29 and May 3 supported the investigation, the daily said. </P>
<P> Although several politicians under investigation have accused the prosecutor-general of launching the probe for political reasons, 74 percent of those surveyed said they believed in Valdivieso, it said. </P>
<P> The poll had a margin of error of 3.2 percentage points, meaning results could vary by that much either way, it said. </P>
