<P>  The European Union has suspended fisheries negotiations with Canada until it stops harassing EU fishing vessels, a European Commission spokesman said Monday. </P>
<P> ``There can be no negotiations until Canada stops unilateral actions on the high seas,'' the spokesman told reporters. </P>
<P> Last weekend Canada cut the nets of a Spanish trawler, Pescarmaro 1, which had been fishing for Greenland halibut (turbot) in disputed fishing grounds in international waters off the coast of Newfoundland. </P>
<P> ``The Canadian government is using force illegally. It's a real act of international piracy,'' EU Fisheries Commissioner Emma Bonino said in an interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. </P>
<P> Bonino, in New York for a U.N. fisheries conference, added: ``The Union will not play the scapegoat for the mismanagement of fisheries by the Canadian authorities.'' </P>
<P> But the EU was still seeking a negotiated multilateral solution to the dispute within the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO), the Commission spokesman said. </P>
<P> It remained ready to search for agreement on fishery control measures during talks between experts in Brussels, he added. </P>
<P> EU ambassadors, meeting in Brussels Monday, rejected Canadian charges of illegal fishing by the Spanish trawler Estai and agreed to send a protest to Canada. </P>
<P> European Commission President Jacques Santer and French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe would send a political message condemning the Canadian action but leaving the door open for a negotiated settlement, EU officials said earlier. </P>
<P> ``The Canadian action is unacceptable...but the EU is ready to continue negotiations for a non-discriminatory share of fish quotas and control measures,'' said an EU official. </P>
<P> The seizure of the Estai on March 9 while it fished off the coast of Newfoundland marked the start of the bitter fisheries dispute. The vessel was released after the captain had been charged with illegal fishing and its owners paid a bond. </P>
<P> EU ambassadors were due to discuss the fisheries dispute again Thursday. </P>
