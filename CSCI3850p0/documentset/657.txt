<P>  Nigeria's crippling oil strike entered a sixth week Monday with workers continuing to demand that the jailed opposition leader be freed and made president. </P>
<P> Moshood Abiola, widely believed to have won last year's annulled presidential election, remained in police custody in the inland capital Abuja after rejecting bail conditions last week set by a court trying him on treason charges. </P>
<P> ``The strike will go on for as long as it is necessary,'' said Wariebe Agamene, national president of the blue-collar oil workers union, NUPENG. </P>
<P> The 150,000-strong NUPENG began the strike July 4 to press Nigeria's military rulers to free Abiola unconditionally and hand power to him. It was joined two weeks later by the 50,000-strong white-collar oil workers union, PENGASSAN. </P>
<P> Abiola, a multi-millionaire businessman, was arrested on June 23 and charged with treason after proclaiming himself president in defiance of military rulers. The Abuja court trying him offered Friday to free him if he did not address political meetings or leave Nigeria without permission. </P>
<P> The bail offer followed talks between the government and the Nigeria Labor Congress union federation, which last week suspended a brief general strike to allow the talks on its demand for Abiola's unconditional release. A senior NLC official who has been party to the negotiations said union chiefs met Abiola at the weekend and both sides were disappointed with the conditions of the bail offer. </P>
<P> The NLC's central working committee was due to meet Monday to discuss its next move. </P>
<P> The oil workers strike remains the most devastating of the industrial actions taken so far to seek Abiola's release. It has disrupted domestic fuel supplies and bitten deep into the country's crude oil production and exports, which provides more than 90 percent of its hard currency earnings. </P>
