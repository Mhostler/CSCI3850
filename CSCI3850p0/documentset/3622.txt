<P>  The first full-scale shipment of apples arrived in Japan from the United States Saturday, the fruit of America's tenacious 10-year battle to lift Japan's ban on its apples. </P>
<P> The 450 tons of Red Delicious apples from Washington state were taken ded from the 7,743-ton freighter Crystal Privelege, port authorities in Tokyo said. </P>
<P> The apples, 20 to 30 percent cheaper than Japanese apples, were to go on sale at Tokyo supermarkets Monday. </P>
<P> The United States first challenged Japan's quarantine procedures for apples in 1984, charging they were a non-tariff trade barrier. </P>
<P> Japan had said internal U.S. safety standards for viruses and moths were insufficient, largely giving in to demands by local producers to keep the market closed. </P>
<P> Last year, Japan backed down. A Farm Ministry inspection team found there was actually nothing wrong with U.S. safety checks. </P>
<P> Theoretically, Japan's apple market has been open to imports since 1971. But only small quantities from North and South Korea and New Zealand had been admitted. </P>
<P> U.S. growers were expected to export 12,000 tons of Golden Delicious and Red Delicious apples to Japan this year, said a spokesman for the Washington Apple Information Center, which was set up in Tokyo for the event. </P>
<P> Japanese consume a million tons of apples a year. </P>
