<DATELINE>KIGALI, Rwanda (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Rwandan Hutu refugees are flooding home from Zaire at the rate of 2,000 a day but many others are still fleeing into exile, apparently driven by fear of revenge at the hands of Tutsi troops, aid workers said Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``Since last week an average of 2,000 returnees have passed through our three monitoring points in the area of Ruhengeri (in the northwest),'' U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) spokesman Fernando del Mundo said. </P>
<P> Del Mundo said the refugees had told him they had had to abandon the camps at night because they would have been killed if Hutu militias discovered them. </P>
<P> ``The situation inside the camps remains grim, people continue being killed. Of course they want to get out,'' the official added. </P>
<P> But other aid workers who asked not to be named said that Rwandans were still fleeing into Zaire at the rate of 200 a day. In the east of the country, people were fleeing to Tanzania at the rate of 1,000 daily. </P>
<P> The UNHCR says there are 1.2 million refugees, most of them Hutus, in Zaire. It says there are 510,000 in Tanzania and 250,000 in Burundi. </P>
<P> The agency's figures are disputed by other aid groups which accuse the UNHCR of overestimating the number of people who fled advancing guerrillas of the mainly Tutsi Rwanda Patriotic Front. </P>
<P> Peacekeepers and aid workers on the ground also disagree bitterly with a UNHCR report alleging that RPF soldiers have been systematically butchering Hutus to avenge the genocide of up to a million people, mostly Tutsi, between April and July. </P>
<P> ``This UNHCR report is absolutely wrong and malicious,'' said Canadian Captain Philip Drew, who commands a platoon of peacekeepers in the southeastern town of Kibungo deployed to guard against such killings. </P>
<P> ``It is based on rumors and lies,'' said Drew, who described how he had unearthed mass graves holding the remains of thousands of corpses which refugees said were victims of the RPF but who had obviously died at the hands of Hutu gangs in April. </P>
