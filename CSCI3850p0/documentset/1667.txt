<P>  Scientists are concerned that public confidence in government research is being eroded by policy-makers who use the findings to back political agendas, according to a poll released Thursday. </P>
<P> The poll, taken for the Advancement of Sound Science Coalition, showed that 62 percent of scientists believe the confidence in research has decreased the last 10 years. </P>
<P> It also showed that 83 percent agree that policy-makers use science to achieve goals in such areas as pesticides, dioxin, environmental tobacco smoke or water supply. </P>
<P> The coalition of scientists, academicians, former government officials and business executives said also that the poll showed that scientists thought that nearly half of the research was undertaken to meet pre-established goals. </P>
<P> Coalition chairman Garrey Carruthers, a former New Mexico governor, said in a statement the ``results reinforce our mission, to ensure sound science is used to make public policy, and emphasizes the need for a set of scientific principles against which to hold government research accountable.'' </P>
<P> The poll was taken by the Tarrance Group, which surveyed 508 medical reseachers and natural scientists. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percent. </P>
