<P>  Renewed talks between baseball owners and striking players recessed Saturday to allow the owners to prepare a new proposal in the 93-day-old labor deadlock. </P>
<P> The strike has wiped out the last six weeks of the regular major league season, the playoffs and World Series and threatens the start of the 1995 season next spring. </P>
<P> The talks had resumed Thursday for the first time since Sept. 9. </P>
<P> Federal Mediator Bill Usery, a former labor secretary who was appointed by President Clinton, characterized the three days of renewed talks as ``beneficial.'' </P>
<P> ``The owners met last night and again this morning and have decided they need time to prepare a new proposal. The owners will come back next week with a new proposal,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``There is a better understanding of each other and I remain hopeful we can push through to an agreement. I remain positive that, in good faith, we can do just that.'' </P>
<P> The new meetings were scheduled for the Washington, D.C., area where Usery is headquartered but no specific site was given. </P>
<P> John Harrington, chairman of the Boston Red Sox and head of owners' committee said, ``We understand each other better and hopefully can reach an agreement. </P>
<P> ``Both sides listened to each other, but we have 28 clubs involved, and this proposal will take time.'' </P>
<P> Don Fehr, head of the player's union, said, ``We are scheduled to meet again next Thursday and have a sustained bargaining session at that time.'' </P>
<P> The owners are expected make a final proposal that will include a cap on player salaries, the major sticking point in the talks. The players have refused to accept the cap and want the current system of free agency. </P>
<P> ``I'll wait and see what they bring back to the table Thursday,'' said Fehr. ``A salary cap is not something the players are interested in.'' </P>
<P> If the players reject the owners proposal it is expected the owners will declare an impasse prior to December 20 and implement the final offer. </P>
<P> They could then open spring training camps and invite the players to return in an effort to break the union. </P>
