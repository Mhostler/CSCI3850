<DATELINE>SAVANNAH, Ga.(Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Georgia Republicans who gathered for a weekend convention got an earful about reducing the power of the federal government but heard little of one of the party's potentially most divisive issues -- abortion. </P>
<P> A few of the delegates sported badges that said ``Keep Our Platform Pro-Life.'' But those seeking the party's presidential nominee next year generally stayed clear of the subject. </P>
<P> Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole did not mention abortion in the brief, general message he sent delegates by videotape. Nor did California Gov. Pete Wilson, who is expected to enter the race shortly, in the two-page letter he sent after throat surgery forced him to cancel his appearance. </P>
<P> Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander omitted the topic in his speech and Texas Sen. Phil Gramm included only an indirect reference that ``I want every child welcomed into life and love.'' </P>
<P> Gramm was asked later why he did not take a stronger stand. He said his position was already well known. </P>
<P> ``I'm pro-life. It is very important but I don't think our party is a single-issue party,'' Gramm said. ``I think we're concerned about everything that affects families.'' </P>
<P> While Republican candidates have received strong support in the past from the anti-abortion movement, polls show there are also many in the party who support abortion rights. </P>
<P> Some party leaders have suggested candidates stress other issues that most Republicans agreed on, such as cutting back the size of the federal government. </P>
<P> The only presidential candidate to mention the abortion issue at the weekend Georgia gathering was Alan Keyes, a syndicated radio talk show host and former State Department official. </P>
<P> In a fiery speech, Keyes referred to the Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion as ``a constitutional principle that strikes at the heart of our basic moral values'' and equated abortion with the killings in the Oklahoma City bombing. </P>
<P> ``None of us has the right for our utilitarian purposes or our convenience to take the life of another human being,'' he said afterward. ``I'm spreading the word that the Republican Party cannot retreat from it.'' </P>
