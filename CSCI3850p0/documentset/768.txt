<P>  Officers probing the killing of a U.N. peacekeeper on the uneasy border between Kuwait and Iraq said Sunday they did not rule out that common criminals were to blame, the explanation given by Iraq. </P>
<P> But Kuwaitis pointed the finger at Baghdad, which remains an object of hatred in the small emirate four years after its northern neighbor invaded and occupied it. </P>
<P> ``This fresh attack reflects the Iraqi regime's determination to defy international resolutions,'' the Kuwaiti cabinet said. </P>
<P> ``The cabinet calls on the (U.N.) security council to take all measures and arrangements to put an end to the Iraqi regime's continuous provocations,'' a statement said. </P>
<P> A Bangladeshi warrant officer was shot dead in an ambush Friday night on Iraq's side of the border, the first member of the U.N. Iraq Kuwait Observer Mission to be killed in an armed incident since the force was deployed in April 1991. </P>
<P> Diplomatic sources said the alleged criminals had also stolen the patrol's jeep. Iraqi authorities had issued a warrant for the arrest of the assailants and had told UNIKOM it would do what it could to secure their capture, they said. </P>
<P> ``We tend to agree that it might have been a robbery or something of that kind, but we are still investigating,'' said a spokesman for the U.N. military observer force. </P>
<P> The Bangladeshis were attacked near Safwan town, about 12 miles west of Umm Qasr port. They were patroling in the jeep on the Safwan to Baghdad motorway in the six mile-wide Iraqi sector of the border zone. </P>
<P> The United Nations set up the demilitarized zone and deployed UNIKOM along it after a U.S.-led alliance drove Iraqi troops out of Kuwait in the six-week Gulf War in 1991. Iraq had invaded Kuwait in 1990 and claimed the emirate as its own. </P>
<P> A report in Iraq's ruling party newspaper al-Thawra said smugglers attacked the U.N. patrol because it had earlier confiscated alcohol they were trying to take into Kuwait, where alcohol is banned. </P>
