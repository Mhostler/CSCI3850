<P> The Astros drew 30,828 to the opening game of a weekend homestand against the Philadelphia Phillies even though every one of the 54,350 seats in the Astrodome was offered free. </P>
<P> Some fans indicated it will take more than ticket giveaways to bring them back to the park regularly after the strike that shut down the season last August. </P>
<P> ``That's the only way you got me here,'' said one man, who took advantage of the giveaway to bring his son, a Little League player, to the park. </P>
<P> But others seemed glad to have baseball back. </P>
<P> ``I was concerned about the games the owners and players were playing. But I'm a die-hard fan,'' said Stan Curtis as he headed through the turnstiles. </P>
<P> ``With the strike and all, it's a good way to get (fans) to come back out,'' said Astro left fielder Luis Gonzalez, whose club was leading the National League central division going into the game. </P>
<P> The Astros, who averaged about 26,000 fans a game in last year's strike-shortened season, lost 5-2 to the Philadelphia Phillies on Friday, ending a three-game winning streak. </P>
