<DATELINE>CHICAGO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Brendan Shanahan broke a tie early in the third period and the St. Louis Blues used tough defense to shut down the Chicago Blackhawks 3-1 Wednesday. </P>
<P> Shanahan pounced on the puck in the slot after a failed clearing pass by Chicago defenseman Chris Chelios and scored his 12th goal of the season, a powerplay tally, to give the Blues a 2-1 lead at 3:15 of the third period. </P>
<P> ``We spent a lot of time in their end and went with the approach that a good defense is a good way to get a lot of shots on goal to stay in the end and force them a lot,'' Shanahan said. </P>
<P> The Blues won their third straight and snapped Chicago's five-game winning streak by holding the Blackhawks to one goal on just 18 shots, including only nine in the first two periods. Chicago had scored 27 goals during its winning streak. </P>
<P> Glenn Anderson added an insurance goal with 5:41 left in the third period. </P>
<P> Chicago's Joe Murphy opened the scoring at 10:15 of the first period, but the Hawks were shut down the rest of the way as St. Louis scored three unanswered goals. </P>
<P> Denis Chasse scored at 5:27 of the second period to tie the game 1-1 before Shanahan and Anderson made the difference in the third. </P>
<P> We didn't respond very well to the chances we had,'' Chicago's Bernie Nicholls said. ``The Blues did all the right things tonight and when we're on the road we do the right things, we get back to basics. When we come home, we tend to be a little too fancy.'' </P>
<P> In Vancouver, Tim Hunter, Pavel Bure and Martin Gelinas scored first-period goals to lead the Canucks to a 5-2 victory over the Los Angeles Kings. </P>
<P> Vancouver beat the Kings for the seventh straight time and tied Los Angeles for second place in the Pacific Division with 28 points. Both teams are tied for sixth in the Western Conference playoff race. </P>
<P> The Canucks snapped a three-game losing streak and earned only their second win in seven games. </P>
<P> Vancouver entered the game in an offensive drought, scoring only six goals in their previous five games. But the Canucks struck for three goals in the first 14:35 of the game to take a commanding 3-0 lead. </P>
<P> The loss was only the third for the Kings (7-3-1) in their last 11 games. </P>
<P> At Florida, Steven Rice completed his first career hat trick with a powerplay goal at 8:04 of the third period to lift the Hartford Whalers into a 4-4 tie with the Panthers. </P>
<P> Rice took a cross-ice pass from Andrew Cassels and beat Mark Fitzpatrick over his right shoulder for the tying goal. </P>
<P> ``I'm happy about the hat trick,'' Rice said. ``It's a thrill for me, but I wish we would have pulled out a win.'' </P>
<P> The Whalers are unbeaten in their last four games (3-0-1), while Florida, which rallied from a 3-0 first-period deficit, is 3-1 in its last four contests. </P>
<P> Florida goalie John Vanbiesbrouck was pulled at 8:43 of the first period after allowing the two quick goals to Rice. </P>
<P> The Panthers, who had a season-high 38 shots on goal, scored three unanswered goals in the second period to tie the game. </P>
<P> Sean Burke made 34 saves for Hartford. </P>
<P> At Tampa Bay, Steve Konowalchuk scored a pair of goals to lead the Washington Capitals to a 4-2 victory over the Lightning. </P>
<P> Peter Bondra had a goal and an assist for the Capitals, who won for the fifth time in their last six road games. </P>
<P> Rookie goalie Jim Carey, who has allowed three goals in three games against the Lightning, made 24 saves and improved to 10-2-2 since being called up from Portland of the American Hockey League. </P>
<P> The Lightning lost for the sixth time in their last seven home games. </P>
<P> The Senators, who have lost six straight games to New Jersey, fell to 1-9-1 in their last 11 games overall. </P>
