<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Armed militants of Turkey's most lethal left-wing urban guerrilla group killed former Justice Minister Mehmet Topac Thursday, an Interior Ministry official said. </P>
<P> Topac, a former center-right politician, was gunned down by four attackers in his downtown Ankara law office. He died instantly with two shots to his head, the official said. </P>
<P> The assailants, earlier said to be three, included one woman. </P>
<P> The killers fled after leaving behind a statement in the name of the ``Revolutionary Peoples Forces,'' known as a hit squad of the deadly Dev-Sol (Revolutionary Left). </P>
<P> Topac, 55, was justice minister between June 1988 and March 1989, under the late Turgut Ozal, who later became president. </P>
<P> Dev-Sol is known to have killed nearly 50 people including an ex-prime minister, five generals, prosecutors, judges and police chiefs since the late 1970s. The group says its victims are guilty of ``crimes against the revolution.'' </P>
<P> Several Western businessmen and American servicemen have also been Dev-Sol victims. </P>
<P> Its attacks showed a marked rise after French police arrested its leader, Dursun Karatas, on the Italian border on September 9. </P>
<P> Karatas, who fled an Istanbul maximum security jail in 1989, was also wanted by the Interpol for crimes in other European countries, Turkish officials said. </P>
