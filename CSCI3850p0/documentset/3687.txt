<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  PLO leader Yasser Arafat has asked the United States to intervene quickly to stop Israel expanding and funding Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, a PLO official said Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``We met the U.S. counselor in Jerusalem and we asked his country to intervene immediately to stop the settlements in all forms and their fundings, out of concern for the peace process,'' PLO official Nabil Shaath told Reuters. </P>
<P> ``President Arafat has also directly contacted the U.S. administration on the issue of settlements,'' added Shaath who is in charge of international cooperation in the Palestinian Authority running Gaza and Jericho. </P>
<P> Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, speaking after a meeting between Arafat and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak Tuesday, said Israel had brought relations with the Palestinians to crisis point by illegally expanding West Bank settlements. </P>
<P> Moussa said expanding settlements was a serious violation of international law and the terms of the Madrid peace conference. </P>
<P> Egypt might also ask the United States whether the expansion violated the terms of an agreement under which Washington guaranteed loans to Israel worth $10 billion, he added. </P>
<P> ``It should be raised with them (the Americans),'' he said. </P>
<P> Palestinians began moving against settlement expansion last month after Israeli bulldozers started work on a hilltop above the West Bank village of al-Khader to build an additional 500 apartments for the settlement of Efrat. </P>
<P> The Israeli government, under pressure from Palestinians and left-wing Israelis, halted work at the site but authorized building on another hill. Work continued on other settlements. </P>
<P> Asked if the dispute had brought Israeli-Palestinian talks to ``ultimate crisis,'' Moussa said: ``No, we have not reached that level yet but it is a crisis situation.'' </P>
<P> ``The settlement policy is a very serious thing. It will affect the whole process of peace,'' he added. </P>
<P> Shaath, in Cairo with Arafat, said the Palestinian Authority had won Egypt's full backing on the issue of settlements. </P>
<P> The best hope for an end to the crisis was the meeting next week between Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Moussa and Shaath added. </P>
<P> Arafat met Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres on the edge of the Gaza Strip Monday and Peres said they were making progress toward agreement on the next stage in Palestinian self-rule -- elections and an Israeli troop redeployment. </P>
<P> But Moussa put more emphasis on the meeting with Rabin. ``It's a very important thing. We look forward to this meeting and we are very eager to see agreement,'' he said. </P>
<P> Shaath added: ``The meeting is supposed to be the most important on the troop redeployment and the settlement issue.'' </P>
<P> He said Peres did not meet two Palestinian demands -- that Israel ban non-governmental funding to expand settlements and stop confiscating Palestinian land to build roads. </P>
<P> ``There are still gaps between us that were not settled. We could not reach a solution on them,'' he said. </P>
<P> Shaath said Peres tried to ease Palestinian fears about Israel's delay in discussing redeployment. He told Arafat that Rabin would hand over detailed talks on redeployment and maps at their meeting next week. </P>
<P> He said Israel had, however, showed flexibility on the question of prisoners, at least ``in a cosmetic way'' by referring the issue to a ministerial-civilian committee. </P>
<P> He said a quick breakthrough was likely and that he expected women prisoners to come out first. </P>
