<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The chairman of a key House committee Wednesday called for a complete transformation of the federal Medicaid program for the poor, suggesting that states may be given control of the system. </P>
<P> Commerce Committee Chairman Thomas Bliley, a Virginia Republican, told an industry group he would introduce a health reform bill that included tax-sheltered medical savings accounts and portability requirements to ensure that insurance coverage was not lost with a job change.  Bliley's speech sent another strong signal that Republicans, who control the House for the first time in 40 years, plan major changes in federal health care programs in order to achieve their promise of a balanced federal budget. </P>
<P> ``To reach the goal of the balanced budget, major changes in Medicaid, amounting to what should be considered a transformation of the program, are essential,'' Bliley told the National Committee for Quality Health Care. </P>
<P> ``The Commerce Committee will look at the entire Medicaid program ... this could mean replacing the individual entitlement to Medicaid with states deciding who is entitled to receive benefits,'' he said. </P>
<P> On Monday, House Speaker Newt Gingrich called for a complete reappraisal of the Medicare program for the elderly in order to help reduce the deficit, calling the present program too bureaucratic and inflexible. </P>
<P> Earlier Wednesday, Senate Labor Committee chair Nancy Kassebaum said she expected Congress to pass health insurance market reforms this year and predicted that budget-cutters will take a close look at Medicare. </P>
<P> Kassebaum has introduced a welfare reform bill to give the government greater control over Medicaid, a joint state- federal program that covers the poor, disabled and providing long-term nursing home care, while leaving welfare to states. </P>
<P> The House last week passed a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, part of their overall Contract with America. </P>
<P> Republican lawmakers have not yet spelled out specific cuts to bring the budget in line by 2002 as the amendment calls for, but it is clear they are looking at Medicare and Medicaid -- each growing by more than 10 percent a year. </P>
<P> State governors have been begging Washington for relief from Medicaid, an entitlement program that guarantees individuals aid if they meet certain guidelines. </P>
<P> Bliley suggested that Congress could save money by moving Medicaid patients into managed care programs or ending the entitlement status of the program and giving states control. </P>
<P> He also called for major changes in the portion of the program that provides federal money to hospitals that treat a large number of the poor and indigent. States have learned how to manipulate the program to secure Medicaid funds to meet other budget needs. </P>
<P> Bliley said Republican lawmakers, who met with Illinois Republican Gov. Jim Edgar earlier this week to discuss Medicaid, were considering capping growth of the program at a set percentage increase over the next five years. </P>
<P> That prompted Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, in the audience, to rise to protest that Edgar spoke only for Republicans. ``I hope you will talk to the Democratic governors,'' Dean said. </P>
<P> Bliley was sharply critical of President Clinton's health care reform plan that called for universal health insurance and government cost controls, which died in Congress without a vote last year. </P>
<P> Bliley said he would introduce legislation calling for more incremental health care reforms including insurance portability, medical IRAs -- tax sheltered savings accounts to meet medical costs -- and medical malpractice reform. </P>
