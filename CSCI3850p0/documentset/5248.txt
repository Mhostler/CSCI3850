<P>  Notorious British gangster Reggie Kray said he and his late twin brother Ronnie had no regrets about the murders they carried out in a reign of terror in London's East End. </P>
<P> Reggie Kray, who is to be released briefly from prison to attend his brother's funeral, told the Independent newspaper: ``Being twins there is a certain amount of telepathy. I know he is at ease.'' </P>
<P> Ronnie Kray, who died in a hospital after suffering a heart attack, had previously been diagnosed a paranoid schizophrenic and was serving his sentence at Broadmoor Psychiatric Hospital in the county of Berkshire, west of London. </P>
<P> The 61-year-old murderers, who terrorized London's East End during the 1960s, were both sentenced to life in prison in 1969. </P>
<P> Reggie Kray, speaking from Maidstone Prison in the southern English county of Kent, said: ``I have got no regrets, my brother didn't have any either.'' </P>
<P> Kray, who has now been in jail for 27 years, said: ``Ron and myself wrought some violence on different people but we lived in a violent world and violence has been perpetrated on us as well. That was the way of life in the East End of London then.'' </P>
<P> The twins have been glamourized in books and a film as ruthless gangsters with a sense of honor. </P>
