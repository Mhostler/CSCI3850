<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Police seized five tons of pure cocaine and four tons of partially processed coca paste in a raid on a drug processing laboratory in northwest Colombia, news reports said Saturday. </P>
<P> RCN radio said the laboratory, hidden in woods near the town of Puerto Nare, about 95 miles northwest of Bogota, was one of the biggest ever discovered in the country. </P>
<P> Police could not immediately be reached to confirm the seizure, which was also reported in the Bogota newspaper El Tiempo. </P>
<P> More than 100 people worked at the complex, which was equipped with generators, ovens and driers for converting coca paste into cocaine for export. The traffickers fled as police closed in Friday night and only one person was arrested, the radio said. </P>
<P> Authorities also confiscated hundreds of gallons of acetone and hydrochloric and sulphuric acid used to process the cocaine. </P>
<P> Colombia is the world's biggest exporter of cocaine, sending between 700 and 1,000 tons a year of the drug to the United States and Europe, according to estimates by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. </P>
