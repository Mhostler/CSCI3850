<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The United States expects to strike a partial trade deal with Japan Friday and to counter-balance the package with limited sanctions action, U.S. sources said Thursday. </P>
<P> That scenario could easily change -- top-level negotiations are set to stretch late into Friday night -- but the aides said some action against Japan ``is all but a given.'' </P>
<P> President Clinton and his top economic and foreign-policy advisers met Thursday to mull precisely which sanctions to employ should no deal emerge in the final face-to-face. </P>
<P> U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor will lead the final negotiations, hoping to strike enough common ground to avert a commercial blowup between the world's top economies. </P>
<P> Talks were set to kick off mid-afternoon after Foreign Minister Yohei Kono flies in from New York. Trade Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto was not expected until the evening, setting the stage for a long night of negotiations. </P>
<P> ``The bottom line is that we ain't got no deal. How do we strike the balance (in reacting) is the key,'' said one aide. </P>
<P> The U.S. officials spoke to Reuters after the day-long, internal deliberations about Japan, which is firmly on notice that Friday is the absolute deadline for a deal. </P>
<P> As of Thursday night, the aides were banking on an agreement to deregulate Japan's insurance sector, continued deadlock over cars and a probable -- though far from definite -- deal on procurement. </P>
<P> How to respond is the question. </P>
<P> Many in the administration fear a heavy hand will roil currency markets and cast a pall over a mid-November summit of Asia-Pacific leaders to be staged in Indonesia. </P>
<P> Still others -- although a clear minority -- argue all-out pressure is the only way to wring concessions out of Tokyo and that the time for action is now. </P>
<P> Either way, Kantor plans an announcement at noon Saturday. </P>
<P> Under Thursday's scenario, the administration plans some sanctions proceedings, albeit fairly narrowly targeted. </P>
<P> Top of the list: targeting Japan's $4.5 billion flat glass market under the unilateral Super 301 law, opening the door to months of negotiation under the explicit threat of sanctions. </P>
<P> ``They are not even talking about it much any more,'' said one aide. ``Our understanding is that's pretty much a given.'' </P>
<P> Aides say Tokyo operates a cartel in glass, with two or three Japanese producers doggedly clinging onto a constant market share despite outmoded, costly practices. </P>
<P> Foreigners have captured just three percent of the market. </P>
<P> Clinton's inner circle was united on the decision, said aides familiar with the internal meeting. </P>
<P> But there was plenty of argument over whether to lash out at Japan's prized car sector, with car trade accounting for two-thirds of the $60 billion trade imbalance. </P>
<P> Officials said Super 301 action on replacement car parts was ``possible'' -- an outcome that risks driving down the dollar and thereby forcing up U.S. interest rates. </P>
<P> ``It's still a maybe,'' said one U.S. official, who nonetheless downplayed the likelihood. </P>
<P> Aides expected no broader action under Super 301. </P>
<P> Should the negotiators fail to strike a deal on government purchasing, U.S. officials have vowed immediate retaliation on Japan's procurement sector. </P>
<P> ``There will be no delay,'' said one administration source. </P>
<P> Kantor would target a range of Japanese firms that compete for U.S. government contracts and impose sanctions in 30 days. </P>
