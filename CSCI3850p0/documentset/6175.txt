<P>  The Bosnian government army blockaded a U.N. barracks in central Sarajevo on Monday in protest at the death of one of its men, U.N. spokesman Alexander Ivanko said. </P>
<P> Anti-tank mines were placed across the entrance to the Marshal Tito barracks, home to some 800 French and 500 Ukrainian peacekeeping troops. Bosnian army soldiers were on guard with portable anti-tank weapons. </P>
<P> ``Hundreds of our soldiers are blocked inside, they cannot get in or out,'' Ivanko said. </P>
<P> The barracks was once the Sarajevo headquarters of the old Yugsolav national army and has been badly damaged by shelling. </P>
<P> The Moslem-led government army accused the French of killing the soldier with a rocket propelled grenade but Ivanko denied U.N. invovement, and added: ``It is preposterous as the French do not have RPG's in their possession.'' </P>
<P> The standoff began as a four-month ceasefire the U.N. has been unsuccessfully trying to renew expired at noon (1000gmt). </P>
<P> The city was calm with only the sound of occasional small arms rounds echoing around the hills. </P>
