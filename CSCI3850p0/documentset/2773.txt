<P>  Former heavyweight contender and 1984 Olympic gold medalist Henry Tillman has been ordered to stand trial on nine felony fraud charges involving the alleged use of phoney credit cards and a ``cloned'' cellular phone. </P>
<P> Police claim they caught Tillman, 34, on videotape as he used a counterfeit Discover card and a phoney driver's license while attempting to get $800 cash at the Hollywood Park racetrack casino in suburban Inglewood. </P>
<P> He is also accused of using a counterfeit Visa card and a bogus name and social security number to get $3,500. </P>
<P> Tillman, who twice defeated Mike Tyson in qualifying bouts for the 1984 Olympics, was ordered by a Municipal Court Judge Monday to stand trial in Superior Court. </P>
<P> So-called ``cloned'' cellular phones are programmed to tap into existing cellular phone accounts belonging to other people and are illegal. </P>
<P> Tillman, who has denied the charges, remains free on $100,000 bail. He was convicted of robbery in 1981 and served two-and-a-half years in prison. </P>
