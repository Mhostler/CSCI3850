<DATELINE>FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Sierra Leone rebels attacked a town on the outskirts of Freetown Saturday, the closest they have come to the capital in four years of fighting. </P>
<P> Military officers said the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels attacked Newton, 24 miles outside Freetown, in the early hours of Saturday. </P>
<P> Government forces backed by Guinean troops with heavy artillery battled to push back the rebels, whose attack caused panic on the outskirts of the capital, they said. </P>
<P> ``The RUF rebels, who were removed from Sango town yesterday, bypassed the army position and attacked inhabitants of Newton town 24 miles from the capital,'' an officer told Reuters. </P>
<P> ``We are now in control of Newton town. Troops backed by Guinean soldiers are on the offensive chasing the rebels with heavy artillery bombardment by Guineans,'' he added. </P>
<P> Many residents of nearby Waterloo town, 18 miles from the capital, were fleeing their homes, prompting the government to rush in military reinforcements to reassure them, the army sources said. </P>
<P> The presence of the rebels so close to the capital went largely unnoticed in the city, with attention there riveted on a soccer match between Ghana and Sierra Leone. </P>
<P> RUF took up arms in 1991 and pursued a poorly-coordinated campaign against the government until it switched tactics this year to targeting the country's vulnerable foreign-owned mines. </P>
<P> They still hold 10 foreign hostages and not even the presence of Nigerian forces backed by warplanes has stopped them from paralyzing the country's economy through random attacks on the countryside and highways. </P>
<P> Rebel spokesmen have boasted in the past week that RUF is ready to strike the capital, something the army has vowed to prevent at all costs. </P>
<P> RUF's chief foreign spokesman Alimamy Sankoh said in a statement that serious fighting was raging Saturday around Benguema military barracks and nearby Waterloo, with heavy casualties on both rebel and government sides. </P>
<P> ``This is in response to the call of the people of Freetown for RUF to enter the capital,'' he said in the statement issued in Ivory Coast. </P>
<P> There was no confirmation in Freetwon of fighting around the barracks. RUF has so far avoided any direct confrontation with the army and an attack on the barracks would signal a major shift in their strategy. </P>
<P> Sankoh said earlier this week that RUF had infiltrated men inside the capital and was only waiting for the right time to strike. </P>
<P> A Ukrainian crewman flying helicopter combat missions for the government army was mysteriously shot and killed inside military headquarters in the capital two days ago. The Rebels have not claimed his killing. </P>
