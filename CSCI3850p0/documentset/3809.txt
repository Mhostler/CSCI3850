<P>  Self-confessed extortionist ``Dagobert,'' who became a German folk hero with his Disney cartoon-inspired name and escapades that kept police chasing him for two years, went on trial in Berlin Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``Dagobert'' made about 30 vain attempts to extract ransom money from Germany's largest retail chain, Karstadt, after planting homemade bombs in at least five of its stores. </P>
<P> The extortionist, whose real name is Arno Funke, borrowed his nickname from the Disney character Scrooge McDuck, Donald Duck's stingy Scottish uncle who is known in German as Dagobert. </P>
<P> ``I was at the end of my tether and wanted to commit suicide so I thought of blackmailing a department store to change my life,'' Funke, 44, an unemployed sign painter from Berlin, told the court. </P>
<P> He said he was a sick man whose life was completely devoid of joy. He suffered from memory lapses and was unable to work since becoming disabled from inhaling paint fumes. </P>
<P> With the police in hot pursuit, Funke hatched scheme after scheme to get his hands on a ransom of $980,000 from the Karstadt group. </P>
<P> Although he never succeeded, Funke captured the public's imagination and the news magazine Der Spiegel named him ``Gangster of the Year'' in 1993. </P>
<P> He was charged with six counts of bombing, 10 counts of extortion and a count of attempted arson after being arrested last April in what became his most famous escapade in his quest for Karstadt cash. </P>
<P> Funke had told authorities to put the money in a roadside bin in Berlin used to store grit for icy roads. </P>
<P> But when police looked in the bin, they found it had been placed over a manhole and the grit had drained from underneath, enabling Funke to take what he thought was the package of money and escape through the city's sewer system. </P>
<P> No doubt to his chagrin, Funke later discovered that the police had put wads of paper in the bag. </P>
<P> He was finally arrested at a phone booth as he tried to fix a new date for payment of the ransom. </P>
<P> The Karstadt bombings injured two people but Funke, who faces up to 15 years in jail, told the court he had not intended to harm anyone. </P>
<P> Funke, who lived with his Philippine-born wife and small son in the quiet southwest Berlin district of Mariendorf, got his taste for extortion after managing to obtain $320,000 from the luxury Berlin store KaDeWe in 1988. </P>
<P> He told the court he had originaly planned to start his own business with the money but instead he used it for vacations. </P>
