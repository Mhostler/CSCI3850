<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Russian ultra-nationalist politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky said Monday that his main goal in visiting the United States is to improve his image and to tell people the truth about his party. </P>
<P> ``There is a lot of false information about me and about our party,'' said Zhirinovsky, who arrived in San Francisco Sunday night at the start of a controversial visit to the United States. </P>
<P> ``The main objective (of the visit) is to improve the image which the American people have about me (and) to give the true image of me and my party,'' he told Reuters in an interview. </P>
<P> Zhirinovsky was due to give a speech later Monday on ''Creating a new Russia'' at an event in San Francisco sponsored by the World Affairs Council, a non-partisan group. </P>
<P> The United States granted a tourist visa to Zhirinovsky last week, but a State Department spokesman said the U.S. government found his views anathema. </P>
<P> Zhirinovsky, whose Liberal Democratic Party took almost one-quarter of the votes in last December's Russian parliamentary elections, has alarmed many in the West with his extreme nationalist comments. </P>
<P> Jewish groups, condemning what they say are Zhirinovsky's anti-Semitic views, have protested his visit. </P>
<P> But Zhirinovsky, conservatively dressed in black suit and tie, was careful to tone down his rhetoric in the interview and seemed eager to portray a sober image. </P>
<P> News reports saying that he favored reconstituting the Soviet Union within its former borders and also incorporating Finland were ``propaganda'' and anti-Semitic remarks attributed to him were ``a mistake,'' he said, speaking through an interpreter. </P>
<P> At a news conference later, he said: ``Anti-Semitism is not in the program in our party. We are struggling against it.'' </P>
<P> Zhirinovsky said he would wear a bulletproof vest during his San Francisco speech and press conference. </P>
<P> ``We have received some information that violence may be used,'' he said, without giving details. The U.S. State Department is providing security for Zhirinovsky's visit. </P>
<P> Zhirinovsky said he was willing to meet with President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore or other top U.S. officials. </P>
<P> ``We have not asked officially to have a meeting with American officials but indirectly we suggested we'd like to have some such meetings,'' Zhirinovsky said. </P>
<P> A U.S. State Department spokesman said last week he was unaware of any plans for Zhirinovsky to meet with any U.S. officials. </P>
<P> Zhirinovsky said he was asking President Boris Yeltsin to call elections for president and Parliament within six months. </P>
<P> ``I and my party will call on Mr. Yeltsin for the election and if Mr. Yeltsin will not have the election in spring next year it will be a dictatorship in our country,'' he said. </P>
<P> Zhirinovsky said he was sure he would become president because Russian voters did not want either Communists or reformers, who he referred to as ``radical democrats.'' </P>
<P> He said if either a Communist or a ``radical democrat'' was elected president, Russia would face civil war. </P>
<P> ``We're very surprised why the West is supporting radical democrats. ... Russia is in a very bad condition and we are very, very near to the catastrophe,'' he said. </P>
<P> Zhirinovsky said that if his party came to power in Russia, it would have very good relations with the United States. </P>
<P> ``We could make a lot of agreements to reduce military expenses. We could speed up the process of creation in Russia of a stable economy, a stable political situation and make the situation in the world on the whole more peaceful,'' he said. </P>
