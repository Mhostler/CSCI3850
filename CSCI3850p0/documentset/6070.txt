<P> Both court-appointed lawyers had asked to be taken off the case because they had friends killed in the blast. Coyle said he had also received death threats. But Howland said he had ''complete confidence in the high professionalism of defense counsel.'' </P>
<P> The judge said intense media coverage of the blast was not a sufficient reason to transfer the case to another state. </P>
<P> ``It is true that an extensive amount of media coverage has accompanied the bombing of the Alfred Murrah building. This circumstance alone is insufficient to warrant a change of venue, especially at this preliminary and narrowly focused stage of the hearings,'' he said. </P>
