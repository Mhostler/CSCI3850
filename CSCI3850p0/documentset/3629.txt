<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Fierce winter storms lashed much of the United States on Saturday, causing at least a dozen traffic deaths on icy highways, while tornadoes damaged homes in central Florida, authorities said. </P>
<P> A storm moving in from Alaska brought driving rain and snow and strong winds to northern California, downing power lines and cutting off electricity to tens of thousands of people. </P>
<P> In Los Angeles, heavy rain flooded freeways, sent mudslides pouring onto roads in Malibu, and was blamed for numerous accidents. </P>
<P> Severe thunderstorms, including storm-triggered tornadoes, caused severe property damage in the Orlando, Fla., area, where some garage doors were torn from homes. </P>
<P> A tornado ripped through Marion County, Fla., before dawn, destroying dozens of mobile homes in a trailer park and uprooting trees. </P>
<P> ``We just heard this roar and ... all of a sudden the windows came in and the roof went off and we just lay there and hoped for the best,'' one resident of the trailer park told CNN. </P>
<P> The western Great Lakes region shivered in subzero temperatures and Omaha, Neb., was blanketed with 9 inches OF snow Friday. </P>
<P> Icy weather made driving hazardous across Tennessee, the Carolinas and Ohio. </P>
<P> In the Carolinas and Virginia, five motorists were killed on icy roads as freezing rain caused hundreds of accidents. </P>
<P> In Spartanburg, S.C., police said Daniel Lehner, 31, was killed after the ice caused a 15-vehicle pileup. Police said Lehner was hit by a truck as he stood beside a car he had just collided with in the pileup. </P>
<P> Two drivers were killed in Virginia when their vehicles went out of control on icy roads, state police said. </P>
<P> The Tennessee Highway Patrol reported two traffic fatalities since Friday afternoon and said at least one was due to icy roads. </P>
<P> Six weather-related traffic deaths were reported in southern Ohio. </P>
<P> Severe thunderstorms late Friday in South Carolina prompted the National Weather Service to issue tornado and severe thunderstorm warnings for most of the state. </P>
<P> The weather service in Columbia, S.C., said strong winds tore the roof off an apartment building and a private home, and that power lines and trees were snapped. </P>
<P> Northern California was pounded throughout the night by heavy rain and snow and strong winds. The storm dumped a thick layer of fresh snow on the Sierra Nevada mountains. </P>
<P> There was a lull in the storm Saturday, but two more storms were forecast before Monday. </P>
<P> The winds and rain downed power lines in northern California, and at the height of the storm 200,000 families wre without power, a spokesman for Pacific Gas and Electric Co said. </P>
<P> By midday Saturday, some 50,000 to 60,000 customers in northern California, the Santa Cruz area and the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains still lacked power, he said. </P>
<P> One of the three main routes to Yosemite National Park in northern California was closed Saturday after rocks fell on top of a snowplow working to clear Highway 140. </P>
<P> Southern California, still clearing up after floods earlier this week which killed two people, was again hit by heavy rain. </P>
<P> Police said several motorists were injured as cars slammed into each other on rain-slicked highways. </P>
<P> California Gov. Pete Wilson declared a state of emergency in Los Angeles and Orange counties late Friday to help local agencies respond to widespread flooding, which has caused damage estimated at more than $31 million. </P>
<P> Saturday's storm also brought blizzards to mountain areas in southern California. Interstate 5, the state's main north-south artery, was closed at the 2,500-foot Tejon Pass, 40 miles north of Los Angeles. </P>
<P> A big storm system brought rain and winds gusting up to 68 mph to southern New England and a mixture of rain, sleet and snow to northern areas of New England, the weather service said. </P>
