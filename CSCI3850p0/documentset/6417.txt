<P>  Actor Gary Busey was charged with a number of drug-related offenses Tuesday, just 24 hours after leaving the hospital where he was treated for an apparent overdose of cocaine. </P>
<P> Deputy District Attorney Michael Wilson said Busey, who won an Oscar nomination for his role as rock legend Buddy Holly in the movie, ``The Buddy Holly Story,'' was charged with possessing cocaine, marijuana, the hallucinogen PCP, and with being under the influence of cocaine. </P>
<P> He faces up to three years in prison if convicted on all charges. </P>
<P> The 50-year-old actor was expected to surrender in the next two weeks for arraignment on the charges, Wilson said. Busey remained free and bail of $10,000 would be recommended at the arraignment hearing, Wilson added. </P>
<P> Busey was taken to Santa Monica Hospital in serious condition last Thursday night after his girlfriend found him unconscious in his Malibu home. He was released in good condition Monday. </P>
<P> Los Angeles County Sheriff's spokesman Matt Rodriguez said last week paramedics treated Busey for ``an apparent overdose of cocaine.'' </P>
<P> ``They also found approximately one and a half grams of cocaine in his shirt pocket,'' he added. </P>
<P> Rodriguez said that after obtaining a search warrant, sheriff's deputies found another half gram of cocaine and four grams of marijuana in Busey's master bedroom. Due to his medical condition, Busey was not arrested at the time, Rodriguez said. </P>
<P> Busey, who is also a drummer, came close to death in 1988 when he was involved in a motorcycle accident. </P>
<P> He made his film debut in 1971 in ``Angels Hard as They Come.'' He also had roles in ``Thunderbolt and Lightfoot,'' ''Gumball Rally,'' ``A Star is Born'' and ``Point Break.'' </P>
