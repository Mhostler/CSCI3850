<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Polish police searched the offices of a Warsaw tabloid daily Sunday and confiscated explosives that reporters found amid an upsurge in bombings in Poland's capital this year. </P>
<P> The paper, Super Express, had planned to display the explosives at a news conference to show how easy it was to obtain such materials in Warsaw, a spokesman for the paper Krzysytof Kaczynski told Reuters. </P>
<P> But a police bomb squad arrived two hours earlier, searched the premises and confiscated six sticks of TNT, detonators and fuses, Kaczynski, who witnessed the search, said. </P>
<P> The explosives had been bought from members of the police anti-terrorist squad, PAP news agency said. Police officials declined comment. </P>
<P> Eight bombs, six of them placed in cars, have exploded in Warsaw since the start of the year. Two others were rendered harmless before they could go off. </P>
<P> The bombings are linked to growing gang warfare in Poland's capital, Warsaw's biggest-circulation daily Zycie Warszawy said Sunday. </P>
<P> PAP meanwhile reported the latest bombing in the southern city of Bytom where a parked car blew up early Sunday. No injuries were reported. </P>
