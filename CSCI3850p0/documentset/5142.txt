<DATELINE>BONN, Germany (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Police raided 80 apartments around Germany Thursday in a major strike against neo-Nazi groups and seized propaganda published by an American being held in Denmark, officials said. </P>
<P> The Federal Criminal Office said police confiscated weapons and ammunition in the dawn raids as well as banned Nazi pamphlets published by Gary Lauck of Lincoln, Neb. </P>
<P> Officials said Lauck, whose extradition is sought by authorities in the German city of Hamburg, had been smuggling banned hate literature into Germany for more than 20 years. </P>
<P> ``We hope we have now finally reached the ringleaders,'' said Ruediger Bagger, spokesman for the Hamburg public prosecutor. </P>
<P> ``This operation should show that anyone who thinks he can secretly get Nazi propaganda and distribute it here will be brought to justice.'' </P>
<P> Lauck enjoys near-hero status among neo-Nazis for his skill in getting nationalist and anti-Semitic writings into Germany through a confusing network of foreign addresses. </P>
<P> Danish police in Roskilde, west of Copenhagen, said they arrested Lauck Monday and were awaiting extradition papers from Germany. The Hamburg public prosecutor has had a long-standing international warrant out for his arrest. </P>
<P> In Germany, he could face up to five years in jail if convicted on charges of publishing hateful and racist literature. </P>
<P> Denmark's liberal freedom of speech laws have long frustrated German requests to silence neo-Nazis on its soil and officials were not sure if Copenhagen would automatically comply with the request to extradite him. </P>
<P> Lauck, who spent four months in a German jail in 1976 for peddling Nazi propaganda, heads the National Socialist German Workers' Party - Foreign Organization (NSDAP-AO), a name deriving from the official title of Adolf Hitler's party. </P>
<P> His group publishes Nazi magazines in a dozen languages and produces millions of stickers, posters and armbands bearing swastikas and such messages as ``Foreigner, Get Out!'' </P>
<P> In an interview aired on German television, Lauck said his group was the heir to the Nazi party. Hitler was ``if anything too humane,'' he said. </P>
<P> Lauck has exploited freedom of speech laws and used multiple shipment points to get his unmarked packages into Germany. ``Looking for our materials is like looking for a needle in a haystack,'' he boasted last year. </P>
