<P>  A 29-year-old former postal worker, intent on stealing enough to pay his back rent, was charged Wednesday with shooting four men to death in a Montclair post office robbery that shocked the quiet suburban community. </P>
<P> Christopher Green of East Orange, N.J., was arrested at his home earlier in the day and has confessed to the murders of the four men and wounding a fifth man, said U.S. Attorney for Northern New Jersey Faith Hochberg. </P>
<P> ``He used some of the stolen money to pay back rent last night. He hid some of the money under the refrigerator in his apartment and he threw out the clothing he wore in the robbery,'' she said. </P>
<P> Green had worked at the post office he robbed as a temporary employee from July 1992 to April 1993 and knew his victims, Hochberg said. </P>
<P> She added that after robbing the tiny Watchung Plaza post office, he ordered the two employees and three customers to go in the back room and lie down and then he shot them all in the head. </P>
<P> Green was arrested just 19 hours after the murders at his home in an apartment complex four miles south of the murder scene. </P>
<P> ``He had a mountain of debt,'' Hochberg said, explaining the motive. </P>
<P> Earlier in the day, New Jersey postal union officials confronted Postmaster General Marvin Runyon, demanding to know if the suspect was a temporary worker who had gone through an inept screening process. </P>
<P> Runyon ducked the question at a press conference here but said post office security was a major concern and added, ``We want our post offices to be as safe as possible for employees and customers.'' </P>
<P> The murders were the latest in a long list of violent incidents at post offices across the country over the past decade, in which at least 38 people have been killed. </P>
<P> Many of the incidents have involved postal employees who have run amok, shooting and killing fellow employees. </P>
<P> Police said the bodies of the four men were discovered when a postal employee arrived for a regularly scheduled delivery in the late afternoon Tuesday at the small, two-room post office. </P>
<P> A nurse at the University Hospital in Newark where the wounded man, 44-year-old computer expert David Grossman, was flown Tuesday, said he was conscious and able to talk to police about the killings. </P>
