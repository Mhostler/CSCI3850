<P>  A man who allegedly murdered his former girlfriend and then planned to ``marry the corpse'' was in police custody Tuesday awaiting transfer to his home state of New Jersey for trial, authorities said. </P>
<P> Forrest Fuller, 28, of Pemberton, N.J., was arrested Thanksgiving Day at a Fairmont bar after he told an employee the body of his ex-girlfriend, Jodie Myers, 20, was in the back of his car. </P>
<P> ``He confessed to the murder,'' said Marion County Sheriff Ron Watkins. </P>
<P> ``It appears that he had split up with Myers recently and didn't want anybody other than himself to be involved with her. It appears to be an obsession. He shows no remorse.'' </P>
<P> Police said Fuller apparently strangled and then stabbed Myers, also of Pemberton, with a steak knife in his trailer home last Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``He called her mother on the way out of New Jersey and said he was going to California to marry the corpse. He said he'd cut off her finger bearing the wedding band and mail it to her,'' Watkins said. </P>
<P> He said Fuller faces a charge of first degree murder and is expected to be transferred to New Jersey late Wednesday or Thursday. </P>
