<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Clinton urged Americans Wednesday night to reject the entreaties of ``new isolationists,'' and tried to energize a U.S.-led effort to keep nuclear weapons from spreading. </P>
<P> In a major speech, Clinton invoked the memory of Arthur Vandenburg, a Republican senator who worked with Democratic President Harry Truman on global problems after World War II, in appealing for bipartisanship on foreign policy. </P>
<P> He also sought to identify himself with Richard Nixon, a Republican president known for his strong views on the need for the United States to stay engaged internationally. </P>
<P> ``If we are be strong at home and lead abroad, we must overcome a dangerous and growing temptation in our land to focus solely on the problems we face here in America,'' Clinton said. ``America cannot walk away from its interests or its responsibilities.'' </P>
<P> ``American leadership is necessary for the tide of history to keep running our way, and for our children to have the future they deserve,'' he said. </P>
<P> The president's speech, at a conference sponsored by the Nixon Library, amounted to a thinly veiled rebuke of many on the Republican right and some liberal Democrats who are critical of his leadership on international issues. </P>
<P> He said critics of his approach ``oppose our efforts to expand trade, reject our conviction that democracy must be nurtured with investment ... trumpet the rhetoric of American strength, but then argue against the resources we need'' to deal with problems abroad. </P>
<P> Clinton's words were clearly aimed at House Republicans, who, as part of their ``Contract with America'' legislative agenda, want to curtail U.S. involvement in U.N. peacekeeping operations and make deep cuts in U.S. foreign aid. </P>
<P> A secondary target, administration officials said, were Democratic liberals critical of Clinton's free trade policies. </P>
<P> ``The new isolationists are wrong. They would have us face the future alone,'' Clinton said. ``If we withdraw from the world today, we will have to contend with the consequences of our neglect tomorrow.'' </P>
<P> Clinton's speech coincided with the intensification of an administration push to lock in indefinitely the 25-year-old Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) at a 172-nation conference that opens in New York next month. </P>
<P> Announcing that Vice President Al Gore will lead the U.S. delegation to the conference, Clinton said: ``Nothing is more important to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons than extending the treaty indefinitely and unconditionally.'' </P>
<P> ``Failure to extend NPT indefinitely could open the door to a world of nuclear trouble. Pariah nations with rigid ideologies and expansionist ambitions would have an easier time acquiring nuclear weapons,'' he said. </P>
<P> Third World countries are resisting the extension of NPT, saying that they are unwilling to forsake nuclear weapons forever unless nuclear powers do more to promote nuclear disarmament. </P>
<P> To underscore his commitment to that, Clinton said the United States would remove 200 tons of bomb-building material -- enriched uranium and plutonium -- from its nuclear stockpiles. </P>
<P> He said the so-called fissile material that will be eliminated was ``enough for thousands of nuclear weapons.'' </P>
<P> Clinton's political parry and diplomatic move followed a speech at the same conference by Senate Republican leader Bob Dole critical of administration policy toward Russia and Iraq. </P>
<P> He said Clinton's policy toward Russia was too pro-Yeltsin and that it was a sign of weakness to send U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Madeleine Albright to other capitals to consult on a new move to lift the Iraqi sanctions. </P>
<P> ``Instead of announcing that the United States will veto any efforts to ease or end U.N. sanctions on Iraq, the administration dispatches an envoy to plead with the Europeans for cooperation. Where would such timidity have gotten us in the Cold War?'' Dole said. </P>
<P> U.S. national security adviser Tony Lake said Dole was ''wrong'' on Clinton's Russia policy and ``misinformed'' about the administration's strategy for maintaining sanctions on Iraq. </P>
<P> He said Albright had informed other U.N. members that the United States was prepared to use its Security Council veto to maintain the Iraqi sanctions if necessary. </P>
<P> ``I might add also that we do not need lectures on how to stand up to the Iraqis,'' Lake said. </P>
