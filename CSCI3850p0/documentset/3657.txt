<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  House Speaker Newt Gingrich Monday softened a Republican proposal to ban welfare payments to most legal immigrants to the United States. </P>
<P> The proposal has been part of a sweeping plan for welfare reform that is included in House Republicans' ``Contract with America,'' a list of bills that they plan for a House vote in the first 100 days of the new Congress. </P>
<P> ``I think we're going to revisit the question of eliminating legal aliens from ever getting any access to government services after some length of time being here and paying taxes,'' Gingrich said. </P>
<P> ``I am very pro legal immigration ... I think we would be a very, very self-destructive country if we sent negative signals to legal immigrants,'' he said. </P>
<P> He suggested that citizens who sponsored legal immigrants should have a binding three-to-five-year financial obligation for the immigrant being sponsored. </P>
<P> The twin burdens on the states of welfare and illegal immigration have been hot-button issues, especially during the campaigns leading up to the November elections. </P>
<P> California voters passed a controversial proposition on the ballot denying aid and education for illegal immigrants. </P>
<P> The House Republican plan went beyond that, however, to deny welfare eligibility to legal immigrants, except those who had become citizens, entered the country as refugees or had been in the United States more than five years. </P>
<P> Gingrich was asked about the proposal when he appeared with leaders and members of the National Restaurant Association at the Capitol in a demonstration of the industry's commitment to provide jobs to get people off the welfare rolls. </P>
<P> He said his position represented ``not so much a change of heart'' but he indicated that Republicans were continuing to fine-tune the proposals made last year in the light of later information. </P>
<P> Gingrich said 30 governors had now said they were prepared to accept a cap on government welfare payments for five years, saving $40 billion, providing the federal government handed over the job to the states. </P>
<P> ``We are not going to get trapped into doing something dumb just so you all can say we're consistent,'' he said. </P>
<P> During his news conference, Gingrich praised the restaurant industry for offering work opportunities for 300,000 people a year and argued strongly against increasing the minimum wage, which has stood at $4.25 since 1991. </P>
<P> Labor Secretary Robert Reich said Friday that President Clinton is actively considering a proposal to increase the minimum wage but has made no final decision. </P>
<P> Gingrich said increasing the minimum would kill jobs for the young poor. </P>
<P> ``I would be very surprised if President Clinton takes the bait from the liberals,'' he said. </P>
