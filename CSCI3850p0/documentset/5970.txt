<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  John Stennis of Mississippi was an old-style Southern Democrat who served in the Senate for 42 years from 1947 to 1989, defending segregation and wielding his considerable influence to back a strong U.S. military. </P>
<P> Stennis died Sunday of pneumonia at St. Dominic's Hospital in Jackson, Miss. He was 93. </P>
<P> Throughout his long Senate career, Stennis was known as a courtly gentleman, always with a friendly word for everyone, who believed in honor, patriotism and fiscal conservatism. </P>
<P> He belonged to the group of Southern conservatives who were most generally remembered for their adamant stands for ``states rights'' -- often code words for state-enforced racial segregation -- during the 1950s and early 1960s. </P>
<P> Yet, Stennis stood out as a soft-spoken opponent of civil rights laws rather than a foe given to bombast and bluster. </P>
<P> He was best known during his Senate career as a leader of the congressional faction favoring a strong Pentagon. </P>
<P> Stennis was chairman of the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee from 1969 until 1981, wielding his influence on every aspect of U.S. defense power. </P>
<P> In 1981, when Republicans took control of the Senate for the first time in a generation, Stennis had to move down to become ranking Democrat on that panel. </P>
<P> His influence on military affairs peaked in the 1970s when he not only held reign over the vital committee which decides weapons programs but also headed the defense appropriations subcommittee which doles out the money. </P>
<P> He was born in rural Kemper County on August 3, 1901 and was a lawyer and a well-known state circuit court judge before going to the Senate. </P>
<P> Throughout his career, the courtly Stennis maintained his calm judicial manner and was often called upon by presidents and fellow senators for advice and counsel. </P>
<P> ``I want to plow a straight furrow right down to the end of the row,'' Stennis declared in his first campaign for the Senate in 1947 and the line became his credo. </P>
<P> During the 1950s, Stennis was named to the committee investigating Republican Sen. Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin, whose anti-communist accusations gave rise to the word ``McCarthyism.'' </P>
<P> In 1954 at the conclusion of the investigation, Stennis charged McCarthy with spilling ``slush and slime'' on the Senate through his innuendo and charges. </P>
<P> The Senate soon afterwards took the unusual step of voting to censure McCarthy -- a move that pushed his career downhill. </P>
<P> Stennis, a one-time prosecutor, also was elected unanimously the first chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee even though he had voted against creating the panel. </P>
<P> He also served on the senate committee investigating the role of then-President Richard Nixon in the 1972 Watergate burglary of the Democratic Party headquarters. </P>
<P> Stennis suffered a series of personal health crises. In 1973, a gunman shot him in the stomach outside his Washington home but he soon overcame the serious injuries. </P>
<P> He had open heart surgery in December 1983 but returned to work in 1984. A year later, he had a cancerous leg removed. </P>
<P> He was honored by President Reagan, much of the Senate and a crowd of more than 1,000 in what was billed ``Celebration of a Legend'' when he retired in 1989. </P>
<P> He moved into a retirement center in 1990 after winding up part-time teaching duties in government and history at Mississippi State University, his alma mater. </P>
