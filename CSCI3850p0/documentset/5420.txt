<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Thousands of Spanish farmers from the drought-stricken southern region of Andalusia began a week-long march Monday to demand government aid. </P>
<P> Calling it a march for the survival of Andalusia, organizers estimated that some 20,000 farmers would demonstrate outside parliament in the regional capital Seville Friday after walking from four different cities. </P>
<P> The farmers, who grow rice, corn, cotton and sunflowers, are asking for direct subsidies to farmers and projects to renovate the area's irrigation systems. </P>
<P> ``Fundamentally, we are asking for investment to improve the infrastructure,'' said Miguel Lopez, regional coordinator for UAGA, a big farmers' union. ``The situation is desperate.'' </P>
<P> Farmers' unions say they need $7.9 billion to protect them from the drought. They say the European Union should pick up 75 percent of the bill, leaving the rest for Spain's regional and central governments. </P>
<P> Last year Spain provided a total of $3.21 billion to farmers hit by the drought. </P>
