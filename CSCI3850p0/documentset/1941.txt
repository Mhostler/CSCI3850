<P>  A Cold War ``culture of secrecy'' pervading the CIA, FBI and other U.S. agencies has hindered investigation into the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, a non-government panel heard Tuesday. </P>
<P> Historians seeking better access to documents in the case contend that this climate undermined the public trust in government and that this trust will not be restored until all relevant documents on the assassination are brought to light. </P>
<P> ``We hear frequently that the trust of the American people in their institutions is at an all-time low,'' attorney Jim Lesar told the Assassination Records Review Board. ``I believe that this precipitous decline in trust began with the Kennedy assassination ...'' </P>
<P> The board, an independent panel of historians that held its first hearing Tuesday at the National Archives, is trying to define what constitutes an assassination record. </P>
<P> Lesar said the government's handling of the assassination records has been marked by ``secrecy, deceit, obfuscation, rumor and innuendo.'' </P>
<P> Others testifying before the board specifically faulted the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency as being particularly balky when it came to declassifying assassination documents and even harassing researchers, especially those critical of the original government investigation into the death. </P>
<P> ``We feel that we have under the Cold War years developed in the federal government a kind of culture of secrecy and a bureaucracy that has not allowed many important records that are no longer sensitive to be opened,'' said Page Putnam Miller of the National Coordinating Committee for the Promotion of History. </P>
<P> Miller said there were trillions of documents that could reasonably be made accessible to historians, lawyers and others without jeopardizing national security. </P>
<P> Among those, said historian John Newman, are all intelligence materials related to Lee Harvey Oswald, any record of the official investigation and certain Cold War policy documents pertaining to the Soviet Union, Cuba, Vietnam and arms control. </P>
<P> The board has a three-year mandate to identify, locate and make available documents on the Kennedy assassination. </P>
