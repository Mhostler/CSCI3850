<P>  Japan plans to start gradually withdrawing its troops from Rwandan refugee camps in Zaire early next month, a Defense Ministry official said Thursday. </P>
<P> ``We planned to complete the troops pullout by the end of December. That means a step-by-step withdrawal should begin possibly in early December,'' the official told Reuters. </P>
<P> The 260 troops and air force personnel arrived in the Goma area early in October following the withdrawal of French forces. </P>
<P> The troops are only allowed to provide transportation, medical help, water and aid in preventing epidemics in the camps, where Rwandans have sought refuge from the mass killings that swept their country. </P>
<P> The troops' presence has become a hot political issue in Japan since refugees attacked a truck carrying three Japanese members of a volunteer organization and their local assistants. </P>
<P> About 20 armed Japanese troops went to the group's aid. </P>
<P> A spokeswoman for the volunteer group -- The Association of Medical Doctors for Asia (AMDA) -- in Japan said the team would leave Goma Saturday to join colleagues in Bukavu. </P>
<P> She said poor security was not the main reason for the transfer of the medical team. </P>
<P> ``Although we must not ignore the security situation there, that's not the reason. We worked out this plan a long time ago,'' she told Reuters. </P>
<P> There were a sufficent number of international aid workers in the Goma camps, she said. </P>
<P> ``In Bukavu, there is much to be done by our staff... But it is also true that security is better,'' she said. </P>
<P> Aid officials in Goma said this week that threats against aid workers in the camps were increasing and at least 20 people -- mainly refugees -- had been killed in clashes in the camps in the last two weeks. </P>
<P> U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali plans to ask the Security Council to consider sending a police contingent or rapid deployment force to tighten security in the camps and break a reign of terror by Rwandan Hutu militiamen and troops. </P>
