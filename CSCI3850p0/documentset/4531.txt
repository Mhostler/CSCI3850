<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A U.S. appeals court Friday refused to dismiss criminal charges against former Minnesota Senator David Durenberger for conspiring to make false claims to the Senate over a condominium deal. </P>
<P> Durenberger was charged last year in a two-count indictment with conspiring to hide his ownership interest in a Minnesota condominium so he could obtain Senate reimbursement when he traveled to his home state. </P>
<P> The indictment said Durenberger, a Republican who served in the Senate from 1979 until 1994 when he decided not to seek reelection, and others devised a scheme under which some of the cost of the condominium would be paid by the Senate. </P>
<P> In his appeal, Durenberger argued that the Senate rules committee has exclusive authority to determine who shall be entitled to reimbursement for expenses. He said his prosecution by the Justice Department violated the constitutional requirement on the separation of powers between the branches of government. </P>
<P> He also argued that he could not be prosecuted for making a false claim because the law bars the Justice Department from ''second-guessing'' a rules committee decision on expenses. </P>
<P> But the appeals court's three-judge panel unanimously rejected the appeal and upheld a federal judge's ruling that dismissed the claims. The ruling clears the way for Durenberger to stand trial if he does not make any more appeals. The charges carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. </P>
<P> The Senate disciplined Durenberger in 1990, denouncing him for the condominium billings as well as other improper financial transactions. </P>
