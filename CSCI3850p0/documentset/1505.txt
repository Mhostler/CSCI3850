<P>  The men who have kept Vladimir Lenin's body preserved for 70 years are trying their magic on North Korea's Kim Il-sung. </P>
<P> Itar-Tass news agency said Tuesday Russia's specialist embalmers had already begun work in Pyongyang on the body of the North Korean strongman who died on July 8. </P>
<P> Tass, quoting sources close to Moscow's Institute of Biological Structures, said the embalming process would take from eight to 12 months with the simplest variant costing between $300,000 to $500,000. </P>
<P> But creating an environment for the long-term preservation and display of the body -- similar to that in which Lenin's mummified corpse has been kept for seven decades -- could cost up to $5 million, it added. </P>
<P> Apart from the body of the Soviet state founder, which lies in a mausoleum on Moscow's Red Square, Russian embalmers also preserved for posterity the corpses of Vietnam's Ho Chi-Minh, Agostino Neto of Angola and Clement Gottwald of Czechoslovakia. </P>
<P> Tass said the Russian center was tying up financial and other details of the deal in negotiations with a visiting North Korean delegation. </P>
<P> Under the Russian method of embalming, all fluids are removed from the body and it is then dipped in a special preserving fluid. </P>
<P> Tass said North Korean authorities had not yet decided where the North Korean leader's body would be put on display. </P>
