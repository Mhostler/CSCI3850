<DATELINE>BOSTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  More than three decades after John Kennedy occupied the White House and Robert Kennedy was attorney general, five members of America's most famous political clan are running for office. </P>
<P> And the name, it seems, still carries some of the magic of Camelot -- for now. </P>
<P> In a poor section of Boston, Sen. Edward Kennedy, who has moved ahead in his race for re-election to the Senate, receives the endorsement of women from 75 diverse advocacy groups. </P>
<P> Across town in the city's financial district, his nephew Rep. Joseph Kennedy -- the self-described ``pit bull'' of his uncle's campaign -- attends a public hearing on descrimination in property insurance. </P>
<P> In Providence, Rhode Island, Ted Kennedy's 27-year-old son Patrick, is campaigning in a gritty working class suburb for a first term in one of the state's two House of Representatives seats. </P>
<P> Also running are two other members of the Kennedy clan: Kathleen Kennedy Townsend - daughter of Robert Kennedy - is Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor in Maryland, and Mark Shriver, son of Ted Kennedy's sister Eunice, is running for a seat in the Maryland House of Delegates. </P>
<P> ``It's a name that still has a lot of celebrity status,'' observed Mickey Edwards, a former Republican congressman from Oklahoma and now a lecturer in public policy at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. </P>
<P> ``Although this is not the generation that created the magic of the Kennedy name, the magic still clings to them.'' </P>
<P> While other dynasties like the Roosevelts and the Rockefellers have left a lasting mark on American history, none of them still attract the kind of enduring national and global attention of the Kennedys. </P>
<P> In a televised debate Tuesday between Ted Kennedy and Mitt Romney, the most serious Republican challenger for Kennedy's seat in his 32 years in the Senate, the press corps bristled with media representatives from Japan, France, Germany, Britain, Australia and a host of other countries. </P>
<P> ``In this election, the Europeans are looking for a race that they can hook into,'' said a producer from Germany's ZDF televison. ``The Kennedys are it.'' </P>
<P> But for all the fame of the Kennedy name, there are negatives. </P>
<P> ``There's the downside of people thinking they know where you stand, the temptation to challenge you to make themselves a name, and the problem that if you're a Kennedy you have to try hard to convince people that you have some substance and can make it not just on your name,'' said Edwards. </P>
<P> In the campaign for an election where poll after poll shows anger at incumbent politicians and a swing to greater conservatism, even in formerly liberal states, the Kennedys still have a significant powerbase in Massachusetts. </P>
<P> One measure of that is Republicans have not even fielded a candidate to oppose Joseph Kennedy for his seat in Congress. </P>
<P> Voters seem weary of the rough-and-tumble campaign fought mainly through a barrage of costly television advertising between Ted Kennedy and Romney, a dashing multi-millionaire businessman who boasts of being a political neophyte. </P>
<P> The New York Times recently decribed Romney as the ``perfect anti-Kennedy'' suggesting that his biggest advantage may be what he is not, rather than what he is. </P>
<P> But that view appears to be wearing thin. </P>
<P> ``Romney offers himself as the candidate of change,'' the Boston Globe said in an editorial on Thursday. ``What he would change from is obvious; what he would change to is still unclear.'' </P>
