<P>  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin will go to Jordan Monday for a joint television interview with King Hussein to mark Israel Independence Day, Rabin's spokesman said. </P>
<P> Spokesman Oded Ben-Ami said Rabin and the king would meet at the Red Sea port of Aqaba to record the interview with Israel Television ahead of the holiday marking 47 years of Israeli statehood and beginning Wednesday night. </P>
<P> Rabin would then tour the ancient red-rock site of Petra for the first time, Ben-Ami said. </P>
<P> The two leaders signed a peace treaty in October ending a 46-year official state of war between Israel and Jordan. </P>
<P> ``The prime minister is travelling tomorrow,'' Ben-Ami told Reuters Sunday. ``He will be in Aqaba for a joint interview with King Hussein for a broadcast on Independence Day for Israel TV and visit Petra.'' </P>
<P> Ben-Ami said the joint holiday interview was the idea of state-run Israel Television. </P>
<P> Israeli leaders began meeting the king publicly last year after more than 20 years of meetings kept secret because of the official state of war. </P>
<P> Israelis -- knowing their leaders had tacitly cooperated and secretly negotiated with Jordan for years -- were at ease making peace with Amman, especially since the deal did not require hefty land concessions dominating other negotiations. </P>
<P> Even so, Israelis have faced an uphill battle. Palestinians, who make up much of Jordan's 4.2 million population, view Israel as an occupier of their land and the treaty as the death knell to their hopes of returning. </P>
<P> An ancient Nabatean city, Petra has become something of a legend in Israel. </P>
<P> For generations, Israeli youths lost their lives stealing across the border for a glance at the city carved in red stone. Some were killed, others died of exposure. </P>
<P> The journey fraught with danger so worried Israel that for a time it banned a popular Hebrew song about Petra from radio stations. </P>
<P> When Rabin signed the peace treaty with the king he said Petra, like peace itself, was no longer a dream. </P>
