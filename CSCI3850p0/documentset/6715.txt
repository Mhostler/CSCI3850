<DATELINE>KINSHASA, Zaire (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Zaire Saturday lifted a blockade that had been preventing trucks and several thousand people from its Ebola virus epidemic zone traveling to the capital, a World Health Organization official said. </P>
<P> ``The blockade has been lifted and the trucks are on their way into Kinshasa,'' WHO representative in Zaire, Abdu Moody, told Reuters. </P>
<P> The government and city officials imposed the blockade to prevent the spread to the capital of the deadly virus, which has so far killed 97 of the 128 people known to have been infected. Five Italian nuns have died and a sixth is ill with Ebola disease. </P>
<P> Travelers, stranded by a road block on Zaire's main highway at Mongata about 90 miles from Kinshasa, had been growing increasingly angry as food and water ran short at the isolated junction. </P>
<P> Kinshasa's governor and Zaire's health minister rescheduled a visit to the roadblock from Friday to Saturday, for fear that they would be lynched, one official said earlier. The visit was to assess conditions and decide whether to maintain the blockade. </P>
<P> The disease, which is spread by contact with blood or bodily fluids and kills by causing uncontrollable bleeding, has so far not spread beyond Bandundu province, which provided almost half of the capital's food. It first surfaced in the town of Kikwit, 300 miles from the capital.  Travel restrictions initially affected only movement between Kinshasa and Kikwit, the town at the heart of the epidemic 320 miles east of the capital. They were extended to all travelers from the virus-infected Bandundu province as the virus surfaced in towns on the road to the capital. </P>
<P> Authorities fear the arrival of the disease in Kinshasa, a city of five million people and one of the filthiest capitals in the world, could spell disaster. The capital's infrastructure and medical services have broken down through neglect. </P>
<P> So far no cases have been reported there but rising prices and fear of food shortages fuelled tension. </P>
<P> ``We have made concrete propositions to the minister of health who has passed the proposals to the government,'' commission president Bompenda Bonkumo told Reuters Friday. </P>
<P> Aides in the official party said authorities wanted to screen all stranded people, a move that could trigger further delay, more chaos and possible unrest. ``It's just impossible to imagine how they can screen all these people one by one,'' one visitor to Mongata said. </P>
<P> The commission's proposals call for one or two centers outside Kinshasa to screen only those travelers showing suspicious symptoms. ``Not everybody coming from the region to Kinshasa will be sent there,'' Bompenda said. </P>
<P> Regional administrators have piled pressure on the central government to lift the quarantine measures, which they say have paralyzed the economy of the area. The WHO also says such measures tend to be ineffective. </P>
