<P>  Former interior minister Antonio Gava, once one of Italy's most powerful politicians, was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of links with the Naples Mafia. </P>
<P> Police said Gava, a 64-year-old former Christian Democrat who has previously denied similar accusations, was picked up before dawn at his home in Rome and remanded in custody at a military prison in the capital. </P>
<P> Gava, who held the country's most sensitive portfolio from 1988 to 1991, was the most prominent member of the political old guard to be arrested in Italy's judicial assault on corruption. </P>
<P> Dozens of other suspects were also held including a former deputy chairman of parliament's justice commission, Socialist Raffaele Mastrantuono, businessmen and alleged clan bosses of the Camorra, the Naples area Mafia. </P>
<P> A statement by the public prosecutor's office in Naples said a total of 98 arrest warrants had been issued and assets worth tens of millions of dollars confiscated as part of the operation. </P>
<P> It said the arrests followed testimony from Carmine Alfieri, undisputed chief of the Camorra clans for a decade until his arrest in 1992, and his leading lieutenant, Pasquale Galasso. </P>
<P> Alfieri, who wrested control of the clans in a turf war littered with corpses, broke organized crime's strict code of silence in March and turned state's evidence, saying he wanted ``to bring myself closer to God.'' </P>
<P> Gava's power base in Naples, dubbed Italy's ``kickbacks capital'' by investigators, made him baron of one of the most powerful factions in the once mighty Christian Democrat party. </P>
<P> The Interior Ministry gave Gava control over police, civil intelligence and the fight against organized crime. </P>
<P> The Christian Democrats, in government since World War Two until this year, never once ceded the portfolio to other coalition parties because it was so powerful. </P>
<P> The current minister Roberto Maroni of the Northern League, the first non-Christian Democrat to hold the office, said Gava's arrest illustrated the revolution in Italian politics. </P>
<P> ``It's now certain that there are no more idols, sacred cows or taboos in Italy that the judiciary is unable to demolish,'' Maroni told reporters. </P>
<P> Gava's lawyer, Carlo Taormina, said his client, who has been in poor health, was basically accused of building his political prestige in a trade-off of votes for favors with the Camorra. </P>
<P> He called the claims, and Gava's arrest, incomprehensible and politically motivated. </P>
<P> ``Somebody wanted to strike at an emblem of the political and institutional life of the first republic,'' Taormina said. </P>
<P> Gava, named in a report to parliament's anti-Mafia commission last November as a politician with ties to the Camorra, did not stand for parliament in the elections which buried Italy's traditional political parties last March. </P>
<P> He already faces a number of probes in the corruption scandals that have rocked Italy over the past two years. Another of Naples' old political bosses, former health minister Francesco De Lorenzo, is in a city jail accused of accepting bribes from drug companies. </P>
<P> Seven times prime minister Giulio Andreotti, under whom Gava served at the interior ministry, has been accused by magistrates in Palermo of membership of the Sicilian Mafia. </P>
<P> Judges are due to decide in December whether Andreotti, who calls the accusations absurd, should stand trial. </P>
