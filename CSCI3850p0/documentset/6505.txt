<DATELINE>KIEV, Ukraine (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Clinton, his head bowed and covered in a yarmulke, paid tribute Friday to more than 100,000 people killed at Babi Yar, one of the first sites of mass Nazi killing of Jews in World War II. </P>
<P> Clinton, his wife Hillary at his side, stood on the edge of the ravine where the bodies of Jews were dumped after SS guards herded them together from all districts of Kiev and shot them one after the other in the neck. </P>
<P> After Hillary Clinton tossed lilies over the side, the president put his arm around her waist and held her. </P>
<P> ``The victims of Babi Yar cry out to us still. Never forget they tell us that humanity is capable of the worst just as it is capable of the best,'' Clinton said next to the menorah erected at the site in 1991. </P>
<P> ``Never forget that the forces of darkness cannot be defeated with silence or indifference. Never forget that we are all Jews, Gypsies and Slavs. Never forget. May God bless this holy place.'' </P>
<P> The couple then stood alone at a second memorial erected by Soviet authorities in the 1970s. A wreath was placed for them as a rabbi recited the kaddish, the Jewish prayer for the dead. </P>
<P> Clinton later told reporters the view looking into the ravine was ``overwhelming. I wish every American could stand on the edge of the ravine and look down that ravine.'' </P>
<P> A total of 33,771 Jews were killed in 10 days between the Jewish high holy days of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur in 1941 -- within weeks of the Nazi occupation of Kiev. </P>
<P> Gypsies and Ukrainian nationalists were dumped regularly into the ravine after killings over the next two years. </P>
<P> The exact number of dead may never be known, but most historians put the figure at a little more than 100,000. </P>
<P> Historical accounts of Babi Yar record that Nazi occupying authorities ordered Kiev's Jewish community to assemble in the city on Sept. 29, 1941 after Soviet underground agents had blown up a number of Nazi headquarters. </P>
<P> Jews were marched en masse to the ravine past incredulous Kiev residents and told to undress at the ravine. The shots from the mass shootings could be heard two miles away in the city center. </P>
<P> When the Red Army began advancing across Ukraine following the Nazi defeat at Stalingrad, German officers ordered the site to be dug up and the remains of tens of thousands of victims burned to cover up traces of the massacres. </P>
<P> For nearly three decades after the war, the site stood unmarked, inspiring Soviet poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko to write a poem saying ``No gravestone stands on Babi Yar.'' </P>
<P> Soviet authorities erected the first monument in 1974, but pointedly omitting all references to the Jewish origin of so many of the dead. </P>
<P> The menorah was erected on the 50th anniversary of the 1941 killings, when Ukrainian leader Leonid Kravchuk officially apologized for what many Jews saw as indifference to their fate at the time. Two years later Kravchuk made a more formal apology in a speech to the Israeli Knesset. </P>
<P> Leaders of Ukraine's 500,000-strong Jewish community, the country's second largest ethnic minority after 11 million Russians, say relations with Ukrainians are excellent in the post-Soviet era. </P>
