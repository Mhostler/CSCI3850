<DATELINE>ROME (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A 62-year-old Italian woman who had a donor's fertilised eggs implanted in her uterus gave birth Monday to a boy, the clinic where she was treated said. </P>
<P> Roseanna Della Corte, who lives in the central Italian town of Canino, is described in Italy as the world's oldest mother. </P>
<P> Della Corte's pregnancy was supervised by controversial fertility doctor Severino Antinori, who last year helped a 59-year-old British woman give birth to twins. </P>
<P> Staff at Antinori's Rome clinic said Della Corte and her child were both well. They declined to say where the baby was born or how the child was delivered. </P>
<P> So-called ``granny pregnancies'' have unleashed an ethical storm in Italy. A government-appointed committee last month recommended that scientifically assisted pregnancies should be limited to couples of child-bearing age. </P>
<P> Antinori fertilised the anonymous donor's eggs with the sperm of Della Corte's husband, who is in his 60s. She has said she wanted a baby following the death in 1991 of her 17-year-old only child, Riccardo, in a road accident. </P>
