<DATELINE>OKLAHOMA CITY (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Federal prosecutors Tuesday linked Timothy McVeigh, the only man charged so far with the devastating Oklahoma City blast, to a bomb and arms-making plot in Michigan with two right-wing extremists. </P>
<P> As officials said the death toll from the bombing could top 200, McVeigh, 27 was listed as a co-conspirator in federal charges filed in Michigan against farming brothers James and Terry Nichols. </P>
<P> The charges were not linked to the Oklahoma bomb. </P>
<P> The official death toll in last Wednesday's disaster has reached 90 with about 135 people still missing. </P>
<P> Assistant Fire Chief Jon Hansen said rescuers may be between 24 and 48 hours away from the heart of a 250-ton pile of rubble, the area where they expect to find at least 100 more bodies, including 20 children from a day care center. </P>
<P> The charges of bomb and firearms-making allow officials to hold the Nichols brothers while they probe whether the Oklahoma blast was plotted by a small band of extremists who think they are at war with the government. </P>
<P> CNN reported that McVeigh was refusing to speak to authorities, claiming he was a political prisoner. It said McVeigh would only give his name, rank and serial number -- the only information a prisoner of war gives his captors. </P>
<P> CNN said the FBI found traces of ammonium nitrate on McVeigh's clothes and in his car which link him to the ammonium nitrate fertilizer bomb used in Oklahoma. </P>
<P> It also said a witness identified McVeigh as a man seen getting out of a truck at the building shortly before the blast and that McVeigh had been linked to an apparent test bomb in Kingman, Ariz., while he lived there last year. </P>
<P> Police are still hunting a man identified only as ``John Doe II'' who they say rented the truck used in the bombing with McVeigh. They issued a new sketch of the dark-haired, tattooed man Tuesday, this time showing him in a baseball cap. </P>
<P> The complaint filed against the Nichols brothers in Milan, Mich., said that James conspired from 1992 to 1995 with his brother and McVeigh to ``to make and possess firearms, that is destructive devices.'' </P>
<P> The Nichols brothers had been held since Friday as material witnesses in the case -- James after agents raided his farm in Decker, Mich., and Terry after he turned himself in to police at Herington, Kan. </P>
<P> Prosecutors told federal magistrate Lynn Hooe that James Nichols might flee and presented a threat to the community. McVeigh, James Nichols, 41, and Terry, 40, have ties to the Michigan Militia, an anti-government paramilitary group which is part of a pro-gun anti-government movement operating in several states. </P>
<P> Its ranks have been swollen by those who hate the government for its showdown with the Branch Davidian sect in Texas two years ago, which ended in more than 70 deaths. </P>
<P> Court papers accompanying the indictment said James Nichols ``made comments stating that judges and President Clinton should be killed and that he blamed the FBI and ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms) for killing the Branch Davidians in Waco.'' </P>
<P> McVeigh will be arraigned on Thursday but both his court-appointed lawyers said they were dropping out because they had friends among those who died. </P>
<P> The attorneys have also received death threats. </P>
<P> Officials say that pieces of blue plastic were found embedded in the bodies of several of the victims and media reports said investigators were trying to see if they matched blue drums found in a search of the home of Terry Nichols. </P>
<P> With hundreds of people phoning in tips on a toll-free number, officials say they are developing many leads but this has also led to false breakthroughs. </P>
<P> Two men in different parts of the country were briefly detained because they resembled the face in a drawing of the second suspect distributed by the FBI. But both were cleared. </P>
