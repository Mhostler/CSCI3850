<P>  A USAir jet crash during a thunderstorm here in July could have been avoided if the pilots had used proper landing procedures for violent wind shifts, said an engineer with the maker of the jet Thursday. </P>
<P> USAir Flight 1016 crashed into woods July 2 after the aircraft aborted a landing during a thunderstorm, killing 37 of the 57 people on board. </P>
<P> William Rickard, of the aerodynamics-acoustics unit of McDonnell Douglas Corp's Douglas Aircraft Co. division, said the flight crew may have been able to prevent the crash had they known of the deadly wind shear. </P>
<P> They then could have followed normal flight procedures, Rickard told the National Transportation Safety Board. </P>
<P> Once aborting a landing, normal procedure is to fly straight rather than turn, according to pilots and engineers. </P>
<P> Heavy rains impaired visibility and the pilots of the DC-9-30 testified earlier this week before the NTSB that in the attempt to avoid the landing they steered right. </P>
<P> ``When the plane turned right, it flew directly into the path of the microburst,'' Rickard said. </P>
<P> A microburst is a more violent type of wind shear. </P>
<P> Air traffic controller Jeffrey Vincent testified Monday that he too was surprised the plane turned right, saying he was then unable to transmit weather information to the pilots because of the need to re-route the plane's flight path. </P>
<P> Rickard's testimony comes during the last of the NTSB's four-day hearings to piece together the cause of the crash, and two weeks after another USAir plane crashed near Pittsburgh, killing all 132 people aboard. </P>
<P> The July 2 and September 8 crashes were the fourth and fifth fatal accidents involving USAir jets in five years. </P>
<P> In July the jet was flying to Memphis, Tenn. from Columbia, S.C., with a scheduled stop at Charlotte-Douglas International Airport. </P>
