<P>  A Republican think-tank headed by prospective presidential candidate Jack Kemp Wednesday blasted President Clinton's record on foreign policy and advocated the use of air power in Bosnia. </P>
<P> Empower America, a Republican group co-headed by Kemp, who served as housing secretary in the Bush admnistration, along with former education secretary William Bennett, issued a scathing report on Clinton's performance. </P>
<P> Former U.N. ambassador Jeanne Kirkpatrick, the main author of the report, said Clinton's foreign policy team was well-meaning but weak and had made too many mistakes. </P>
<P> ``The foreign policy of the Clinton administration at mid-term is not a disaster. But it is also not a success. It does not reflect the high standards and moral seriousness we were led to expect. It is, at best, disappointing,'' Kirkpatrick wrote. </P>
<P> But speaking at a news conference, Kirkpatrick was far more harsh, saying the recent deterioration of the situation in former Yugoslavia was a new and major U.S. failure which she compared to the appeasement of Nazi Germany in the 1930s. </P>
<P> ``We have been living through a very painful reminder that appeasement never works,'' said Kirkpatrick. She advocated the immediate use of NATO air power to force Bosnian Serbs to halt their aggression. </P>
<P> Kemp, who is considering whether to run for the presidency in 1996, said the main lesson of the 20th century was that weakness provoked aggression. He said that was a lesson Clinton and his foreign policy team had forgotten. </P>
