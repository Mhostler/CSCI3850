<P>  Two bishops attending a Vatican synod said Thursday that the movement to allow women to become priests smacked of American cultural imperialism and did not matter to most people in much of the world. </P>
<P> A number of nuns at the month-long synod have called for an end to male domination in Roman Catholicism, urging authorities to open their eyes to women's talents and recognize feminism as a gift to the Church. </P>
<P> The two bishops spoke in response to questions at a news conference from two American nuns who said the Church needed to open the priesthood to women. </P>
<P> ``Why is it that in certain parts of the world a small group speaks so much about this particular issue,'' said Archbishop Orlando Quevedo of the Philippines. </P>
<P> He said most of the synod representatives from Africa, Asia and South America were not talking about it. </P>
<P> ``Very often one problem belaboring one local church, say the United States, becomes a problem for the whole church,'' Quevedo said. </P>
<P> ``We in the developing countries are wondering: Is this part of -- pardon the phrase -- cultural imperialism? Is this something that is going to be important to developing countries?'' </P>
<P> Archbishop Tadeusz Kondrusiewicz of Moscow said: ``I agree absolutely. Nobody from Eastern countries (at the synod) posed such a problem.'' </P>
<P> The Catholic Church says it has no authority to ordain women because Christ chose only men as his apostles. Women's groups have rejected this ban, which the pope has called definitive. </P>
<P> The questions about women priests at the news conference were asked by Sister Michele Olley and Sister Donna Quinn, both members of the National Coalition of American Nuns. </P>
<P> After the news conference, other members of the coalition contested Quevedo's assertions. </P>
<P> Women's rights has become an issue at the synod, where 348 delegates from around the world, only 59 of them women, are discussing the life of priests, nuns and friars in the Church. </P>
<P> Women make up some 72 percent of ``consecrated'' members of the Church -- priests, nuns, friars and other members of religious orders who take vows, such as poverty and chastity. </P>
<P> Several delegates at the synod, which ends on October 29, have asked that qualified nuns at least be allowed to hold senior decision-making jobs throughout the Church and in the Vatican Curia, its male-dominated central administration. </P>
