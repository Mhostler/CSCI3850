<P>  A Canadian province is considering mandatory AIDS tests for health workers after health officials confirmed a doctor practiced medicine for up to 10 years while carrying HIV. </P>
<P> Alberta Premier Ralph Klein said Tuesday a provincial government committee has been formed to conduct a review on testing and disclosure policies for health workers. </P>
<P> ``I think we would have to move fairly quickly on this,'' Klein told reporters following a cabinet meeting where the issue was discussed. </P>
<P> Public health officials announced Monday a doctor infected with HIV, the virus associated with AIDS, had voluntarily stopped practicing medicine at the Fort Saskatchewan Hospital after becoming ill. </P>
<P> It is believed the doctor, who officials declined to name, contracted the virus between five and 10 years ago. </P>
<P> The doctor performed dozens of operations while carrying the virus. About 170 patients considered most at risk of infection are being tracked down and advised to undergo blood tests. </P>
<P> Dr. Bryce Larke, medical director of the province's AIDS program, stressed the risk of infection is extremely low but ''not zero.'' </P>
<P> A telephone help-line set up to answer questions about the risk was swamped with calls Tuesday. </P>
<P> But an AIDS support group spokesperson warned government and health officials are over-reacting and could be unnecessarily creating public hysteria. </P>
<P> There should be no concern about transmitting the disease if usual precautions were taken, said Sandra Maygard, co-ordinator of the local AIDS support group. </P>
<P> ``I'm making the assumption that all surgeons wear surgical gloves when operating,'' said Maygard. ``Even if this man had cuts on his hands, he's got surgical gloves on,'' she added. </P>
