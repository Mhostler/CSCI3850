<P>  A British junior minister resigned from Prime Minister John Major's government Tuesday after he picked up a pickaxe during a confrontation with protesters blocking a road project. </P>
<P> Scottish Office minister Allan Stewart wrote to Prime Minister John Major to say: ``I do not wish in any way to be an embarrassment to a government I have been proud to serve.'' Stewart says he picked up the pickaxe to prevent it being used by anyone else during the incident Sunday. Protesters say he threatened them and police are investigating. </P>
<P> Major wrote to Stewart, a minister since 1981, saying he was sorry he had resigned. ``But I do understand and appreciate your reasons for doing so,'' he added. </P>
<P> During Sunday's incident, Stewart, 52, confronted demonstrators trying to prevent a new motorway being built through his central Scotland constituency. </P>
<P> Protestors say he tore down posters they had put up before brandishing the pickaxe aggressively. </P>
<P> Major named another of the 11 Conservative MPs who sit for Scottish seats, George Kynoch, to take over responsibility for industry and local government affairs at the Scottish Office. </P>
<P> Two junior ministers resigned from Major's government In October over allegations that they failed to disclose favors from Harrods department store owner Mohammed al-Fayed. One of them, Neil Hamilton, strongly denied the claims. </P>
