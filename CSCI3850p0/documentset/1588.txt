<P>  One of the world's finest collection of teddy bears is up for sale because their owners say no one was able to find their home. </P>
<P> Colin and Wendy Lewis blamed tourist officials and local councillors for plummeting attendance at their teddy bear museum in the western English town of Tetbury because they were banned from putting up direction signs to say where it was. </P>
<P> ``It is such a pity. People have told us we had the best teddy museum in the world. We have had the heart and stuffing knocked out of us by this,'' Colin Lewis said, announcing the sale of 2,300 bears by the auctioneers Sotheby's next month. </P>
