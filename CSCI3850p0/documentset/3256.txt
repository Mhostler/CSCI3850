<P>  China stoked the fires Friday in its battle to win re-entry to the GATT, warning it would retaliate if Washington took action against China because it regarded Beijing's concessions as inadequate. </P>
<P> ``We hope that substantive talks on China's GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) membership will be finished by the end of this year,'' the People's Daily quoted Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi as saying. </P>
<P> ``But we will never yield to external pressure or threat,'' she said. ``We have prepared for both the best and the worst.'' </P>
<P> In Geneva, major trading powers are weighing a new draft protocol for China's accession to the GATT, which offers a compromise formula for Beijing in line with China's self-imposed deadline of Dec. 31. </P>
<P> U.S. and European Union officials said they expected round-the-clock negotiations over the weekend before a key meeting Tuesday to formally take stock of China's application. </P>
<P> However, Wu said China would not be cowed by what she called threats this week by visiting U.S. negotiator Lee Sands who warned it would be very difficult for China to re-enter the GATT if Beijing failed to reach agreement with the United States on protection of intellectual property rights. </P>
<P> She quoted Sands as saying Washington could retaliate if Beijing did not meet U.S. demands for better copyright protection. </P>
<P> ``The day when the United States produces its list for retaliation will be the day when China produces hers,'' Wu was quoted as saying, adding that China feared neither U.S. threats to obstruct China's entry or its retaliation. </P>
<P> Beijing is insisting on joining the GATT by year-end and on being a founder member of its successor body, the World Trade Organization (WTO). </P>
<P> In Geneva, Pierre-Louis Girard, who chairs the GATT working group negotiating China's terms of entry, last Friday proposed a new accession protocol for the world's sixth largest trading entity. </P>
<P> Details of the 25-page secret text and 12 annexes were not available. But officials said the draft included provisions for transition periods and other special derogations in some areas from GATT's non-discrimination rules governing global trade. </P>
<P> The draft protocol does not grant China outright its demand for the status of a developing country with special GATT rights, but recognizes ``certain features'' of the Chinese economy, according to trade officials scrutinising the proposal. </P>
<P> ``In eight years of talks, this is the most tense and drastic moment,'' the People's Daily said in a commentary. </P>
<P> The United States is leading the charge among major trading powers for China to speed up its market opening for industrial and farm goods as well as service industries, and is especially keen to see better copyright protection. </P>
<P> China applied in 1986 to rejoin GATT, which it left in 1949 after the communist takeover. </P>
<P> Wu insisted China had made unprecedented progress in legislation governing copyrights since an agreement between Washington and Beijing in 1992, and said the level of protection continued to improve. </P>
<P> She said she was most dissatisfied with the progress of ongoing bilateral talks, and warned that if substantive talks on China's GATT re-entry were not concluded by the end of the year, China would no longer offer to take part in bilateral or China working group talks. </P>
<P> ``China has adopted a positive attitude toward its GATT re-entry during the eight-plus years of negotiation, and if any party should exert pressure upon us and block our re-entry, it is not China that should be held responsible for all the consequences,'' Wu was quoted as saying. </P>
<P> However, she held out a kernel of hope, saying talks remained the best way to narrow differences and resolve contradictions, and adding that with GATT entry access to China's market would be greater. </P>
