<P>  The U.S. government may tighten its recent crime bill and use anti-racketeering laws to stop fund-raising in the United States for guerrilla groups like the Palestinian Hamas, the State Department said on Tuesday. </P>
<P> Secretary of State Warren Christopher said on Monday Washington would ``seek new legislation where necessary'' to stop Hamas -- which has killed 26 people in Israel in a string of recent attacks -- raising money in the United States. </P>
<P> Washington also began a diplomatic offensive last week to persuade other countries to follow suit, particularly Gulf Arab states where rich individuals contribute funds to Hamas, according to Israeli officials. </P>
<P> State Department spokeswoman Christine Shelly said several U.S. government departments had been looking for some time at legal ways ``to cut off domestic material support for terrorist acts committed by Hamas or any other terrorist group. </P>
<P> ``We will be reviewing existing U.S. counter-terrorism and related laws with a view toward expanding their reach and strengthening enforcement,'' Shelly said. </P>
<P> She told reporters the crime bill, passed in August after a stormy passage through Congress, had several provisions that could be beefed up, including one that penalises the provision of money and equipment for specific acts of terrorism. </P>
<P> The administration was also looking at the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations (RICO) act, which has been used among other things in extortion cases involving organized crime, to see if it could apply to counter-terrorism. </P>
<P> Although allegations of fund-raising in the United States by Hamas, an Islamic group which opposes the PLO policy of peace with Israel, have dominated the debate, Shelly said any new legislation could also target Jewish extremist groups. </P>
<P> She said seven or eight government agencies were involved in the review and that the process was likely to take some time. </P>
