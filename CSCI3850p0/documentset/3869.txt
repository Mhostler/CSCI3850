<P>  Six wolves, including a rare blue-colored male, were released Friday into Yellowstone National Park where wildlife biologists hope they will successfully re-establish the species, park officials said. </P>
<P> Another 11 gray wolves were sent to central Idaho -- where four were previously released last Saturday -- completing this year's portion of a controversial plan to bring the gray wolf back to the American West, where it has been absent for more than 60 years. </P>
<P> The six at the park joined another eight which were released last week. </P>
<P> Park spokeswoman Cheryl Matthews said the wolves, which were caught in the Canadian Rockies, were doing well. </P>
<P> The 29 wolves in both areas make up the full complement of this year's wolf release. </P>
<P> Ranchers have been harshly critical of the prospect of having wolves in the area, fearing they will attack livestock. A lawsuit is pending in federal court to stop the $6 million plan, which calls for bringing in 30 wolves over the next three to five years. </P>
