<P>  British scientist Joseph Needham, whose lifelong study of China made him one of the world's leading scholars, has died at the age of 94, his Cambridge University college said Saturday. </P>
<P> Needham started his academic career as an embryologist in the 1930s and helped to set up the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 1946. He then turned his full attention on China's impact on the world. </P>
<P> Rev. John Sturdy, dean of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, with which Needham was associated for more than 70 years, said he died peacefully Friday. </P>
<P> ``He was one of the great men of the century, a polymath,'' said Sturdy. ``He had an extraordinary range of interests.'' </P>
<P> His epic 15-volume work, ``Science and Civilization in China'' became a landmark history and took up 40 years of his life. </P>
<P> One reviewer described the work as ``perhaps the greatest single act of historical synthesis and intercultural communication ever attempted by one man.'' </P>
<P> Needham's driving ambition was to explore why China -- home of inventions including the clock, gunpowder, printing and the mariner's compass -- did not enjoy a scientific revolution and become a fully fledged world power. </P>
<P> His opus covered subjects ranging from history, philosophy and astronomy to clock-making, acupuncture and navigation. </P>
<P> It helped to earn him China's prestigious Order of the Brilliant Star in 1990 and in the same year Beijing made him a Friendship Ambassador. </P>
<P> Needham first became interested in the history of Chinese science in the early 1940s, when he was scientific counsellor at the British embassy in Chungking, China's wartime capital. </P>
<P> In 1976 he became director of the Needham Research Institute in Cambridge, an international center for the study of China, where though frail and crippled with arthritis, he worked several hours a day well past the age of 90. </P>
<P> When the first volume of ``Science and Civilization in China'' appeared in 1954, he had no idea it would develop into such a massive undertaking.'' We blithely decided we could do it in seven volumes, but the material turned out to be so rich and varied,'' he said in 1991. </P>
<P> In 1989, he married his friend and collaborator Lu Gwei-Djen after the death of his first wife, Dorothy, herself an eminent scientist. Lu died in 1991. </P>
<P> The only blot on his career, which was feted with numerous academic awards from universities around the world, came in the 1950s when he lent his name to false allegations that the United States had used germ warfare in Korea. </P>
<P> For years he was excluded from positions of influence at his Cambridge college before the episode was put to one side and he was elected Master of Caius in 1966. </P>
