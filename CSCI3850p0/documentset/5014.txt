<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich Sunday promised a spending shakeup at the Pentagon, saying the department should be reinvented. </P>
<P> Kasich, an Ohio Republican, said defense spending should be held to a ceiling of $270 billion a year by 2002, just $22 billion more than the $258 billion that President Clinton has proposed for 1996. </P>
<P> ``Frankly, we believe and Newt believes this, that that whole building needs to be reinvented,'' Kasich said on NBC's ''Meet the Press'', referring to House Speaker Newt Gingrich. </P>
<P> ``We have reached an agreement that we are going to be at $270 (billion) as a ceiling,'' Kasich said of the target for 2002, the year the Republicans have promised to balance the budget. </P>
<P> Kasich described defense procurement system, in which he said the Pentagon takes up to 25 years to buy some items, as a disaster. </P>
<P> ``We are going to have changes in that Pentagon. They're not all going to occur in this first year, but they will be occurring,'' he said. </P>
<P> Kasich said House Republicans stood by their election commitment to cut taxes and balance the budget. </P>
<P> White House economic adviser Laura Tyson, speaking on the same program, attacked the proposed tax cuts, saying they were not warranted by the current low unemployment rate. </P>
<P> ``This tax cut is not going to give us more jobs,'' Tyson said. </P>
<P> The White House has proposed tax cuts of $63 billion over five years, about a third of the Republican proposal of $190 billion. </P>
<P> Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey also attacked the Republican tax cut proposal, saying it targeted special interest groups such as the tobacco industry. </P>
<P> House Republicans last week passed a spending cuts bill that included $9 billion of deficit cuts over five years. </P>
<P> Some $1.4 trillion must be cut from the deficit in order to balance the budget by 2002. </P>
