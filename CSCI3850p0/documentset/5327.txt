<P>  Holy megabytes! Papal encyclicals have finally entered the computer age. </P>
<P> Pope John Paul's latest opus, Evangelium Vitae (The Gospel of Life), is the first encyclical available on a computer disk. </P>
<P> The Vatican's publishing house, Libreria Editrice Vaticana, said the disk costs $5.60. </P>
<P> A publicity sheet for the disk says it will allow anyone to ``navigate'' inside the encyclical -- about 200 pages in the old-fashioned printed version -- with ease. </P>
<P> St Peter wrote the first Papal letter nearly 2,000 years ago on papyrus and sent it off -- by messenger, horse and sail boat -- to early Christian communities in the Middle East. </P>
