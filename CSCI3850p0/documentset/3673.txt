<P>  Most Britons want to halve the cost of the monarchy and think the number of royal palaces and staff should be reduced, a survey published Tuesday said. </P>
<P> The ICM royalty poll in The Guardian newspaper found that 53 percent of Britons want the monarchy's overall cost to the taxpayer, estimated at $77 million a year, to be cut. </P>
<P> ``The same percentage want the five royal palaces financed by the taxpayer ... to be reduced to two,'' the newspaper said. </P>
<P> ``Slightly more -- 54 percent -- want the royal yacht Britannia to be shared with business as a floating conference center,'' it added. </P>
<P> The random poll of 1,003 adults also found that 56 percent of the people questioned said the 750 palace staff that are paid by the taxpayer should be reduced by half. </P>
<P> ``Eighteen percent want no public money to be paid to the Royal Family ... 32 percent want the royal yacht taken out of service and 15 percent want no public money spent on palaces and staff,'' the newspaper added. </P>
<P> The findings support suggested plans by Britain's opposition Labor Party outlined by home affairs spokesman Jack Straw. </P>
<P> He suggested firing half of the country's royal highnesses and turning those who remained into a low-key Scandinavian-style monarchy. </P>
