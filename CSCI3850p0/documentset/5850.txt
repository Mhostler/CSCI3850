<P>  About 1,500 workers at the Hewlett-Packard plant in Singapore were evacuated on Wednesday after a chemical spill, the company said. </P>
<P> It said in a statement the evacuation was ordered after some employees smelled an odour in the basement. </P>
<P> Two women employees and a male contractor were taken to hospital with breathing problems and nausea, but no serious injuries were reported. </P>
<P> Civil Defence experts later neutralised the spilled chemical, which came from a 200-litre drum of sodium hypochlorite, a liquid commonly used for bleaching. </P>
<P> The U.S.-based company has 6,000 employees in Singapore at 10 sites producing computers, printers, circuits and other components. </P>
