<P>  People born during a measles outbreak are at greater risk of contracting Crohn's disease, a painful bowel condition often requiring surgery, doctors reported Thursday. </P>
<P> Several studies have suggested a link between Crohn's disease and measles but the report in the Lancet medical journal specifically found the disease was more common in people born during epidemics. </P>
<P> The study, a collaboration by doctors in Sweden, Britain and the United States, traced people living in Sweden who had developed the disease before the age of 30. It said the number of people with Crohn's disease who were born after a measles epidemic was significantly higher than expected. </P>
<P> ``The last trimester of the pregnancy and the first few weeks after delivery might be important because the fetus is immunologically vulnerable,'' it said. </P>
<P> British scientists last year said they had found evidence the measles virus could cause a blockage of the tiny blood vessels supplying the intestines. </P>
