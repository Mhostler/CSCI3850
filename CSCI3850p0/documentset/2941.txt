<P>  Pop superstar Michael Jackson and his wife Lisa Marie Presley are to divorce just six months after they married, London and New York newspapers said Thursday. </P>
<P> Britain's Daily Mirror said Jackson instructed his lawyers to file divorce papers after complaining that his wife, daughter of rock 'n' roll king Elvis Presley, was ``invading his space.'' </P>
<P> The New York Daily News said the couple were splitting because Presley refused to live with Jackson in New York. </P>
<P> ``It has been a very cold marriage,'' a Jackson associate told the paper. </P>
<P> The couple were married in the Dominican Republic in a low-key ceremony in May that brought together two of the most famous names in 20th century pop music. </P>
<P> The Daily Mirror quoted a source in Jackson's entourage as saying the reclusive star had complained: ``He cannot go anywhere or do anything without her.'' </P>
<P> ``The idea of marriage was better than marriage itself. When Michael was facing possible child molestation charges, his life turned upside down,'' the source was quoted as saying. </P>
<P> ``During that time, he talked to Lisa Marie nearly every day on the phone... Since Lisa Marie was always there for him, it was logical he'd ask her to marry him. But Michael does things on the spur of the moment and he lives to regret it. </P>
<P> ``The reason he wants out is that he wants his privacy,'' the source added. </P>
<P> Another source, quoted by the New York Daily News, said: ``With most marriages you can kiss and make up after disagreements. But that doesn't seem to apply here. </P>
<P> ``Michael told me they're splitting. He wants to live in New York, he doesn't want to live in California. He said it's bad vibes, bad luck for him.'' </P>
<P> The Jackson source told the Daily News the singer was prepared to sell his Neverland Ranch in California. </P>
<P> Jackson lives in a luxury apartment in the Trump Tower in New York while his wife lives in California. </P>
<P> ``He's petrified of earthquakes and petrified of riots,'' the source said. </P>
<P> ``He has no confidence in the California police because they tried to frame him, he believes.'' </P>
