<DATELINE>GROZNY, Russia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The government in the breakaway region of Chechnya said it was still fully in control late Saturday and dismissed claims by Moscow-backed rebels that they had seized the capital Grozny. </P>
<P> ``The government is fully in charge of the situation in Grozny,'' Information Minister Movladi Udugov told Reuters in his office at the presidential palace. Itar-Tass news agency earlier quoted the rebels as saying they had seized the palace. </P>
<P> Reuter correspondent Lawrence Sheets said shooting could still be heard on the outskirts of Grozny but it was clear that the government of president Dzokhar Dudayev still controlled the city center. </P>
<P> Udugov said Chechen forces had killed 350 rebels for the loss of four of their own men, but it was not possible to verify his figures. Both sides traditionally make exaggerated claims of their successes. </P>
<P> Tass quoted the opposition Provisional Council as saying its troops took the presidential palace after a day of heavy fighting and that forces loyal to Dudayev were retreating to the town's suburbs. </P>
<P> ``That is rubbish,'' said Udugov. ``You should cancel your subscription to Tass.'' </P>
