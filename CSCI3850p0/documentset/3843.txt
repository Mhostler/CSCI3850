<DATELINE>BONN, Germany (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, having failed to persuade Germany to earmark troops for a rapid-reaction peacekeeping force, said Thursday Bonn could still play a wider role in world affairs. </P>
<P> Playing down German insistence that it would only contribute soldiers for peacekeeping missions on a case-by-case basis, Boutros-Ghali said any nation that designated troops for potential operations could always decline to send them. </P>
<P> ``There can be no asking Germany or any other nation for a blank check,'' he told a seminar on international security. </P>
<P> ``Up until the last minute members states can always say: 'I am not interested in taking part in this peacekeeping operation'.'' </P>
<P> Boutros-Ghali said any German contribution to the 40,000-strong peacekeeping contingent he envisages would be relatively small. </P>
<P> ``If you had an agreement with Germany, it would never be more than one percent of the German national forces. And we are not asking every member state to contribute troops,'' he added, suggesting Germany might instead offer logistical support or field hospitals. </P>
<P> Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said after meeting Boutros-Ghali Wednesday that Germany wanted to keep the freedom to decide each case separately, adding that to earmark units would make it harder to say 'no' when a request came. </P>
<P> ``The U.N. were naive,'' one German security analyst said. ``They should have known that no country would commit troops in advance to peacekeeping missions without knowing what the mission was.'' </P>
<P> Boutros-Ghali is eager to use Bonn's economic power now that unification has allowed it to take more active role in world affairs. </P>
