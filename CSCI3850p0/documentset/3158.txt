<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The incoming Republican leaders of the House and Senate urged President Clinton Monday to impose an immediate moratorium on federal rulemaking, calling excessive government regulation a ``hidden tax.'' </P>
<P> In a letter to Clinton, initiated by incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, the lawmakers said the moratorium should stay in force through the first 100 days of the new Congress. </P>
<P> ``On November 8, the American people sent a message to Washington. They voted for a smaller, less intrusive government,'' Dole and Gingrich said in the letter. </P>
<P> ``We believe this moratorium ... would send a clear signal that, working together, we intend to ease the burden of federal overregulation on consumers and busineses that has slowed economic growth and stifled job creation,'' they said. </P>
<P> White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers, asked about the letter, said ``it's under review.'' </P>
<P> ``We take any letter from the leadership seriously and we will review it carefully,'' she said. </P>
<P> The letter was also signed by incoming Senate Whip Trent Lott of Mississippi, incoming House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas and other top Republican officials.  Republicans, who won sweeping gains in Nov. 8 elections, will take control of both the House and Senate in January. In the House, Gingrich plans an aggressive agenda for the first 100 days laid out in his ``Contract with America.'' </P>
<P> The contract calls for increased defense spending, lower taxes, a balanced budget amendment, welfare reform, a presidential line item veto and a host of other programs. </P>
<P> Due to its slower pace of action, the Senate cannot move as aggressively as the House, but Dole has laid out an ambitious schedule including the balance budget amendment, legislation on unfunded state mandates and other issues. </P>
<P> Congressional Democrats and the White House have been trying to figure out how to respond to the muscular Republican agenda. Clinton said Sunday he would favor a middle-class tax cut if offsetting spending cuts were found. </P>
<P> The administration is also considering submitting a budget to Congress calling for new cuts in the federal bureaucracy along with a defense spending increase. </P>
<P> In their letter, the Republicans claimed that private estimates project the combined direct cost of compliance with existing federal regulations to the private sector and state and local governments was over $500 billion a year. </P>
<P> During the moratorium they want agencies to kill rules that are not cost-effective, recommend ways to eliminate unnecessary rules and give states and localities flexibliity. </P>
<P> They added that the moratorium should not apply to rules that are intended to relax a regulatory burden, necessary to meet a legal deadline, respond to an emergency or are essential to enforce criminal laws. </P>
<P> The Republicans said data showed that the administration had issued over 767 regulations in the past six months and was pursuing more than 4,300 new rules in the next fiscal year, from October to September. </P>
