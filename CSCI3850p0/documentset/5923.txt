<P> Clinton declared that Sunday will be a day of national mourning. He and Mrs Clinton will attend memorial services for the bombing victims in Oklahoma City on that day. </P>
<P> Speculation has swirled as to the identities and possible ethnic backgrounds of those responsible for the car-bombing that demolished an Oklahoma City federal office building on Wednesday, killing more than 50 people. The FBI has issued arrest warrants for two unidentified white men and, shortly before Clinton spoke, the Justice Department announced it was releasing a Jordanian-American who had been intercepted on an overseas flight and returned for questioning. Clinton declined to answer specific questions about the investigation but said: ``I know what they (the investigators) have done and the American people would be very pleased and very impressed by the work they are doing.'' </P>
<P> He also added a special message for America's children, saying that he did not want them to assume the worst about adults because of the ``evil'' done in Oklahoma. ``We're going to get through this,'' he said. ``I don't want our children to believe something terrible about life in the future.'' </P>
