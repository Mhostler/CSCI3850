<P>  President Clinton, in a move that breaks with U.S. allies, has directed American military forces to stop enforcing a U.N. arms embargo on Bosnian Muslims as of Saturday, U.S. officials said Friday. </P>
<P> The decision fulfills a mandate of the U.S. Congress, which cut off funds for U.S. activities in support of the embargo by Nov. 15 if Bosnian Serbs did not accept a peace plan for the former Yugoslav republic. </P>
