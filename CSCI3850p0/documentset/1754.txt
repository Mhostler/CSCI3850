<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Actress-comedienne Whoopi Goldberg and union organizer Lyle Trachtenberg were reported to be on their honeymoon Sunday, one day after their private, star-studded wedding. </P>
<P> Goldberg, 44, who announced her engagement in April during an appearance on CNN television's ``Larry King Live,'' married the 38-year-old Trachtenberg on Saturday at her Pacific Palisades estate, several Los Angeles television stations reported. </P>
<P> Videotape shot by news helicopters hovering over Goldberg's home showed a bride in a white gown and a groom in a tuxedo taking their vows on the back lawn. </P>
<P> Among the 350 invited guests were Arnold Schwarzenegger, actor Matthew Modine and director Steven Spielberg, KNBC reported. </P>
<P> Masses of white balloons were released in an apparent attempt to obstruct the view of news cameras. </P>
<P> The newlyweds were honeymooning Sunday, KNBC said, but there was no word on the location. </P>
<P> The wedding plans had been rumored for the past week, but Goldberg's representatives could not be reached for comment. </P>
<P> Goldberg met Trachtenberg, a film industry union organizer, last year on the set of one of her movies. On ``Larry King Live'' last April 29, Whoopi said: ``He's a normal guy. He's got a regular 9 to 5 job five days a week. I've never been out with somebody like that before.'' </P>
<P> Goldberg was embroiled in controversy last year when she defended her then-boyfriend, actor Ted Danson, after he performed in blackface at a comedy ``roast'' for her sponsored by the New York Friars Club. The two later broke up. </P>
<P> It was the second marriage for Goldberg, who has a daughter from her previous marriage. </P>
<P> Goldberg, whose real name was Caryn Johnson, got her start as a standup comic. She won an Oscar in 1991 for her role in the film ``Ghost.'' She has also starred in ``The Color Purple,'' ''Sister Act,'' ``Sister Act 2'' and ``Corinna, Corrina'' and hosted the Academy Awards presentation in March. </P>
