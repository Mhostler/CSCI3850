<DATELINE>GDANSK, Poland (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Polish explosives experts blasted away the top six floors of a partly collapsed high-rise apartment house Tuesday to try to clear a path to buried victims of a fatal gas explosion. </P>
<P> The initial blast, as residents slept early Monday, leveled the lower three floors of the 11-story building in the northern port city of Gdansk, and left the upper storeys teetering dangerously on a shaky foundation of rubble. </P>
<P> Officials announced that four people had been killed and police at the scene said at least another three were dead. </P>
<P> Officials said 19 people were unaccounted for Tuesday. Some may have been away for the Easter holiday, but others were thought to be trapped in the ruins. Nine people were still in hospital, although none were seriously injured. </P>
<P> Emergency services decided that bringing in military engineers to blow the surviving storys sideways was the only way to safely reach any survivors. </P>
<P> ``Any further rescue work without demolition is impossible and that is why this decision was taken. There are certainly people in the rubble. We believe there are people still alive,'' Janusz Szalucha, fire brigade chief, told Reuters. </P>
<P> The blast set by the rescuers caused remaining floors of the block to fold and drop in a cloud of dust, landing partly to the side of the building's foundations. </P>
<P> Windows in surrounding buildings, from which inhabitants had been evacuated, were shattered by the detonation. </P>
<P> Rescue workers told Polish television the operation went as planned. Teams were standing by to begin shifting rubble into trucks and digging down to search for the living and the dead. </P>
