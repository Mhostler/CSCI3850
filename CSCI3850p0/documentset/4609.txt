<P> Testifying with the jury absent from the courtroom, Rosa Lopez -- then a housekeeper for Simpson's next-door neighbor -- said she saw the Bronco at about 10:15 p.m. last June 12, the time prosecutors charge that the football legend was committing the murders. </P>
<P> Lopez -- whose testimony was being videotaped for a possible later showing to jurors -- said she was walking her employers' dog at the time and that the Bronco was parked in the same place she had seen it about two hours earlier. </P>
<P> Prosecutors contend that Simpson drove the Bronco to his wife's townhouse two miles from his Brentwood mansion. They say DNA tests had shown that blood from Simpson and both victims was found inside the car. </P>
