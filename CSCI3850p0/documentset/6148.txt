<DATELINE>LONDON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  British opposition leader Tony Blair claimed Saturday that he was on the way to victory in the next general election after persuading his Labor Party to ditch its historic commitment to mass nationalization. </P>
<P> A special party conference voted by a margin of two to one Saturday to scrap a clause in Labor's 75-year-old constitution committing it to common ownership. </P>
<P> A new statement, which recognizes the strengths of a market economy but calls for a more just society, symbolized Blair's bid to occupy the center ground of British politics and end a string of four general election defeats by the Conservatives. </P>
<P> Blair said the result marked a ``day of destiny'' for both the Labor Party and the country. </P>
<P> ``The people of Britain don't deserve this government. They deserve something better. Today we have shown that we can win their trust to provide something better,'' he said. </P>
<P> The Conservatives were saying only last year that Blair's refusal to tackle the so-called Clause Four commitment to nationalization showed he was a weak leader unwilling to confront Labot Party paymasters in the trade unions. </P>
<P> Prime Minister John Major, in an article in the News of the World, a Sunday tabloid, was quick to counter-attack Blair and mock the vote. </P>
<P> ``There were many grunts and shouts like a fake wrestling match, but the result was fixed before the bout. Only the crowd were deceived by the entertainment,'' he wrote. </P>
<P> ``The debate was the biggest attempt to con the gullible since the wolf dressed up as Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother.'' </P>
<P> But Blair's victory, six days before local council elections in England and Wales in which the Conservatives are forecast to fare very badly, put Major even more on the defensive. </P>
<P> Opinion polls last week said Labor had a 35-point lead over the Conservatives across the country and Blair's personal triumph in the conference vote could well increase this. </P>
<P> Thrust into the top job after the sudden death of Labor leader John Smith a year ago, he has stamped his authority on a party hungry for power after 16 years in opposition. </P>
<P> To win support for Saturday's vote, Blair toured Britain urging party members to ditch a clause which traditionalists revered as a symbol of Labor's roots as a working-class movement but which he regarded as a millstone around its neck. </P>
<P> His tactics worked. Rank-and-file members supported him by the overwhelming margin of nine to one. </P>
<P> Britain's two biggest unions, representing transport and public sector workers, voted against Blair. But the overall union vote, accounting for 70 percent of the conference total, broke down 38-32 percent in his favor. </P>
<P> The figures strengthened Blair's hand in his dealings with the unions, who have traditionally bankrolled the party and as a result have had a big influence on its policy. </P>
<P> Aides were already predicting that Blair would distance himself even more from the unions in the run-up to the next general election, which must be held by May 1997. </P>
