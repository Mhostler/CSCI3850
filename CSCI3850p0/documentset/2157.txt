<P>  The United Nations in New York and its force commander in southern Lebanon have protested to Israel over the firing of anti-personnel shells that killed several civilians in a Lebanese village, a U.N. spokesman said Friday. </P>
<P> Reports from the area said Israel late Wednesday fired tank shells packed with hundreds of steel darts, which the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) said were banned under a Geneva convention on methods of warfare. </P>
<P> Late Thursday and again Friday, guerrillas in southern Lebanon fired salvos of rockets into northern Israel. </P>
<P> U.N. spokesman Ahmad Fawzi said in a prepared statement: ``The secretary-general is deeply concerned by the escalation of tension along the Israeli-Lebanese border, and in particular by a report from the force commander of UNIFIL, Maj. Gen. (Trond) Furuhovde (of Norway), that Israel fired anti-personnel shells on the Lebanese village of Nabatiyeh al-Fawqa, killing several civilians, including a woman and a 14-year-old boy.'' </P>
<P> Fawzi, added: ``The force commander has strongly protested this to the Israeli Defense Force. A protest has been conveyed today by the secretariat to the Permanent Mission of Israel. </P>
<P> ``The secretary-general condemns all violence against civilians. He calls for restraint on all sides.'' </P>
