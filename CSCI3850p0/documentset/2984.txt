<P>  A mystery raid by unidentified armed men on a Moscow building turned into a political fight Saturday when the head of a bank in the building accused President Boris Yeltsin's personal guards of carrying it out. </P>
<P> The purpose of Friday's operation was not clear but the official Itar-Tass news agency quoted authoritative sources as saying it was carried out by unnamed special services to confiscate documents in the building. </P>
<P> The documents, it said, ``confirm the involvement of certain commercial banks in Black Tuesday,'' a reference to the Oct. 11 collapse of the ruble. </P>
<P> Armed men wearing camouflage and balaclavas surrounded the building, which houses the Moscow mayor's office and Most Bank, a leading commercial bank. They detained several people and vanished. </P>
<P> ``It's already no secret to anyone what this power structure (the armed men) is. It's the main directorate of the Russian Federation president's guard,'' bank chief Vladimir Gusinsky told NBC television. </P>
<P> ``A main guard's directorate is empowered to guard things, not this kind of investigation. This is absolute lawlessness.'' </P>
<P> Yeltsin's press secretary, Vyacheslav Kostikov, issued a statement saying the president had ordered an investigation. </P>
<P> ``The president notes an unprofessional lack of coordination between the special services and law enforcement bodies in this operation,'' the statement said. Yeltsin promised to take tough action after the investigation. </P>
<P> A spokesman for the president's office said earlier the operation was carried out by sections of the mayor's office guards and interior ministry guards. </P>
<P> The interior ministry and the mayor's office denied any involvement. </P>
<P> A spokesman for the Federal Counter-Intelligence Service said it had nothing to do with the incident and a duty officer at Moscow police headquarters said there was no record of it. </P>
<P> The swoop took staff at Most Bank by surprise. </P>
<P> The bank is believed to have close links with Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, a Yeltsin ally, and political commentators say a struggle for influence with the president is pitting part of his personal entourage against the increasingly powerful Luzhkov. </P>
