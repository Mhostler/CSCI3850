<P>  Nordic countries took steps Tuesday to weld shut the bow doors of car ferries following the Estonia disaster, but Britain said such action was not necessary. </P>
<P> Finnish authorities ordered doors welded closed and Swedish officials were meeting to consider similar measures for their ferries plying Baltic routes. </P>
<P> Denmark said it was also considering such measures after the bow door of the Estonia broke off in the Baltic last week, allowing water to flood in and killing 910 people. </P>
<P> French technical inspection group Bureau Veritas said it had approved the safety of outer doors and ramps on the Estonia less than a month before it sank. </P>
<P> A BV spokesman said that once the classification society had heard reports water might have entered the bow entrance of the ferry it had told owners of similar ships it surveys around the world to conduct immediate checks of the bow doors. </P>
<P> British ferry operators said, however, they had no problems with the safety of their bow doors and there was no evidence fastening them permanently, as proposed by Finland, would apply. </P>
<P> British Chamber of Shipping Director-General Admiral Sir Nicholas Hunt said the ferries of companies like Europe's market leader, the Peninsular & Oriental Navigation Co Plc (P&0) and Stena Sea-Link, had a different design from the Estonia. </P>
<P> ``We have not found anything wrong with our design,'' Hunt told Reuters. </P>
<P> He said ferries operating out of Britain, carrying 50 million passengers a year on 140 ferries a day, had a system whereby there was a third water-tight barrier behind the bow doors and the already water-tight car ramp on Ro-Ro ferries. </P>
<P> Finnish maritime authorities said bow doors of car ferries sailing between Helsinki and Stockholm are to be welded permanently as safety checks continue. </P>
<P> An official at the Finnish Board of Navigation said it had taken its decision after video film showed the bow door, or visor, of the Estonia was torn off, allowing water to flood in and sink the ship in heavy seas. </P>
<P> Film showed the bow door was missing. Investigators from Estonia, Finland and Sweden, said locking devices on the moveable outer bow door had failed but could not yet say why. </P>
