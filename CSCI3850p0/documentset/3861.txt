<DATELINE>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Three Filipinos convicted of killing three people including a two-month-old baby were beheaded in Saudi Arabia Friday, and two of the severed heads were displayed on poles, reports from Riyadh said. </P>
<P> The Qatar news agency, in a report from Riyadh, quoted a statement from the Saudi Ministry of Interior saying the three were beheaded for breaking into the house of Youssef al-Rajhi and killing one of his sons, a housemaid and driver. </P>
<P> The British Broadcasting Corp quoted the statement as saying the heads of two of the men were displayed on poles in Riyadh as part of the sentence passed by the sharia (Islamic law) court. </P>
<P> Saudi Arabia applies the death penalty, usually beheadings by sword in public after Friday prayers, against convicted criminals including drug traffickers and murderers. </P>
<P> The Filipinos were accused last year of breaking into the leading Saudi businessman's house, a diplomat said. </P>
<P> A Filipino diplomat in the Saudi capital Riyadh told Reuters by telephone he heard the news on local radio but the embassy had not been notified officially of the executions. </P>
<P> A fourth Filipino who took part in the attack died when Saudi anti-terrorist police stormed the house after men, who took house members hostage, refused to negotiate with police or officials from the Philippines embassy, diplomats said. </P>
<P> Rajhi's wife and another son were wounded in the attack. </P>
<P> More than half a million Filipinos work in Saudi Arabia. </P>
