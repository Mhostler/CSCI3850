<P>  Incoming Republican congressional leaders Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas and Newt Gingrich of Georgia wrote President Clinton Wednesday, calling on him to propose a middle-class tax cut in his speech to the nation Thursday. </P>
<P> They also challenged him to endorse other parts of the Republican platform, including a balanced budget amendment and opposition to any further U.N. peacekeeping operations. </P>
<P> Clinton has already said he wants to cut taxes if possible, and is preparing to talk about that Thursday. </P>
<P> But the three-page letter goes far beyond tax cuts and outlines 10 points the Republicans urge on Clinton, virtually asking him to adopt their agenda as his own. </P>
<P> ``During this year's campaign, we promised the American people that a Republican Congress would work to lower taxes, dramatically reduce the size of the federal government, cut unnecessary federal regulation, and protect our national security,'' the letter said. ``Now that the elections are over, we have an obligation to keep our commitments.'' </P>
