<P>  The United States renewed calls Tuesday for NATO air strikes -- vetoed this week by senior U.N. officials -- to punish Serbs for shelling ``safe areas'' in Bosnia. </P>
<P> ``We support measures, including the use of NATO air power, which we believe can demonstrate to the... Serbs that their actions in violation of the safe areas of Bihac and Sarajevo have consequences,'' the State Department said. </P>
<P> The U.N. commander for Bosnia, Lieutenant-General Rupert Smith, had asked for air strikes against Serb positions after a Serb mortar attack on Sarajevo Sunday, but U.N. officials rejected the request, fearful of Serb reprisals. </P>
<P> Their decision drew a sharp condemnation Monday from the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Madeleine Albright. ``I fail to understand the logic behind turning down such a request,'' she said. </P>
<P> State Department spokeswoman Christine Shelly said Washington continued to believe that air strikes could be effective, despite the need to ensure the safety of the U.N. peacekeeping force, UNPROFOR. </P>
<P> ``The U.N. with the backing of the Security Council and NATO have agreed the circumstances in which NATO air power can be employed. That agreement has not changed,'' she said. </P>
<P> ``We're not attempting to change the agreement, but consistent with statements we've made in the past we would like to see tougher enforcement of those agreements.'' </P>
<P> Shelly said the United States had discussed the matter with its allies, but did not say how they had reacted. Britain and France, with thousands of troops in Bosnia, are reluctant to provoke Serb retaliation against them. </P>
<P> In Sarajevo, U.N. spokesman Alexander Ivanko said the Bosnian Serbs had ``got away with murder. We realized we were not in a position to defend a U.N. 'safe area'.'' </P>
<P> Shelly said the five-nation ``Contact Group'', which is trying to negotiate a settlement in Bosnia, would hold another meeting Friday at an undecided venue in Europe. </P>
<P> The United States, Russia, Britain and France and Germany are members of the group. Friday's meeting would be at the level of foreign ministry political directors, she said. </P>
