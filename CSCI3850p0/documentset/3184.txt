<P>  Vietnam denied Wednesday that it had asked the United States to return to its old naval base at Cam Ranh Bay, where Russia's navy has facilities. </P>
<P> ``Cam Ranh has never been brought up in all the contacts between Vietnam and the United States,'' a Foreign Ministry spokesman said in a statement reported by the official newspaper Vietnam News. </P>
<P> ``Vietnam will fully exercise its sovereignty over Cam Ranh, as it will over the rest of its territory, and does not wish to see it become a base for any foreign countries,'' he added. </P>
<P> The ministry said it was responding to a report in the Bangkok newspaper Siam Rath that the United States had been invited to return to Cam Ranh, a major U.S. naval base during the war which ended in 1975. </P>
<P> The Vietnamese navy took over the base south of Nha Trang after the war and gave facilities to the Soviet, and then the Russian, navy. </P>
<P> As U.S.-Vietnamese relations improved, there was speculation Hanoi might offer the U.S. Navy facilities at Cam Ranh to serve as a counterweight to Chinese naval strength in the South China Sea, where Vietnam and China have several territorial disputes. </P>
<P> The top U.S. military officer in Asia and the Pacific, Adm. Richard C. Macke, fueled the speculation during a visit to Vietnam in October. </P>
<P> He said he saw military cooperation developing once diplomatic relations had been established. Asked about Cam Ranh, he said: ``I am a naval officer and naval officers are always looking for good ports.'' </P>
