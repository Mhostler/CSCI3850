<P>  Horns, water hoses, a cheering crowd and the losing team greeted Peter Blake and his Team New Zealand crew Thursday as they sailed to shore as winners of the America's Cup challenger trials. </P>
<P> The first victory sip from the Louis Vuitton Cup after the Kiwis sailed from the race course to the South Western Yacht Club went to helmsman Russell Coutts, the man who steered Team New Zealand's boats, Black Magic I and Black Magic II, almost unbeaten through the trials. </P>
<P> ``I guess we're there now,'' said Coutts. ``But tomorrow we'll start preparing for the next part.'' </P>
<P> The team members were still low-key after eliminating One Australia and moving one step closer to their dream of taking the Cup away from the eventual American defenders. </P>
<P> ``It's winnable,'' said Blake. ``To take the America's Cup back to my country is the best present I could ever give my country. I can't think of anything more I would like to do in my life than to take the America's Cup back.'' </P>
<P> And while the celebrations got underway in the United States, more than half a million people were joining in the festivities back in Auckland, toasting the first New Zealand team to clinch a berth in the America's Cup since the country made its first bid in 1987. </P>
<P> For New Zealand it has been a tempestuous path. While its sailors have successfully captured every major yachting trophy on offer, the America's Cup -- yachting's holy grail -- has always evaded them. </P>
<P> In 1987 Chris Dickson flew through the challenger elimination rounds with a record breaking 37-1 tally, only to fall heavily -- 1-4 -- to Dennis Conner in the challenger final. </P>
<P> The infamous catamaran debacle of 1988 saw the New Zealanders lose both face and 0-2 on the water. The America's Cup that year was fought out mainly in the courts, and there were no challenger trials before the racing, regarded as an embarrassing aberration in the history of the Cup. </P>
<P> In 1992, New Zealand's claim to the Louis Vuitton Cup seemed inevitable. With a 25-5 run-up to the challenger finals it was favored to claim the Cup -- but the New Zealanders crumbled. </P>
<P> A ruling against the way the New Zealanders were using their bowsprit dealt a huge distraction to the team. After going up 4-1 in the challenger finals the New Zealanders fell to the Italians, who blazed through to a 5-4 victory. </P>
<P> For 1995, at last, everything was in place. The New Zealanders' reputation for starting fast and fading out has been shattered. </P>
<P> ``It's impossible to think that you can enter the America's Cup and win first time,'' said Blake. </P>
<P> ``You have to be prepared to come back. Every time you come back, you can get a little better.'' </P>
<P> Winner of the Whitbread Round the World Race and current holder of the non-stop around the world record, Blake has brought calm and organisation to the New Zealand camp. </P>
<P> By design the team adopted a low-key approach even as it stamped its authority over the challenger trials from the outset in January. </P>
<P> ``Until you've done it what have you got to talk about?'' said Blake. </P>
<P> As the crew members pulled down the sails after Thursday's race and made their way back inshore Blake managed to show an element of satisfaction. </P>
<P> ``We have done what is necessary to be here. There is still a lot to do and a lot to give.'' </P>
<P> He added: ``We are very fresh. This time three years ago the Italians had given everything. This is huge satisfaction, especially the way we did it. It was better than expected.'' </P>
<P> Laurie Davidson, designer of the speedy boats, was second to drink from the victory cup. </P>
<P> Denied that pleasure was the losing team. The Australians lost their front-line boat in a dramatic sinking on March 5 but bravely fought adversity to make it through the semifinals and into the finals with their older boat. </P>
<P> One Australia skipper John Bertrand, the only man to take the America's Cup from American shores, congratulated the winners. </P>
<P> ``Congratulations to Team New Zealand. Their attention to detail has been excellent,'' said Bertrand. ``The opportunity for the challengers to win the America's Cup is very strong. If they can pull it off it will be a great accolade for the country of New Zealand.'' </P>
