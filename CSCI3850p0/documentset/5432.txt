<P> Spain and its EU partners have been at odds with Canada over fishing for Greenland halibut off Newfoundland since Canada seized a Spanish trawler early last month, accusing Spain of endangering stocks by overfishing. </P>
<P> Under a draft accord adjusting fishing quotas Canada would be allowed five times more Greenland halibut than it caught last year while Spain would see its quota heavily cut, a Spanish official at the Brussels talks said. </P>
<P> ``As we see our government criteria, we are not going to be able to accept it,'' Gonzalez said. </P>
<P> But the prime minister insisted that, apart from British sympathies with Canada, Spain had been ``quite well supported'' by the EU. </P>
