<P>  Canadian generals who golfed and fished in Florida as part of a military exercise code-named Operation Palm Tree won't be going again this year, a spokesman for the military said Thursday. </P>
<P> ``It has been discontinued. There are no plans for them to attend,'' said Air Force spokeswoman Capt. Karen Mair. </P>
<P> Copies of the conference agendas, leaked to the media by an independent military magazine called Esprit de Corps, show that after a brief two and a half-hour meeting last year, the generals swung into two days of fishing, putting contests, receptions and award dinners. </P>
<P> The leak comes when Canadian newspapers are running stories about Canadian sailors being forced on to welfare because their wages have been frozen for four years. </P>
<P> One leaked military report suggests soldiers be given more time off to drive taxis, deliver pizzas or stand in line at food banks. </P>
<P> Last year's conference was held in February in northwest Florida in conjunction with the U.S. military and was attended by 19 Canadian Air Force generals. The year before, 20 Canadian generals attended the same event. </P>
