<P>  The haul of smuggled goods seized by China in 1994 was worthy of a major trading company, and included cars, steel, palm oil, oil products, computers and air conditioners, the People's Daily said on Friday. </P>
<P> Officials confiscated goods worth 3.6 billion yuan ($427 million), detained 1,100 people and discovered 35,000 vessels with no name or registration name or number, many involved in smuggling, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> Smuggling was rampant in the east and southern coastal provinces of Guangdong, Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Hainan, it said. </P>
<P> Customs officers made the biggest haul, including 2,085 cars, 150,000 tonnes of steel, 154,000 cases of cigarettes, 39,000 square metres of veneer board, 83,000 tonnes of oil products, 71,000 tonnes of edible oils and 17,000 computers and items of telecommunications equipment. </P>
<P> The State Tobacco Monopoly and Industrial and Commercial Bureau mobilised 67,000 people in the anti-smuggling campaign, closing down 320 illegal markets and confiscating colour televisions, cigarettes, air conditioners and computers. </P>
<P> Smuggling has blossomed in the 16 years of China's open-door policy, with easier movement in and out of the country, booming foreign trade and rising incomes at home creating a huge demand, especially for consumer goods. </P>
<P> High tariffs on many imported goods, preferred by many Chinese to domestic brands, make smuggling a highly profitable business. </P>
