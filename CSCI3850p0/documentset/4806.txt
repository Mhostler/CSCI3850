<P>  Britain's Queen Elizabeth arrived at Belfast airport Thursday for her first visit to Northern Ireland since Irish republican and pro-British Protestant guerrillas halted a 25 year war six months ago. </P>
<P> Security forces launched a huge operation to guard against any resurgence of violence from maverick groups as the Queen arrived to open a road and rail network and to confer city status on Armagh, Ireland's ecclesiastical capital. </P>
<P> The visit takes place in a climate of optimism about the province's peace prospects with the British and Irish governments united on a peace strategy and representatives of the former warring gunmen edging their way to the talks table. </P>
