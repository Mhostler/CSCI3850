<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Ghastly television images of the Oklahoma City bombing have brought back raw memories of the 1993 New York World Trade Center attack, but an unsolved 1920 incident on Wall Street was actually more deadly. </P>
<P> On September 16 that year, 30 people were killed and hundreds injured after explosives were left in a parked horse-drawn carriage in New York's financial district. </P>
<P> The attack, which left holes still visible on the marble facades of Wall Street, baffled investigators. </P>
<P> Hundreds of suspect were questioned amid charges the culprits were foreign terrorists. By 1922, the reward money had risen to $80,000 and the remains of the carriage had been taken to harness manufacturers all over the United States, but no one was ever charged with the crime. </P>
<P> The target could have been the J.P. Morgan and Co. bank headquarters, the newly-completed Assay Office containing $1 billion of gold, the Stock Exchange or Wall Street itself. </P>
<P> The World Trade Center bombing on February 26, 1993, was not so mysterious and was solved relatively quickly. </P>
<P> The blast was caused by a 1,200 pound car bomb driven into the building's underground parking area. It killed six people and injured more than 1,000. </P>
<P> Six days after the explosion, police arrested Mohammad Salameh, a Jordanian national who entered the country illegally. Eventually he and three other men described as Muslim fundamentalists were convicted and sentenced in 1994 to life for the bombing. </P>
<P> Prosecutors alleged the four men were a small part of a larger organization working to punish the United States for its support of Israel. </P>
<P> In a separate trial this year, Egyptian cleric Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman and 10 followers are accused of helping to plan the blast and to plot bombings at the United Nations building, a Manhattan federal office building and the bridges and tunnels leading into New York. </P>
