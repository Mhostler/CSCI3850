<P>  President Clinton will have lunch Friday at the White House with Italian Prime Minister Lamberto Dini in an expression of confidence in Italy's new government, a senior White House official said Wednesday. </P>
<P> Dini, who won a vote of confidence in the Italian Senate Wednesday, is to be in North America later this week for a meeting of finance ministers planning next summer's Group of Seven summit in Halifax, Nova Scotia, of the world's seven largest industrialized nations. </P>
<P> Dini was Italian finance minister before replacing Silvio Berlusconi as prime minister. Since he was going to be ``in the neighborhood'' for the G7 meeting, Clinton decided to invite him for lunch, the White House official said. </P>
<P> ``It is an expression of confidence in the new Italian government with which we have to work on a number of issues,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. </P>
<P> He said that, in addition to G7 economic issues, the two leaders would discuss security issues regarding the southern flank of NATO. </P>
<P> With NATO using Italian bases as staging grounds for flights enforcing a no-fly zone over Bosnia, ``the Italian government is enormously important in some of our management of ongoing crises around the world,'' the official said. </P>
