<P>  Mexico has pulled out of hosting the 1997 World Athletics Championships in Mexico City because of the country's economic problems, the International Amateur Athletic Federation said Wednesday. </P>
<P> IAAF president Primo Nebiolo said ``a number of alternatives'' were available. </P>
<P> Even before Wednesday's announcement, Madrid had already expressed an interest in hosting the championships if Mexico pulled out. </P>
<P> In an exchange of letters released by the IAAF, the world governing body for track and field, Mexican president Ernesto Zedillio Ponce de Leon referred to his country's ``recent number of serious, exceptional problems, particularly in the economic sector.'' </P>
<P> He wrote: ``...following profound analysis, I regret to inform you that Mexico must renounce the organization of the 1997 world championships.'' </P>
<P> Nebiolo, while ``greatly saddened,'' told the president he fully understood ``the painful motives.'' </P>
<P> Nebiolo told the president the IAAF would do everything possible to find a ``suitable and dignified alternative.'' </P>
<P> Mexico's decision to pull out came as no great surprise as the country continues to struggle with economic instability. </P>
<P> Two weeks ago Mexico told soccer's world governing body FIFA that it no longer wanted to host the 2002 World Cup. </P>
