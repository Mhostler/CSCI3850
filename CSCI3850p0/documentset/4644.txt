<DATELINE>TOKYO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  North Korean leader Kim Jong-il Wednesday attended the funeral of Defense Minister O Jin-u, number two in the communist state's hierarchy, who died of cancer last weekend. </P>
<P> It was a rare public appearance by Kim Jong-il, the eldest son and heir of late President Kim Il-sung. </P>
<P> ``The Great Leader of our party and our people Comrade Kim Jong-il, Chairman of the National Defense Commission of the DPRK (North Korea) and Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, was present at the funeral,'' the official Korean Central News Agency said in a dispatch from Pyongyang. </P>
<P> ``Comrade Kim Jong-il together with senior party and state officials paid a moment's silent tribute to the memory of O Jin-u,'' KCNA said. </P>
<P> Radio Pyongyang had said Kim Jong-il would head the 240-member funeral committee, which includes senior party and state officials. </P>
<P> Kim has yet to be elevated to the key posts held by his father -- state president and general secretary of the all-powerful communist party. </P>
<P> KCNA said O's body was buried in the Revolutionary Martyrs Cemetery on Mount Taesong in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang. </P>
<P> ``A bust of O Jin-u was set up in the cemetery,'' it added. </P>
<P> The death last Saturday of O, head of North Korea's 1.1-million-strong military, compounds the mystery over developments in the corridors of power of the secretive state, which is already reeling from the shock of losing its founder, Kim Il-sung, last July. </P>
<P> O, one of the elder Kim's closest allies, was a staunch advocate of the autocratic leader's decision two decades ago to groom his son Jong-il for succession. </P>
<P> The late defense minister spent nearly six weeks late last year at a Paris hospital for treatment for lung cancer. South Korean intelligence officers said then he received radiation treatment and chemotherapy but the cancer was too far advanced. </P>
<P> South Korean officials in Seoul said O's death could speed leadership changes in the North's military, which has so far been controlled by old guards. </P>
<P> ``His death may open the way for younger generals to rise to important posts,'' a Unification Ministry official in Seoul said. </P>
<P> South Korean officials have said there were no signs Kim Jong-il's position would be in danger because of O's death. </P>
<P> O served with Kim Il-sung as a fellow member of a partisan guerrilla group during Japan's 35-year rule of the Korean peninsula, which ended in 1945. </P>
<P> His death has left Kim Jong-il the lone member of the Workers' Party Political Bureau Presidium, the top layer in the Communist Party. Kim Il-sung and O were the only other members in the body. </P>
