<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Afghan government forces kept up an advance against the Taleban student militia in the central province of Ghor Thursday, after taking large areas from its control, the official Kabul Radio said. </P>
<P> Forces loyal to President Burhanuddin Rabbani began the advance against the Islamic student-led fighters Wednesday night. They were still moving forward late Thursday, said the broadcast monitored in Islamabad. </P>
<P> Seven Taleban fighters were killed and four captured against one government fighter killed and two wounded, the radio said. </P>
<P> There was no independent confirmation of the report, which coincided with a Taleban charge that government jets dropped cluster bombs in an attack Wednesday on the militia-held town of Maidan Shahr, west of Kabul. </P>
<P> Taleban regional commander Mullah Masher told reporters near Kabul Thursday that four government aircraft had bombed the town after his men repelled a ground assault. </P>
<P> Local villagers confirmed the attack, but there was no confirmation as to whether cluster bombs were used. </P>
<P> Masher said he was convinced the government fighters were preparing for a major attack to drive the Taleban out of Maidan Shahr but that he was ready to face them. </P>
<P> ``Our morale improves with every day, we have enough ammunition supplies in just one depot to last us at least three more years and we still have plenty of public support,'' he said. ``With God's help we will hold our lines.'' </P>
<P> Taleban began defending the town six weeks ago when government fighters pushed the militia back about 12 miles from Kabul's outskirts. </P>
<P> The Kabul government has this week also reported successes in the southwestern provinces of Farah and Helmand in its first major assaults against Taleban since March. </P>
<P> Then, government forces drove the militia out of a newly-captured district of Kabul and the nearby Charasyab base in March. </P>
<P> The March defeat shattered an aura of invincibility which had surrounded Taleban since it captured several southern and eastern provinces, mostly from other opponents of Rabbani. </P>
