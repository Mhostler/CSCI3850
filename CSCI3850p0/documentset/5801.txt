<DATELINE>MOSCOW (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Russian President Boris Yeltsin Monday backed plans for an amnesty of war veterans now in jail to mark the 50th anniversary of the Allied victory over Nazi Germany in World War II, a presidential aide said. </P>
<P> Viktor Mironov, deputy chairman of the parliamentary committee for security, told Interfax news agency the amnesty was likely to free about 300,000 people and was intended primarily for prisoners who had once fought in World War II. </P>
<P> He said the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, would consider a resolution on the amnesty this week and that it would also include some invalids, minors and women. Murderers and anyone sentenced for more than five years would be excluded. </P>
<P> Itar-Tass news agency quoted a representative of the presidential press service as saying: ``President Boris Yeltsin agreed today with the State Duma proposal.'' </P>
<P> Tass confirmed that serious offenders would not be included in the amnesty. But it did not say how many people would benefit from the amnesty or when exactly it would take effect, if approved by parliament. </P>
