<P>  The United Nations began an airlift of urgent supplies for Chechen refugees Sunday despite restrictions it said were being imposed by Russian authorities. </P>
<P> The Geneva-based headquarters of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said a chartered Russian IL-76 cargo plane carrying 42 tons of aid arrived in Vladikavkaz, in Russia's north Ossetia region, after a five-hour flight from Amsterdam. </P>
<P> After delivering its cargo, the UNHCR aircraft was scheduled to fly on to Turkey to pick up another 33 tons of supplies and return to Vladikavkaz Tuesday. </P>
<P> UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond said a 10-member UNHCR mission which arrived in Vladikavkaz Wednesday to assess the needs of the Chechen refugees had found its movements restricted by Russian officials. </P>
<P> The team had been able to make only a single one-day trip so far to Ingushetia, a region on the western boundary of Chechnya where more than 80,000 Chechens have fled and where the UNHCR wants to concentrate its efforts initially, he said. </P>
<P> ``Our team had a meeting this morning with the Russians and got permission for seven people to go to Nazran (in Ingushetia) for one day tomorrow. They will look at how to distribute this assistance. We still need better access and freedom of movement in Ingushetia,'' he added. </P>
<P> Sunday's airlift cargo included 14,250 blankets, four tons of soap, 11.5 tons of plastic sheeting, World Health Organization medical supplies, a vehicle and communications equipment. </P>
<P> Some of the aid will be handed out to Chechens who have fled to north Ossetia, but the bulk will be taken by the Russian relief agency Emercom to Ingushetia for distribution there under UNHCR supervision. </P>
<P> ``In all our operations we insist on monitoring distribution. We want to make sure the distribution is equitable and fair,'' Redmond said. </P>
<P> Redmond said the UNHCR team went to the area to assess the needs of around 150,000 people who have fled to Ingushetia, Dagestan, north Ossetia and the Stavropol region of southern Russia after the Russians asked the U.N. for assistance. </P>
<P> He said the one visit the UNHCR team had made to Ingushetia so far had shown the desperate needs of the Chechen refugees. </P>
<P> ``There were people who were so weak they could hardly walk. In fact some had to be lifted off the trucks. There were people who had not eaten for four days, people who had spent several weeks in cellars in Grozny, who had nothing left but the clothes on their backs,'' he said. </P>
