<P>  Bosnian Muslim and Croat leaders will meet next weekend at a security conference in Munich to shore up the federation they created last year, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Thursday. </P>
<P> The United States originally sponsored the federation in a bid to isolate the Bosnian Serbs, and senior U.S. officials will also be attending the annual conference on European security in the German city of Werkunde. </P>
<P> The Washington Post reported Thursday that Defense Secretary William Perry and Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke would meet the Muslims and Croats there to try to defuse tensions that have arisen between them. </P>
<P> ``As you know the federation documents were initially signed here in Washington. We're very anxious that that process move forward,'' Christopher told reporters before talks with Polish Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak. </P>
<P> ``It is, I think, significant and can be very valuable for the parties to meet in Munich to redouble their efforts toward a federation and making a federation work,'' he said in reply to a question about the meeting. </P>
<P> Christopher said the federation should move ``beyond being a concept to have the largest amount of substantive content''. The United States and its allies needed ``to put their shoulder to the wheel and help the parties with the consolidation of the federation concept''. </P>
<P> Bosnia's Muslim Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic made a passing reference to the Munich meeting during a Washington news conference Wednesday, but gave no details. </P>
<P> The Washington Post said Perry and Holbrooke would urge the Moslems and Croats to integrate their societies instead of creating separate schools and police forces and maintaining separate armies. </P>
<P> It quoted Holbrooke as telling a lunch with Washington Post staff that the situation in Bosnia had become dangerous as a result of Muslim-Croat tensions and Croatia's decision to have U.N. peacekeeping forces leave its territory later this year. </P>
<P> ``The situation is very close to the kind of disintegration that could set off a very dangerous chain reaction,'' Holbrooke was quoted as saying. </P>
