<P>  Philippine communist rebels said Saturday peace talks in the Netherlands with the Philippine government had collapsed over the issue of safety guarantees for returning insurgents. </P>
<P> ``The talks that have taken place have been a complete failure,'' the rebels' chief negotiator, Luis Jalandoni, told Reuters in a telephone interview from their base in the central Dutch town of Utrecht. </P>
<P> ``As far as we are concerned it is not possible to continue talks under the current circumstances,'' he said. </P>
<P> Negotiations between the two sides, repeatedly held up by disputes, had aimed to forge a common agenda for formal negotiations to end the 24-year-old insurgency. </P>
<P> The dispute centered on the rebels' demands for safety and immunity from prosecution, with the rebels accusing the government of tabling a ``patronising'' proposal violating the spirit of equality in a joint declaration drawn up as talks began in 1992. </P>
<P> Jalandoni accused the government of ``pretending to offer the olive branch of peace with the right hand when it is really dripping with blood in the left hand.'' </P>
<P> He warned of mass demonstrations in the coming week in the Philippines against the government's attempts to seek a rapid ratification on the GATT trade treaty, which he said would intensify the economic and social burdens borne by the people. </P>
<P> Jalandoni said the government's chief negotiator, Howard Dee, ``denied all our data and facts. He was still hopeful there would be peace.'' But he said the government's ``superior and insincere'' approach was ``totally unacceptable'' to the rebels. </P>
<P> The latest round of talks, which began Monday, was the third in preliminary talks between the Philippines and the rebels. </P>
<P> Howard Dee said earlier this week that Filipinos were rapidly losing patience at the slow pace of proceedings. </P>
<P> ``We must refrain from threatening the progress of the talks with preconditions, outright demands, unfounded accusations, and other acts that could make us and the public as well lose confidence in our peace talks,'' he said. </P>
<P> The government has been trying to draw all insurgent groups in the Philippines to the peace table. It is close to forging agreements with Muslim separatist rebels and mutinous army troops who launched six coup attempts between 1986 and 1989. </P>
