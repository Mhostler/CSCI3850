<DATELINE>ORMARA, Pakistan (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Pakistani authorities Tuesday burned 40 tons of hashish seized in a helicopter-backed raid on a camel train in a remote valley last week. </P>
<P> Officials estimated the haul had a Western street value of up to $256 million. It was set alight near the Arabian Sea port of Ormara in the southwestern province of Baluchistan. </P>
<P> The hashish was seized Saturday when a joint force of the government's Anti-Narcotics Task Force (ANTF) and the paramilitary Frontier Corps intercepted the 250-camel train about 90 miles from Ormara in the Awaran hills. </P>
<P> It was burned before reporters, drug enforcement and customs officials of some Western countries and Pakistani military and narcotics control officials could fly to the spot. </P>
<P> An ANTF official, Col. Ehsanul Haq, said the seizure took place after an hour-long gunbattle in which an army helicopter -- one of two that took part in the raid -- was hit by a burst of gunfire unleashed from among more than 100 fleeing smugglers. </P>
<P> He said no one was arrested because the security forces lacked maneuverability after the helicopter was disabled and had to crash land some distance from the scene of the raid. </P>
<P> ``Only 25 of our men who were airlifted by the other helicopter to positions on the surrounding hills forced the smugglers to run, leaving their 40-ton cargo of death behind,'' Haq said. </P>
<P> He said the raid was the culmination of a two-day operation launched after a tip-off from an ANTF informer. Two SAAB light military aircraft were used to spot the convoy and the two helicopters were used to bring in the ANTF and Frontier Corps personnel. </P>
<P> ``We believe that the hashish was made and packed in Afghanistan and was en route to the Baluchistan coast from where it could be smuggled to Western countries,'' he said. </P>
