<P>  Kuwait said Friday it had initialed a military agreement with China allowing Beijing to provide technical help to the Persian Gulf nation's armed forces. </P>
<P> The accord, initialed by Defense Minister Sheikh Ahmad Hamoud al-Jaber al-Sabah and Chinese Defense Minister Chi Hoatian in Beijing Saturday would be a stabilizing factor in the oil-rich Gulf, the official Kuwait News Agency reported. </P>
<P> Kuwait has now signed or initialled military or defense agreements with all five permanent member states of the U.N. Security Council, a key ambition of the small Gulf state ever since the 1991 Gulf War ended a seven-month Iraqi occupation. </P>
<P> ``The military agreement we have signed will constitute a factor of stability in the region and will serve international peace,'' the agency quoted Sheikh Ahmad as saying. </P>
<P> Chi said under the accord China would provide technical expertise in various fields to the Kuwaiti armed forces, the agency reported. </P>
<P> The agency added that China had expressed readiness to cooperate with Kuwait in rebuilding its armed forces following the theft or destruction of equipment during the occupation. </P>
<P> The Chinese Xinhua news agency said Friday the two countries had signed a memorandum of understanding on military cooperation but gave no further details. </P>
<P> Kuwaiti newspapers have reported Chinese officials as saying the Chinese constitution forbids outright defense pacts with other states and any accord it signed would be more limited in nature that Kuwait's other defense agreements. </P>
<P> Kuwaiti Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh Saad al-Abdulla al-Sabah and an accompanying economic delegation are due to visit China in April, diplomats say. </P>
<P> China welcomed Iraq's recognition of Kuwait last year and urged the international community to consider gradually lifting economic sanctions imposed on Baghdad after its invasion. </P>
<P> Sheikh Ahmad is making the first visit to China by a defense minister from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) economic and military alliance of Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirtates, Oman, Bahrain, Kuwait and Qatar, the agency reported. </P>
<P> He said the agreement, initialled on the 31st anniversary of the establishment of Kuwait-Chinese relations, would also boost bilateral cooperation in several fields. </P>
<P> During his visit, Sheikh Ahmad held talks with State Council Premier Li Peng, inspected Chinese warships at a Shanghai naval base and visited military factories. </P>
