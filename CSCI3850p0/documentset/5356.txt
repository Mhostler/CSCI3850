<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Americans are down on all Washington politicians, whether Democrat or Republican, a new survey published Friday showed. </P>
<P> The Harris Poll of 1,005 adults interviewed between March 23 and 26 found that President Clinton's job rating was down five points, Senate Majority leader Bob Dole was also down five points and House Speaker Newt Gingrich's rating had declined by three points. </P>
<P> Overall, the telephone survey by New York-based Louis Harris and Associates disclosed that the Republicans in Congress have slipped four points and the Democrats one point in the job-approval ratings. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points. </P>
<P> A CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll released Thursday showed 61 percent of Americans disapproved of the way Congress was doing its job, up from 59 percent earlier this month. </P>
<P> The main findings of the Harris Poll were that President Clinton's job rating is down to 41 percent positive, 58 percent negative from 46 percent positive, 53 percent negative in February, and the job approval ratings of Republican Senator Dole, who could challenge Clinton for the presidency in 1996, fell to 44 percent positive, 52 percent negative from 49 percent positive, 43 percent negative in February. </P>
<P> Republican House Speaker Gingrich's job ratings are now 32 percent positive and 62 percent negative compared with 35 percent and 54 percent in February, the poll found. </P>
<P> The survey showed that Republicans in Congress slipped in their job approval ratings to 38 percent approval from 42 percent and that the Democrats still have the lowest ratings of any of the leaders or groups measured. The Democrats' approval stand at 30 percent positive, slightly worse than the 31 percent rating in February. </P>
