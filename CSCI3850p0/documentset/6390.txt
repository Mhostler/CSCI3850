<DATELINE>PARIS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Lawyer Jacques Isorni, who defended Vichy French collaborationist leader Marshal Philippe Petain at his post-war trial for treason, has died at his home in Paris, his family said Tuesday. He was 83. </P>
<P> Isorni died Monday, the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe. </P>
<P> Picked as a junior member of Petain's defense team in the summer of 1945, Isorni had not been linked with the Vichy regime during the 1940-1944 German occupation of France. </P>
<P> His brilliant oratory in defense of Petain, arguing that the World War One hero had limited the damage caused to France by the occupying Nazis, soon made him chief defense attorney. </P>
<P> Despite Isorni's arguments, Petain was sentenced to death. Government leader Gen. Charles de Gaulle commuted the sentence to life imprisonment and Petain died in prison in 1951. </P>
<P> Isorni entered parliament in 1951 as an independent rightist and remained there until 1958. </P>
<P> During the early 1960s, he defended members of the extreme rightist Secret Army Organization (OAS) which waged an underground war to overthrow De Gaulle and keep Algeria French. </P>
<P> Isorni was a prolific author of history books and wrote several plays. He was long-time president of an association to defend Petain's memory. </P>
