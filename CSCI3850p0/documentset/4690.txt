<P>  White House press secretary Mike McCurry blasted Republican presidential candidate Phil Gramm Thursday for dodging a question on whether he would choose a woman as a running mate with a joke. </P>
<P> McCurry said he ``found it a little more than ludicrous'' that Gramm, when asked whether he would consider a woman for the number two spot if he wins the Republican nomination, ``responded with a quip about a movie actress.'' </P>
<P> Gramm, interviewed on CNN's ``Larry King Live'' Wednesday night, said there were ``a lot of good and honorable people to choose from'' as possible running mates, citing excellent work by conservative governors around the country. </P>
<P> Asked if he would run with a woman, Gramm fired back, ``Sophia Loren is not a citizen.'' He did not elaborate. </P>
<P> ``I didn't think you could get away with that kind of thing in this day and age, but it's consistent with my view that a lot of these (Republican candidates) are 19th century kind of guys,'' McCurry said. </P>
