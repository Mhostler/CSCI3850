<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Israel and the Palestinians agreed at a four-nation summit in Cairo Thursday to press on with their self-rule agreements, and PLO leader Yasser Arafat promised Israel he would take a strong line against violent opponents of peace. </P>
<P> After more than five hours of talks, Arafat and the leaders of Israel, Egypt and Jordan made a fresh commitment to the goal of a full Middle East peace including Syria and Lebanon. </P>
<P> Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, returning from the summit, said Friday that the meeting sent a signal to the Middle East that a ``bloc for peace'' had established itself there. </P>
<P> Rabin, speaking to reporters in a military plane en route to Tel Aviv, called the summit ``a signal to the Middle East -- behold, the bloc for peace has established itself here.'' </P>
<P> He added: ``In my view, this is a matter of the highest importance.'' </P>
<P> Egypt said it called the one-day summit to save the Middle East peace process from collapse over disputes such as Jewish settlements, Islamic militant attacks on Israeli targets and Israel's refusal to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. </P>
<P> Asked if it had achieved this objective, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said, ``Yes. I believe the Palestinian-Israeli peace process is back on track.'' </P>
<P> Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, attending the summit with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and King Hussein of Jordan, will meet again next Thursday on the border between Gaza and Israel for more talks, he added. </P>
<P> Also Thursday, Israel, Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinians agreed to press on with plans to set up a regional development bank to provide much-needed funds for economic cooperation underpinning their peace process . </P>
<P> The leaders of the four parties renewed their support for the proposed bank, endorsed by a Middle East economic summit in Casablanca, Morocco, last November, in a communique issued at the end of their meeting in Cairo. </P>
<P> ``To enhance economic cooperation and encourage joint rojects and attract the international private sector ... the parties will continue to cooperate in the establishment of a regional development bank,'' the statement said. </P>
<P> The four parties, known as the ``core countries'' in regional economic cooperation, are strongly in favor of setting up the bank discussed by experts in Washington last month. Experts from 37 countries and international organizations agreed in Washington to set up a task force to work out details of the proposed bank. </P>
<P> The current Middle East peace process was launched at a conference in Madrid, Spain, more than three years ago and has taken shape in agreements signed by Israel to end almost 50 years of hostility with Jordan and the Palestinians. </P>
<P> But the march toward peace has stumbled over Arab-Jewish violence, mainly by Muslim militants opposed to peace with the Jewish state, Israel's sharp reaction to this violence, and deadlock in talks with Syria. </P>
<P> On the peace process a joint communique said: ``The leaders ... reaffirmed their determination to continue the Middle East peac process toward the fulfillment of a just, lasting and comprehensive peace. ... The parties are committed to honor and implement fully in letter and spirit the historic accords reached between them.'' </P>
<P> ``(They) condemned all the outbreaks of bloodshed, terror and violence in the region and reaffirmed their intention to stand staunchly against and put an end to all such acts,'' it added. </P>
<P> In Washington, Secretary of State Warren Christopher hailed the summit as a ``historic meeting'' and welcomed its commitment to press ahead toward a full Middle East peace. </P>
<P> U.S. officials said foreign ministers of the four parties involved -- Egypt, Israel, Jordan and the PLO -- were expected to meet in Washington Feb. 12 to discuss ways of implementing the summit decisions. </P>
<P> ``I welcome the results of the summit that has been held in Cairo. It was an historic meeting,'' Christopher, who has made repeated trips to the Middle East in search of a settlement, said in a statement issued hours after the summit ended. </P>
<P> He said the meeting showed that the four leaders ``are standing together in the pursuit of peace and they are also standing firmly together against those who would try to stop the march towards peace.'' </P>
<P> Moussa, asked what practical steps would be taken on violence, said: ``Such a meeting cannot discuss specifically ways and means but we reaffirm our stand against all kinds of violence that would undermine the peace process.'' </P>
<P> The communique indicated that the leaders made little progress on the dispute over Israel's nuclear program -- an issue gaining urgency as the April deadline for renewing the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty approaches. </P>
<P> ``After appreciating President Mubarak's disarmament proposals on weapons of mass destruction, the parties shall pursue a mutually viable Middle East zone, free of weapons of mass destruction -- nuclear, chemical and biological, `` it said. </P>
<P> Moussa described the nuclear dispute as ``very serious'' and said Egypt would keep talking about it with the Israelis. </P>
<P> Egypt has so far strongly resisted American pressure to agree on an extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty unless it is signed by the Jewish state. Israel, which is widely believed to possess nuclear arms, has consistently refused to sign the treaty. </P>
<P> Peres said Thursday that Israel and Egypt were close to resolving the dispute over the treaty, but Moussa denied this. </P>
<P> ``It's not correct ... and it's not accurate,'' he said. </P>
<P> The communique said the four leaders ``expressed the hope that the near future will witness the achievement of peace accords between Israel, Syria and Lebanon.'' </P>
