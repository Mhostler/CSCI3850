<P>  South African President Nelson Mandela, touring black squatter camps on the eve of a ruling party congress, told his poorest supporters on Friday his government has begun improving their lives. </P>
<P> ``I walked around and I smelled poverty,'' Mandela told supporters in Namibia squatter settlement outside Bloemfontein, where his African National Congress Saturday opens its first congress since taking power in historic elections last April. </P>
<P> ``Before the election we promised you that we want a better life for all of you. We promised you houses, schools, hospitals and clinics, tarred roads, running water and electricity,'' Mandela told a crowd of about 300 in the squatter camp. </P>
<P> He said his government of national unity had begun setting up structures to deliver on those promises but it would take time. </P>
<P> Mandela listed his government's achievements, among them feeding schemes for children, free medical care for pregnant women and free education for children starting school in 1995. </P>
<P> ``We have also started building dams and boreholes throughout the country to give the people clean water. No other government has achieved these things in seven months,'' he said. </P>
<P> Fierce debate is expected at the ANC congress over accusations that the party leadership has moved too slowly to improve the quality of life for the black majority, partly because it is too scared of alienating whites. </P>
<P> Mandela said earlier this month bids to reassure whites that they had nothing to fear from an ANC government had been necessary for the last seven months. </P>
<P> ``Now we have the opportunity to address the needs of our people,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``We have not spent a cent preaching reconciliation, but we have spent millions of rand (dollars) trying to set up structures to improve our people's lives,'' Mandela added. </P>
<P> He said followers who criticised the ANC style of government had no clue of what was involved in running a country. </P>
<P> Tokyo Sexwale, premier of the province around Johannesburg now known as Gauteng, said the congress in Bloemfontein would re-examine party strategy. </P>
<P> ``We are going to...get a fresh mandate from our constituencies, to receive a report back of what we are doing best and where we have fumbled,'' he said. </P>
<P> Ordinary ANC members said they would like to see a fully agreed program of action to address issues such as housing, education and economic growth. </P>
<P> ``To avoid any misunderstanding, the conference needs to come with ideas on how that program of action is going to be communicated to the people on the ground,'' said Katlehong ANC leader Kennedy Ngengebule. </P>
<P> Another ANC supporter said: ``Congress needs to come clean on how it is going to climb out of the gravy train, how it is going to stop kow-towing to whites. Really I am bitter about the fact that it looks like blacks do not exist any longer.'' </P>
<P> Several of the ANC key leadership positions are up for grabs at the congress -- deputy president, national chairman, secretary general and treasurer. </P>
