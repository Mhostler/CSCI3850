<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A U.S.-led international coalition was the key to reversing Iraqi aggression against Kuwait in 1991, but maintaining the same united course against Saddam Hussein this time may prove trickier. </P>
<P> Saddam's new provocation comes during a period when President Clinton is politically weak at home, his world leadership is questioned and U.S. forces are on the ground in Haiti and in the air, when called for, over Bosnia. </P>
<P> U.S. ties with Britain, France and Russia -- pivotal allies in the Gulf War effort -- have been bruised by differences over Bosnia. </P>
<P> Meanwhile, Baghdad has been wooing France and Russia to support lifting United Nations sanctions against Iraq with promises of lucrative business contracts and repayment of millions of dollars in debts once oil sales are resumed. </P>
<P> Baghdad initially branded as ``fabrication'' U.S. claims that some 80,000 Iraqi troops were amassing near the Kuwaiti border. But Monday, Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, said in New York his government would move its forces away from southern Iraq because of U.N. Security Council concerns. </P>
<P> Whether, or how soon, this would defuse the crisis was not clear. The troop buildup was widely seen as a sign of Saddam's frustration over failing to persuade the Security Council to lift Gulf War sanctions that have devastated Iraq's economy. </P>
<P> The Clinton administration has made multilateral action a hallmark of its foreign policy. Officials said the president was calling world leaders Monday in an effort to recreate the coalition that three years ago forced Iraq to withdraw its troops from Kuwait, which it invaded in August 1990. </P>
<P> Faced with a new buildup of Iraqi troops, the United States was sending at least 38,000 ground troops to the Gulf. </P>
<P> ``It is very important, as this was an international action before, to keep the international community with us and show international resolve that this is not the proper behavior,'' Madeleine Albright, Washington's U.N. envoy, told CNN. </P>
<P> Britain, despite differences with Washington over policy toward political allies of the Irish Republican Army as well as Bosnia, showed continued commitment to thwarting Saddam. </P>
<P> It dispatched a frigate to Kuwaiti waters and Defense Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said an Iraqi attack on Kuwait would be met with an allied response as tough as in Gulf War. </P>
<P> ``We have assured our friends and partners in the Gulf of our readiness to help them,'' Prime Minister John Major's office said in a statement. ``Iraq should draw the appropriate conclusions.'' </P>
<P> France also said it would join a new U.N.-sponsored intervention against Iraq and sent a frigate to the Gulf to deter any move by Baghdad to attack Kuwait. </P>
<P> But, privately, French officials were skeptical about the extent and significance of Iraq's military buildup near Kuwait, suggesting such a move would make little sense in Baghdad's drive to ease sanctions but might help the Clinton administration in the run-up to U.S. congressional elections. </P>
<P> France, Russia and China have favored easing sanctions to reward Iraq's compliance with disarmament resolutions, while the United States and Britain oppose setting any timetable. </P>
<P> French strategists say that due to Iran's strategic threat to Gulf stability, it is short-sighted to keep isolating Iraq. </P>
<P> There were other signs of allied restiveness. </P>
<P> A senior foreign policy expert from Germany's ruling party, Hans Stercken, questioned the hard-line U.S. stance against Iraq and urged the United Nations to lift its sanctions. </P>
<P> Stercken, head of parliament's foreign policy committee, said many people believed Washington had more commercial than political reasons to insist on maintaining the U.N. sanctions. </P>
<P> Meanwhile, Turkey, another Gulf War coalition member, said it might not allow Western planes at its southern airbase of Incirlik to be used to hit Iraq if renewed tension led to war. </P>
<P> U.S. officials have left the door open to a pre-emptive strike if Iraqi troops remain within what Washington considers menacing distance, even though such a strike would surely upset some Third World nations and perhaps even some U.S. allies. </P>
