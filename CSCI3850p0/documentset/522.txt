<P>  The U.S. Coast Guard intercepted 16,019 Haitian boat people in July, setting a new monthly record for the total picked up at sea, officials said Monday. </P>
<P> Coast Guard ships picked up 29 Haitians in international waters off Haiti Friday and another 35 Sunday. All of the refugees will be taken to the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. </P>
<P> The Coast Guard said its previous record was set in May 1992, when it interdicted 13,053 Haitians at sea. </P>
<P> Haitian refugees have been fleeing political and economic turmoil in their Caribbean homeland since a bloody military coup in September 1991 ousted Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the nation's first democratically elected president. </P>
<P> The stream of refugees rose to a flood this month in response to a Clinton Administration policy shift which granted Haitian boat people the chance to plead their case for U.S. political asylum. </P>
<P> The United States had been repatriating them without hearings. </P>
<P> But, overwhelmed with an outflow that reached more than 3,000 people per day at the beginning of the month, the White House announced July 5 that it was shifting its policy to deny boat people the opportunity for resettlement in the United States. </P>
<P> The number of boat people fleeing Haiti has slowed to a trickle since then. </P>
<P> The Coast Guard also said Monday it had picked up 1,010 Cuban migrants in July, just below the total of 1,173 picked up in June. The June total was the largest since the 1980 Mariel boatlift, when over 100,000 Cubans migrated to Florida. </P>
