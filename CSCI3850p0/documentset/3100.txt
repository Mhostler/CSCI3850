<P>  Defense Secretary William Perry Friday announced $7.7 billion in cuts in military modernisation programs over the next six years to help fund force readiness and the quality of life for U.S. forces. </P>
<P> The cuts, part of a policy that in developing military forces ``people come first,'' included a decision to stretch out procurement of the Air Force's F22 ``stealth'' fighter and put off production of the Army's new RAH-66 ``Comanche'' attack-scout helicopter, Perry said. </P>
