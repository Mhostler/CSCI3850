<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A lawyer representing Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, who is on trial for plotting to bomb U.S. landmarks, said Thursday President Clinton's order freezing her client's assets is meaningless because he is indigent. </P>
<P> ``He has no assets,'' Lynne Stewart told Reuters. ``The judge (in the bombing case) has declared him indigent.'' </P>
<P> Although she said Clinton had essentially ``declared my client is a terrorist on the eve of his trial,'' she did not think the move would affect the jury. ``They aren't supposed to be reading the paper,'' she said of the panelists. </P>
<P> Jury selection in the case was expected to conclude Thursday and opening statements are scheduled to begin Monday. </P>
<P> President Clinton Tuesday froze U.S. assets of 12 Middle East ``terrorist'' groups, saying he was responding to recurrent acts of violence that could disrupt the peace process. He issued an executive order and sent a letter to Congress announcing he was freezing the U.S. assets of the groups and prohibiting transfers of money to them. </P>
<P> The groups include Islamic Jihad, which claimed responsibility for a weekend bombing that killed 19 people in Israel, and Hamas, which bombed a bus in Tel Aviv in October, taking 22 lives. Both oppose the 1993 Israel-Palestine Liberation Organization peace accord and advocate armed struggle against Israel. </P>
<P> Clinton has also frozen the U.S. assets of 18 individuals suspected of involvement in Middle East terrorism, including Abdel-Rahman. The Egyptian cleric and 11 others are charged with scheming since 1989 to wage what prosecutors call a ``war of urban terrorism'' in the United States. </P>
<P> The indictment alleges that the defendants were involved in the February 1993 blast at the World Trade Center in New York and had plans to blow up the United Nations building and bridges and tunnels leading into New York City. </P>
<P> They are also charged with the November 1990 murder of Rabbi Meir Kahane in New York and with planning to kill Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak during a 1993 U.S. visit. </P>
<P> The cleric is accused of being the group's spiritual leader who encouraged them to commit the alleged acts of violence. </P>
<P> Prosecutors told U.S. District Judge Michael Mukasey Thursday that their opening statement will take about 90 minutes. Defense lawyers will give individual statements that are expected to last a total of about nine hours. </P>
