<DATELINE>DHAKA, May 17 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Dhaka's metropolitan magistrate said on Wednesday he would rule in three days on whether the Home Ministry's permission to proceed with the trial of self-exiled feminist writer Taslima Nasrin was valid. </P>
<P> ``I have heard both defence and prosecution arguments ... and I will give by verdict on May 20 on the issue of ministry's permission,'' A.K.M. Kamaluddin said after a two-hour hearing. </P>
<P> The trial on charges Nasrin offending Islam and outraged Moslem religious feelings was originally due to begin in Nasrin's absence on April 15, but the judge deferred it until May 17 after her lawyers challenged the ministry's go-ahead order. </P>
<P> Under Bangladeshi law, a person who allegedly commits an offence outside the country cannot be tried without special permission from the Home Ministry. </P>
<P> Nasrin fled to Sweden last August after she received death threats from Moslem fundamentalists following India's Statesman newspaper quoting her as saying Islam's holy book, the Koran, ``should be revised thoroughly.'' </P>
<P> Nasrin said she was misquoted but was unable to mollify fundamentalists calling for her death by hanging. </P>
<P> One of Nasrin's attorneys, Idrisur Rahman, said a trial would amount to a curtailment of her fundamental rights, especially since she had denied making the remark. </P>
