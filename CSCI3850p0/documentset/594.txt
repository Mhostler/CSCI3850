<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Lebanon kept the door open Thursday to handing over to Germany a Palestinian suspected of links to a 1986 bomb attack on U.S. soldiers in a Berlin disco. </P>
<P> Chief Prosecutor Judge Mounif Oweidat said Lebanese authorities were waiting for Germany to complete its extradition file ahead of a final decision on whether to deliver Palestinian Yasser Shraydi. </P>
<P> ``We need the Germans to complete the file,'' he told Reuters. </P>
<P> Oweidat denied German and U.S. claims that Shraydi had been freed, saying he was still in custody. The Palestinian is suspected of playing a leading role in the April 1986 attack on La Belle discotheque, in which two U.S. soldiers and a woman were killed and more than 200, including many off-duty U.S. servicemen, were injured. </P>
<P> Frank Thiel, spokesman of the Berlin Justice Ministry, said Wednesday all the necessary files had been handed over to Lebanon as far back as August 1993. </P>
<P> But Oweidat said Thursday he had sent a letter to the German embassy in Beirut asking German authorities to supply the report of the explosives expert who investigated the bombing. </P>
<P> He said he also asked for a copy of the interrogation of a Lebanese suspect, Imad Mahmoud, who Oweidat said is under arrest in Germany in connection with the bombing. </P>
<P> ``We have not heard anything since,'' Oweidat said. </P>
<P> Asked what Lebanon would do if Germany did not send the information, he said a final decision on whether to deliver Shraydi was in the hands of the Lebanese justice minister. </P>
<P> The Berlin Justice Ministry said Tuesday Interpol had informed it that the Palestinian had been set free by Lebanese authorities. </P>
<P> In Washington, State Department spokesman Mike McCurry confirmed a Washington Post report that there had been long delays in providing U.S. material on the case to Bonn. </P>
<P> But he said it had been made available to the German government in June and the delays did not affect the extradition attempt. </P>
<P> McCurry said Shraydi was ``no longer in direct custody'' and said his release was ``inexplicable and inexcusable.'' </P>
<P> Then-President Ronald Reagan blamed Libya for the disco attack, and sent U.S. planes to bomb Tripoli in retaliation. </P>
<P> Shraydi was acquitted two months ago of charges that he murdered a Libyan dissident in Berlin in 1984. </P>
