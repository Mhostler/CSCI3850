<P>  China will impose new rules on its film industry, limiting the number of foreign imports and regulating co-productions, some of which have embarrassed the Communist Party, the official China Daily said Tuesday. </P>
<P> Imported films will be limited to 30 percent of the total film market, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> No more than 30 films annually may be made in co-productions with foreign companies. </P>
<P> ``The rules aim to strengthen administration of imported films and co-production of films with foreign producers,'' Li Wenbin, an official at the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television, told the newspaper. </P>
<P> ``There will be more careful screening of imported films, one of the major channels through which the Chinese get access to foreign culture,'' the newspaper said. </P>
<P> Li said the restrictions were not aimed at shutting out foreigners. </P>
<P> ``Co-production of films with foreigners can survive (the new rules) if the principle of mutual benefits is observed,'' he said. </P>
<P> China has been embarrassed in recent years when films made by its directors with foreign funds have won overseas praise and prizes, even when domestic censors have not allowed them in the local market or have demanded extensive changes. </P>
<P> The latest Chinese film to run into trouble at home despite praise abroad was Zhang Yimou's ``To Live.'' The director stayed away from this year's Cannes Festival, where the film was in contention, because it had not been passed by the censors. </P>
<P> Last year's co-winner of Cannes' Golden Palm award, Chen Kaige's ``Farewell to My Concubine,'' was only shown in China after the censor's cuts. </P>
<P> The new rules say that the ministry must have the final say before co-produced films can be released. </P>
<P> China intends to keep a strict eye on the content of films, Li said. </P>
<P> ``It is out of the question for us to allow the production of films depicting sex and violence,'' Li said. </P>
<P> The newspaper did not mention questions of political sensitivity, which have dogged many of the acclaimed offerings by Chinese directors in recent years. </P>
<P> It simply said: ``The script will be the prime concern in the screening of films.'' </P>
