<P> North Korea has said it shot down the helicopter, killing U.S. Army Chief Warrant Officer David Hilemon and capturing Chief Warrant Officer Bobby Hall. But the Pentagon said again on Monday it could not confirm whether the helicopter was shot down or made an emergency landing. </P>
<P> The official said that Hall was the command pilot and was taking Hilemon on a familiarization ride not far from the border when the unarmed OH-58 sped across the border by mistake at high speed at an altitude of only 100 feet. </P>
<P> ``He (Hall) thinks he is in South Korea, where he is supposed to go,'' said the official of Hall's radio message at 10:43 a.m. Korean time on Saturday. The official said that the helicopter went down five minutes later about 3.75 miles north of the line dividing North and South Korea. </P>
