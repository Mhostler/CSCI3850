<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  At least 17 people died and scores were missing Friday after a container ship and a Philippine inter-island ferry carrying more than 550 people collided in Manila Bay, the Philippine coast guard reported. </P>
<P> A coast guard spokesman said at least 449 people had been rescued from the ferry Cebu City. Its owners, William Lines, said 528 passengers and 45 crew were aboard the ship. </P>
<P> Some of the missing may have been taken ashore by fishing boats that responded to the emergency. </P>
<P> But survivors said they believed some people were sucked to their deaths when the ferry sank in about 100 feet of water near the mouth of Manila Bay before dawn. </P>
<P> Cesar Llagas said his wife survived but he lost his grip on their 18-month-old daughter Roselyn when the ferry sank and they were dragged underwater. He believed she died. </P>
<P> Llagas said the collision between the Cebu City and the 12,549 gross ton Singaporean-registered Kota Suria container ship sounded like an earthquake on the second-lowest deck of the ferry. </P>
<P> ``People panicked. They were running around grabbing life vests. They were asking for help but they were not saved because they were all sucked down,'' he said after being brought ashore at Manila harbor. </P>
<P> Capt. Teleforo Solda, marine superintendent of William Lines, said the 2,452 gross ton Cebu City sank after it was struck. </P>
<P> How long it stayed afloat after the collision was uncertain. Some survivors said it was only a few minutes, others as long as an hour. </P>
<P> Veneranda Calamba, carrying her 16-month-old son Marcelo, was among several passengers who managed to scramble from the ferry to the Kota Suria. </P>
<P> Marcelo clapped his hands in delight when they reached land. </P>
<P> ``We were at the bottommost part of the ship and I saw the water rising and so I went up to the next deck,'' said another survivor, Amalia Logo. </P>
<P> ``People were scrambling for life jackets. I didn't bother to get one because I know how to swim so I jumped off the ship.'' </P>
<P> A Reuter reporter who flew over the scene in a helicopter during the rescue said the sea at the mouth of Manila Bay was littered with floating cargo containers and empty life rafts. </P>
<P> An oil slick marked the spot where the Cebu City sank after the collision and rescue ships surrounded the area. </P>
<P> The bows of the black-and-white-painted Kota Suria were damaged where it struck the Cebu City amidships in apparently clear weather. </P>
<P> An official of the Kota Suria's Singapore owners, Pacific International Lines, said none of the container ship's 24 crew was hurt. </P>
<P> The sunken ferry, a combined passenger and cargo vessel, was on its way to Tagbilaran in the central island of Bohol when the collision occurred. </P>
<P> President Fidel Ramos said he had ordered a thorough investigation into the accident. </P>
<P> The Philippines, an archipelago of 7,100 islands, has frequent sea disasters involving inter-island vessels. </P>
<P> More than 4,000 people died in the world's worst peacetime sea disaster in December 1987 when the Dona Paz ferry and an oil tanker collided and exploded off Mindoro Island. </P>
