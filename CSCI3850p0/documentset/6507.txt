<DATELINE>MADRID (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Real Madrid's Lithuanian center Arvidas Sabonis said Friday he would be leaving the club to join the Portland Trail Blazers of the NBA. </P>
<P> The towering 31-year-old, who was inspirational in Madrid's European Champion Clubs' Cup final four victory last month, said the United States would be his last port of call before retiring. </P>
<P> ``After Real Madrid there is nowhere else (in Europe) to go,'' a tearful Sabonis told reporters. </P>
<P> ``It's the U.S. and then Lithuania. As my leg still lets me play, I'll go to the States. Then home, to fish and spend time with my family. </P>
<P> ``I'm going now so that I don't regret it later. This is my last opportunity and I still dream of playing in the NBA.'' </P>
<P> Sabonis, widely acclaimed as one of the finest players in Europe, has played in Spain for six years and with Madrid for the last three. </P>
<P> In 1988, Sabonis joined forces with Sarunas Marciulionis and Alexander Volkov on the Soviet team that won Olympic gold in Seoul, defeating the U.S. team along the way. </P>
