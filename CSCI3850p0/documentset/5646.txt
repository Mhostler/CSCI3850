<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A San Francisco judge said in a precedent-setting ruling Monday that relatives of seven people killed in a gunman's rampage can sue for damages the manufacturer of the assault weapons he used. </P>
<P> San Francisco Superior Court Judge James Warren said the families can go ahead with wrongful death suits against the gun manufacturer, Navegar Inc of Miami, Fla. </P>
<P> Dennis Henigan, a lawyer for the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, a gun control group allied with the victims' families, said it was a landmark ruling. </P>
<P> ``It establishes for the first time that if companies in the gun industry put on the market weapons of war that have no legitimate use, they may be held accountable for the violence that is the inevitable result of that conduct,'' Henigan said. </P>
<P> An attorney for Navegar denied the company was responsible and said the company may appeal Warren's ruling. </P>
<P> The case stems from a July 1, 1993, shooting at a San Francisco office block when gunman Gian Luigi Ferri, 55, went on a shooting rampage at a law firm, killing eight people and wounding six before taking his own life. </P>
<P> Families of seven of the victims want to sue Navegar, which makes the TEC-DC9 semi-automatic pistols used by Ferri, as well as makers of other equipment used in the 101 California Street shooting. </P>
<P> The gun and equipment manufacturers sought to have the suits dismissed, pointing out that no court in California has ever held a gun manufacturer responsible for criminal shootings. </P>
<P> Lawyers for the victims' families argued that the gun manufacturer should be held liable because its products were ''designed for mass killing'' and it was ``ultrahazardous'' to sell this type of gun to the general public. </P>
<P> Ferri bought two TEC-DC9s in Las Vegas, Nevada, where their sale is legal, and brought them into California. </P>
<P> Warren blocked the plaintiffs from going ahead with their suit against USA Magazines Inc, a Downey, California firm which manufactures the clip Ferri used, partly because the California law does not impose any ban on ammunition. </P>
<P> The next hearing in the case is scheduled for July 10. </P>
