<P>  Pernell ``Sweet Pea'' Whitaker is moving up in class and aims to pad his claim of being the world's best ``pound for pound'' fighter against World Boxing Association junior middleweight champion Julio Cesar Vasquez of Argentina. </P>
<P> Whitaker, currently the World Boxing council welterweight champion, has signed to challenge Vasquez March 4 in Atlantic City. </P>
<P> ``If you want to be called the best, the best has to go out and seek the next best,'' said Whitaker, 34-1-1, Wednesday. </P>
<P> Vasquez, 52-1, has held the junior middleweight crown for two years, having successfully made 10 title defenses. </P>
<P> ``We want to keep proving each and every time that he (Whitaker) is the best pound for pound in the world and to do that we have to take on challenges like Vasquez,'' promoter Dan Duva said. </P>
<P> Whitaker has also held titles previously in the lightweight and junior welterweight divisions. </P>
<P> ``I'm always challenging myself and this is a challenge for me,'' he said. ``I know I'm not a junior middleweight but I feel I have the skills and guts and brains to step in with any man and feel comfortable to beat him.'' </P>
<P> Whitaker, at 5-foot-5, will be giving away a six-inch height advantage to Vasquez. </P>
<P> According to Duva, Whitaker does not intend to keep the junior middleweight crown if he beats Vasquez. </P>
<P> ``He is only interested in being recognized as the best pound for pound fighter in the world,'' he said. </P>
<P> Whitaker last fought three months ago when he easily outpointed American James ``Buddy'' McGirt despite being knocked down in the second round. </P>
<P> The busy Vasquez defended his title six times last year, outpointing American Tony Marshall in his last outing in November. </P>
