<DATELINE>NEWTON, Sierra Leone (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Sierra Leonean rebels sneaked around army positions in broad daylight to attack the town of Newton, their closest strike to the capital so far, a senior military officer said Sunday. </P>
<P> The officer, who asked not to be named, told reporters about 150 rebels armed with AK-47 automatic rifles attacked the town 24 miles from the capital Freetown Saturday but were driven back by government forces backed by Guinean troops and heavy artillery. </P>
<P> He said two paramilitary police and 13 rebels were killed. </P>
<P> ``The only civilian casualty was a man whose right foot was shot by the rebels,'' he said. </P>
<P> Three rebels in paramilitary police uniforms were captured and identified as deserters, he added. </P>
<P> Reporters who visited Newton Sunday found it relatively undamaged but deserted. People from towns in the area were fleeing along the main road to Freetown. </P>
<P> At Waterloo, 18 miles from Freetown, military sources said thousands of refugees from the civil war in neighboring Liberia had abandoned their camp and were sleeping at the disused train station which is nearer the main road. </P>
<P> Reporters saw no evidence to back claims by rebel spokesman Alimamy Sankoh in Ivory Coast that there was fighting in Waterloo and the rebels had reached Freetown's eastern suburbs. </P>
<P> The Revolutionary United Front stepped up its 4-year-old campaign late last year with a military and political offensive. The rebels hold 10 Europeans captured in raids since November. </P>
<P> They control main roads in the interior but no towns, and demand the withdrawal of Nigerian, Guinean and other foreign forces from Sierra Leone before they will talk to the military government. </P>
<P> Saturday's attack went largely unnoticed in Freetown, where attention was concentrated on an African Nations soccer cup qualifying match against Ghana. </P>
<P> Sierra Leone won 1-0 after a 77th minute penalty from Lamin Conteh, who plays in Belgium. Forty fans were injured, three seriously, when the main gate at the national stadium collapsed. </P>
