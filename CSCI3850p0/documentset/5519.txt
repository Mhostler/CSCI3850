<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Thursday approved a bill easing water pollution control requirements for industries and cities. </P>
<P> The measure, which goes to the House floor for action, also makes regulators give much greater consideration to costs before requiring water quality improvements. </P>
<P> The committee approved the bill 42-16 after rejecting a series of amendments from Democrats to reinstate pollution controls that the bill would eliminate or relax. </P>
<P> Committee Chairman Bud Shuster, R-Pa., said the bill is not a retreat from water protection but gives industries, local governments and states more flexibility to meet goals. </P>
<P> ``EPA (the Environmental Protection Agency) and Washington will not be able to dictate to the states and localities as it has been able to do in the past,'' Shuster said. </P>
<P> He said the bill raises the authorization to $3 billion a year for loans to states for water projects, from $2 billion, although he doubted Congress would appropriate the full amount. He said he hoped the House would vote in May or June. </P>
<P> The Clinton administration opposes the bill, saying it undermines efforts to protect rivers, lakes and coastal areas, would cause major destruction of wetlands and fails to address agricultural runoff, a major pollution source. </P>
<P> ``I believe it (is) bad for the environment, the economy and the American people,'' Assistant EPA Administrator Robert Perciasepe said in a letter to Shuster. He called the bill ``a wholesale repeal and replacement'' of clean water laws. </P>
<P> The committee rejected a number of amendments offered by ranking Democrat Norman Mineta of California to strengthen the bill's anti-pollution measures or to maintain current law. </P>
<P> ``None of us really wants to be in the position of having to explain in our districts why we voted to fundamentally weaken the Clean Water Act,'' Mineta said. </P>
<P> But Shuster said the bill had broad bipartisan support, and noted it passed by more than a two-to-one margin after most Democratic amendments were rejected by similar margins. </P>
<P> The bill, backed by industries and local governments, provides for more waivers and exemptions for water treatment, revokes a mandatory program to stem pollution of coastal areas and requires cost-benefit and risk assessment studies before new regulations are imposed. </P>
<P> It also sets up a system of ranking wetlands for protection, which the EPA said could expose 60-80 percent of remaining wetlands to development, including parts of the Florida Everglades and the Dismal Swamp that straddles southeast Virginia and northeast North Carolina. </P>
<P> Environmentalists blasted the legislation, dubbing it the ''Polluter Protection Bill.'' But Shuster warned them that if they try to block the bill in the Senate, states will risk losing $3 billion a year for pollution control. The Senate Environment Committee is to start work on its bill in June. </P>
