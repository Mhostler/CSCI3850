<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Saudi Arabia's foreign minister expressed concern Thursday about Iran's military buildup in the Gulf. </P>
<P> ``Iran is one of the most important countries in the Gulf and therefore its policies toward stability or away from it concerns all the countries,'' Prince Saud al-Faisal said during a picture-taking opportunity with Secretary of State Warren Christopher. </P>
<P> The Saudi minister earlier met with President Clinton at the White House. </P>
<P> U.S. Army Gen. John Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, disclosed Wednesday that Iran had deployed Hawk anti-aircraft missiles on islands in the Straits of Hormuz, boosting fears about its ability to cut off oil shipping from the key waterway. </P>
<P> ``They have right now deployed Hawk missile systems. The other day they started putting missiles on their launchers, which they had not done before,'' Shalikashvili said. </P>
<P> Ahead of a working lunch with Christopher at the State Department, the Saudi minister was asked if his government was as concerned about this development as Washington. </P>
<P> ``We look forward to peace and stability in the Gulf region and we hope that the efforts that are expended by all the countries in the Gulf region will not be for militarization,'' he told reporters, speaking in English. </P>
<P> Prince Saud also told reporters Arab countries want to extend the crucial Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that comes up for renewal soon. </P>
<P> But according to an unofficial interpretation of his Arabic response, he did not say specifically if Saudi Arabia supports the U.S. position in favor of making the treaty permanent. </P>
<P> Egypt has threatened not to support an indefinite extension of the treaty if Israel does not agree to join as a non-nuclear state. </P>
<P> Prince Saud said the Arab states want to create a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East and hope Israel will be part of this. </P>
<P> Christopher said he and the Saudi minister would discuss the NPT, Arab-Israeli peace negotiations and the U.S.-led effort to keep U.N. sanctions on Iraq. </P>
