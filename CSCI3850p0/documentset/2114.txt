<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Two leading Republicans Wednesday assailed a California ballot proposition that would deny education, welfare and medical benefits to illegal immigrants. </P>
<P> California's Republican Gov. Pete Wilson has backed the so-called ``save our state'' initiative and made it a centerpiece of his re-election campaign against Democrat Kathleen Brown, whom he currently leads in the polls. </P>
<P> But Brown's campaign was likely to seize on a detailed nine-page statement from former education secretary William Bennett and former housing secretary Jack Kemp, a possible 1996 presidential candidate, to hit back at Wilson. </P>
<P> Polls show Californians back the initiative by a two-to-one majority. If enacted, it would require local police, hospitals, schools and clinics to identify those in the United States illegally for deportation. </P>
<P> Even if approved, the proposition would not take effect since its constitutionality is open to question. Approval would likely result in decades of litigation. </P>
<P> ``We urge Republicans not to support an anti-immigration movement which we consider in the long run to be politically unwise and fundamentally at odds with the best tradition and spirit of our party,'' Kemp and Bennett said. </P>
<P> They said the California ballot proposition would contribute to anti-immigrant feeling, which would eventually boomerang back to hurt the Republican Party. </P>
<P> ``Immigrants are becoming a kind of all-purpose punching bag, and if some of the anti-immigration measures now being considered do pass, the problems which they are supposed to ameliorate will still be with us,'' Kemp and Bennett added. </P>
<P> Bennett, who won prominence for compiling the best-selling ''Book of Virtues,'' has become a strong moral voice on the right of the Republican Party. He was considered a possible presidential contender for 1996, but removed himself from consideration last summer. </P>
<P> Kemp, who has not disclosed his presidential intentions, is a leading economic conservative. </P>
<P> The two Republicans said the California proposition would create a nation of informers and speed the creation of a vast government bureaucracy. Children would be pressured to turn in their parents and nurses and teachers would be asked to report suspected illegal immigrants to the authorities. </P>
<P> ``This is not a road we should head down,'' Kemp and Bennett said. </P>
