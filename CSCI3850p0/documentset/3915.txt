<DATELINE>LAUSANNE, Switzerland (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Salt Lake City, Utah; Quebec City, Canada; Oestersund, Sweden; and Sion, Switzerland, were named the four finalists to host the 2002 Winter Games Tuesday. </P>
<P> The decision, announced by International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch, meant that five bidding cities were eliminated -- Graz (Austria), Sochi (Russia), Jaca (Spain), Tarvisio (Italy) and Poprad-Tatry (Slovakia). </P>
<P> The IOC's full 100-strong membership will choose the winner in a secret vote in Budapest on June 16. </P>
<P> All nine candidates presented their bids to an IOC panel Monday in the IOC's first attempt at ``pre-selecting candidates.'' </P>
<P> Olympic observers say that Salt Lake City, which lost out narrowly to Nagano in the contest to host the 1998 Games, will start the final stretch as favorite. </P>
<P> Its strongest opposition, they say, will come from Quebec City -- making its first Olympic bid -- and Oestersund. </P>
