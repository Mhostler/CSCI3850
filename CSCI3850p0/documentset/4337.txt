<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Right-wing South African whites armed with chains, whips and snarling dogs Tuesday terrorized black children bussed into their neighborhood and threatened to burn down a school the pupils have occupied. </P>
<P> Armed police escorted the children from the fenced school compound to buses at the end of the day. </P>
<P> ``Tonight we're coming to burn down this school. We don't want these dirty kaffirs here,'' said one resident, referring to the blacks by a derogatory term now outlawed in South Africa. </P>
<P> About 100 men and women, most armed with chains, whips, batons or sticks, shouted abuse while their Rottweiler and Alsation dogs barked viciously at the children behind the schoolyard fence. </P>
<P> The 3,000 black pupils occupied the school in the low-income Ruyterwacht suburb of Cape Town a week ago after they were turned away from overcrowded township schools about nine miles away at the beginning of the new school year. </P>
<P> Scores of previously whites-only schools have closed due to dwindling white population growth, but the country faces a massive backlog of classrooms and facilities in the townships to which blacks were restricted under apartheid. </P>
<P> The former white government began to relax school segregation in 1989, but the last vestiges of classroom apartheid were lifted in January when segregation was outlawed. </P>
<P> Black children have increasingly moved into many mainly white schools since President Nelson Mandela won the first all-race elections last April and others have taken over abandoned school buildings. </P>
<P> Male nurse Wentzel Veldtsman said he was not a racist, but added: ``We are at breaking point now because we don't want these blacks here. The issue is they don't stay here. They stay in the townships and then they come here and disrupt the people. </P>
<P> ``I saw with my own eyes how one of these blacks climbed over the fence and pulled out his private parts and tried to piss on a woman,'' Veldtsman said. </P>
<P> Pieter Labuschagne, sporting two golden front teeth, said: ``They're urinating in public, they're having intercourse right in front of us in the school yard. They're animals, the place looks like a pigsty.'' </P>
<P> Ursula Fourie said she did not want any blacks in her suburb because they had killed her husband last year. ``Now they're going to kill us and I will not allow it a second time.'' </P>
<P> Asked why children would want to kill her, she said: ``Because they hate us.'' </P>
<P> School pupil Nicholas Booi said he was both sad and angry about the threats of the white community: ``They must think we are very, very bad. </P>
<P> ``We have voted and in a way they must make us feel happy in their areas. We're not here to disturb them. We only want an education,'' he said. </P>
<P> Zukiswa Vumenjani said she was angry because the residents were wasting valuable teaching time. </P>
<P> ``And we didn't do all these things they say like urinating and all that. We wanted to be friendly with them.'' </P>
