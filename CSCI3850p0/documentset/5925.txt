<P>  Investigators of the Oklahoma City building blast have obtained a film of the federal building scene and are processing it, the FBI said on Friday. </P>
<P> ``I can confirm we have a film, which has been sent for analysis,'' said Weldon Kennedy, Federal Bureau of Investigation special agent at a news conference. He said he could not confirm what was on the film. </P>
<P> He said the film was apparently taken by a nearby building's surveillance camera. Since the film was ``somewhat damaged'' in the aftermath of Wednesday's blast at the A.P. Murrah office building, Kennedy said investigators would have to enhance the images. </P>
