<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Police have arrested the deputy leader and more than 30 members of a breakaway faction of the Maoist guerrilla movement Shining Path in a nationwide sweep, authorities said Thursday. </P>
<P> ``We're talking about a very important capture,'' Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori told reporters. </P>
<P> Fujimori said 20 guerrillas were detained, including four members of the group's 10-member Emergency Central Committee. </P>
<P> Police officials said more than 30 guerrillas were caught in the sweep Tuesday and Wednesday, including several regional and national leaders. </P>
<P> They said Margie Clavo Peralta, political chief of a Shining Path faction, was arrested Wednesday with two other rebels in a rented house in the central Andean city of Huancayo. </P>
<P> The faction is led by Oscar Ramirez Durand, who opposes a peace accord with the Peruvian government. </P>
<P> Police said the hard-line guerrilla faction was planning an ``armed strike'' to try to upset the South American country's April 9 general elections. </P>
<P> Authorities said Maoist rebels took advantage of the withdrawal of Peruvian troops engaged in last month's border conflict with Ecuador to step up attacks in the coca-growing Upper Huallaga Valley. As many as 50 people may have died in the renewed violence. </P>
<P> But attacks have subsided since the troops returned from the Ecuadoran border and the arrests Tuesday and Wednesday are the latest blows to the weakened Maoist group, which has waged a 15-year guerrilla war in Peru's mountains and cities. </P>
<P> The two-day operation was carried out by a special intelligence unit of Peru's anti-terrorist police in the cities of Huancayo, Huanuco, Ica and the capital of Lima, police said. </P>
<P> Shining Path has suffered several setbacks following the September 1992 capture of its founder and ideological leader, Abimael Guzman. </P>
<P> In late 1993, Ramirez, known to his followers as Comrade Feliciano, emerged as the leader of a faction that rejected Guzman's calls from prison for a peace accord with Fujimori's government. Ramirez favors continued armed violence. </P>
<P> Authorities said Ramirez is still at large in a remote jungle area about 220 miles east of Lima. </P>
<P> Close to 30,000 people have died in guerrilla-related violence since Shining Path took up arms in May 1980. </P>
