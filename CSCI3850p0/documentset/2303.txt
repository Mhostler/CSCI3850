<P>  A Colorado hotel worker suspected of shooting 20 to 30 rounds into the White House Saturday recently disappeared telling his wife he was going out to buy things he needed for target practice, police said. </P>
<P> ``He disappeared September 30 and his wife filed a missing person report on October 1,'' said Sgt. Dean Kelsey, a spokesman for the sheriff's office in El Paso County, which encompasses the Colorado Springs area. </P>
<P> The suspect was identified as Francisco Martin Duran, 26, from Wide Field, Colorado, a suburb just south of Colorado Springs. </P>
<P> Kelsey said marital problems were not listed in the wife's report as a reason for Duran's disappearance. </P>
<P> ``It's ironic, when he was leaving he told his wife he was going to buy material he needed for target practice,'' Kelsey said, quoting the report. </P>
<P> Duran worked at the posh Broadmoor Hotel in Colorado Springs, Kelsey said. </P>
<P> Local television news showed Duran's modest house with red shutters and reported federal authorities were outside the house, waiting for someone to come home. </P>
<P> KCNC-TV in Denver quoted neighbors as saying Duran also had a four-year-old son. </P>
<P> John Hinckley, who shot and wounded former President Ronald Reagan in Washington in 1981, was from Evergreen, Colo., outside Denver. </P>
