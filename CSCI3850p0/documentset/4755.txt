<P>  Portugal has condemned Canada's ultimatum to Spanish and Portuguese fishermen to pull out of an area off Canada's east coast by Tuesday as a deplorable threat and a violation of international law. </P>
<P> The European Union and Canada are disputing rights to take Greenland halibut, also known as turbot, in international waters off Canada's east coast, and Ottawa said Monday it was prepared to act to save dwindling fish stocks. </P>
<P> Speaking Monday night on Portuguese RDP radio, monitored in London, Portugal's Maritime Affairs Minister Eduardo Azevedo Soares said Canada's attitude was unacceptable to EU members. </P>
<P> ``I feel this is a deplorable threat because Canada does not have sovereignty over the NAFO (Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization) area, where the Portuguese and Spanish fishermen are fishing,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``This is therefore a threat that places Canada outside respect for international law and the law of the seas.'' </P>
<P> ``This is a situation which has to be resolved in other ways and not with threats. The Portuguese government is following the situation very closely, very, very closely,'' he said. </P>
<P> Earlier Monday, EU foreign ministers condemned Canada's actions, saying a two-month ban proposed by Ottawa on fishing for Greenland halibut was unacceptable and seizure of ships would violate international law. </P>
<P> EU Fisheries Commissioner Emma Bonino said the EU would react firmly if Canada arrested EU vessels, but declined to give details. </P>
<P> Canada has a controversial law which allows it to stop any ships on the high seas, but up to now the law has been applied only to flag-of-convenience and stateless vessels. </P>
<P> Friday Canada changed its laws to allow its naval craft to board and seize Spanish and Portuguese boats, even if they fish outside Canada's 200-mile territorial limit. </P>
