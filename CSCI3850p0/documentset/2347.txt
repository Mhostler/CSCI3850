<P>  A major manhunt in Germany ended Tuesday with the surrender of the second of two escaped convicts who had led German police on a two-day chase of mayhem and robbery across the country. </P>
<P> Raymond Albert, a 32-year-old former East German army commando, gave up after eluding hundreds of hunters for a whole day in woodland near Driedorf, north of Frankfurt. </P>
<P> ``We can confirm that he has been detained. He gave himself up voluntarily,'' a Hesse state police spokesman said. </P>
<P> Albert's accomplice, Gerhard Polak, 35, who had been serving time for armed robbery, was captured earlier Tuesday in the woods around the holiday village of Heisterberg, his bag full of bank notes and carrying a hand grenade and gun. </P>
<P> At least 300 police, along with special GSG-9 commandos, armored cars, tracker dogs and helicopters had been been called in to search for the two men, who had led police on a whirlwind 620-mile chase through six German states. </P>
<P> The Hesse police spokesman told Reuters Albert had fired a shot into the air to bring attention to himself before surrendering. ``He wasn't aiming at anybody. It was a signal.'' </P>
<P> He added: ``Obviously, he was getting tired; he had been on the run for quite some time. I presume that with all the lights being set up, he realized his position was hopeless.'' </P>
<P> Police vans cruised through neighboring villages around midnight, assuring citizens they could sleep safely. </P>
<P> Earlier Tuesday, the convicts released the final batch of their hostages and then disappeared into the wooded slopes of the forest after one of them exchanged a flurry of gunfire with pursuing police. </P>
<P> Albert and Polak, a Swiss national who had escaped from jail once before in 1988, shook off pursuers Monday night after a chase which took them from Hesse in the west to Saxony, Brandenburg and Thuringia in the east and then back to Hesse. </P>
<P> The kidnappers had threatened to ``blow everything into the air'' unless police stopped following them. </P>
<P> The chase began Monday in Stuttgart, where the convicts kidnapped two police officers and used them as human shields to rob a bank in Fulda, in Hesse state, netting, according to German radio, some $170,000. </P>
