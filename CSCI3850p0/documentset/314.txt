<DATELINE>CAIRO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Israel and the PLO agreed at the end of talks in Cairo Wednesday that Palestinians would have control over education in the West Bank, officials said. </P>
<P> Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath said the Palestinian self-rule authority would ask U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to help resolve other disputes with Israel over self-rule when he visits Gaza on Thursday. </P>
<P> Shaath said he will meet Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, due to hold talks with Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres Thursday, and would ask Moussa to press Israel to activate delayed security arrangements in self-rule areas. </P>
<P> Moussa said Peres would discuss with President Hosni Mubarak the peace process, particularly the Palestinian-Israeli track. </P>
<P> Israeli chief negotiator Major-General Danny Rothschild said before he returned to Israel that Palestinians could decide how to run their education system. </P>
<P> ``It was a fruitful meeting ... Within the sphere of education they (Palestinians) are going to get control, to decide everything that needs to be decided on the educational sphere.'' </P>
<P> ``As far as education is concerned we made a good progress and there are very few problems left to be worked on next week, so we are taking them back home with us and the Palestinians are taking them back home with them and hopefully they will be able to conclude them next week,'' Rothschild added. </P>
<P> Shaath said: ``It was a very positive meeting this afternoon. We have accomplished most of the paper on education. So next time we will just spend about a few hours on it and we will go into health directly.'' </P>
<P> On Tuesday, Palestinians said Israeli negotiators were putting restrictions on control of education but Rothschild said the Palestinians would have full right to set up their own curricula without interference from Israel. </P>
<P> ``Nobody dares to think that the curricula will not be a Palestinian one. They will have to decide, they will have to change it and implement it in their area,'' he said. </P>
<P> Both sides are negotiating details of ``early empowerment'' in five areas -- education, health, tourism, taxation and social affairs -- for Palestinians in areas still under Israeli rule. </P>
<P> Palestinians began running their own affairs in Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho in May. Under PLO-Israeli interim peace agreements the rest of the West Bank will have limited autonomy in advance of Palestinian elections later this year. </P>
