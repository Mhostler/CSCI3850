<P>  A U.S. airman and his son who survived nine days lost in the freezing wilds of Turkey on a diet of snow were doing well at a military hospital Wednesday after a family reunion, a U.S. official said. </P>
<P> ``They had a comfortable night and are just relaxing today. They have minor frostbite on their toes and feet but nothing serious,'' a U.S. air force spokesman said. </P>
<P> The two were eating a normal diet again, he said. </P>
<P> Lt. Col. Mike Couillard, 37, and his son Matthew, 10, turned up alive Tuesday in the snow-swept mountains of northwest Turkey after getting lost in fog while skiing in Bolu province on Jan. </P>
<P> The two sheltered in a rock crevice before Couillard, trained in wilderness survival, left his son and went for help. He was discovered in a nearby mountain hut two days later by village wood-cutters who then rescued the boy. </P>
<P> A joint U.S.-Turkish military search operation was abandoned after a week on the presumption the two had died in sub-zero temperatures. </P>
<P> The officer was reunited with his wife Tuesday night in hospital at the U.S.-Turkish Incirlik air base in southern Turkey, a spokesman for the base told Reuters by telephone. </P>
