<P>  Former U.S. president George Bush advised Chileans on Wednesday not to be angered or discouraged by U.S. campaign rhetoric against bringing Chile into NAFTA as scheduled by the middle of next year. </P>
<P> Bush told an audience of top Chilean businessmen and politicians that ``empty cannons of rhetoric'' were bound to be aimed at Chile and its prospects for joining the North American Free Trade Agreement as the 1996 campaign heats up. </P>
<P> ``You are going to hear a lot of heated campaign rhetoric, especially on trade, and it's going to start right about now,'' Bush said. ``The loudest voices are going to be on the extremes -- on the left and on the right, some in the Democratic Party and some in my own party, and from one nutty independent up in Texas,'' he said, alluding to billionaire Ross Perot. </P>
<P> ``I hope you don't get overly concerned about this rhetoric because these people are appealing to a selfish streak in the American people,'' said Bush, who called himself ``the father of NAFTA'' when he arrived in Chile on Monday. ``Do not be discouraged by the shrill cries of those calling for America to retreat to fortress America,'' he said. </P>
<P> Bush, on a private visit that was to end Wednesday night, met businessmen and played golf at a posh Santiago country club. He gave his talk at the invitation of VTR, a Chilean telephone company that was staging a conference. </P>
<P> He later met with President Eduardo Frei, whose government is due to begin talks this month aimed at making Chile the fourth partner in NAFTA, which is phasing out trade barriers among current members Mexico, Canada and the United States. </P>
<P> U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said Wednesday the United States hoped to wrap up talks on bringing Chile into NAFTA by the end of this year -- a sign the Clinton administration sees Chile's entrance on track. </P>
<P> Under a timetable announced by Clinton in December, Chile is due to join NAFTA by mid-1996. With 13 million people, it will be the group's smallest member and will bring to it a fast-growing, export-driven economy. </P>
<P> Chile's Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat said technical negotiations between Chile and the current NAFTA members will start by the end of the month and Chile expected high-level talks involving Kantor, Aninat and their Canadian and Mexican counterparts to begin in late May. </P>
