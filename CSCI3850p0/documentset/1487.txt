<P>  Former President Jimmy Carter said Monday that the image of Haiti's de facto president Emile Jonassaint as a puppet of the military leaders was ``absolutely incorrect.'' </P>
<P> Carter, who led a team of U.S. negotiators that won a promise Sunday from the Haitian military junta to step down by October 15, said Jonassaint was the one who spurred the military leaders to agree to the deal. </P>
<P> Carter told reporters that negotiations had almost broken down between his team, which also included Democratic Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia and retired General Colin Powell, and the Haitian military leaders Lieutenant General Raoul Cedras and army chief of staff Brigadier General Phillippe Biamby. </P>
<P> Then the group decided to go over to Jonassaint's office, Carter said, recalling the scene at a Monday press conference. </P>
<P> ``President Jonassaint, we have been led to believe, and I believed it ahead of time, was a figurehead. This proved to be absolutely incorrect,'' Carter said. </P>
<P> ``When we got to President Jonassaint's office with his ministers sitting in front of him, and his commanders of the military in front of him ... he said, 'we will take peace instead of war. I will sign this agreement,''' Carter said. </P>
<P> ``All of his people in the room disagreed,'' Carter continued. ``But there was no doubt it was his decision that brought about consummation of the agreement.'' </P>
<P> Jonassaint was made president last May, installed by the Haitian military leaders who had overthrown the democratically-elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide. </P>
