<DATELINE>ATLANTA (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  An Atlanta man is suing a used car dealer and the credit data firm Equifax Credit Information Services Inc because of a racial epithet that appeared on his credit statement. </P>
<P> The plaintiff, a security guard named George West, says that when he asked for a copy of his credit report in May 1993, he found the word ``nigger'' listed as his former employment. </P>
<P> West says he has been injured by the epithet and is suing Equifax, car dealer Monster Motors Inc and employees of both companies for $2 million in actual damages and $25 million in punitive damages and legal fees. </P>
<P> Equifax blamed the incident on the car dealer, accusing Monster Motors of violating its procedures. </P>
<P> ``Once we found out about the unauthorized entry, we immediately deleted it from the file,'' a company statement was quoted as saying by Saturday's Atlanta Journal-Constitution. </P>
<P> ``We also conducted a thorough investigation, sent out new copies of his report to the few businesses that may have received a report with the unauthorized entry, apologized to Mr West in person and in writing.'' </P>
<P> The newspaper said a phone call to Monster Motors went unanswered. </P>
