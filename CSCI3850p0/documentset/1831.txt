<DATELINE>ST PETERSBURG, Russia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Thieves have stolen two gold-plated candelabra from the Usupovsky Palace in central St Peterburg, where mystic monk Grigory Rasputin was stabbed and poisoned. </P>
<P> Palace director Grigory Svesnikova told Reuters thieves had entered the palace at night, apparently with a key, and got away with the 19th-century treasures which have a market value of more than $10,000. </P>
<P> Museums and palaces in Russia's former imperial capital have been the target of thieves in a general breakdown of law and order since the collapse of the Soviet Union. But it is the first time in 25 years the sumptuous mansion-turned museum has been victimized. </P>
<P> One of the most luxurious dwellings in Russia's architectural capital, Usupovsky Palace was where aristocrats poisoned and stabbed Rasputin, mystic adviser to the last Czar Nicholas II. </P>
<P> Rasputin was later drowned outside the Baroque mansion in an icy canal. </P>
<P> Svesnikova said the former residence of the wealthy merchant family Usupov is open for private tours but that corridors containing hundreds of gold art works have no security system. </P>
<P> She said the theft was discovered Tuesday but had probably occurred earlier. Police have no suspects. </P>
