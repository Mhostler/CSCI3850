<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuters) -</DATELINE>
<P>  While House Republicans celebrated passage of their ``Contract With America,'' a poll released Thursday indicated a majority of Americans have mixed feelings about the initiative, and most have never even heard of it. </P>
<P> A New York Times/CBS News poll of 1,089 adults found only 38 percent had read or heard anything about the ``Contract With America,'' which was pushed through the House in less than 100 days. </P>
<P> Of those polled, 47 percent said they were ``mostly disappointed'' with the first 100 days of the 104th Congress, compared with 39 percent who said they were pleased. </P>
<P> Sixty-one percent said the rich would benefit most from the Republican legislative agenda; only 25 percent said they thought the Republican plans would improve their own lives. </P>
<P> Fifty-one percent said President Clinton cared more about the needs and problems of the middle class, while 34 percent said Republicans cared more for the average American. </P>
<P> The poll was conducted before Wednesday night's passage in the House of the contract's ``crown jewel,'' a $189 billion tax-cut plan. </P>
<P> The majority of those surveyed before the vote, 78 percent said they liked the idea of a $500 per-child tax credit contained in the plan, but 80 percent said it should be limited to families earning less than $95,000 a year instead of the GOP's proposed ceiling of $200,000. </P>
<P> As in previous surveys, the majority of those polled said that given a choice, they would prefer to have lawmakers balance the budget rather than cut taxes. </P>
<P> Despite the less-than-enthusiastic support for efforts in the Republican-controlled Congress, the majority of those polled said Republicans have better ideas than Democrats about restructuring welfare. Most of those surveyed also believed the Republican Congress, not President Clinton, would set the course for the country in the coming years. </P>
<P> The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points. </P>
