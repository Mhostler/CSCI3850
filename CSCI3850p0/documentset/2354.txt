<P>  Danish police and U.S. federal agents impounded 190 Harley-Davidson motorcycles believed to have been stolen and arrested two motorbike dealers in a nationwide raid, police said Wednesday. </P>
<P> Police said they believed most of the classic American Harley-Davidson motorcycles seized all over Denmark Tuesday had been illegally imported with false frame numbers. </P>
<P> Some $5 million worth of motorcycles were taken after a detailed investigation of police records of the 2,400 Harley-Davidson machines known to be owned by Danes, Copenhagen police robbery section chief Kurt Olsen said. </P>
<P> The police raids, concentrating on Danish motorcycle gangs, were carried out with the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is currently conducting an international search for stolen Harley-Davidson motorcycles. </P>
<P> ``There are signs that organized criminals are at work, professionally falsifying frame numbers and selling stolen machines on an extensive international scale,'' Olsen said. </P>
<P> Four Danish Harley-Davidson dealers were detained in the police swoop. Two were released after questioning while the other two were remanded in custody under suspicion of selling stolen goods and fraud. </P>
