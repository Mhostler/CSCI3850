<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Kim Jong-il will soon be officially confirmed as North Korea's leader despite earlier rumors of illness and of a power struggle in the Stalinist nation, analysts say. </P>
<P> They point to the publication of a treatise by him and to several recent reported public appearances by Kim, who spent several months out of the limelight after the death of his father President Kim Il-sung on July 8. </P>
<P> Kim, long designated as his father's successor, wrote an article entitled ``Socialism is Science,'' which was published by the ruling party daily Rodong Sinmun on Nov. 1. </P>
<P> ``Although socialism has suffered a setback in some countries, it still remains alive in the hearts of the people as a science,'' he wrote. </P>
<P> ``Though socialism has gone through temporarily painful turns and twists owing to opportunism, it is sure to revive and win in the end for its scientific accuracy and truth.'' </P>
<P> An analyst at South Korea's Unification Ministry said the treatise was the first of its kind published in the North since Kim Il-sung's death. </P>
<P> ``In this context, the treatise itself is very meaningful and this can be interpreted as evidence that Kim Jong-il will soon be officially confirmed as Kim Il-sung's successor,'' said the analyst, who declined to be identified. </P>
<P> Nozomu Akizuki of Meijigakuin University in Tokyo said he believed the article was the final proof that Kim Jong-il was already head of North Korea in all but name. </P>
<P> Another analyst in Tokyo said the article indicated no change from the policies of Kim Il-sung, leader for almost five decades of the world's last Stalinist state. </P>
<P> Rodong Sinmun, in an editorial published Saturday, urged North Koreans to study Kim's treatise thoroughly. </P>
<P> The editorial, monitored by the South's official Naewae Press, said people should be ``armed with'' the contents of the treatise and make them their ``bones and flesh.'' </P>
<P> Kim, 52, made his first public appearance since his father's funeral at a televised memorial service Oct. 16. </P>
<P> He reportedly appeared again Oct. 31, visiting a newly renovated tomb dedicated to Tangun -- mythical founder of Korea -- where analysts say Kim Il-sung may be buried. </P>
<P> Yu Suk-ryul, fellow at the Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security, said Kim also held meetings across North Korea to thank people for mourning his father. </P>
<P> ``Such meetings will be used to show public support for Kim Jong-il and to promote him as the nation's undisputed leader,'' Yu said. </P>
<P> Kim reportedly made another appearance two days later when he inspected a bridge spanning the Taedong River in Pyongyang. </P>
<P> He has been considered the North's de facto leader since his father's death but has yet to be officially named to the key posts his father held -- state president and communist party chief. </P>
<P> South Korean scholars lecturing at U.S. universities told a seminar held in Seoul over the past two days that Kim Jong-il's regime would remain stable for the time being. </P>
<P> The Joong-ang Daily News quoted professor Lee Jong-sik as telling the seminar, ``There will be no change in Kim Jong-il's unique ruling system for a fairly long period of time because there is no possibility that organized movements of protest could emerge in the North.'' </P>
