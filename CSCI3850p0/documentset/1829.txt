<DATELINE>SANTA ANA, Calif (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A judge dismissed an arson charge Wednesday against a Mexican immigrant accused of starting one of southern California's most devastating brush fires last year, finding that the defendant had been in prison at the time. </P>
<P> Jose Soto Martinez, 26, had confessed to starting the blaze in Laguna Beach, south of Los Angeles, which destroyed 366 homes and businesses at a cost of $528 million, after his arrest in September for setting three smaller fires. </P>
<P> Prosecutors say Martinez took them to the point of origin for the 14,000-acre fire and described trying to summon up a demon king called ``Gotam.'' </P>
<P> But defense lawyers and family members said Martinez, who apparently has a history of mental instability, was in a prison in Mazatlan, Mexico, under an assumed name when the fire erupted. </P>
<P> Deputy District Attorney Michael Fell said his office was able to confirm the alibi with Mexican prison officials and guards and Martinez' former cellmates. </P>
<P> ``Based on the information we acquired, the district attorney's office feels the only fair thing to do, the only just thing to do, is dismiss the charge,'' he said. </P>
<P> But the prosecutor defended the decision to charge Martinez in the first place, saying that only investigators and the arsonist should know the origin of the fire. </P>
<P> ``At no time from September 16th until now ... did the defendant ever deny admission of that fire,'' Fell said. ``He never said he had an alibi. The defendant never said he was in a Mexican prison or that he had family in the United States.'' </P>
