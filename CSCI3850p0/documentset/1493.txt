<P>  Dante Caputo, the chief U.N. envoy for Haiti, resigned his post, the United Nations announced late Monday. </P>
<P> No reason was given for the resignation, but Caputo apparently opposed the U.S. military intervention in the Caribbean nation. </P>
<P> Caputo, a former Argentine foreign minister, negotiated the 1993 Governors Island agreement between exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and Haiti's military strongman Raoul Cedras. The military ignored the agreement shortly afterwards. </P>
<P> Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said in a statement that he received the resignation ``with deep regret'' and expressed thanks ``for the courage and devotion which he lent to the discharge of his duties.'' </P>
