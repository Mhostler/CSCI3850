<DATELINE>GOMA, Zaire (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Zairean troops killed another civilian Saturday in this already tense border town flooded with Rwandan refugees, U.N. officials said. </P>
<P> The victim was apparently a local money changer, said U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) spokesman Panos Moumtzis. </P>
<P> Goma police were not available for comment. </P>
<P> The killing of a resident in similar circumstances Thursday triggered street demonstrations. </P>
<P> In the Zairean capital of Kinshasa, incoming Prime Minister Kengo Wa Dondo said the government would withdraw the 500 paratroopers sent to Goma and Bukavu, 60 miles to the south, last month, the start of the Rwandan refugee crisis. </P>
<P> The prime minister, speaking on television Friday night, set no date for the replacement. A military inspector was expected in Goma soon to review the situation, government officials said. </P>
<P> Troops fired in the air Thursday to disperse about 1,000 protesters who had scattered rocks on the streets to stop traffic and erected barricades with burning tires. </P>
<P> There were no reports of injuries. </P>
<P> Last week, a group of Rwandan refugees slashed to death a Zairean soldier accused of demanding bribes at Katale camp. </P>
<P> Zairean soldiers are badly paid and many have resorted to looting in Goma since the influx of about one million refugees from Rwanda in mid-July. They also often ask journalists for money. </P>
<P> Tension has been running high in Goma and the aid effort to help refugees has led to thefts and hold-ups. </P>
