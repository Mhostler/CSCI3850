<P>  A teacher whose seven-year-old pupils helped her identify a 2,000-year-old Egyptian relief sold the stone slab for $183,300 at an auction Thursday. </P>
<P> The teacher and her husband had used the relief as a garden decoration, standing geranium pots on it. </P>
<P> ``It was only when my wife was doing a school project on hieroglyphics with her class that we began to look more closely at the stone, which is covered with a variety of different symbols and figures,'' said the husband who declined to be named. </P>
<P> ``The group of seven-year-olds came to the house to take rubbings of the markings and were able to identify a few of them from library books,'' he said. The British Museum was then able to pinpoint the stone as an 1875 BC relief. </P>
