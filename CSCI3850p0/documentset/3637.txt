<DATELINE>GROZNY, Russia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Columns of Russian troops backed by heavy artillery closed in on the presidential palace in the capital of separatist Chechnya Sunday, but rebel fighters appeared to be clinging on to their positions. </P>
<P> Russian television said the troops, approaching the blackened palace from the north and southwest, were suffering heavy losses. </P>
<P> Fierce Russian attacks at the bridge over the Sunzha River stopped reporters three blocks away from the presidential palace, symbol of resistance to Moscow since Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev unilaterally declared independence in 1991. </P>
<P> ``Nothing's changed really,'' said Said Umarov, a 20-year-old soldier leaving the central square in the early afternoon. </P>
<P> ``Russian troops are about 800 meters (1/2 mile) from the palace in a suburb just north of the center -- and around the railway station,'' Umarov added. </P>
<P> Itar-Tass news agency quoted Russia's government press center as saying Dudayev had left Grozny two days previously. </P>
<P> No one at the government press center was available to confirm it had issued the report of Dudayev's flight. The center's bulletins have regularly contradicted both Chechen and independent eyewitness reports of events in Chechnya. </P>
<P> Russia's independent NTV television said much of the fighting centered on Grozny's main market, south of the palace. </P>
<P> It said troops moving from the southern outskirts were within 600 yards of the palace, and a group to the north was within 800 yards. It said the palace was coming under heavy artillery fire. </P>
<P> ``A semi-circle is being drawn around the city,'' the television said, quoting its correspondent in Grozny. ``The Russian command says the troops have suffered heavy losses.'' </P>
<P> The television said Russian troops had tried unsuccessfully to capture the palace three times during the night, and tanks had taken up positions in the morning not far from the building. Pictures from the city showed numerous explosions and buildings ablaze. </P>
<P> Interfax news agency said the Chechens had stopped a Russian advance and quoted Chechen commanders as saying more than 10 Russian tanks had been destroyed. </P>
<P> It also said Chechen fighters had captured a unit of Russian paratroopers 18 miles southwest of Grozny and Russian commanders were threatening to bomb the area unless they were released. </P>
<P> Grozny's main thoroughfare Avturkhanova Avenue, normally teeming with groups of soldiers, was almost deserted by midday, as were parallel streets and alleyways. </P>
<P> The injured were being transported from the center, some in private cars and others in armored personnel carriers captured from Russia and now flying the green, red and white Chechen flag. One dead soldier lay in an armored personnel carrier. </P>
<P> Several soldiers reported Russian troops had attacked in force Saturday from the train station, about one mile south of the palace. The attack was repulsed, they said. </P>
<P> Russian troops apparently changed tactics in Grozny during the weekend after suffering heavy losses in a New Year's Eve tank-led drive on the city. </P>
<P> Movladi Udugov, head of the Chechen national information service, told Russian television Kremlin forces had abandoned the ploy of trying to take Grozny with tanks and were instead destroying the city block by block. </P>
<P> In Moscow, a Russian Defense Ministry spokesman confirmed fighting was continuing. </P>
<P> ``Federal troops are holding steady in Grozny and are cleansing the railway station...of Dudayev's gunmen,'' the spokesman told Itar-Tass. </P>
<P> Tass also said Dudayev and his personal guard had left Grozny for the settlement of Galanchezh. </P>
<P> But, quoting the government press center, it acknowledged that ``although illegal bands are flowing out of Grozny, Dudayev's fighters still control several districts of the city.'' </P>
<P> Interfax reported that Sergei Kovalyov, Russia's human rights commissioner, had flown back to Chechnya after a brief visit to Moscow to plead in vain for Russia to make a truce. </P>
<P> Kovalyov believes Russian democracy is in danger now conservative military bosses are in the ascendant. </P>
<P> Also in Moscow, about 1,500 Communists staged a noisy rally against Russia's military actions. Liberals have also denounced the campaign, leaving ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky as the only major parliamentary leader backing Yeltsin's campaign. </P>
