<DATELINE>BOSTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Massachusetts Democrat Senator Edward Kennedy, who two days ago attacked his Republican opponent in the Senate race over his Mormon religion, appears now to be backing off these earlier remarks after a barrage of press criticism. </P>
<P> ``I believe that religion should not be an issue in this campaign,'' Kennedy said in a statement late Wednesday. ``The way to make that so is to stop talking about it and to focus on issues like jobs and health care, which is exactly what I intend to do.'' </P>
<P> Kennedy's conciliatory statement came after both of Boston's main newspapers blasted him for telling reporters Monday that Mitt Romney, a multimillionaire and former Mormon leader, should be questioned about his church's policy of excluding blacks from the priesthood prior to 1978. </P>
<P> Romney responded by assailing Kennedy for betraying the stance of his brother John F. Kennedy against religious prejudice, articulated in a 1960 speech before he became America's first Roman Catholic president. </P>
<P> ``I do not speak for my church on public matters, and the church does not speak for me,'' John F. Kennedy said in a famous speech during the 1960 campaign. </P>
<P> Since a primary last week Tuesday, in which Romney, 47, easily won the Republican nomination to challenge the six-term incumbent for his Massachusetts Senate seat, Kennedy has launched an advertising campaign on television, attacking Romney over his business record as a venture capitalist. </P>
<P> While the latest polls show the negative campaign may be beginning to swing the neck-and-neck race in Kennedy's favor, his attacks on Romney have won him few friends in the local press. </P>
<P> ``The tough U.S. Senate race is taking its toll on Senator Edward Kennedy's usually savvy political judgment,'' the Boston Globe said in an editorial. ``He hurts himself and discredits his family history by challenging his opponent, Mitt Romney, on religious issues.''  The Boston Herald described the Kennedy camp's campaign tactics as a ``descent into sleaze.'' </P>
<P> ``The Mormon faith isn't relevant to this campaign any more than Catholicism counted in the 1960 presidential race of Ted Kennedy's older brother,'' the Herald said. </P>
<P> Even by the tough standards of Massachusetts politics, Kennedy's race against the political novice and previously unknown Romney has degenerated into a rough and tumble battle. </P>
<P> In previous elections, Kennedy, who has held his Senate seat since he was first elected in 1962, has barely had to fight for re-election. Boston's big Irish community and the power of the Kennedy name gave him a virtual lock on local politics. He was able to remain aloof to some of the seedier tactics employed by others. </P>
<P> But this time, political analysts say Kennedy, 62, is showing signs of strain against the more youthful and telegenic Romney, who already has spent some $2 million in television campaigns blaming Kennedy for failed policies. </P>
<P> Some local commentators, who view the Kennedys as a media-feeding industry, already have begun to contemplate life if the senior senator from Massachusetts loses his bid for re-election in November. </P>
<P> ``You go outside the state and whom do people ask you about? Ted Kennedy. And after all these years as Captain Ahab to Ted's Great White Whale, it could all be...coming...to...an...end,'' wrote Howie Carr, a Boston Herald columnist and local radio commentator. </P>
