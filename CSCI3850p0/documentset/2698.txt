<P>  Russian Ambassador Sergei Lavrov said Friday he proposed a Security Council resolution on U.N. safe areas in Bosnia that would condemn cross-border fire in Bihac by rebel Serbs in Croatia and ask the United Nations to update its concept of such areas. </P>
<P> Lavrov spoke to reporters after the council met in private consultations and was briefed by U.N. officials on the latest fighting around the northwestern area of Bihac, where Serb aircraft attacked the city, a U.N.-designated safe area. </P>
<P> The Serb jets came from Ubdina airport, held by rebel Serbs in Krajina area of Croatia, and a U.S. official said Croatia had given permission for NATO jets to fly over its territory. Military experts in New York said they believed the Serb planes had missed their target. </P>
<P> Some envoys said the Russian draft might be amended to include other provisions. These would make clear that air power could be used against aircraft attacking Bosnia in the future, wherever they came from, such as in Croatia. </P>
<P> The problem then would be whether NATO wanted to take the risk of going into Croatia because of lack of ground defenses and no clear legal authority from NATO bodies, they said. </P>
<P> The council, which meets nearly every day on Bosnia and other issues, will have a closed session again later Friday and may meet again over the weekend. </P>
<P> Yasushi Akashi, the civilian head of the U.N. operation in the Balkans, was at U.N. headquarters in New York Friday but it was not known yet if he would brief members. </P>
<P> However, Lavrov as well as U.S. officials emphasized that any decision on air attacks as well as weapons exclusion zones are determined by the U.N. Protection Force in the Balkans and NATO and not by the Security Council. </P>
<P> The Russian draft asks U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to ``update his recommendations on modalities of the implementation of the concept of safe areas'' in cooperation with all warring parties in an effort to ``put an end to all offensives'' in these areas. </P>
<P> It also condemns violations across the Croatian-Bosnian borders and ``demands that all parties and others concerned and in particular the so-called Krajina Serb forces, fully respect the border.'' </P>
