<P>  An appeals court Friday upheld a Cincinnati bylaw that says homosexuals may not be given anti-discrimination protection. </P>
<P> Civil rights advocates criticized the ruling and said they would appeal. </P>
<P> The amendment to the Cincinnati charter, approved by voters in 1993, invalidated a city law prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation. Specifically, the charter amendment prohibited granting ``special class status ... based upon sexual orientation, conduct or relationships.'' </P>
<P> The amendment ``infringes no constitutionally protected right and may stand as enacted,'' the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit said, reversing a lower court ruling. </P>
<P> The American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio called the new decision wrong and said it will appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. </P>
<P> ``It's a very sad day when the Most Livable City in America (a designation recently awarded to Cincinnati) carves out one group of citizens for special discriminatory treatment,'' the ACLU said in a news release. </P>
<P> In a telephone interview, ACLU of Ohio executive director Chris Link said the ruling will be appealed, adding he hoped the Supreme Court would consolidate it with a similar case out of Colorado that addresses constitutional rights of homosexuals. </P>
<P> Civil rights lawyers representing five individuals and two organizations challenged the charter amendment. They said it infringes on constitutional rights of groups to petition their government and said that homosexuals comprise a group entitled to certain protections under the law. </P>
<P> The lower court had agreed with both elements. </P>
<P> But the Appeals Court said the amendment did not interfere with the right of any individual to vote or lobby city council on issues of interest. </P>
<P> ``The only effect of the amendment upon Cincinnati citizens was to render futile the lobbying of council for preferential enactments for homosexuals,'' the court said. </P>
<P> Also, it said, homosexuals do not comprise an identifiable group entitled to special protection because homosexuals are generally not identifiable unless they choose to be. </P>
