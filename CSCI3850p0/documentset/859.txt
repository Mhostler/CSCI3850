<P>  Italian Labor Minister Clemente Mastella, who provoked outrage last week when he linked Jewish financiers to the decline in the lira's value, Thursday made his peace with Rome's chief rabbi. </P>
<P> ``In a long and friendly conversation, Labor Minister Mastella ... clarified the sense of the words which when distorted provoked an unjustified row,'' the ministry said in a statement. </P>
<P> Rabbi Elio Toaff accepted the explanation but voiced fears over a revival of anti-Semitism in Italy, the statement added. </P>
<P> Italian Jews labeled the government anti-Semitic after the media reported Mastella as saying New York Jewish financiers opposed to the presence of the neo-fascist-led National Alliance in government were helping to undermine the currency. </P>
<P> A member of the small Christian Democratic Center, Mastella apologized for his comments and said he had only sought to calm international fears about Italy's right wing. </P>
<P> Toaff told Mastella he saw signs of growing hostility toward members of Italy's 40,000-strong Jewish community. </P>
<P> ``There are signs of a revival of anti-Semitism which should be contained and countered swiftly,'' Toaff was quoted as saying. </P>
<P> Earlier this week three youths slashed a Jewish woman's face in a racist attack in the central Italian town of Assisi. </P>
<P> Mastella said he planned to discuss anti-Semitism with cabinet colleagues and that he would meet leaders of Italy's Jewish community next week. </P>
