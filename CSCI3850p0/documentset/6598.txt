<P>  People living in Switzerland, the Netherlands and Finland stand a better chance of surviving certain types of cancer than other Europeans, Europe's first cancer survival league table showed. </P>
<P> For cancers of the breast, large bowel and stomach, where early diagnosis is a major determinant of survival, the study published Tuesday by the European Union-funded body Eurocare discovered substantial differences. </P>
<P> But where cancers responded well to drug treatment, as in the case of testicular cancer and Hodgkin's disease, survival rates were uniformly high, it said. </P>
<P> Overall, cancer patients in Poland and Estonia fared the worst among the 800,000 from 11 European countries studied. </P>
<P> In western Europe, Britain also tended to have a low ranking with only eight to nine percent of its stomach cancer patients living for five years after diagnosis, against 23 percent in Switzerland. </P>
<P> Eurocare project coordinator Franco Berrino of Italy's Instituto Nazionale Tumori said the performance of the leaders in the table suggested the rest could do more. </P>
<P> ``Surely, the fact that these three countries (Switzerland, the Netherlands and Finland) are in a better position indicates that is room for improvement in the others,'' he told a news conference. </P>
<P> Possible reasons for the differences between countries could be earlier diagnosis, better treatment or possible variations in tumor types. </P>
<P> Patients studied were diagnosed between 1978 and 1985, and followed up to the end of 1990 to give five-year survival rates. </P>
<P> In many major cancers, trends were clearly improving with breast cancer, for example, registering a two percent improvement between 1978-80 and 1983-85 across Europe. </P>
<P> Up to three out of four women now survive the disease, although it remains easily the biggest female cancer killer. </P>
<P> Overall cancer survival rates were higher among women than men, reflecting above average recovery prospects for breast and some other female cancers. </P>
<P> A total of 27 different cancers were monitored. Survival rates varied widely according to tumor site, reflecting the differing treatment prospects for different cancer types. </P>
<P> European men suffering testicular cancer had the best chance of surviving five years or more, at 84 percent. Those with pancreatic cancer had a survival chance of just three percent. </P>
