<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Republican senators Wednesday criticized the terms of a U.S. agreement with North Korea that ended a dispute over Pyongyang's nuclear program. </P>
<P> In a letter to President Clinton, four Republicans, including two members of the Foreign Relations Committee, called the accord unacceptable and charged that concessions made by Washington reversed long-standing U.S. policy. </P>
<P> The letter, sent by Foreign Relations Committee members Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Frank Murkowski of Alaska, along with Alfonse D'Amato of New York and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, was released following similar critical statements by Republican Leader Bob Dole and John McCain of Arizona. </P>
<P> Dole said the agreement under which North Korea will get new nuclear reactors and the United States promised to open a liaison office in Pyongyang ``shows it is always possible to get an agreement when you give enough away.'' </P>
<P> He said Congress should closely examine the agreement when it returns. </P>
<P> The letter to Clinton said the policy reversals came in concessions that allowed spent nuclear fuel rods to remain for years in North Korea and delay for years special inspections of two suspect nuclear sites. </P>
<P> It said none of the U.S. goals in North Korea -- including making it free of nuclear weapons and ending state-sponsored terrorism -- had been secured on acceptable terms in the agreement. </P>
<P> ``All it does is paper over the crisis and delay its resolution,'' the senators said. ``Worse, it will secure Kim Jong-il's rule, just as he is trying to consolidate his power.'' </P>
<P> The senators urged Clinton to reconsider the agreement and send the negotiators back to the table. </P>
<P> Under the U.S.-North Korea framework deal reached late Monday and due to be formally signed Friday, North Korea will freeze its current graphite nuclear building program and close its one existing experimental reactor. </P>
<P> In return, Washington is to form an international consortium, including South Korea and Japan, to provide Pyongyang with light-water reactors, which produce very little of the plutonium it has been accused of diverting to make nuclear arms. </P>
