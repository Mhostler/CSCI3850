<P>  Japanese writer Kenzaburo Oe said Thursday he had won the Nobel Prize for literature partly thanks to the achievements of fellow Japanese writers. </P>
<P> ``I won the prize thanks to the accomplishments of modern Japanese literature. I think I got it because I am still young and living,'' he told television from outside his home in Tokyo. </P>
<P> He said other modern Japanese writers deserved the prize but had died too early. </P>
<P> ``I think the level of Japanese literature is high,'' he said. ``If Kobo Abe had been living he would have won. If Shohei Ooka had won that would have been good.'' </P>
<P> Oe, 59, won $950,000 prize for ``creating an imagined world where life and myth condense to form a disconcerting picture of the human predicament,'' the Swedish Academy said. </P>
<P> As a young man Oe read widely in French and English, particularly the works of Jean-Paul Sartre whose novels were the subject of his graduation thesis at Tokyo University. </P>
<P> His early works showed a somber and occasionally grotesque poetic imagination, but he later became involved with social and political questions and the cultural dislocation of post-war Japan. </P>
<P> At 23 he won the prestiguous Akutagawa prize for a short story, ``The Catch,'' about a black U.S. serviceman who lands in a Japanese village, is captured by its people and takes a young boy hostage as he tries to escape. </P>
<P> Like other Japanese writers of his generation Oe was strongly influenced by World War II, the atom bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the subsequent occupation of Japan by U.S. forces. </P>
<P> He has remained concerned by the threat of nuclear weapons. He worked in the peace movement and became spokesman for Japan's left-wing intellectuals in the 1960s, when he joined the campaign against the United States-Japan security treaty. </P>
<P> Oe has described his writing as a way of exorcising Japan's past. </P>
<P> One event that left a mark on his work was the birth in 1963 of a son with severe brain damage. The novel he wrote about this, ``A Personal Matter'' demonstrated a new affirmation of life and a will to rise above despair. </P>
<P> ``The Silent Cry,'' published in 1967, describes two brothers returning to a village in a forest. It symbolizes a spiritual pilgrimage back to his youth and to a Japan which has been lost in the course of wrenching social change. </P>
<P> Oe is now writing a three-volume novel called ``Burning Green Tree,'' his first for seven years. He has said the book, which concerns his 36-year life as a writer, will be his last, according to televsion reports. </P>
<P> He is Japan's second winner of the Nobel Prize for literature after Yasunari Kawabata, who won it in 1968. </P>
<P> ``Oe is very representative of modern Japanese literature,'' said Shoji Okochi, a professor at Musashino Women's University. </P>
<P> ``His work is easy to translate so it should be easier than Kawabata for an international audience to understand.'' </P>
