<P>  A second 13-year-old schoolboy hanged himself in a central Japanese town Tuesday in an area already involved in controversy about a similar bullying-suicide, police said. </P>
<P> The boy's body was found on the same day that Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama held a special Cabinet meeting to discuss the first death and Japan's Education Ministry urged teachers to crack down on schoolyard bullying. </P>
<P> The second boy left no note explaining his death but raised fears that there might be a wave of copycat suicides. </P>
<P> Police said the body of the second boy, who was not named, was found at a workshop belonging to his father. He hanged himself from a ceiling beam. </P>
<P> The latest young suicide lived in the town of Okazaki, next to the town of Nishio, where 13-year-old Kiyoteru Okochi hanged himself last month, leaving a note saying several classmates bullied him into stealing money from his family. </P>
<P> The note said that over a year the bullies extorted $10,000 from him, dunking him in a nearby river if he refused to pay. </P>
<P> The boy's poignant suicide note said, ''I just can't find any money to take to them today. What's the use of continuing to live like this?'' </P>
<P> A major newspaper reported last week at least 10 schoolboys had taken their lives because of bullying so far this year. </P>
<P> The suicides have put all aspects of Japan's strictly disciplined school system under the microscope and the latest death is certain to add new urgency to a search for solutions. </P>
<P> In other recent signs of strains in Japan's school system, a teacher was suspended for hitting a pupil in the head every day for six months because he was inattentive, and a schoolboy playing truant died in a car accident while being pursued by a teacher in another car. </P>
<P> A government spokesman said that at Tuesday's cabinet meeting, Murayama said parents, teachers and students all had a responsibility to stamp out bullying. </P>
<P> Education Minister Kaoru Yosano said potential victims of bullying must be identified early so they could get counselling to help them head off attacks by classmates. </P>
<P> In the report it issued Tuesday, the Education Ministry announced an emergency survey of teachers and headmasters to gauge the extent of schoolyard bullying. </P>
<P> The most up-to-date figures -- for 1992 -- showed there were a total of 23,258 cases of bullying reported by 7,305 schools. This was an increase on the 22,062 bullying cases reported by 7,172 schools in 1991. </P>
<P> But researchers and teachers say official statistics do not accurately reflect the extent of bullying because the figures are provided by headmasters, who may want to hide shortcomings in the way they run their schools. </P>
<P> The report also urged teachers to solve problems of stress caused by competition among students to pass university entrance examinations, and the refusal by some students to attend classes. </P>
<P> It said an increasing number of students dislike school, mainly due to harsh judgements of their academic performance. Only 14 percent of 17-year old high school students for example, said they were satisfied with school life. </P>
<P> The report was based on a survey in March of some 10,000 primary, junior high and senior high school students, of whom 91 percent responded. </P>
