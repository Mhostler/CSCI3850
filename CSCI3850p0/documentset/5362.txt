<P>  Bolivia extradited a retired Army colonel to the United States to face cocaine trafficking charges in Miami, the Justice Department said on Friday. </P>
<P> Faustino Rico Toro, 57, who briefly headed Bolivia's anti-drugs force in 1991, has been accused of conspiring to smuggle half a ton of cocaine to the United States in the early 1990s. </P>
<P> Rico Toro, a Bolivian citizen who headed military intelligence in the 1980s, has denied the charges. He has been in jail since his arrest a year ago. </P>
<P> Justice Department officials said he was put aboard a U.S. government plane on Friday and that he will stand trial in federal court in Miami. </P>
<P> They said it marked the first extradition from Bolivia to the United States in nearly three years. </P>
<P> Bolivia's Supreme Court in February approved the extradition. After the ruling the State Department warned Americans in Bolivia of a ``heightened danger'' of violence against them. </P>
<P> Attorney General Janet Reno hailed the extradition and said she hoped the case ``will serve as a precedent for future successes'' in the extradition of fugitives between the two nations. </P>
