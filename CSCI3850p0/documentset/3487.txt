<DATELINE>SEATTLE (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Seattle Seahawks Thursday fired head coach and general manager Tom Flores and his entire coaching staff. </P>
<P> The Seahawks finished in last place in the AFC Western Division this season with a 6-10 record. </P>
<P> Seattle was 14-34 in three years under Flores, who originally joined the team as president and general manager in Feb. 1989, before taking over as coach for Chuck Knox in 1992. </P>
<P> Seattle closed the season with consecutive losses and scored less than 20 points in its last five games. </P>
<P> The 57-year-old Flores has a lifetime record of 97-87 in 12 seasons as a National Football League head coach. </P>
<P> He rose to prominence as coach of the Oakland/Los Angeles Raiders from 1979-87 when he compiled an 83-53 record with two Super Bowl titles. </P>
<P> Under Flores, the Raiders become the only wild card team to win a Super Bowl with a 27-10 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles following the 1980 season. Flores again guided the Raiders to the title three years later with a 38-9 rout of the Washington Redskins in Super Bowl XVIII. </P>
<P> He enjoyed no such success in Seattle. Flores finshed 2-14 in his first season before guiding the Seahawks to consecutive 6-10 campaigns. </P>
<P> Flores and former Chicago Bears head coach Mike Ditka are the only two people in NFL history to earn Super Bowl rings as a player, assistant coach and head coach. Flores earned rings as a reserve quarterback with the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl IV and as an assistant with the Raiders in Super Bowl XI. </P>
<P> In addition to Flores, Seattle fired offensive coordinator Larry Kennen, defensive coordinator Rusty Tillman, defensive line coach Tommy Brasher, wide receivers coach Bob Bratkowski, defensive coach Dave Brown, quality control coach Tom Catlin, staff assistant Arnie Matsumoto, defensive backs coach Paul Moyer, offensive line coach Howard Mudd, special teams coach Russ Purnell, and running backs coach Clarence Shelmon. </P>
