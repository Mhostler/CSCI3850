<P>  A Marine apparently shot and killed himself aboard a ship that had been off Haiti, U.S. officials said Wednesday. </P>
<P> They said Lance Corporal Maurice Williams, 21, of Detroit, was found dead in a sleeping area on the U.S. landing ship Nashville while it was in port in Puerto Rico. </P>
<P> The Nashville is one of a group of ships that landed about 1,800 Marines at Cap Haitien on Haiti's north coast when the U.S. military operation began September 19, and took them off this week. </P>
<P> Officials said they did not know if the Marine was among those who went into Cap Haitien. </P>
