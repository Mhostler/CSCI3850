<P> Defense workers William Barloon and David Daliberti were arrested March 13 when they became lost on a trip to visit friends in the demilitarized border zone between Kuwait and Iraq. Barloon, 39, works for McDonnell Douglas and had lived in Kuwait for 2 3/8 years, and Daliberti, in his 40s, works for the defense firm Kay and Associates. </P>
<P> The verdict, relayed to the United States by the Polish embassy in Baghdad, was condemned by Christine Shelly, a spokeswoman for the State Department, who said the two Americans ``accidentally crossed the border, they committed no offense justifying jail sentences.'' </P>
<P> ``The United States is actively pursuing their release through a variety of diplomatic channels,'' she said. The spokeswoman said that ``in our diplomatic contacts we are making it clear that Iraq has nothing to gain through this obvious misguided attampt to take advantage of two Americans.'' </P>
<P> Iraqi courts in the past have sentenced other westerners held for the same charge to up to 10 years jail, but none served the full termed and were released within a year. </P>
