<DATELINE>LA PAZ, Bolivia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Bolivia's Supreme Court has postponed a ruling on a United States request for the extradition of a former anti-drugs squad chief charged with cocaine smuggling, the domestic news agency Jatha said Thursday. </P>
<P> Col. Faustino Rico Toro, ex head of Bolivia's Special Anti-Drug Smuggling Force, could face up to 10 years in prison on charges of possession and distribution of cocaine in Florida, according to documents presented by the U.S. embassy in La Paz. </P>
<P> The charges against Rico Toro followed the discovery in 1991 of a plan by Bolivian smugglers to ship 265 pounds of cocaine to Miami. </P>
<P> The Supreme Court ruling was suspended until next week after one judge said he was against extraditing Rico Toro, who says he is innocent, Jatha said. </P>
