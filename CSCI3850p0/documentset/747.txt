<DATELINE>SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Bosnian Serb soldiers, some of them drunk, tried to raid three U.N. weapons collection depots near Sarajevo but were blocked by French peacekeepers, a U.N. military spokesman said Saturday. </P>
<P> The Bosnian Serbs have repeatedly violated a U.N.-declared heavy weapons exclusion zone around Sarajevo by seizing back weapons stored in U.N. compounds. </P>
<P> When the Serbs seized five heavy weapons last week, the U.N. responded by calling in a NATO air strike against a Serb target near the city. </P>
<P> Major Rob Annink of the U.N. Protection Force said drunken Serb soldiers tried to force their way into a weapons depot in the suburb of Ilidza early Friday morning. </P>
<P> ``At 0220 hours yesterday, a number of drunken soldiers attempted at the Ilidza weapons collection site to recover an anti-aircraft gun and tried to burn a U.N. flag. Guards prevented this action,'' Annink told a news conference. </P>
<P> Three hours later at dawn, officers of the Bosnian Serb army arrived at another arms compound at Bare and demanded weapons back, claiming they faced an imminent attack by the Bosnian army. </P>
<P> No weapons were taken and French U.N. guards drove the Serbs back. </P>
<P> Serb troops also tried to remove two Praga anti-aircraft guns from the Lukavica arms depot Friday afternoon but French peacekeepers prevented them, Annink said. </P>
<P> Serb forces returned the five heavy weapons, including a tank, they grabbed from Ilidza a week ago after NATO warplanes blasted a Serb combat vehicle not far away. </P>
<P> It was the third NATO air strike against the Serbs. Serb forces besieging the Muslim town of Gorazde in eastern Bosnia were hit last April. </P>
<P> The Serbs withdrew heavy weapons outside a 12-mile radius around Sarajevo or handed them to U.N. supervision inside it last February under a NATO threat of air strikes to make them stop besieging the city. </P>
