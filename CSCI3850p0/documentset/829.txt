<P>  Former politician Enoch Powell, famous for arousing controversy, has stirred a religious storm in Britain by suggesting Jesus may have died by stoning not crucifixion. </P>
<P> The claims are made in a new work of biblical scholarship by Powell, an 82-year-old classics expert better known as the political maverick who delivered a 1960s doomsday warning that immigration would inflict ``rivers of blood'' on Britain. </P>
<P> In leaked extracts of the book published this week in the British press, the former Conservative minister questions the basic Christian tenet that Jesus was crucified by the Romans. </P>
<P> Working from a early Greek translation of St Matthew's gospel, he says according to the reports that Jesus was more likely stoned to death for blasphemy on the orders of his fellow Jews after being publicly proclaimed the son of God. </P>
<P> The biblical accounts of the crucifixion are central to Christian belief and provide worshippers with the defining symbol of their religion, the cross. </P>
<P> Theological scholars reacted with astonishment Wednesday, saying Powell's idea that the crucifixion was a fictional add-on to the early gospel account was ``outrageous'' and ``utterly impossible.'' </P>
<P> Contacted by Reuters Wednesday, Powell declined to comment on the conclusions of his book ``The Evolution of the Gospel'' or the agitation they had caused in the tranquil field of theological textual research. ``I am not prepared to comment on the book until it is published, except to say that this book appears to have launched itself,'' he said. </P>
<P> A spokeswoman for the publishers, Yale University Press, expressed annoyance that journalists had broken a strict embargo on the copies of the book sent out to the media prior to its September 21 publication date. </P>
<P> ``It's a scholarly work of theology. It's stuff that depends on Greek verb endings and footnotes. I was hoping it wouldn't be sensationalized,'' she said. </P>
