<P>  The assembly framing Ethiopia's post-Marxist constitution has voted against private ownership of land. </P>
<P> The decision, taken Friday after heated debate in the 548-member constituent assembly, will preserve one of the most important social and economic changes made by left-wing army officers who overthrew Emperor Haile Salassie in 1974 and ruled until 1991. </P>
<P> Assembly spokesman Jamal Abdoulkadir said state ownership of land would ensure that millions of peasant farmers could not be evicted by powerful businessmen. </P>
<P> ``Land in Ethiopia will remain a national heritage. It cannot be a commercial commodity and will not be sold like coffee,'' Jamal said. </P>
<P> ``Gone are the days when rich people would buy out and evict peasant farmers from their land as they used to do during the time of Emperor Haile Selassie,'' he said. </P>
<P> Parts of the economy have been put back in private hands since Marxist dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam was ousted by guerrilla forces in May 1991, but land is scarce in a nation of 55 million. </P>
<P> Jamal said Ethiopians would have the right to own buildings on land leased from the state. </P>
<P> Another clause endorsed by the assembly was the right of Ethiopia's regions to secede if they wanted to. </P>
<P> ``The clause emphasizes that the unity of Ethiopia will be entirely voluntary -- that the different peoples of Ethiopia will remain united only through their own will and not by coercion,'' Jamal said. </P>
<P> The Red Sea state of Eritrea, where 30 years of rebellion played a major part in the downfall of Ethiopia's feudal monarchy and its Marxist successor, declared independence last year and was recognized as a separate state by the new government in Addis Ababa. </P>
<P> Some opposition parties boycotted constituent assembly elections last June because they said they feared that state ownership of land and the right to secede were not in the best interests of Ethiopia. </P>
