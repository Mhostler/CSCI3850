<P>  A man who bombed an abortion clinic is to be released from prison next month over the protests of abortion advocates, but the government is asking that his movements be restricted, officials said Thursday. </P>
<P> The release came under particular scrutiny because of last Friday's killing of two clinic workers in Boston, shootings that brought to five the number of people killed at U.S. abortion clinics. </P>
<P> The man due to be released, Jonathan Brockhoeft, was convicted of a 1985 arson that destroyed a Cincinnati Planned Parenthood clinic and an earlier attempted bombing in Florida. He cannot be held past his Feb. 18 release date, Edmund Sargus, the U.S. Attorney for Ohio's southern district, said. </P>
<P> In a letter to the Parole Commission, Sargus asked that during his three-year probation Brockhoeft be barred from entering nine counties in Cincinnati area. </P>
<P> He also requested that Brockhoeft be ordered to keep at least 1,000 feet from the homes and businesses of clinic workers. </P>
<P> ``(Brockhoeft) has stated his continuing avid support for those who use violence against persons involved in providing abortion services,'' the letter said. </P>
<P> ``He's the self-proclaimed father of the justifiable homicide philosophy,'' said Al Gerhardstein, lawyer for the Planned Parenthood Association of Cincinnati. </P>
<P> Gerhardstein said he also asked the Justice Department to investigate Brockhoeft's ties to three people convicted in killings of abortion providers. </P>
