<DATELINE>KINSHASHA, May 16 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The death toll in western Zaire's Ebola epidemic is rising relentlessly, forcing authorities in Kinshasa to tighten a quarantine zone around the capital city of five million people. </P>
<P> Outside the sprawling central African country, more and more governments started screening or monitoring passengers arriving from Zaire or even elsewhere in Africa to ensure they were not carrying what is one of the most lethal diseases known to man. </P>
<P> As a World Health Organisation bulletin on Monday put the latest toll at 77, up from 60, officials in Zaire moved to reinforce measures to shield Kinshasa from the epidemic, centred in the town of Kikwit 500 km (311 miles) away. </P>
<P> The special national committee tracking the epidemic -- which broke out in Kikwit in April and has spread to at least four neigbouring towns -- said it was asking police to quarantine 25 foreign journalists who visited Kikwit on Sunday. </P>
<P> ``In the interests of preventing the disease from spreading to Kinshasa and outside the national frontiers, it has been decided that the 25 members of the foreign press who went to Kikwit be placed in quarantine,'' said committee chairman Bompenda Bonkumo. </P>
<P> Bompenda told Reuters it was up to police to decide how to implement the decision of the committee, which has recommended a 21-day quarantine period for people travelling from the affected Bandundu province in contravention of an official ban. </P>
<P> The virus, for which there is no vaccine or cure, is spread through close contact with blood or bodily fluids and kills by causing uncontrollable bleeding. As many as nine out of 10 people who contract the disease die. </P>
<P> Soldiers on Sunday surrounded the journalists on the tarmac of Kinshasa airport after they arrived from Kikwit. They were allowed to go after the intervention of the U.S. and French consuls as well as Kinshasa governor Bernadin Mungul Diaka. </P>
<P> Anxiety heightened among the huge foreign press corps gathered to report the epidemic after a western embassy hinted authorities had decided to quarantine journalists at Kinshasa's Intercontinental Hotel, where most of them are staying. </P>
<P> The evening passed without any police intervention. </P>
<P> The move followed reports people from the infected area had bribed soldiers at road blocks to let them travel to Kinshasa. </P>
<P> Mungul said the blockade was now being strictly enforced, adding that two busloads of passengers were prevented from entering Kinshasa on Monday. </P>
<P> Countries as far away as Yemen and the Philippines announced screening or monitoring of certain arriving plane passengers, following steps taken by Zaire's former colonial ruler Belgium, by Egypt and neighbouring Sudan. The Philippine measures also covered southern Africa. </P>
<P> Authorities in Angola's northern oil-rich Cabinda enclave partly closed the border with neighbouring Zaire. </P>
<P> In a separate development, an expatriate family working for a mining firm close to the Angolan border was evacuated to Kinshasa and sent straight into quarantine in a city clinic. </P>
<P> Mungul authorised the evacuation after the employer accepted quarantine conditions, which apply to all companies repatriating foreign staff to Kinshasa from areas tainted by Ebola. </P>
<P> Mungul emphasised that no cases of the virus had been reported in the capital. ``Nothing has changed in Kinshasa,'' he said, adding that two people put in quarantine about a week ago were not ill but had been isolated as a precaution after arriving from the affected area. </P>
