<P>  Gunmen in the southern Senegalese province of Casamance killed three government soldiers in an apparent a resurgence of separatist violence, the government daily Le Soleil reported Monday. </P>
<P> The paper said unidentified attackers killed two soldiers on Sunday and had slain one last Monday. </P>
<P> Sunday's killings, near the regional capital Ziguinchor, came as members of the separatist Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance (MFDC) demonstrated in Sedhiou, 50 miles to the east, in defiance of a ban by local authorities. </P>
<P> The MFDC launched a secessionist guerrilla war in 1982. A truce, which has largely held, was signed in July 1993. </P>
<P> Analysts say the rebel movement is fractured by radicals who believe the cease-fire has not brought promised political gains or ended what they say is central government neglect of the province. </P>
