<P>  The Security Council agreed in a unanimous decision Thursday the United States-administered U.N. trusteeship agreement for Palau had terminated after the western Pacific territory became independent on Oct.1. </P>
<P> On that date Palau, with some 16,000 people living on eight of its more than 200 islands, entered into a compact of free association with the United States, approved by voters last year. </P>
<P> Palau was the last ward of the U.N. Trusteeship Council, which helped promote self-government or independence for 11 territories previously administered under mandates from the defunct League of Nations as well as some colonies taken from Italy and Japan at the end of World War II. </P>
<P> Other independent states which were once trust territories, or include parts of former trust territories, are Ghana, Somalia, Togo, Cameroon, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. </P>
<P> Ambassador Madeleine Albright of the United States, which administered Palau for 47 years, told the Security Council her country looked forward to the day Palau became a U.N. member. </P>
<P> The Trusteeship Council suspended operations on Nov.1 but did not immediately dissolve itself since this requires amending the U.N. Charter. </P>
