<P>  Twenty Greenpeace environmental activists occupied a German power station chimney Monday and said three of them would stay on it throughout an 11-day U.N. climate conference in Berlin. </P>
<P> Greenpeace said it had targetted the RWE utility's coal-fired power plant in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia as a symbol of carbon dioxide emissions that many scientists believe contribute to global warming. </P>
<P> Industrial nations account for around 80 percent of the global emissions that help trap the sun's warmth and raise the atmosphere's temperature, it said in a statement. </P>
<P> They built a platform about half-way up the 633-foot smokestack in Frimmersdorf and planned to unfurl a 65-foot banner, saying: ``Stop CO2 - Go Solar.'' </P>
<P> The conference, attended by at least 128 countries, aims to cut emissions of the man-made ``greenhouse gases'' warming the atmosphere which many scientists think may cause radical climate shifts or make the sea level rise. </P>
<P> The meeting starts Tuesday and runs through April 7. </P>
