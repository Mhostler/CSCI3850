<P>  Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said on Sunday an agreement on normalizing relations with Tunisia was a ``first-rate achievement'' wideningg Israel's diplomatic foothold in North Africa. </P>
<P> ``This is an opening which we will pursue until we attain a full agreement on relations,'' Peres told Israel Radio from New York. ``At this point we have some sort of relations with three North African states, namely Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia.'' </P>
<P> Peres and Tunisian Foreign Minister Habib Ben Yahia, in New York for the U.N. General Assembly, announced Saturday that Belgium would represent Israel's interests in Tunis and Tunisia's in Tel Aviv. </P>
<P> Representatives would be sent to the Belgian embassies in both cities, a joint statement said. A Tunisian economic liason office also is to open in Gaza and Jericho. </P>
<P> ``I regard this development as a first-rate achievement,'' Peres said in the radio interview. `` I attribute importance to the fact that the issue has been made public -- there are no secrets here.'' </P>
<P> Israeli officials had said they hoped Tunisia would be the next Arab state to follow Morocco's lead in establishing low-level diplomatic ties with Israel. </P>
<P> Morocco and Israel announced September 1 they would open liaison offices, the most direct ties established between the Jewish state and an Arab country since Egypt made peace in 1979. </P>
<P> Tunisia was home for more than a decade to PLO chief Yasser Arafat before he moved to the Gaza Strip to take charge of Palestinian self-rule. </P>
<P> Israel's air force bombed PLO headquarters in Tunis in 1985. In a raid in Tunis three years later, Israeli commandos assassinated Khalil al-Wazir, better known as Abu Jihad, a top leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization. </P>
