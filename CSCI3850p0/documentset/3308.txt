<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Time magazine reported Sunday that independent counsel Donald Smaltz is investigating a charge made by a former pilot for Tyson Foods that he helped convey cash payments from the company to President Clinton while Clinton was governor of Arkansas. </P>
<P> The weekly news magazine said Joseph Henrickson, 43, a pilot fired from Tyson's aviation division last year, told Time that on six different occasions, mostly in the 1980s, he carried sealed white envelopes from Tyson headquarters in northwest Arkansas to receptionists working at Midcoast Aviation, where the world's largest poultry producer lands its planes in Little Rock.  The Time report, in its issue reaching newsstands Monday, was made available to Reuters Sunday. </P>
<P> Smaltz was appointed by a three-judge panel last September to investigate whether Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, who has resigned effective Dec. 31, provided favors in return for accepting gratituties from Tyson Foods and other companies. </P>
<P> That seemingly narrow brief has gone beyond Espy to include Tyson Foods and its relationship with Clinton as Arkansas governor. An official with the investigation told Reuters last week the probe covers ``possible gratuities and that includes the giver and the givee.'' </P>
<P> Henrickson told Time that in each instance he held the envelopes up to the light to examine their contents and they appeared to be filled with $100 bills. </P>
<P> Time said Henrickson believed the envelopes were intended for delivery to Clinton, ``though there is no evidence he received them nor any allegation as to the purpose for which the money was intended.'' </P>
<P> ``So far, no eyewitness has corroborated Henrickson's story to Time,'' the newsmagazine added. </P>
<P> Time quoted lawyers for both Clinton and Tyson Foods as saying the allegations were ``totally false.'' </P>
<P> Time said Smaltz confirmed that he was looking into the accusations. ``It's very high on my radar screen,'' the newsmagazine quoted Smaltz as saying. </P>
