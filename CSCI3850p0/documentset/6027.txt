<DATELINE>LAGOS, Nigeria (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Nigeria, cut off from American assistance because of heavy drug trafficking, has cracked down on its drug barons and arrested about a dozen of them, the country's chief anti-narcotics officer told Newswatch magazine. </P>
<P> Maj. Gen. Musa Bamaiyi, chairman of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), was quoted as saying in an interview that other known barons were in hiding. </P>
<P> ``There is no baron again, from the look of things,'' he said in the interview published this week. </P>
<P> Nigeria does not produce heroin or cocaine but has become a major transit center. The United States ``decertified'' it last year, a measure which blocks economic aid when Washington is dissatisfied with a government's efforts in the drug war. </P>
<P> But an international report released in February said Nigeria appeared to be making some progress in its war against drug trafficking. </P>
<P> In its 1994 annual report, the Vienna-based International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), a United Nations agency, said a task force set up by Nigeria last year to reinforce NDLEA had begun to record positive results. </P>
<P> Bamaiyi said NDLEA had also successfully stepped up prosecution of those arrested for drug trafficking. </P>
<P> ``Last year, we had 67 cases and within the first quarter of this year I think we have had 44 already,'' he said. </P>
<P> The United States contends that well-placed Nigerians behind drug trafficking are never investigated by the authorities, but some socially prominent people have recently been charged with trafficking and appeared before military tribunals. </P>
