<P>  Sudan's leading Islamist figure Hassan al-Tourabi Sunday accused Amnesty International, which has condemned his country for gross human rights violations, of being in the pay of British intelligence services. </P>
<P> Tourabi, in a news conference marking the end of a four-day meeting of the Popular Arab and Islamic conference (PAIC), also condemned U.N. reports of violations by the Khartoum government. </P>
<P> ``I have spent seven years of my life in prison, but my name was not mentioned in (Amnesty) reports because I am what they call the 'fundamentalist' doctor Tourabi,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``Who is it who funds them? It is the British intelligence service,'' Tourabi said of the London-based human rights group. </P>
<P> Tourabi was imprisoned during the rule of former president Jaafar Nimeiri, ousted in a 1985 coup after 16 years in power. He holds no official position in Sudan but is widely believed to be the power behind Khartoum's present military government. </P>
<P> He also attacked the U.N. rapporteur on Sudan Gaspar Biro, who published a damning report on the country in 1993. He described him as s ``a trivial writer loved by the West.'' </P>
<P> He said Western organizations criticized Khartoum ``because of the identity of Sudan, because it has chosen Islamic identity.'' </P>
<P> The PAIC, headed by Tourabi, called in its final declaration for the establishment of an Islamic human rights organization. </P>
<P> ``The conference also suggested reformulating an Islamic human rights charter according to our view, which is close to the real Christian view,'' Tourabi said. </P>
