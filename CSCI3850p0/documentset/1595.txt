<P>  About 50 members of a secretive German colony in southern Chile moved into the second week of a hunger strike Sunday to protest what they called persecution by officials investigating charges of abuse at the site, witnesses said. </P>
<P> About 40 sympathizers have joined the hunger strike off and on at Colonia Dignidad (Dignity Colony), where 200 German immigrants and their descendants live behind barbed wire. </P>
<P> Local television showed images of pale and weak-looking strikers shrouded in blankets on the floor of the colony's meeting hall. </P>
<P> ``A lot of them can't even get up,'' said Raul Lara, a reporter for a local radio station after visiting the strikers Sunday. ``But they say no matter what, they won't end the fast until the government changes its attitude.'' </P>
<P> The 50 strikers, mostly teen-agers and young adults, stopped eating a week ago to protest at a Chilean government decree revoking the colony's legal status as a charitable organization and efforts to close its hospital and school. </P>
<P> The decree, upheld last month in a ruling by the Chilean Supreme Court, cleared the way for investigations into charges of torture, child abuse and other atrocities at the colony tucked in the Andean foothills. </P>
<P> The hunger strikers issued a statement Saturday saying they were protesting at ``the blind political persecution which does not respect the dignity nor the human rights'' of the settlers. </P>
<P> Human rights groups have also charged that political prisoners were tortured and executed at the colony during the former military rule of General Augusto Pinochet. </P>
<P> The hunger strike was ``organized by fanatics'' at the colony, said left-wing congressman Sergio Aguilo. </P>
<P> The colony was set up by Paul Schaefer, who fled Germany in 1961 after being charged with sexually assaulting children at an orphanage he set up after World War Two. </P>
<P> Defectors have charged that Schaefer, a magnetic personality able to quote from the Bible for hours, separated children from their parents at the remote colony near the town of Parral. </P>
<P> Its 200 or so residents are all but cut from the outside world and have refused to cooperate with investigators. </P>
<P> The decree means the colony technically has no legal right to exist but it has survived because its leaders shifted its assets to other institutions, judicial sources have said. </P>
