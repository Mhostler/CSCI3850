<DATELINE>CHICAGO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A herbal medicine made from greasewood that damaged a woman's liver so badly she required a transplant is still being sold despite a government warning, doctors reported Tuesday. </P>
<P> The Food and Drug Administration in 1992 issued an alert about the preparation, called chaparral, and it was voluntarily withdrawn from the U.S. market. </P>
<P> But it continues to be sold abroad and can be purchased in the United States from overseas mail order sources, the report said. </P>
<P> In this week's Journal of the American Medical Association, doctors at the University of Chicago Hospitals reported on a 60-year-old woman who had been taking one to two chaparral capsules daily for 10 months. </P>
<P> In the three weeks before she sought help she had upped the doseage to six capsules a day. Her liver was beyond saving and she underwent a successful transplant. </P>
<P> Her case, in 1992, was one of several which prompted the FDA to issue its warning. </P>
<P> But Tuesday's report said the preparation may still be available and consumers and doctors should be aware of it and other potentially dangerous alternative medicines. </P>
<P> The chief author of the report, Alfred Baker, said he found the chaparral capsules for sale as recently as last summer at a health food store in downtown Chicago. He also said the FDA continues to receive reports of chaparral poisonings. </P>
<P> ``This case should sound an alarm to physicians, especially in light of the rising prevelance of alternative medications and therapies,'' said Baker. </P>
<P> The preparation is made from ground leaves of an evergreen desert shrub called greasewood or creosote bush. American Indians used the leaves for a medicinal tea. </P>
<P> It has been touted in recent years as an antioxidant which can retard aging and protect against a variety of ailments ranging from arthritis and cancer to the common cold. </P>
