<P> Details of the U.S. involvment were to be given at a briefing by the Pentagon later Friday. Defense Secretary William Perry, speaking to reporters in Britain as he travelled back from a visit to Moscow, said earlier Friday: ``We are getting ourselves in a state of readiness to do this.'' </P>
<P> He said a marine amphibious group including the helicopter ship Essex would soon leave the Gulf for waters off Somalia. The Essex and its escort ships are carrying about 1,800 Marines, but Perry said that any operation to help withdraw the remaining 15,000 U.N. peacekeepers from Somalia in January and February would involve more. </P>
<P> He would not be more specific, but defense officials said another amphibious group containing about 1,800 Marines was also in the Indian Ocean and could move quickly off Somalia. </P>
<P> The United States, which at one stage had 28,000 troops committed to a humanitarian aid mission in the impoverished, war-torn East African state, pulled the last of its forces out earlier this year. The mission was marred by clashes with Somali warlord forces and an ambush of U.S. soldiers. </P>
