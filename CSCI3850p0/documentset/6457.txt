<P>  The Vietnamese coastguard rescued 27 Chinese heading for Australia by boat, helping them repair damaged engines and sending them on their way, officials in the central port of Danang said on Thursday. </P>
<P> The 22 men and five women from Guangxi province were trying to reach Australia to escape poverty at home, they said. </P>
<P> Fishermen spotted their boat in Vietnamese waters and alerted the coastguard, who took them into Danang on May 5. They left again on Sunday after repairs to three of the boat's four engines, the officials told Reuters by telephone. </P>
<P> It was not known whether the 27 were of Vietnamese origin. </P>
<P> Australia is sending home more than 700 Chinese economic migrants who pitched up on its coastline in recent months. </P>
<P> Some of them had fled Vietnam for China in the late 1970s when Sino-Vietnamese relations were bad and Hanoi took tough measures against Vietnam's ethnic-Chinese minority. </P>
