<P>  Francisco Duran, the Colorado man accused of trying to kill President Clinton last year, left a card at his last job saying ``Death to all government officials,'' a government witness testified Tuesday. </P>
<P> Duran was arrested Oct. 29 for allegedly firing 29 shots at the White House with a semi-automatic rifle. No one was injured, but several shots hit the presidential mansion. </P>
<P> Clinton was in the residence at the time of the shooting. </P>
<P> Duran was wrestled to the ground by two bystanders and turned over to White House guards. He has pleaded not guilty. </P>
<P> Robert Hislop, a Secret Service agent at the time of the shooting, testified that he went to the Broadmoor Hotel in Colorado Springs, Colo., two days after the shooting to interview Duran's former co-workers. </P>
<P> Duran had worked at the hotel's furniture shop until Sept. 30, but disappeared. </P>
<P> Hislop, who now works for a private company, said a hotel executive gave him one of Duran's business cards with the death threat written on the back, along with Duran's signature. </P>
<P> The hearing was held to determine whether the card and other evidence gathered at the hotel and from Duran's truck, found near the White House after the shooting, could be used in the trial, which is scheduled to begin Thursday. </P>
<P> The words ``kill the (prez)'' reportedly were on a map found after the shooting in Duran's truck. </P>
<P> Duran's attorneys argued the evidence should be suppressed because Duran had a right to privacy in his hotel workshop and because the truck was searched for explosives before a warrant was issued. </P>
<P> Judge Charles Richey said he would take the motions under advisement. </P>
<P> Duran, 26, dressed in blue prison coveralls and occasionally smiling, sat quietly through the three-hour hearing. He could be sentenced to life in prison if found guilty. </P>
<P> Mark Marek, another Secret Service agent, said a slip of paper addressed to the Secret Service was found in Duran's wallet after the shooting. It gave the location of the truck and asked that it be returned to Duran's wife and son in Colorado. </P>
<P> Police who searched the truck found a shotgun and ammunition in it. </P>
