<P>  Amnesty International called Tuesday for an independent forensic inquiry into the slaughter of thousands at a Rwandan refugee camp. </P>
<P> The human rights organization said the probe should be speedily launched ``before crucial evidence is concealed and the possibility of determining the truth is destroyed.'' </P>
<P> ``Justice has still not been done in addressing last year's genocide,'' it said in a statement. </P>
<P> ``Massacres and reprisal killings are likely to continue until the Rwandese people see that those who commit such atrocities are brought to justice,'' it said. </P>
<P> Rwandan troops have tightened their siege of the Kibeho refugee camp in the southwest of the country while the U.N. tries to negotiate free passage for the last 1,000 Hutus holed up there. </P>
<P> Amnesty said nearly 80,000 survivors of the massacre should be protected and urged the government to ensure that Rwanda Patriotic Army troops ``do not carry out extrajudicial executions against internally displaced persons in future operations.'' </P>
