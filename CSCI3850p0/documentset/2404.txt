<P>  A federal appeals court in Nigeria Friday granted bail to detained opposition leader Moshood Abiola and urged him to keep the peace, a court reporter said. </P>
<P> Justice Umaru Abdullahi, presiding judge at the Court of Appeal in Kaduna, gave the ruling in an appeal filed by Abiola, the undeclared winner of last year's annulled presidential vote, who was not in court. </P>
<P> A lower court trying him for treason had refused to grant Abiola unconditional bail. The prosecutor said the military government would appeal the ruling. </P>
<P> Justice Abdullahi said ``We hereby set aside the judgment of the lower court and have hereby granted you bail in self recognition and urge you to desist from doing anything that could jeopardize the peace of the nation.'' </P>
<P> The arrest of Abiola in June after he proclaimed himself president in defiance of Nigeria's military rulers sparked strikes and protests in July and August. </P>
<P> It was not clear whether the government would free Abiola pending the outcome of its appeal against the ruling. </P>
