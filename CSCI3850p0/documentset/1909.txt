<P>  Former campaign workers for Rep. Mike Huffington are claiming that the Republican's wife, Arianna, is essentially running his campaign, the Los Angeles Times reported Monday. </P>
<P> Huffington, a Republican, is in a closely watched senate race with Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein that could potentially change the balance of power in the Senate if he is victorious. </P>
<P> The Times said it had interviewed five of eight Huffington campaign workers who left their jobs in August because of what they said were disagreements with Arianna Huffington's decision making. </P>
<P> ``I did not think it was in the best interest of the Republican Party, the state of California and -- given her ambitions -- the nation for that matter, to elect her to the U.S. Senate, and that's essentially what we were doing,'' the Times quoted Lauri Shirck-Twomey, who was Huffington's statewide finance director before resigning, as saying. </P>
<P> Another unnamed former campaign worker told the Times, ``She is the campaign manager in the traditional sense. Whatever anybody else tells you, she is running the place. Nobody makes a move without telling her.'' </P>
<P> Arianna Huffington, who was the subject of several national media stories and was featured in the ``Doonesbury'' comic strip recently over her participation in a controversial religious group, denied she is running her husband's campaign. </P>
<P> In an interview with the Times she said, ``I am involved in the campaign, but I don't know many campaign wives who are not involved in their (husbands') campaigns. </P>
<P> ``I am not involved with the day-to-day running of the office.'' </P>
