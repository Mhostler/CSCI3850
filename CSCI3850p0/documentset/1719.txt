<P>  Israeli soldiers shot and killed a Palestinian after he stabbed and wounded a soldier in the occupied West Bank town of Hebron Friday, Israeli security sources said. </P>
<P> They said the incident took place near the Tomb of the Patriarchs in the heart of Hebron, home to 100,000 Arabs. </P>
<P> The tomb complex, a site sacred to Jews and Muslims, has been closed to the public since a Jewish settler killed some 30 Arab worshippers at the mosque there February 25. </P>
<P> Palestinian sources identified the dead man as Nader Abu Ishkhaidem, 20. They said he supported the Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas. The group opposes the Israel- PLO peace deal. </P>
<P> They said the Israeli army immediately imposed a curfew on the center of Hebron, where about 400 Jews live in several small, fortified enclaves. </P>
