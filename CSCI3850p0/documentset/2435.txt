<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The exiled Iranian opposition group Mujahideen Khalq said early Sunday that Iran had fired ground-to-ground missiles at one of their camps in Iraq, but it gave no indication of casualties or damage. </P>
<P> In a statement handed to Reuters in Baghdad, the group said the long-range rocket attack, the first against a Mujahideen camp inside Iraq, was launched early in the morning. It said its members were scouring the camp for possible damage or casualties. </P>
<P> ``Four earth-to-earth missiles ... were fired from the Iran-Iraq border against a camp of the liberation army called Ashraf,'' the statement said. </P>
<P> ``The firing of missiles was continuing and the forces of the National Liberation Army of Iran (in Iraq) were placed under full alert,'' it added. </P>
<P> There was no independent confirmation of the statement, but Mujahideen officials in Baghdad took foreign journalists and cameramen to visit the site. </P>
<P> Ashraf, the group's largest camp in Iraq, is 50 miles from the Iranian border. </P>
<P> In a similar statement on the missile attack faxed from the Mujahideen's Paris office to Reuters in London, the group blamed what it called a biased U.S. State Department report against it for acting as ``a green light'' to Iran for Sunday's missile attack. </P>
<P> In a scathing report on the resistance group made public in Washington Monday, the State Department said the Mujahideen was not a viable alternative to the Tehran government. </P>
<P> In the unclassified portion of the document, it said it had consulted a large cross-section of Iranian opposition groups and expatriates, including Mujahideen sympathizers. </P>
<P> Reporting its conclusions, it said: ``Shunned by most Iranians and fundamentally undemocratic, the Mujahideen Khalq are not a viable alternative to the current government of Iran.'' </P>
<P> Shahin Gobadi, spokesman for the group in Washington, lashed out at the State Department and termed the report ``a bunch of boldfaced lies that shows they have not studied historical factors about this organization.'' </P>
<P> The attack Sunday was the second by Iran which the Mujahideen had reported against Ashraf in less than a month. </P>
<P> Last month, the group said Iran's revolutionary guards attacked the camp with mortars, but inflicted no casualties. </P>
<P> The Mujahideen have their headquarters in Baghdad and several bases inside the country, some close to the Iranian border. </P>
<P> Efforts to mend relations between Iraq and Iran following their 1980-1988 war have all but failed. </P>
<P> Iran has made better ties conditional on Baghdad's curbing of Mujahideen activities inside Iraq. </P>
