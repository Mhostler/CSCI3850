<P> The most exciting round probably was the second when the two warriors went at it toe-to-toe in the corner to the delight of the 10,382 cheering fans. </P>
<P> Both fighters landed powerful punches, as they pounded away at each others' midsections and traded uppercuts and hooks to the head. </P>
<P> Pazienza, who earned about $750,000 for the fight, was warned shortly afterward for holding the top rope with his right hand and hitting Duran with the left. </P>
<P> By the fifth round, Pazienza began to zero in on the Panamanian, finding the range several times with left hooks to the body quickly followed by left and right hooks to Duran's head. </P>
<P> Pazienza punished Duran again in the sixth round with a hard right hand to the head coming off the ropes and then with a left that rocked Duran. </P>
<P> ``I overtrained and my arm hurt a little for this fight,'' said Duran, who was paid about $600,000 for his efforts. </P>
<P> Pazienza appeared to hurt Duran near the end of the eighth round when he caught the Panamanian up against the ropes and landed a left-right combination. </P>
<P> Pazienza then missed an overhand right and slipped to his knees against the ropes directly in front of New Jersey Governor Christie Todd Whitman. </P>
<P> In the ninth round, a cocky Pazienza, his back to the ring post, let Duran hit him in the stomach and said to him, ``go ahead, go ahead.'' </P>
<P> Near the end of the 12th round, Pazienza doubled up from what he later said was a low blow and a back spasm related to a training injury. He stayed away from Duran for a few moments and then finished the fight with a flurry of punches. </P>
<P> Pazienza held the International Boxing Federation lightweight title and the World Boxing Association junior middleweight crown, which he had to give up after breaking his neck in 1991. </P>
<P> Pazienza, who resumed boxing just a year after the injury suffered in an automobile accident, weighed in Friday at 168 pounds, and Duran weighed 1675/8 pounds. </P>
<P> Duran won the WBA lightweight title against Scot Ken Buchannan in the 13th round in 1972. </P>
<P> He won the World Boxing Council welterweight title on a 15-round decision over Sugar Ray Leonard in 1980 and the WBA junior middleweight crown in 1983. </P>
<P> Duran won his fourth title as a 7-1 underdog against Iran Barkley when he pounded out a 12-round decision to take the WBC middleweight championship. </P>
<P> Pazienza said afterward that he next wanted to fight IBF super middleweight champion Roy Jones, jr, who many believe to the be the best fighter pound-for-pound in the world. </P>
<P> ``With Roy Jones, if he steps into the ring with me it is no joke, I'll be all over the place. He'll see an intensity, he's never seen,'' Pazienza said. </P>
<P> ``I never stop training. I'll go on vacation and I'll train all the time.'' </P>
