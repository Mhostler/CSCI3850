<DATELINE>JAKARTA, May 4 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The chairman of Indonesia's ruling Golkar party said the sensitive issue of who would replace ageing President Suharto should not be discussed until his current five-year term ends in 1998, the official Antara news agency reported on Thursday. </P>
<P> ``If anyone has a personal opinion on the succession issue, he should, for the time being, keep it to himself,'' party chief Harmoko he was quoted as saying on Wednesday. </P>
<P> He told reporters it would be the job of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) to discuss the succession issue when it convened for a general session in 1998. </P>
<P> Harmoko was responding to suggestions by a number of legislators and government officials on the succession issue. </P>
<P> The Jakarta Post newspaper quoted Sudomo, chairman of the Indonesia's advisory council, as saying on Wednesday he knew Suharto had long wished to have a civilian as his deputy. </P>
<P> Sudomo also said the next president should be a former cabinet minister, socio-political organisation leader or one from the ``university circle.'' </P>
<P> Harmoko and other ministers made similar calls before Suharto, a former general who has ruled Indonesia since the late 1960s, was elected unopposed for a sixth five-year term in 1993. </P>
<P> Indonesia's 500-seat parliament meets every five years with 500 members -- all unelected -- of the consultative assembly to choose a president. The next presidential election is scheduled for 1998. </P>
<P> Antara said that Harmoko had been nominated by a number of Golkar branches to be vice president. Harmoko refused to comment on the nomination. </P>
<P> A number of legislators were quoted by the Kompas newspaper as saying on Wednesday that Harmoko and Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana, Suharto's eldest daughter, were considered the best candidates for president or vice president. </P>
<P> During his tenure as one of the world's longest serving leaders, Suharto has never appeared to be grooming any potential successor. </P>
<P> Some academics say suppressing talk of who might eventually succeed the 73-year-old Suharto could lead to instability if he decided to step down or died, because no obvious successor exists. </P>
