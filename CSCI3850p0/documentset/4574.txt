<P>  U.S. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown denied Sunday that the United States planned to drop its support of former Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari to head the World Trade Organization. </P>
<P> The New York Times, quoting a senior official, said in its Sunday editions that the Clinton administration was looking for a graceful way to ditch Salinas after accepting that he had no chance of getting the job. </P>
<P> The Americans, Europeans and Asians are sharply divided over who should head the prestigious world trade watchdog and time is running short to break the deadlock. </P>
<P> Each bloc is backing a local man, with the European choice well in front. Without transatlantic consensus, however, any one candidates is virtually doomed, given the politics of trade. </P>
<P> Vice President Al Gore said Saturday that the United States supports the selection process underway at WTO headquarters in Geneva and hoped the logjam would soon end. </P>
<P> One possible way out would be for Salinas -- whose reputation has been badly tarnished by the financial crisis in Mexico -- to quietly fade into the background. </P>
<P> The Times said the U.S. plan was to withdraw its backing even as officials insist they still support Salinas. </P>
<P> Brown, in Belgium for a technology conference, indeed stuck by Salinas and said the story was untrue. </P>
<P> ``There is no truth to the report, even by the New York Times, that we have dropped our support for former President Salinas. He is our candidate,'' Brown told reporters. </P>
<P> ``We think he's the best candidate. We continue to hope that he will become the president of the WTO,'' said Brown. </P>
<P> Asked if the report then signaled a rift in the Democratic U.S. administration over how best to proceed, Brown replied: ``I don't know of any such debate.'' </P>
<P> However, the administration is clearly in a quandary over the deadlock, displayed by a series of surprise announcements, U-turns and intense internal debate. </P>
<P> Last week, the United States caught its trading partners short by proposing a possible compromise: all three men bow out and clear the way for a fallback candidate. </P>
<P> That idea was promptly knocked down by the Europeans -- and then, in a surprise about-face, brushed aside by both Brown and Gore in swift succession. </P>
<P> The current WTO director general, Peter Sutherland, is due to leave March 15 and is eager to go after a tenure in which he wrapped up tortuous negotiations, buried the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and ushered in the powerful WTO. </P>
<P> The front-runner to succeed him is a former Italian trade minister, Renato Ruggiero, who is backed by 57 countries. </P>
<P> South Korea's former trade minister, Kim Chul-su, is in second place with 29 votes. Salinas has 28 backers. </P>
