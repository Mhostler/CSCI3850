<P>  Paul Cayard has a window in his mainsail on Young America, the better to watch his Kiwi counterpart Russell Coutts vanish in Black Magic. </P>
<P> ``I was just watching in the window, and it took all of about a minute until he disappeared out the front of the window. It was pretty impressive,'' the Stars & Stripes helmsman said after falling behind 3-0 to Team New Zealand in the best-of-nine America's Cup finals. </P>
<P> The problem for the Americans now, pointing towards Race 4 on Thursday, is that their window of opportunity to make enough adjustments to their borrowed boat to be competitive is closing as quickly as Black Magic has sailed. </P>
<P> Stars & Stripes tactician Tom Whidden noted that after a demoralizing 4 minute, 14 second defeat in Race 2, some people had questioned whether there was any way the Americans could improve their boat speed enough to make any difference against the Kiwis' admittedly faster machine. Apparently there was. Tuesday's loss was by only 1:52. </P>
<P> ``Obviously we worked on a few things and tried some new things today that we think helped, improved our performance,'' Whidden said Tuesday, adding that they would use Wednesday's lay-day to continue tuning the boat, especially in the downwind mode after making improvements in upwind speed. </P>
<P> The changes available at this point consist mainly of different sails and different trimming of the masts. </P>
<P> ``They'll get a little closer,'' said Dave Peterson, a principal designer of Black Magic. ``They have to get closer. We're sailing at 98-99 percent of our boat, and they're lower, and they're just slowly learning. So it's inevitable that they would improve.'' </P>
<P> But he doubted the Americans, who borrowed their boat only a week before the finals and now have to win five races before they lose two, could get their boat efficiency up to Black Magic's level in time. </P>
<P> ``I don't think they can get there that quickly,'' Peterson said, adding that the Kiwis, who have lost just once on the water in 41 races here, probably reached their present optimal understanding of their yacht three or four weeks ago. </P>
<P> Coutts said most of his crew had been in this situation before. ``We've been behind and come from behind and won, or been in front and lost. So nobody's taking it too lightly, that's for sure. I've been 3-nil down before and won a regatta, so it's not impossible.'' </P>
<P> While boat speed is the main factor in winning an America's Cup, tactics and weather play a role. </P>
<P> Stars & Stripes team boss Dennis Conner, a San Diego native whose forte has been reading the light and changeable winds here, said he hoped for such conditions in Race 4. </P>
<P> But Cayard, and most everybody else, felt his light blue, mermaid-decorated yacht had its best chance against the Kiwis' big black boat in higher winds: ``We do seem much more competitive over about 12 knots. </P>
<P> ``So I went in to the meteorologist at the end of the day and I said, Is there any way you can dial up 14 knots for me at the start on Thursday? And he said, Sorry, it's going to be lighter than today.'' </P>
<P> Faced with a disparity in straightline boat speed, the Americans have to try to draw Team New Zealand into a tacking duel, where tactics, wind-reading skill and crew work make the difference. The Kiwis have simply sailed away from such challenges so far. </P>
<P> ``We kind of are getting ourselves into a tactical mentality, which is that we feel we really have to create action,'' said Cayard. </P>
<P> ``And anybody who's been sailing for a long time knows that's basically a disadvantage if you feel you have to do that. Because if the guy ahead is sailing smart, which these guys can do, they just sail the (wind) shifts and you go the other way just to create action.'' </P>
<P> Asked if it was tough to stay motivated against a faster boat, Cayard said: ``It is difficult, but that's just the mental test. And I think we've been doing that all spring, basically, just scrambling along trying to find ways to go faster and faster every day. </P>
<P> ``So they're faster today and they were faster yesterday, but hopefully they'll be not as fast relative to us on Thursday. And that's what we're here for. That's what we do for a living. We just try to keep going faster and faster until someone says stop.'' </P>
