<P>  Two FDA advisory panels made a qualified recommendation Friday that the agency approve for over-the-counter sale Merck & Co's prescription drug for heartburn. </P>
<P> But before Pepcid can be sold without a prescription, the FDA and Merck must first resolve differences over interpreting a Merck trial study purporting to show Pepcid's effectiveness, the panels said. </P>
<P> The Food and Drug Administration usually accepts its panels' recommendations, but is not bound by them. </P>
<P> On Thursday advisory committees recommended against approving the prescription drug Tagamet for over-the-counter sale. The panels said the drug by SmithKline Beecham Plc failed to prove the anti-ulcer medication had no adverse effects to those who may be taking other drugs. </P>
<P> The committees Friday found no problem with Pepcid's safety, but statisticians argued over Merck's analyses of its trials showing the drug's effectiveness. </P>
<P> The committees also gave qualified approval to a request that Pepcid be approved to prevent and treat heartburn. </P>
