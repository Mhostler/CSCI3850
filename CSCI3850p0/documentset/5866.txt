<P>  Actor Marlon Brando missed the funeral of his daughter Cheyenne because the shock of her death was so great he had to be put under sedation in his Los Angeles home, a family source said Wednesday. </P>
<P> Cheyenne was found hanged in her bedroom in Punaauia on this French South Pacific island Sunday and was buried next to Dag Drollet, her murdered boyfriend, Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``He (Brando) will come later. He could have evaded the hordes of photographers in a big city but not in a small place like Tahiti,'' the source told Reuters. </P>
<P> Relatives said the death of Cheyenne had brought about a Romeo-and-Juliet like reconciliation between her family and that of Drollet who was shot and killed by Cheyenne's half-brother Christian on May 16, 1990, at his father's hilltop Hollywood mansion. </P>
<P> The mothers of Cheyenne and Drollet stood side-by-side at the young woman's funeral and the names of the young couple now appear side-by-side on their common pale granite tombstomb. </P>
<P> The couple is survived by a 5-year-old son, Tuki, born after his father's death. </P>
<P> Relatives said Cheyenne had been depressed since the killing of Drollet, for which Christian Brando was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment in 1991. The California Department of Correction said he could be released as early as next January. </P>
<P> She had made three previous attempts to kill herself and had been treated for depression in France and the United States as well as Tahiti. </P>
<P> Cheyenne was said to be particularly upset by a Papeete judge's decision to leave Tuki in the care of her mother Tarita, a Tahitian actress who was Brando's third wife. </P>
<P> Brando, 71, has zealously guarded his privacy for decades. </P>
<P> During Christian's trial, the court was told that before Drollet was killed, Cheyenne, then four months pregnant, had complained of having been beaten by her lover. </P>
<P> Charges against Cheyenne for complicity in the murder were dropped in 1993 after legal wrangling. </P>
<P> During his son's trial, Brando broke a long public silence, telling reporters and photographers he had become a recluse to preserve his sanity. </P>
<P> ``This (Hollywood) is a false world, and it's been a struggle to try to preserve your sanity in a world that has been taken away from you,'' he said at the time. </P>
<P> Last year, he published his autobiography and appeared in a long and rambling live interview with Larry King on CNN television. </P>
