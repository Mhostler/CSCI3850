<P>  Several environmental groups Saturday urged Congress to buy more land than the Clinton administration has asked it to acquire to protect wildlife and expand recreation areas. </P>
<P> Money for the land would come out of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which is filled each year with about $900 million in offshore oil drilling royalties, the Wilderness Society said. </P>
<P> Since 1979, Congress has put more than $10 billion of the money that has gone into the fund off limits, according to a report by a coalition led by the Wilderness Society. </P>
<P> And for fiscal 1996, the Clinton administration has asked to tap just $235 million to buy land. </P>
<P> ``The Administration should be embarrassed by that figure,'' said Jon Roush, president of the Wilderness Society. </P>
<P> ``A promise was made to the American people that the money coming into the fund would be used to protect land, and the government should keep that promise,'' he said. </P>
<P> Not only are the 53 green groups worried that Congress is not spending money meant for land, they also fear that the Republican-led Congress might shut down the fund to help reduce the national debt. </P>
<P> But Roush said that as long as U.S. taxpayers have to subsidize grazing, logging and mining, the fund should be kept alive to invest in land preservation. </P>
<P> The coalition targeted areas in 45 states, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands which are mostly in or next to a national park, forest or wildlife refuge. </P>
