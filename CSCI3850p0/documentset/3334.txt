<P>  Workers are more likely to call their boss ``Santa'' than ``Scrooge,'' despite a year of layoffs and long hours, according to a survey released Tuesday. </P>
<P> The survey commissioned by Proudfoot, a management consulting firm based in Winter Park, Fla., found Santas outnumbered Scrooges 44 percent to 37 percent. </P>
<P> However, 86 percent of those surveyed agreed with the statement, ``The average American business cares more about profits and less about people.'' </P>
<P> And 72 percent of respondents -- including some who gave the boss a Santa rating -- said their employers displayed some Scrooge-like tendencies. </P>
<P> They said their bosses are most Scrooge-like in the following areas -- how much they pay, their concern for employee well-being, health and family life and how much work they demand. </P>
<P> Forty-eight percent said a pay raise would help secure their boss a Santa ranking. </P>
<P> The survey found women are more likely than men to call their bosses Scrooges, 42 percent to 37 percent. Equal numbers of men and women -- 44 percent -- called their bosses Santas. </P>
<P> Forty-five percent believe the average U.S. business cares more about its employees a decade ago than it does today. Thirty-one percent said business cared less a decade ago, and 20 percent said there had been no change. </P>
<P> The survey, conducted by Bruskin-Goldring, polled more than 675 adults nationwide. Its margin of error was plus or minus 3.8 percent. </P>
