<P>  Cuba, traditionally opposed to U.S. intervention in the region, Monday strongly condemned a U.N. Security Council resolution that virtually gives Washington a blank check to oust Haiti's military rulers. </P>
<P> A Foreign Ministry statement said that while Cuba had supported efforts to restore democracy in Haiti, it had to express its ``most energetic rejection'' of the move. </P>
<P> The resolution had been prompted by U.S. pressures which, ''far from seeking a just solution to the Haitian conflict, are solely aimed at guaranteeing its strategic interests in the region,'' it said. </P>
<P> The Security Council voted Sunday to authorize a U.S. invasion and occupation of Haiti if sanctions failed to remove Haiti's military government. The vote went 12-0, with abstentions from Brazil, which represented the strong misgivings of Latin American nations, and China. </P>
<P> The Cuban statement said decisions of this type set ''precedents that violate the most sacred principles of international law, in particular those of territorial integrity and the sovereignty of states.'' </P>
<P> The situtation in Haiti did not represent a danger for peace and security in the region, but what was a threat was the ''concentration of U.S. forces and personnel in Caribbean waters,'' the statement said. </P>
<P> It added that the history of the United States in Haiti, whether open or covert, had ``in all cases led to the installation of bloody military regimes.'' </P>
<P> Cuba, whose relations with the United States have been hostile since the 1959 revolution that brought President Fidel Castro to power, lies just to the northeast of Hispaniola, the island shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic. </P>
