<P>  Cuban-born baseball star Jose Canseco offered some batting tips and moral support Saturday to Cuban refugees being held by the United States in Panama. </P>
<P> Crowds of delighted Cubans pressed for a glimpse of the Texas Rangers' designated hitter during his visit to refugee camps near the Panama Canal. </P>
<P> The United States is holding at the camps about 9,000 Cuban boat people that fled their island nation this summer. </P>
<P> Canseco, whose family fled Cuba when he was a child and who recently visited Cuban refugees held at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo, Cuba, told his compatriots in Spanish not to lose hope at their plight. </P>
<P> ``I am not here to comment on the politics of the situation ... I want the refugees not to lose faith that they will escape their situation,'' Canseco told reporters. </P>
<P> The United States closed its borders to Cuban refugees under a flood of boat people this summer, and has told the refugees they must return to Cuba to apply for legal migration to the United States. </P>
<P> U.S. military officials in charge of the camps said that three Cubans who had escaped the camps earlier in the week were captured by U.S. soldiers late Friday and returned to the camps. </P>
<P> Canseco signed autographs, gave away toys to Cuban children, and then showed off his baseball swing that earned him the Sporting News' 1994 American League Comeback Player of the Year award. </P>
<P> Young Cuban refugees, some wearing scruffy baseball caps, lined up to get a chance to chat with Canseco or catch his ground balls. </P>
<P> In reference to the ongoing major league baseball strike, which ended the 1994 season in September, Canseco said, ``We hope it's over soon. It's hurting everyone.'' </P>
