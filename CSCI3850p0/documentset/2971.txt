<P>  House of Representatives Republicans announced a plan Friday to slash committees by a fifth, abolishing three committees and about 25 subcommittes. </P>
<P> The House Post Office and Civil Service, District of Columbia and Merchant Marine and Fisheries committees would be eliminated entirely and some of their functions taken over by other committees, Rep. David Dreier, the plan's drafter, said. </P>
<P> ``This is major reform,'' said Dreier, a California Republican. He said it was the first major cut in House committees since 1946. </P>
<P> He said many of the remaining 19 House committees will be renamed, the House Armed Services Committee for example becoming the House National Security Committee. </P>
<P> Dreier said the plan, which he said he expects House Republicans to approve Tuesday, will cut House committee staff employes by one third but gave no numbers. </P>
<P> He said the committee will also end the widespread practice of proxy voting, requiring all committee and subcommittee members to be present if they want to vote. </P>
