<P>  Wrapping a patient's failing heart in a back muscle to help the heart beat may become a more common surgical procedure, based on encouraging survival rates, researchers said Tuesday. </P>
<P> At an American Heart Association conference, surgeons from several hospitals said the innovative procedure, known as cardiomyoplasty and first used successfully in 1985, was once viewed as a ``stop-gap measure.'' </P>
<P> But the operation has now been performed 80 times in the United States and hundreds of times in Europe, they said. </P>
<P> And of 420 patients who have undergone cardiomyoplasty, only 11 have needed traditional heart transplants afterward, said Dr. Anthony Furnary, a cardiac surgeon at Oregon's St. Vincent Heart Institute. </P>
<P> A U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved trial conducted between May 1991 and September 1993 involved 68 cardiomyoplasty patients, the researchers said. </P>
<P> Of that group, nearly 70 percent were still alive after 12 months and most showed improved heart function, physical activity and quality of life, the surgeons said. </P>
<P> ``We expect to see more cardiomyoplasty referrals as a result of the better understanding of the true objective merits of this procedure,'' Furnary said. </P>
<P> Cardiomyoplasty involves detaching the back's latissimus dorsi muscle at certain points, pulling the muscle through the chest and wrapping it completely around the heart. </P>
<P> Once positioned, the muscle is then trained through application of a series of electrical impulses to beat in sync with the heart -- and assist it. </P>
<P> ``At that point, the new muscle is able to take over part of the function of the damaged heart muscle ... In effect, the former back muscle becomes an integral part of the heart,'' Furnary said. </P>
<P> The procedure sidesteps two problems that plague heart surgeons -- a shortage of transplantable hearts and the body's tendency to reject transplanted tissue, reasearchers said. </P>
<P> The removal of the back muscle causes no deformity and only a minimal loss of arm strength, they said. </P>
<P> Cardiomyoplasty's chief limitation is that it can only be performed on patients whose hearts are strong enough to keep beating while the new muscle is being trained. This rules out many patients in the final stages of heart failure, the researchers said. </P>
<P> The FDA has plans for a larger study of the procedure, the researchers said. </P>
