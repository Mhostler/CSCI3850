<P>  China's main financial hub, Shanghai, claimed Friday to be top of the class in studying the recently published works of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. </P>
<P> The Liberation Daily said that since the selected works became available two weeks ago, 500,000 copies had been sold in the city, to army units, government and party organizations and companies. </P>
<P> This makes Shanghai, with 13 million people, top of the nation in per capita sales, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> Two printing presses in the city are rushing to bring out a second edition to meet demand, it said. </P>
<P> Shanghai residents say nearly all the purchases are made not by individuals, but by work units using public money. </P>
