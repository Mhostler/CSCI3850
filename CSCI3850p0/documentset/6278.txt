<P>  Two Lebanese civilians, including a four-year-old girl, were killed Thursday in Israeli shelling of southern Lebanese villages, security sources said. </P>
<P> They said Israeli gunners shelled villages on the Iqlim al-Toufah mountain ridge, killing four-year-old Oula az-Zeine and 41-year-old Hassan Ali Karaki. The shelling wounded 75-year-old Rhida Yassin and two other civilians. </P>
<P> In retaliation, Muslim militants fired mortar bombs into an Israeli outpost at Soujud hill and a barracks manned by militiamen of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army (SLA) in Rihan in Israel's south Lebanon occupation zone. </P>
<P> Iqlim al-Toufah is a bastion of the pro-Iranian Hizbollah (Party of God), used by its guerrillas to attack Israeli troops and their local militia allies in a bid to oust them from the south. </P>
