<P>  With union boss Donald Fehr and acting commissioner Bud Selig sitting out Friday's talks, pared down negotiating teams reported progress that could pave the way for a settlement to the Major League Baseball strike. </P>
<P> The Players Association said it had accepted a revenue-sharing plan from the owners in a turn of events that appears to have broken an impasse in the talks aimed at ending the 205-day-old strike. </P>
<P> The so-called ``Fort Lauderdale plan'', which was introduced by owners 13 months ago in Florida, calls for richer teams to contribute no more than three percent of their revenues to poorer clubs. </P>
<P> Fehr, who did not take part in a series of meetings on Friday between small committees from each side, said the union had made a major concession after Thursday's lack of progress sent a frustrated and pessimistic Selig home to Milwaukee. </P>
<P> ``Accepting the Fort Lauderdale agreement for five years is no small step,'' Fehr said. </P>
<P> ``It is not an agreement we like at all, but it is one the owners have made clear is the price of any agreement. They now have it.'' </P>
<P> Colorado Rockies owner Jerry McMorris, who headed up the owners side on Friday, called acceptance of the plan ``a positive step.'' </P>
<P> ``Is it earth-shaking? I certainly couldn't characterize it as that, but things are moving ahead.'' </P>
<P> The owners have said that a deal must be reached by Sunday in order to keep from starting the regular season with replacement players. Replacements are already taking part in exhibition games in Florida and Arizona. </P>
<P> Negotiations are expected to resume on Saturday as the two side attempt to build on Friday's breakthrough. </P>
