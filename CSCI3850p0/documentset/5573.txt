<P>  A Guatemalan military officer implicated in the killing of the guerrilla husband of an American lawyer was brought to the Pentagon last year to attend a seminar, The Nation magazine reported Friday. </P>
<P> The Nation, which last week identified two American agents working for the Guatemalan Army and three intelligence chiefs who were on the CIA payroll, reported that the officer, Maj. Mario Sosa Orellana, attended the seminar Sept. 8 on ''Civilian-Military Relations in a Democratic Society.'' </P>
<P> The Pentagon had no immediate comment on the report. </P>
<P> The article said U.S. support continues for a military blamed for decades of human rights violations, including pistol and rifle sales, troop training and the deployment of U.S. troops in the Central American country, even though U.S. military aid was ostensibly cut off in December 1990. </P>
<P> In 1993, an eyewitness who testified before the Organization of American States about the 1992 torture and murder of guerrilla leader Efrain Bamaca Velasquez implicated Maj. Sosa Orellana, the report said. The same eyewitness also implicated paid CIA informant Col. Julio Roberto Alpirez, the man accused by Rep. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., of ordering the killings of Bamaca and U.S. citizen Michael DeVine. </P>
<P> The Nation also reported that despite attempts by the State Department to portray itself as an innocent bystander in the war, one former U.S. ambassador, Thomas Stroock, had routine access to the CIA's list of agents in the Guatemalan army and that he knew the agency was engaged in ``liaison'' with the G-2, the military's death squad coordinator. </P>
<P> Stroock, now retired after serving as ambassador between 1989 and 1992, declined comment to The Nation when asked whether he had access to the list. </P>
<P> Bamaca was the husband of American lawyer Jennifer Harbury who has campaigned and gone on hunger strikes in attempts to find out what happened to him. The acting head of the CIA Wednesday denied any spy agency complicity in the killings as alleged by Torricelli. </P>
<P> Human rights groups accuse the army of razing more than 400 Mayan villages in the early 1980's and blame the military for killing most of the 100,000 Guatemalans who have lost their lives during the three-decade civil war. </P>
<P> The only official ever sentenced was Captain Hugo Contreras, who was convicted of the 1990 killing of hotelier DeVine but escaped mysteriously from a military base. </P>
