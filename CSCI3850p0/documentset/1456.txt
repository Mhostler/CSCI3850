<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Liberia has revived an elite military unit to boost security in the capital Monrovia following a failed coup last week, residents said Sunday. </P>
<P> They said black-clad troops of the Black Berets unit were spotted on the streets of Monrovia after General Charles Julue's brief bid to seize power Thursday. </P>
<P> A security spokesman in Monrovia told reporters the Black Berets would be needed to support the police once the former national army, the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL), was disarmed under the terms of the latest peace agreement. </P>
<P> The Israeli-trained Black Berets were set up by former interim president Amos Sawyer. They helped to drive off an attack on Monrovia by rebel leader Charles Taylor in October 1992 but Sawyer disbanded them following an increase in tension with the AFL. </P>
<P> Liberia's three main factions signed a new peace accord in Akosombo, Ghana, September 12 setting up a coalition government charged with disarming warring factions and leading the country to elections now set for October 1995. </P>
<P> A delegation of Ghanaian government ministers left Monrovia Saturday after talks with Liberian leaders. Ghana's president Jerry Rawlings holds the presidency of the Economic Community of West African States. </P>
<P> Liberia's interim head of state David Kpomakpor, due to leave office later this month under the terms of the peace accord, has pledged to punish Julue with the full force of the law. If tried and convicted of treason he could be hanged or shot under the law of Liberia, a country founded by freed slaves from the United States. </P>
<P> At least 61 AFL soldiers are in custody after backing Julue's coup attempt. </P>
<P> On Saturday, witnesses said troops of the ECOMOG African intervention force moved into the AFL's Barclay Training Center in central Monrovia, seizing large quantities of arms. </P>
<P> Julue was captured, beaten and stripped by civilians who recognized him Friday on a Monrovia street when he was trying to escape disguised as an Arab. </P>
