<P>  A federal court judge Monday refused to overturn the 1993 ethics conviction of former Alabama Gov. Guy Hunt, even though he said the original indictment was flawed. </P>
<P> U.S. District Judge Edwin Nelson, in a 117-page ruling on an appeal by Hunt, said the jurors who convicted the former governor on violations of Alabama's ethics laws had sufficient evidence to do so. </P>
<P> But he called the earlier indictment ``fatally flawed'' because it failed to state that Hunt had knowingly violated the law. </P>
<P> But Nelson said the error did not violate the former governor's constitutional rights, and so let stand a conviction that also had already been upheld by a state criminal appellate court and the Alabama Supreme Court. </P>
<P> Hunt, who in 1987 became Alabama's first Republican governor this century, was forced to resign from office after being convicted for spending $200,000 of his inaugural funds on personal items such as tires, farm equipment and income taxes. </P>
<P> Hunt, who claims he was the victim of selective prosecution, vowed in December that he would return to office even ``if it's just for 10 minutes.'' </P>
<P> Although he is expected to appeal Nelson's ruling to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, Hunt now will never complete his term of office. </P>
<P> When Hunt resigned in 1993, he was replaced by Lt. Gov. Jim Folsom, a Democrat who lost to Gov.-elect Fob James, a Republican, last November. </P>
