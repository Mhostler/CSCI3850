<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A political furor erupted in Israel Saturday over allegations that Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's Labor party tried to conspire with the PLO against the right-wing Likud government in the 1992 national elections. </P>
<P> Both Labor and the Palestine Liberation Organization, embarrassed by an account of a secret Israeli-Palestinian meeting in recently published memoirs of PLO peace negotiator Abu Mazen, denied any collusion. </P>
<P> Israel Radio set off a political shockwave by reporting that the book alleged that Labor official Ephraim Sneh, now health minister, had at Rabin's behest urged the PLO to deny Likud leaders any pre-election success at peace talks in Washington. </P>
<P> ``We in the Labor party want the following formula: there should be no progress in the Washington talks, but they should not break down,'' the book quoted Sneh telling Sa'id Kan'an, a prominent figure in PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction. </P>
<P> ``Raise the issue of freezing the (Jewish) settlements. That will put the Likud in a corner,'' he purportedly told Kan'an several weeks before the 1992 poll. </P>
<P> An angry Likud, which lost the election to Labor, said it would convene its leadership Sunday to discuss what right-wing legislator Yehoshua Matsa described as ``a conspiracy bordering on treason.'' </P>
<P> Likud officials urged parliament to appoint a panel of inquiry into secret Labor contacts with the PLO at a time when the Palestinian group was outlawed by Israel. </P>
<P> Sneh called the allegations of a conspiracy a web of lies. </P>
<P> ``(Rabin) did not send me to coordinate anything with the PLO,'' he told Israel Radio. </P>
<P> Sneh said he had met Kan'an, at the Palestinian's request, before the 1992 elections but the talks had not been important. </P>
<P> Rabin's office and several Labor ministers said they stood behind Sneh's account. </P>
<P> Kan'an said in a telephone interview with Reuters that he and Sneh had not spoken about internal Israeli politics. </P>
<P> ``We discussed the best ways to support the negotiations in Washington,'' Kan'an said. ``We did not touch on any other subjects, especially those dealing with Israeli elections.'' </P>
<P> Ahmed Tibi, an aide to Arafat, told a hastily convened news conference in East Jerusalem that the transcript had been put into the memoirs by one of Abu Mazen's assistants -- without the author's knowledge. </P>
<P> But Abu Mazen, an architect of the Israel-PLO peace deal signed under the Rabin government in 1993, confirmed he himself had quoted from the transcript. He said cryptically he had wanted to make a point about Israel's attitude toward a peace settlement. </P>
<P> Speaking to Israel Television from Amman, he said: ``We never had a dialog with any Israeli political party with the intention of damaging one side or helping another side achieve success.'' </P>
<P> He said the PLO had not discussed Israeli elections with the Labor party, even indirectly. </P>
