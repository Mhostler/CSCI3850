<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Fighting flared in Kabul Friday, after several days of relative calm, and hospital sources said at least three people were killed and 36 wounded. </P>
<P> Rocket, mortar and artillery fire boomed across the Afghan capital from soon after dawn. Planes of President Burhanuddin Rabbani's forces struck positions held by the opposition forces of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and General Abdul Rashid Dostum. </P>
<P> Rockets hit several residential areas in both parts of the divided city. The fighting, mainly at the southwestern and southeastern ends of the front line, later eased. </P>
<P> Sources at the central Jamhuriyat Hospital said the three dead and 12 of the wounded were mujahideen guerrillas. </P>
<P> One wounded fighter, Azimullah, 18, was hit in the jaw, leg and wrist during a battle at Daemazang in the southwest of the city. </P>
<P> ``I was fighting at Daemazang when a rocket landed nearby,'' he said. ``The opposition had advanced, but they were beaten back.'' </P>
<P> Pro-Rabbani Kabul Radio said the opposition militias suffered ``heavy losses of lives'' from bombing by presidential planes and also lost some strong positions. There was no independent confirmation of its report. </P>
<P> More than 12,000 people have been killed in factional fighting since Islamic guerrillas moved into Kabul in April 1992 after the collapse of a communist government. </P>
