<P>  The selection of alternates for the jury in the double-murder trial of O.J. Simpson ran into more trouble Wednesday, with three of the original jurors facing possible dismissal. </P>
<P> Superior Court Judge Lance Ito excused four alternates Wednesday, leaving a pool of 40 from which he wants at least 12 back-up jurors seated. </P>
<P> Simpson, a Football Hall of Fame running back who eased into a successful career as a sportscaster, actor and commercial pitchman, has pleaded innocent to the grisly June 12 stabbing deaths of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman. </P>
<P> The jury snafu was the latest in a series of glitches Ito has dealt with during the jury selection process, which has lurched forward in fits and starts for almost three months. </P>
<P> Ito and attorneys for both sides questioned three permanent panel members in private Wednesday afternoon, raising the possibility that they might be excused from the case. </P>
<P> The judge announced that one of the jurors under scrutiny, a 52-year-old Amtrak employee of mixed race, had written him a letter saying he was concerned his colleagues at work were able to identify him from news reports. </P>
<P> A hearing on alleged juror misconduct, the result of a sealed prosecution motion, was tentatively scheduled for Thursday afternoon. </P>
<P> The identities of the other two panel members were not known. </P>
<P> However, if they were to be excused, it would reduce the permanent panel to nine, meaning that three alternates would immediately have to step in. </P>
<P> In such a case, legal experts said, Ito might be forced to prolong the selection of alternates to bring the numbers back up. </P>
<P> If the defense and prosecution in the case each exercise their option of summarily dismissing 15 potential alternates when selection continues Thursday, the judge would be left with only 10 alternates. </P>
<P> If the three immediately joined the jury, the number of alternates would then be reduced to seven. </P>
<P> Ito originally said he wanted 15 alternates in anticipation that some jurors would be forced to drop out during the trial, expected to last up to six months. </P>
<P> The judge was also expected to announce Thursday when vital hearings on the admissibility of DNA evidence in the case would begin. </P>
<P> Those hearings, originally scheduled to start Dec. 12 and expected to last two to four weeks, have have been delayed because one of Simpson's DNA experts has a previous obligation to defend someone accused of murder in New York. </P>
<P> Ito was expected to agree to a start date of Jan. 4, which was suggested by defense attorney Robert Shapiro. If that happens, opening arguments would not be heard much before Feb. </P>
