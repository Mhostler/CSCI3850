<P> Georgia Governor Zell Miller announced that $35 million in funding for the project will come from the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce and the local philanthropic community, with another $15 million from retail home improvement chain Home Depot Inc. </P>
<P> ``For two historic weeks in 1996, Centennial Olympic Park will become the world's town center,'' said Miller, who noted that the park will become a state facility after the Olympics. </P>
<P> ``I wanted to make sure all the pieces were in place before I gave the go-ahead for the park.'' </P>
<P> The centennial park is part of a massive, 100-acre downtown development for Atlanta, which will include a 13-acre ``global village'' called '96 Expo with international, regional and corporate pavillions, street entertainment and concessions. </P>
