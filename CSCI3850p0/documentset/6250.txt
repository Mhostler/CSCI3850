<P>  Two Slovene climbers created history when they skied from the top of Annapurna I, the world's tenth-highest mountain in the Himalayan range, Nepal's Tourism Ministry said Wednesday. </P>
<P> The ministry said two Slovene brothers and a Mexican climber reached the 26,000 ft. summit on April 29 from the north face. </P>
<P> It said the brothers from Jezersko, in Slovenia, 32-year-old ski instructor Davorin Karnicar and 25-year-old Drejc Karnicar, skied back to their base camp at 14,018 ft. on the same day, making it the first continuous ski descent. </P>
<P> A French mountaineer skied down the slope 15 years ago, but did not do it in one go, officials said. </P>
<P> Carlos Carsolio, 32, from Mexico City, has climbed nine of the world's 14 mountains that rise above 26,0000 feet. </P>
<P> Only seven other climbers in the world have conquered as many as 10 mountains above the 26,000 ft mark. </P>
