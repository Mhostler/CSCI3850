<P>  The governing body of Italy's judiciary said Thursday it had accepted the resignation as a magistrate of Antonio Di Pietro, four months after he left Milan's ``Clean Hands'' pool of anti-corruption investigators. </P>
<P> Di Pietro, who became a hero in Italy for his work in anti-corruption probes that felled the country's post-World War II political establishment, quit the team last December saying his work was being exploited by politicians on all sides. </P>
<P> A spokesman for the judiciary body, the Superior Council of the Magistrature, said Di Pietro's resignation had been accepted unanimously and without discussion. </P>
<P> Di Pietro, a former policeman, now works as a part-time university lecturer, an advisor to an Italian parliamentary commission and an occasional newspaper commentator. He has repeatedly denied reports that he plans to enter politics. </P>
