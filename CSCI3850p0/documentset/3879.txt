<DATELINE>FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Hundreds of Sierra Leone rebels -- men and women -- attacked a U.S.-owned mining complex and abducted two Britons and three Sierra Leone security guards, forcing them to walk barefoot, a company spokesman said Saturday. </P>
<P> The latest in a rash of abductions in the West African state, all apparently by the shadowy Revolutionary United Front (RUF), brings to at least 19 the number of hostages held. </P>
<P> Earlier, owners of the United States-based company Nord Resources Corp. had said only one local employee was captured in the Friday attack on the Sierra Rutile mining camp. </P>
<P> Quoting eyewitnesses evacuated from the mine, about 150 miles southeast of the capital, spokesman Philip Palmer said the five men were captured at an outlying site and made to walk barefoot about a mile back to the main compound. </P>
<P> He quoted compound cook Willie Pratt as saying about 500 men and women, in combat fatigues and T-shirts reading ``RUF Peacekeeping Force'' took part in the attack. Pratt said he was not aware of any casualties. </P>
<P> The abduction of Peter White, Andrew Young and the three local staff, who were not named, came two days after rebels attacked a nearby Swiss-owned mine and abducted five Europeans, among them another two British employees, and seven locals. </P>
<P> The rebels are also thought to be holding a Swiss national who disappeared Jan. 4 in the eastern town of Panguma. </P>
<P> The RUF launched its revolt with the backing of Liberian rebels in March 1991. It has since splintered into groups of renegade soldiers and bandits who regularly attack convoys on main roads and raid villages in search of food. </P>
<P> Sierra Leone is one of the world's poorest countries and communications with the interior are extremely difficult. </P>
<P> The British Foreign Office warned travellers not to visit Sierra Leone. ``Non-essential travel should not be undertaken,'' a spokesman said. </P>
