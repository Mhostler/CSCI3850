<P>  The first joint Russian-U.S. army maneuvers, opposed by Russian nationalists, will take place in September, Defense Minister Pavel Grachev was quoted as saying Thursday. </P>
<P> Grachev told Itar-Tass news agency the maneuvers would take place at the Totsk range in the southern Urals, the former site of a Soviet atom bomb test. Officials have said that radiation on the site has subsided and there is no danger to the troops. </P>
<P> Grachev dismissed opposition to the peacekeeping maneuvers as ``a vestige of the past'' and said Russia would suffer financial losses and its international standing would be harmed if the exercises were cancelled. </P>
<P> The Totsk joint peacekeeping exercises, involving about 250 U.S. troops, had originally been due to take place July 6-14. </P>
<P> But President Boris Yeltsin ordered Grachev to review the plan after a nationalist campaign portrayed the exercises as a blow to Russia's prestige and dignity. </P>
<P> A visiting U.S. congressional delegation then suggested the exercises, the first of their kind, be held not in Russia but in the United States. Grachev and Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev both rejected this proposal. </P>
