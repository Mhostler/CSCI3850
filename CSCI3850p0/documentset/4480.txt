<DATELINE>TUNIS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Jailed Muslim fundamentalists slit the throats of four guards in an Algerian prison before security forces Wednesday crushed their mutiny, Justice Minister Mohamed Teguia said. </P>
<P> Speaking on Algiers state-run radio, Teguia said 12 members of Serkadji high-security prison were wounded. Some prisoners, many armed with knives, had also been killed and others wounded. </P>
<P> ``There were also dead and wounded among the detainees,'' he said, but gave no figures. ``The situation is now normal.'' </P>
<P> His ministry said earlier security forces were intervening to end the revolt and witnesses, contacted by telephone, said the jail was surrounded by heavily-armed police and gendarmes. </P>
<P> Algeria's official news agency APS described the prisoners as offenders against state security, a term used for militant Islamists waging a war against the military-backed government during which an estimated 30,000 people have been killed. </P>
<P> Teguia said the mutiny was to ``prepare an escape from the prison. They took seven warders (guards) hostage and we started negotiations but these failed. </P>
<P> ``The prisoners started to break the doors of the prison wing to get other detainees into the courtyard. Warders stopped them ... and security forces surrounded the prison,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``When the prisoners realized they could not succeed they slit the throats of four of the warders and refused to return to their cells.'' </P>
<P> Residents said security forces closed the area near the prison and no one could approach. </P>
<P> ``There are armored cars, mounted with machineguns, and armed patrols on foot all in the area,'' one witness told Reuters by telephone. </P>
<P> Le Matin newspaper said: ``Combined security forces are on the spot. Elite marksmen and other 'Ninjas' are on nearby roofs and on the prison terraces.''  'Ninjas' are members of crack gendarmerie units who patrol with their faces completely masked in a hood with simple eyeholes and a slit for the mouth. </P>
<P> The newspaper said around 1,000 prisoners, including 200 ``terrorists'' -- the official name for Muslim militants trying to overthrow the government -- were detained at Serkadji. </P>
<P> According to Liberte newspaper, the mutineers had demanded the release of three men. </P>
<P> It named them as Abdelkader Hachani, a leader of the outlawed Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), Abdelhak Layada, a leader of the Armed Islamic Group (GIA), condemned to death and extradited from Morocco, and Lambarek Boumaarfi, charged with killing head of state Mohamed Boudiaf in 1992. </P>
<P> Le Matin said Hachani and Layada had tried to get the mutineers to give up. </P>
