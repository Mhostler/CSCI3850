<P>  The AIDS Law Project of Pennyslvania said Thursday it had reached a settlement in a suit filed against Rite Aid Corp for allegedly disclosing HIV prescription information to an individual's employer. </P>
<P> ``According to today's settlement agreement, Rite Aid has agreed to alter its information and reporting procedure to ensure that they will no longer disclose HIV prescription information to any employers in Pennsylvania,'' said the AIDS Law project in a statement. </P>
<P> Rite Aid had no immediate comment. </P>
<P> Terms of the settlement were kept confidential, according to a spokesperson for the AIDS Law Project, a non-profit public interest law firm that provides legal services to people affected by the AIDS epidemic. </P>
<P> The case involves Rite Aid's disclosure of prescription information regarding an employee of South Eastern Pennyslvania Transit Authority (SEPTA). </P>
<P> Earlier this month, a federal court jury found SEPTA liable for $125,000 to the employee for its inappropriate use of the information provided by Rite Aid. </P>
<P> ``This is the first case nationwide to address the very real fear that employers will use health benefit records to learn an employee's HIV status,'' said Yolanda French Lollis, the AIDS Law Project staff attorney representing the SEPTA employee. </P>
<P> ``We hope that as a result of the settlement of this lawsuit, other companies will follow Rite Aid's lead and take measures to ensure the confidentiality of HIV-related information for their customers,'' she said. </P>
