<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A Taiwan businessman who built what he claims is the longest four-door, four-wheel car in the world said Wednesday he did it to give the Chinese people ``face.'' </P>
<P> Su Jian-hong said the sight of people in Hollywood and Europe being whisked about in stretched limousines gave him the inspiration to build a 33-foot black car fitted with gold accessories. </P>
<P> ``I saw all those rich people in Hollywood and also in Europe and I thought, 'Why can't the Chinese people have one like that?','' Su said by telephone from his home in the southern Taiwan county of Kaohsiung. ``I built it to give the Chinese people face,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``It is the biggest four-wheel, four-door car in the world and it should get into the Guiness Book of Records. There are cars longer than this one in the world but they all have six wheels and many doors.'' </P>
<P> The car, a remodeled 1978 Lincoln President, has a gold sink with gold taps, a toilet, televisions, speakers and bullet-proof tinted windows. Its interior is painted with swirling dragons. </P>
<P> The car cost nearly $500,000 and took five years to remodel But thieves beware -- anyone who fails to press the correct code number into a pad within five seconds of sitting in the car trips a switch that squirts gas from the upholstery. </P>
