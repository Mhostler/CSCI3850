<P>  Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz said Monday that Baghdad's recognition of Kuwait ``was under consideration'' but he gave no details on when this would be carried out. </P>
<P> He earlier addressed the Security Council, which had expected some more clarification on when and how Iraq would recognize Kuwait, a key demand in eventually easing sanctions. </P>
<P> Instead Aziz read from a communique issued on Oct. 13 in Baghdad by Iraq and Russia, adding: ``This is our position.''  He spoke shortly after Iraq's National Assembly ended an extraordinary session without revealing whether members debated recognition of Kuwait within new U.N.-demarcated borders. </P>
<P> After the Security Council session, he told reporters, in answer to questions, ``This is under consideration,'' but would not give any further details. </P>
<P> U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright, whose council speech cast strong doubt on the sincerity of Iraq's promises, took her cue from Aziz's comments and told reporters: ``It means that what I said in the council is the truth.'' </P>
<P> ``Words are cheap. Actions are the coin of the realm and when they (the Iraqis) go through the steps which we have all outlined as being the actual fact of recognition, that will be the important part. Not that they are considering.'' </P>
<P> Aziz, in his council speech, said: ``The joint communique -- and I am quoting now -- said Iraq emphasized its readiness to positively solve the question of the recognition of the sovereignty of Kuwait and its borders decided by Security Council Resolution 833.'' </P>
<P> Resolution 833, adopted in 1993, accepts the report of a U.N. boundary commission that demarcated the border. </P>
<P> Aziz attacked British Ambassador Sir David Hannay who said the ``continued presence of Saddam Hussein as president of Iraq makes these questions (on easing or lifting sanctions) more difficult to answer satisfactorily.'' </P>
<P> He said Hannay's comments were ``a clear example of the illegal manner of acting toward the question of Iraq'' and it was a violation of international law to question the legitimacy of the Iraq government. </P>
