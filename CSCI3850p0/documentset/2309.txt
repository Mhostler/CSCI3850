<DATELINE>TUNIS, Tunisia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Environment Minister Yossi Sarid, the first Israeli cabinet member invited officially to Tunisia, arrived Sunday in the North African Arab state. </P>
<P> Sarid was to participate in a two-day ministerial Mediterraean Conference on Environment due to start Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``For us it is a unique opportunity. It's the first time an Israeli Minister is in Tunisia,'' Sarid told journalists at his arrival in Tunis. </P>
<P> ``This is one other sign of the peace process ... Tunsia is known for many, many years for its moderation, political wisdom and responsibility,'' he added. </P>
<P> Tunisia, which hosted the Palestine Liberation Organization's headquarters for 12 years, has no diplomatic ties with Israel. But, like fellow north African Arab state Morocco, it has agreed to establish low-level relations with Israel following the Jewish state's peace moves with the Palestinians. </P>
