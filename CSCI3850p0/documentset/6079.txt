<P>  Saudi Arabia has defended a rise in the number of executions by beheading in the kingdom, saying it is applying God's law, and has brushed aside concern by Amnesty International. </P>
<P> ``We apply the laws of God and don't pay attention to whoever says anything about that,'' said Interior Minister Prince Nayef Bin Abdul-Aziz. </P>
<P> The official Saudi Press Agency said Prince Nayef was answering questions from reporters on Wednesday night about a report by London-based Amnesty International on the rising number of beheadings. </P>
<P> Amnesty said it was gravely concerned at the sharp increase in executions in Saudi Arabia, which applies strict Islamic sharia law and beheads murderers, rapists and drug traffickers. </P>
<P> Saudi officials have said the government is determined to crush drug smuggling. </P>
<P> Public beheadings, mainly of drug smugglers, have risen this year. According to unofficial counts, 96 people have been executed so far. </P>
<P> Some 85 were beheaded in 1993, and Amnesty said 53 people were executed in 1994. </P>
<P> Public beheadings are usually held on Fridays after the noon Moslem prayers but diplomats said some were carried out during week days due to a rise in the number of drug-related crimes. </P>
