<P>  The super secret Seawolf stealth submarine was rolled out of its construction barn and into public view for the first time Monday, with Navy officials calling it ``nothing less than awesome.'' </P>
<P> Longer than a football field and weighing more than 10,000 automobiles, the Seawolf is meant to be the quietest submarine ever built. </P>
<P> Even though the submarine, sitting on massive steel beams, was viewed by dozens of reporters and photographers, several parts were shrouded by huge sheets of canvas and pictures were allowed from only a few restricted angles. </P>
<P> ``Seawolf -- Coming Soon To An Ocean Near You'' was printed on one shroud below a hand-painted wolf's head. </P>
<P> ``Despite what the world wants to believe, it is still a very dangerous and volatile world and other countries would love to get at our technology,'' said Kenneth Carroll, Seawolf program manager at the Electric Boat shipyard, owned by General Dynamics. </P>
<P> Even though the Seawolf is just 80 percent complete, the Navy and Electric Boat are giving high priority to publicizing it, hoping to convince Congress to fund construction of more than the two Seawolf-type submarines that are currently planned. </P>
<P> The Seawolf is to be followed by a sister ship, the Connecticut, which is about 40 percent complete. More than $900 million has been spent on design and preliminary work for a third Seawolf, but Congress has yet to approve full funding. </P>
<P> Carroll said 3,000 men and women are working around the clock to finish the Seawolf, due to be launched in June and delivered to the Navy in the summer of 1996. </P>
<P> The submarine is 40 feet high and 353 feet long, will displace 9,137 tons submerged and will have an unprecedented eight torpedo tubes. </P>
<P> It also can be reconfigured quickly to carry large numbers of strike troops, such as Navy Seals, and their equipment or land attack missiles. </P>
<P> In addition to the two Seawolf submarines, Electric Boat is currently working on the last Los Angeles-class submarine and three Ohio-class Trident submarines. </P>
<P> When all of these ships are completed -- projected to be by 1998 -- Electric Boat may have to be mothballed because there are no further plans for submarine construction at this time. </P>
