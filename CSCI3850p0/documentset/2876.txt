<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The prosecutor in the Heidi Fleiss trial asked a jury Monday to reject the so-called ``Hollywood Madam's'' entrapment defense by putting themselves in her place -- as the object of a sting operation. </P>
<P> ``Would you meet in the Beverly Hilton with somebody you don't know from Adam and lay out what a great panderer you are?'' Deputy District Attorney Alan Carter asked the panel. ''If asked to supply two eight-balls of cocaine would you say 'no problem'?'' </P>
<P> Carter, delivering his closing argument in the case, assured the seven men and five women that no ``normally, law-abiding citizen would'' -- but that Fleiss did and was captured on videotape. </P>
<P> Fleiss, 28, the daughter of a prominent Los Angeles pediatrician, is accused of running a prostitution ring catering to the rich and famous in Hollywood. </P>
<P> She faces five counts of pandering -- securing women for prostitution -- and one count of cocaine possession, which could land her in prison for 11 years if convicted. </P>
<P> But defense attorneys have argued that Fleiss was entrapped by overzealous detectives who targeted her for prosecution and overlooked the wrongs of her alleged clients. </P>
<P> Carter, in his 40-minute closing argument, urged the jury to reject the entrapment defense largely based on statements made by Fleiss during the sting. </P>
<P> At one point, Carter reminded the jurors, Fleiss tells the detectives that she has no competition from ``these $200, $300 madams'' and deals with the richest men in the world. </P>
<P> The court had heard that four women allegedly recruited by Fleiss were each paid $1,500 to have sex in a Beverly Hills hotel with undercover detectives posing as Japanese businessmen. </P>
<P> Likening her to a car salesman, Carter read from the transcript of the tapes at a point where Fleiss appears to be bragging about her business. </P>
<P> ``She says ...' In the history of the business, no one has been able to do what I do,''' Carter said. </P>
<P> Defense attorneys were scheduled to deliver their closing argument later in the day. </P>
<P> The case has gained worldwide attention in the expectation that Fleiss' so-called ``black book'' of customers would reveal the names of her famous clients. </P>
<P> But no names of clients surfaced during testimony. </P>
<P> Asked earlier by reporters about Fleiss' clients, her defense attorney, Anthony Brooklier, described them as ''high-end male customers ... men of importance, from all walks of life, including the film industry.'' </P>
<P> Fleiss and her father, Dr. Paul Fleiss, are scheduled to stand trial in federal court in January on charges that they laundered money from the proceeds of the alleged ring. Both have pleaded innocent. </P>
