<P>  Man Mohan Adhikary, Nepal's prime minister-designate, survived 17 years in prison and upheaval in his political movement to bring communist rule to Nepal. </P>
<P> Adhikary -- Nepal's first communist prime minister, will be sworn in Wednesday morning. He was named prime minister Tuesday by King Birenda, whose father -- King Mahendra -- once sent Adhikary to prison. </P>
<P> At 74, Adhikary is one of a handful of elder statesmen who guided a pro-democracy movement which allied antagonists on the center and the left to bring a blood-stained end to absolute monarchy in 1990. </P>
<P> Now, four years later, the former trade union organizer has won another battle, this time against his former liberal allies of the Nepali Congress. </P>
<P> A political pragmatist, Adhikary is the keystone in the Communist Unified Marxist-Leninist party (UML), which he formed in 1991 by merging two rival communist groups. The UML won the most seats in this month's polls but failed to clinch a majority. </P>
<P> Adhikary shrugs off Congress claims that, thrust into power through the ballot, he now will curb democracy. </P>
<P> ``That is an old-fashioned way of putting things,'' the bearded leader said in a recent interview, seated in front of the red communist flag with hammer and sickle, and wearing dark glasses and the traditional Nepali cap. </P>
<P> Adhikary cut his political teeth in 1942 when he joined the Communist Party of India and threw himself into the Quit India movement which ended five years later with India's independence. </P>
<P> Both Adhikary and his predecessor as prime minister, Girija Prasad Koirala, helped organize a landmark strike in 1947-48 at a jute mill in the southern town of Biratnagar. The Ranas, hereditary prime ministers, jailed him for three years. </P>
<P> He was arrested again in 1960 after King Mahendra staged a royal coup and was jailed for seven years. After his release he organized a Marxist movement and was sent to jail again in 1970. </P>
<P> Adhikary's brand of communism is part nationalism, part social democracy -- not unlike Congress' liberal platform. He acknowledges the party has had to change its message since communism went on the retreat in much of the world. </P>
<P> ``We began with Marxism as our guide,'' he said. ``But then we never allowed ourselves to be indifferent to realities.'' </P>
