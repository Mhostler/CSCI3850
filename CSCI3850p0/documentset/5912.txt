<DATELINE>BEIJING, April 21 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  State security officials in China's capital have uncovered an electronics company illegally selling tapping devices, the Beijing Daily said on Friday. </P>
<P> A foreign businessman had supplied the devices to the company for sale in shops, violating the State Security Law, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> The businessman and the electronics company manager would be dealt with according to the law, despite writing apologies, and the bugging devices had been confiscated, it said. </P>
<P> Beijing newspapers have carried advertisements for bugging devices recently and private individuals have bought them, either out of curiosity or for other motives, it said. </P>
<P> Unauthorised use of bugging devices is illegal in China since this could jeopardise state secrets as well as personal rights and freedoms, it said. </P>
<P> China's state security apparatus is exempt, and routinely taps the telephone lines of embassies and foreign news bureaux as well as those of dissidents and others suspected of counter-revolutionary, or subversive, activities. </P>
