<P>  Germans celebrated their fourth year of unity still preoccupied with the challenges of the East-West merger and unsure of how to tackle the problems it created. </P>
<P> Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Roman Herzog appealed Monday to Germans on both sides of their former border to show more understanding for each other and patience with the problems each side has had since unification in 1990. </P>
<P> In Bremen, host to this year's unity festival, crowds of anarchists rejected the message and destroyed cars and shop windows in protest against celebrations. </P>
<P> Tens of thousands passed the day in a more typically German way, stuck in long traffic jams on the autobans as they used the three-day weekend for a quick trip within Germany or across the borders into neighboring countries. </P>
<P> Conspicuously missing was an assertive nationalist streak that many critics -- both in Germany and abroad -- warned would be revived after the first Unity Day four years ago. </P>
<P> ``It wasn't as big as July 14 in France or the American Fourth of July, but it was a nice day,'' a SAT 1 television reporter remarked after showing film of Berlin's street parties and an open-air concert at the Brandenburg Gate featuring Elton John and the Gypsy Kings. </P>
<P> Rudolf Scharping, the Social Democrat (SPD) challenger to Kohl in the general election on October 16, even said unity should have come on another day. </P>
<P> ``I would have preferred October 9,'' he told an election rally in Mettmann, outside Duesseldorf, Monday evening. </P>
<P> On October 9, 1989, 70,000 demonstrators in Leipzig held one of the most important protests of the pro-democracy movement that felled the Berlin Wall and toppled East German communism. </P>
<P> Kohl, whose reelection depends in part on how voters judge his record of dealing with post-unity problems, said unity was the fulfillment of a dream. </P>
<P> ``German unity is not only a question of money,'' he told some 30,000 people in Moedlareuth, a village which straddled the East-West German border until 1990. ``It's a matter of what's in our minds and especially in our hearts. We need to talk more with each other rather than about each other.'' </P>
<P> Herzog said he understood that many Germans in both east and west were disappointed with unification. </P>
<P> East Germans, overwhelmed by dramatic changes following the switch from communism to capitalism, were worried by high unemployment and economic uncertainty, he said. </P>
<P> West Germans, on the other hand, were angry about the slow pace of economic development in the east and the high cost of transforming the region into a market economy. </P>
<P> Herzog appealed to all Germans to put their problems aside and vote, saying: ``There is absolutely nothing to win by not voting. This only strengthens the radical parties whose supporters go to the polls anyway.'' </P>
