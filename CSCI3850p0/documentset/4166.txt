<P>  A man convicted of abducting and killing a woman when he was 19 was headed for the death chamber Tuesday in what would be Texas's fifth execution this year and its 90th since resuming executions in 1982. </P>
<P> Jeffrey Dean Motley, 29, faced execution by lethal injection shortly after midnight. His bid for a stay was denied Sunday by the Supreme Court. </P>
<P> Texas Attorney General's office spokeswoman Sonya Sanchez said: ``There are no active appeals so it looks like it's going to be carried out.'' </P>
<P> Motley, a Milwaukee native, was condemned to die for the 1984 kidnapping and murder of 30-year-old Maria Adelia Duran, of Houston. He has denied killing the woman. </P>
<P> Duran's decomposed body was found 10 days later in a field in La Porte, Texas, just east of Houston. She had been shot with a 12-gauge shotgun. </P>
<P> Motley had been arrested several days earlier in possession of Duran's car. A sawed-off shotgun and some shotgun shells were found in the car. </P>
<P> Traces of human blood were found on a spare tire in the trunk of the vehicle and on a tennis shoe Motley was wearing when he was arrested. </P>
<P> A bank videotape showed Duran making two withdrawals totaling $300 from an automatic teller machine while accompanied by Motley. </P>
<P> Texas has conducted more executions than any other state since the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976. </P>
