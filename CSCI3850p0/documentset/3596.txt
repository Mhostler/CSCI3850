<P>  Congress moved further into the computer age Thursday when House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Librarian of Congress James Billington announced that a new information system called Thomas, after Thomas Jefferson, was now available to people around the world. </P>
<P> The database of congressional information, including the full texts of House bills, will be available through Internet. It will vastly expand online information available when it becomes fully operational, the Library of Congress said. </P>
<P> Gingrich hailed the new system during an appearance before the House Ways and Means Committee saying that information on the House would now be available in 84 countries. </P>
<P> And he gave the committee what he called ``a nutty idea,'' to get members ``thinking beyond the norm.'' </P>
<P> ``Maybe we need a tax credit for the poorest Americans to buy a laptop,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``Now, maybe that's wrong, maybe it's expensive, maybe we can't do it, but I'll tell you, any signal we can send to the poorest Americans that says, 'We're going into a 21st century, third wave information age, and so are you, and we want to carry you with us,' begins to change the game.'' </P>
