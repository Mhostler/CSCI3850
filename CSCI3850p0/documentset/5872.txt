<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  North and South Korea got into a slanging match on Wednesay at a conference on extending the 1970 nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT), with each accusing the other of endangering the security of the Korean peninsula. </P>
<P> South Korean U.N. envoy Park Soo Gil in a speech spoke of ''the nuclear threat from the North'' and said that a ``crisis was recently created due to North Korea's non-compliance with its obligations under the NPT.'' </P>
<P> Exercising his right of reply at the end of the session, Kim Chang Guk of North Korea said South Korea had ``no qualification to talk of the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula'' since it had ``opened the way to foreign forces to introduce nuclear weapons, exposing the destiny of the whole nation to the threat of nuclear holocaust.'' </P>
<P> While expressing concern over ``the nuclear threat from the North,'' South Korea ``could not say a word about foreign nuclear weapons which targeted fellow-countrymen in the North,'' he said, alluding to nuclear arms which the United States says it has removed from the South. </P>
<P> Kim also said South Korean authorities were placing obstacles in the way of an agreement between North Korea and the United States by trying to ``play a central role...though they have no place in it at all.'' </P>
<P> He was referring to an accord last October under which Pyongyang agreed to freeze and eventually dismantle its plutonium-producing nuclear reactors in exchange for light-water models less capable of being used to make nuclear weapons. North Korea insists, however, it will not accept the reactors being offered because they are to be produced by South Korea. </P>
<P> Kyu Hyung Lee of South Korea, also exercising a right of reply, called Kim's remarks ``groundless, distorted and untrue.'' </P>
<P> He cited a recent statement to the conference by the director of the International Atomic Energy Agency that North Korea was not in compliance with its nuclear safeguards agreement and that nuclear material could have been diverted. </P>
<P> No questions had ever been raised about the transparency of South Korea's nuclear facilities, Lee said, urging talks for the prompt implementation of a denuclearisation declaration signed by both countries in 1992. </P>
<P> The representatives of the two Koreas then held a further, briefer round of exchanges before the meeting adjourned. </P>
<P> Park Soo Gil, in his address to the conference, said the the transfer of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes should depend on whether a recipient had a record of honoring the NPT. </P>
<P> A country with a solid history of respecting its provisions should be given full access to nuclear-related technologies and a stable supply of nuclear fuel. </P>
<P> Without referring directly to North Korea, he said strict sanctions should be imposed on those states which did not abide by their obligations under the treaty. </P>
