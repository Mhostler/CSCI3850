<DATELINE>DURSLEY, England (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Rosemary West, accused of being one of Britain's bloodiest murderers, told police she still chatted to her missing daughter Heather by telephone even though the teenager's body was already buried in the family garden, prosecutors said Monday. </P>
<P> West, 41, appearing in court for a hearing to determine if she should stand trial for 10 murders known as the ``House of Horrors'' case, had told police in 1992 that Heather, aged 16 when she was last seen in 1987, had left home because she was a lesbian. But West said she had kept in touch. </P>
<P> ``(West) said she had heard from Heather -- but by now she was buried under her patio,'' prosecutor Neil Butterfield told the court. </P>
<P> Wan and silent, the dark-haired, mild-looking woman bowed her head or fiddled with her glasses during the hearing in a tiny courthouse in the small western England town of Dursley. </P>
<P> Heather was the last in the string of alleged victims that began with stepdaughter Charmaine -- aged eight when she vanished in 1971 -- and included a Swiss tourist and other young adult women, some of them lodgers at the West home. </P>
<P> Rosemary West's builder husband, Fred, who had been charged with a total of 12 murders, should have been in court with her, but he was found dead, hanging from a noose, in an apparent prison suicide on New Year's Day. </P>
<P> Police, long suspicious, finally started digging a year ago at her home at 25 Cromwell Street in nearby Gloucester, uncovering nine female bodies cemented into the walls or buried down below. Prosecutors said some were dismembered. </P>
<P> A 10th body, Charmaine's, was found at a house where West lived earlier with Fred, who was 53 when he died. </P>
<P> Fred, jointly charged with the murders which police believe were carried out between 1971 and 1987, was also accused of killing his first wife and a nanny in the 1960s. Their remains were found buried in a muddy field. </P>
<P> Defense lawyers said that many of the alleged murders took place so long ago, and media publicity of the case had been so gory, that West could not get a fair trial. </P>
<P> Butterfield, however, said West had lied to police about Heather, thereby proving she was to blame for the lapse of time between the alleged offences and the case. </P>
<P> The judge must decide if the case against West is strong enough to go to trial. Strict restrictions have been placed on the press reporting of the case by British legal authorities. </P>
<P> Butterfield rejected defense claims that Rosemary's case had been hurt by publicity, saying the opposite was true as Fred, in ``confessions'' his son Stephen related to a newspaper, had said his wife had nothing to do with the killings, which Stephen said may number more than 12. </P>
<P> Defense lawyer Sasha Wass said media claims that Fred carried out illegal abortions at the family home was an example of reports which would make jurors assume Rosemary must have known what was going on. </P>
<P> West's lawyer, Leo Goatley, has said Rosemary knew her husband had a ``rascally'' side, but was completely ignorant about his alleged dark deeds. </P>
<P> Wass said evidence on which prosecutors based a claim that Fred and Rosemary together tortured young girls they sexually abused was flimsy. </P>
<P> ``Fred whipped my genitals with a two-inch wide leather strap ... the pain was excruciating,'' Caroline Owens, called ``the girl who got away'' in tabloid newspapers, said in a written statement which Wass cited, pointing out it was made more than 22 years after the incident. </P>
<P> Judge Peter Badge was urged by Wass to scrap the case without even going through pretrial hearings. Badge will announce his decision Tuesday morning. </P>
