<P>  PLO chairman Yasser Arafat Monday urged international donors meeting in Gaza to accelerate aid to the beleaguered Palestinian self-rule Authority. </P>
<P> Representatives of the World Bank and the United Nations met members of the Palestinian Authority and officials in charge of development in the occupied territories to discuss plans for international aid to help build the self-rule areas. </P>
<P> ``I hope this meeting will help us accelerate the financial and economic process which had been pledged by donors before,'' Arafat said during a brief appearance at the meeting. </P>
<P> He said donor countries must speed up the transfer of funds to help Palestinians cope with an Israeli closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip imposed after Islamic militants killed 21 Israelis in suicide bombings. </P>
<P> ``I hope that this (the closure) would speed up the transfer of funds in order to overcome the painful repercussions of the closure,'' Arafat said. </P>
<P> Donor countries pledged $2.4 billion in aid to the Palestinians over five years after Israel and the PLO signed their peace agreement in 1993. Most of the money has yet to be transferred. </P>
<P> Economic conditions in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank have deteriorated since the PLO took charge of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank area of Jericho in May last year under the Israeli-PLO peace deal. </P>
<P> Economists say closures Israel imposes on the Palestinian areas after each attack by Islamic militants opposed to the peace agreement have raised unemployment in the Gaza Strip to nearly 50 percent. </P>
<P> United Nations Under Secretary General Terje Rod Larsen said donors will present plans to the Palestinians and discuss how to start implementing them. </P>
<P> ``The donors will present plans of what will be done and will discuss with representatives of the Palestinian Authority (PA) how to procede with these plans,'' Larsen said. </P>
