<DATELINE>SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Rebel Croatian Serbs launched a ground and air attack on the northwestern Bihac enclave in Bosnia across an international border Saturday, dealing a serious blow to U.N. hopes of containing the war. </P>
<P> Two planes bombed Bosnian government army positions north of Bihac town as ground troops attacked along the western edge of the enclave, U.N. officials said. </P>
<P> ``This is most serious news. It's a blatant outright attack by forces of the RSK (Republic of Serb Krajina in Croatia) and we haven't seen anything like it for some time,'' said U.N. spokesman Alexander Ivanko. </P>
<P> First reports of the attack spoke of 13 houses burning and government soldiers and civilians withdrawing from the village of Trsacka Rastela, U.N. officials said. </P>
<P> Bangladeshi U.N. soldiers spotted at least 70 Croatian Serb soldiers moving across the frontier from a Serb-held region of Croatia into Bosnia. </P>
<P> U.N. officials the ground attack began Friday evening and continued throughout Saturday with tank, mortar and artillery fire raining down on government-held terrain. The planes struck just north of the Bihac ``safe area''. </P>
<P> U.N. troops in Croatia reported seeing two Galeb aircraft of a type known to be in Serb hands leave Bosnian airspace towards Croatia after the bombing. </P>
<P> It was not clear if they had taken off from the Serb-held Udbina airbase in Croatia, which was blasted by NATO aircraft last November but is since known to have been repaired. </P>
<P> The attack dealt a serious blow to U.N. hopes of containing the war as a battered four-month truce expires in Bosnia at midnight Sunday with little chances of an extension being negotiated. </P>
<P> The Muslim-led government and the Bosnian Serbs have been deaf to international enteraties to prolong the cease-fire. U.N. officials said that, short of a new truce, they might settle for a temporary non-aggression pact. </P>
<P> U.N. special envoy Yasushi Akashi was due to see leaders of both sides Sunday but U.N. peacekeeping officials doubted if he could renew the cease-fire, the longest of the three-year war. </P>
<P> Instead, they expected a lower-level agreement while the peace-seeking Contact Group of Britain, France, Germany, Russia and the United States, chipped away at the diplomatic stalemate. </P>
<P> ``We could go for something like a statement by both parties that they will refrain from hostile activities,'' a U.N. official said in Sarajevo. ``We have to provide some sort of breathing space to allow the Contact Group to come up with fresh ideas.'' </P>
<P> Peace efforts have been stalled since the Bosnian Serbs rejected a Contact Group peace plan last year to divide Bosnia in two between them and a federation of Muslims and Croats. </P>
<P> The Bosnian government rejected an extension of the cease-fire until the Contact Group did more to try to force the Serbs to accept the plan, which they are alone in spurning. </P>
<P> The cease-fire never took force in the Bihac region and it crumbled in central and northeastern Bosnian in March when government forces attacked Bosnian Serb positions. </P>
<P> Fighting eased towards the end of the week, the Serbs angered U.N. officials by firing a white phosphorous shell at a mainly Muslim town Friday. </P>
