<P>  Angry Argentine Senators Thursday demanded that the U.S. ambassador here explain remarks in which he threatened retaliation if a controversial postal privatization bill was passed. </P>
<P> Senators issued a statement calling on outspoken Ambassador James Cheek to ``clarify'' remarks he made earlier in the week, when he declared U.S. firms would suffer if a bill to deregulate and privatize postal services made it onto the statute books. </P>
<P> ``We are going to respond the moment it (the bill) passes. We are not a country that does not respond, and we know how to defend our interests,'' Cheek said, according to the local DyN news agency. </P>
<P> The Senate also defended itself from accusations by Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo that changes it made to the bill to forbid any postal vehicle from being stopped or searched without a court order would encourage drug trafficking. </P>
<P> ``The Minister said that postal transport or vehicles would cover up sending marijuana or cocaine, but we do not protect drug smuggling,'' opposition senator Fernando de la Ra said. </P>
<P> Under great pressure from Cavallo, the Lower House of Congress Tuesday postponed further debate on the bill until May. </P>
<P> The bill would ensure that the state postal company to be privatized, Encotesa, would end up controlled by existing private Argentine postal companies, limiting competition, Cavallo says. </P>
