<P> Cairo, Egypt (Reuter) - The United States, preparing to wean Egypt off the heavy aid diet of the past 15 years launched a ``Partnership for Growth'' which shifts the emphasis from official grants to private sector promotion. </P>
<P> Vice President Al Gore and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met as patrons of the partnership while three separate groups of ministers and officials held their first working sessions at Mubarak's palace in Cairo. </P>
<P> For months U.S. and Egyptian officials have denied that U.S. aid, running at more than $2 billion a year since the late 1970s, was in the firing line as Congress cuts costs. </P>
<P> But Mubarak came out in the open Monday, saying: ``We don't expect that the aid will last forever. We know very well that there will come a time when it will be reduced. We have no problem with that and we understand very well. </P>
<P> Gore steered away from any aid cuts controversy, telling the American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt: ``We made it clear that we want a broad-based and mature relationship that focuses on trade, investment and mutual commercial benefit.'' </P>
<P> ``U.S. aid flows have increasingly been used to leverage private sector-led growth throughout this country. In today's economy these aid flows must be made to work even harder ... The new U.S. partnership aims to do exactly this,'' he added. </P>
<P> Gore told reporters at the palace the Clinton administration was committed to maintaining the present level of aid at least through 1996. </P>
<P> Talk of the post-aid era cames at a sensitive stage in U.S.- Egyptian relations, with disagreements over the nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and a feeling in Cairo that Washington does not value its Arab ally as much as it used to. </P>
<P> Egyptian officials say they are keen to maintain the aid, which makes a useful though decreasingly significant contribution to the economy. </P>
<P> The administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Brian Atwood, was even more outspoken Sunday on what has previously been a sensitive subject. </P>
<P> Atwood, in Cairo for the Gore visit, told Reuters the $800 million a year in civilian development aid could not continue indefinitely and he was discussing the impact of possible cuts. </P>
<P> ``We are intelligent enough to see that we may have to suffer some cuts in the future,'' he told Reuters during a tour of USAID projects in Cairo. </P>
<P> ``We believe that if some breakthroughs can be made here on the private side, then less (aid) may be appropriate ... Possibly three or four years down the road we may want to see modifications in the program,'' he added. </P>
<P> The civilian aid, alongside military aid worth $1.3 billion, has remained constant since Egypt and Israel broke the ice in the Middle East by signing a peace treaty in 1979. Cutting the military aid is not yet under serious discussion. </P>
