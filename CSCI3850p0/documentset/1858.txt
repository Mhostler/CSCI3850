<DATELINE>CATANIA, Sicily (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A top Sicilian gangster turned police informer urged the Mafia on Friday to surrender, saying the Italian state had defeated organized crime. </P>
<P> ``Lay down your arms, the state is stronger than us and has won the war. Surrender and cooperate with the law,'' Giuseppe Pulvirenti, 64, said in a letter written from his cell in a top security prison. </P>
<P> ``Brothers at this point there is no alternative, either you repent or you will rot in jail,'' he said. </P>
<P> Pulvirenti, right-hand man of notorious Catania clan chief Benedetto 'Nitto' Santapaola, is charged with several murders and is also implicated in the killing of anti-mafia judge Giovanni Falcone in May 1992. </P>
<P> His letter coincided with the discovery of a big cache of arms, thought to belong to Pulvirenti's former clan, in a quarry just outside the eastern Sicilian city of Catania. </P>
<P> Police said they found machine guns, hand grenades and explosives as well as radio equipment capable of tapping into the police communictions network. </P>
<P> Pulvirenti's brother and two sons are also in jail but have refused to join the growing band of Mafia 'pentiti' (turncoats). His wife has disowned him. </P>
<P> Italian authorities say the number of pentiti has more more than doubled in the past year, with over 500 repentant mobsters agreeing to cooperate with the police since April 1993. </P>
