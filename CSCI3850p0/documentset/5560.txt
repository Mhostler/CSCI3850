<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Polish prosecutors Friday filed a court indictment against Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski and 11 other former senior communist officials over the 1970 killings of 44 protesting workers in coastal cities. </P>
<P> Justice Ministry spokesman Andrzej Cubala told PAP news agency the 12 were accused of being ``guiding perpetrators'' in the shootings of the workers by security forces during anti-communist riots in the Baltic ports of Gdansk and Gdynia. </P>
<P> At the time of the 1970 disturbances, sparked by food price rises, Jaruzelski was defense minister. </P>
<P> He later went on to declare martial law and take power in 1981 before crushing the Solidarity movement led by Lech Walesa. </P>
<P> The ramrod-straight general has been defending his martial law decision this week before a special parliamentary commission, saying the move saved Poland from the evils of civil strife and possible Soviet intervention. </P>
<P> Those now facing prosecution over the 1970 shootings also include the then deputy defense minister, Tadeusz Tuczapski and the deputy prime minister, Stanislaw Kociolek. </P>
<P> The indictment, submitted to the provincial court in Gdansk, is backed up by 90 volumes of evidence and there are 1,100 witnesses, PAP reported. </P>
<P> The case was opened in 1990, following the collapse of communism in 1989 after Jaruzelski agreed to semi-free elections. </P>
<P> Unless a verdict in the case is passed by December the legal time limit for the prosecution will expire. </P>
<P> There is however a bill before parliament's upper house that would extend the time available for prosecuting cases which could not be handled before 1989 for political reasons. </P>
