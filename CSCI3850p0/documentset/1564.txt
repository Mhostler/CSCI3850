<P>  Hillary Rodham Clinton heads a long list of senior American officials planning to visit India early next year to strengthen economic and military ties, U.S. and Indian business leaders said Friday. </P>
<P> Mrs Clinton's planned visit underlines Washington's deepening interest in India, which was viewed with suspicion during the Cold War but is now seen as a South Asian military power with great business potential. </P>
<P> Rajive Kaul, vice president of the Confederation of Indian Industry, told Reuters that she was expected to meet Nobel Prize laureate Mother Teresa in Calcutta during her trip. It was unclear whether she would see government leaders. </P>
<P> Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen was expected to make a separate visit to India, preceded by Treasury Undersecretary Lawrence Summers, said Michael Gadbaw, vice president of General Electric. </P>
<P> Their trips would be in addition to already announced visits by Defense Secretary William Perry and Commerce Secretary Ron Brown in early 1995. </P>
<P> Commerce Undersecretary Jeffrey Garten was expected to set the groundwork for Brown's visit with a tour through India late this year. </P>
<P> ``These visits should lead to exponential growth in partnerships,'' Kaul told a meeting of business leaders. </P>
<P> The U.S. officials were expected to visit India at different times but all except Garten and perhaps Summers would come in early 1995. </P>
<P> Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao visited Washington in May. ``There has been a sea change in attitude in Washington towards India since Prime Minister Rao's trip,'' Gadbaw said. </P>
<P> Gadbaw was leading a delegation of some two dozen top U.S. business executives who have met senior government officials in Bombay, Bangalore and Delhi. </P>
<P> Companies represented in the group, called Indian Interest Group U.S.A., include American Express, American Telephone & Telegraph, Bechtel, Citicorp, Enron Corp, Ford Motor Co's Climate Control India Ltd unit, Morgan Stanley, Pfizer, Procter & Gamble, Raytheon, Unisys and US West. </P>
<P> The delegation was set to meet Finance Minister Manmohan Singh Friday afternoon. No contracts were expected to be signed. </P>
