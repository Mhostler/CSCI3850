<DATELINE>DURBAN, South Africa (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Gunmen killed three people, including a 12-month-old baby girl, execution-style in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province, police said Monday. </P>
<P> Police spokesman Bala Naidoo said in a statement the attackers ordered a man, woman and the toddler to lie down in Inanda township outside the Indian Ocean port city of Durban before opening fire in the attack Sunday night. </P>
<P> ``They were ordered to lie next to each other and then shot in cold blood,'' he said. </P>
<P> Naidoo said spent AK-47 assault rifle cartridges were found at the scene. He had no further details and the motive for the killing was not known. </P>
<P> Political violence in the Zulu heartland of KwaZulu-Natal subsided after South Africa's all-race elections in April last year ushered in black rule. </P>
<P> But human rights organizations have warned authorities that violence could escalate in the volatile region before local government elections scheduled for October. </P>
<P> Since the beginning of the year more than 120 people have been killed in the region. </P>
<P> Most of last year's political murders in the province were attributed by police to clashes between blacks loyal to either the African National Congress or the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party, which holds power in KwaZulu-Natal. </P>
