<P>  Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said the United States is committed to maintaining a total ban on the ivory trade, but sees room for debate on the limited sale of elephant hides. </P>
<P> Babbitt spoke late Thursday to representatives from the 126 nations that abide by the treaty known as CITES - Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. The fate of the African elephant has been a major topic of debate at the group's meeting in Fort Lauderdale. </P>
<P> Elephants are flourishing in South Africa, Zimbabe and Botswana, where their numbers have grown so large the governments must kill hundreds of elephants a year to prevent hungry herds from destroying farms. </P>
<P> CITES prohibits all trade in ivory and elephant parts, and South Africa has asked that the ban be partly lifted so it can profit from thinning the herds by selling the hides. Conservationists argue that allowing trade in any elephant parts would open the door to slaughter. </P>
<P> Babbitt told the group the United States is committed to maintaining the ivory ban adopted by CITES nations in 1989. </P>
<P> ``It has saved the African elephant from uncontrollable carnage at the hands of poachers,'' Babbitt said. </P>
<P> But he noted that South Africa's proposal would not alter the ivory ban. </P>
<P> ``We also recognize that South Africa, which has achieved success in the sustainable managmeent of elephant herds, is entitled to a full discussion and debate of the proposal in the best tradition of the CITES process,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``The real question in the mind of the United States is whether it is in fact possible to open a trade in hides without compromising the ivory ban -- whether it is realistic to build an unbreachable wall between ivory and hides.'' </P>
<P> He said the United States encourages discussion of the issue, but only ``in a context that recognizes how successful and important the ivory ban has been.'' </P>
<P> In the decade before the ivory ban, poachers shot 70,000 African elephants, Babbitt said. After the ban, elephant kills dropped tenfold each year, and the price of ivory dropped from $663 a pound to $22 a pound because public opinion destoryed the commercial ivory market, he said. </P>
