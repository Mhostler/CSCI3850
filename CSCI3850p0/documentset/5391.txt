<P>  After huge and bloody army sweeps against Muslim fundamentalists, Algeria says it has ``terrorism'' on the run and is looking increasingly toward a presidential poll to unite its 26 million people. </P>
<P> At the weekend, Algerian Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah Dembri, in an interview, was quoted by the official news agency APS as saying, ``Terrorism is losing ground and the security situation is improving from day to day.'' </P>
<P> Apparently reflecting confidence from unconfirmed reports that Algerian troops had killed up to 2,800 Islamists in five sweeps in the past two weeks, Dembri was quoted as saying Algeria's instability was ``only a passing crisis.'' </P>
<P> The figures, for which Algerian newspapers have given no casualties on the army side, compare with some 40,000 people killed in the past three years, and a death toll that diplomats say is running at around 1,000 per week. </P>
<P> The slide into carnage started in January 1992 when the army-backed authorities scrapped a general election that the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was poised to win. </P>
<P> Since then, Algeria has had four presidents but no parliament. The current president, Liamine Zeroual, promised a presidential poll this year as a way out of the crisis, giving Algeria's people a direct say in their leadership. </P>
<P> Sunday, Zeroual and the former sole ruling party, the National Liberation Front (FLN), discussed the planned ballot. </P>
<P> Both the FLN and the Socialist Forces Front (FFS), which between them won only three dozen seats compared to 180 by the FIS in the scrapped election, had until last week refused to talk with Zeroual. </P>
<P> Saturday, however, the FFS said it would meet Zeroual on April 8 ``with the aim of ... restoring hope to the people.'' </P>
<P> Algerian newspapers termed Sunday's meeting between the FLN and Zeroual a major turning point on the political scene. </P>
<P> Meanwhile, Abderrazak Redjem and Youcef Boubras, members of the Armed Islamic Group's (GIA) leadership, were quoted by three newspapers as saying they had resigned over an order to kill the daughter of jailed FIS president Abassi Madani. </P>
<P> ``They (the GIA leaders) ordered the assassination of Abassi Madani's daughter because she does not wear the hidjab (Islamic veil). This criminal project was going to be blamed on the (Algerian) authorities,'' the newspapers Liberte, El Watan and the Tribune said. </P>
<P> It was impossible to verify the authenticity of the statement. </P>
