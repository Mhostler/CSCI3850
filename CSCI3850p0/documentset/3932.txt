<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigators still do not know for sure what caused the crash of USAir Flight 427, but after two days of hearings are certain of one thing -- airlines need to update their flight data recording equipment. </P>
<P> ``We're trying to determine what sort of improvements we need and we'll probably go back with a strong desire to move ahead and recommend some improvement in the flight data recorder field,'' said Michael Benson, a spokesman for NTSB. </P>
<P> Much of the testimony at the hearings pointed to a rudder control problem as a possible cause for the Boeing 737-300's sudden sharp turn to the left and 6,000 foot plunge into a ravine Sept. 8. All 132 people on board the plane, which was approaching Pittsburgh International Airport, were killed. </P>
<P> NTSB officials said they expect to determine a probable cause by late summer. They said they suspect the crash's cause was multi-dimensional and might have involved the rudder. </P>
<P> The probe has been hampered because the plane's recorder included no information on the position of the rudder, Benson said. The NTSB is an independent government agency that investigates major airplane crashes. There have been only four airline crashes for which the NTSB has found no cause. </P>
<P> ``There are several factors involved and we're looking at the rudder as part of a sequence of events,'' said Michael Benson, an NTSB spokesman. </P>
<P> Benson said the NTSB might make a formal recommendation to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for airlines to move ahead and retrofit older planes with better flight data recorders, or black boxes. </P>
<P> FAA officials noted, however, that retrofitting older airplanes with state-of-the-art flight data equipment is extremely expensive and arduous. ``It's not like changing a lightbulb,'' said Don Zochert, an FAA spokesman. </P>
<P> ``It's a difficult and very expensive retrofit,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``We anticipate a recommendation will come out on this and I'm sure the FAA will consider any proposal made by the NTSB,'' he said. </P>
<P> The hearings are scheduled through Friday with 30 witnesses providing technical data. On the opening day of the hearings Monday, the harrowing transcript of the pilot's last words in the final seconds before the crash were released as well as an animated video recreation of the crash. </P>
