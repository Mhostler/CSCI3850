<DATELINE>SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Bosnian government forces Monday began withdrawing from a demilitarized zone outside Sarajevo but the Bosnian Serb army reneged on a promise to end its fuel blockade of U.N. peacekeepers. </P>
<P> A U.N. spokesman said a fifth of the 500 men deployed by the Muslim-led government left the slopes of Mount Igman, west of the Bosnian capital. </P>
<P> Some of the government troops, departing reluctantly, fired at French U.N. peacekeepers monitoring the operation with machine-guns and rocket-propelled grenades but there were no casualties, U.N. officials said. </P>
<P> ``Bosnian army troops using rocket-propelled grenades, machine guns and command-detonated mines attacked French peacekeepers. The French returned fire. Fortunately the situation has cooled down, helped by darkness and rain.'' </P>
<P> The withdrawal was part of a maze of interlocking demands on the United Nations by both Bosnians and Serbs which are crippling efforts to aid and defend civilians in Bosnia. </P>
<P> In weekend negotiations, the Bosnian Serbs said renewed fuel supplies for UNPROFOR depended on the Igman withdrawal. </P>
<P> The Bosnian government threatened to stay on Igman until the United Nations stopped the Serbs from firing on their only access road to Sarajevo, which crosses the mountain. </P>
<P> Peacekeeping forces prepared to take up positions on the road but the expected breakthrough in fuel supplies failed to happen. </P>
<P> The Bosnian Serb army angered the United Nations by refusing Monday to let 11 promised fuel convoys cross Serb-held territory to Sarajevo and three Muslim safe havens in eastern Bosnia. </P>
<P> Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic later gave permission for a token 20 tons of fuel to be moved after U.N. special envoy Yasushi Akashi called him ``to express ... outrage and demand immediate clearance,'' U.N. sources said. </P>
<P> UNPROFOR spokesman Thant Myint-U said: ``We welcome this as a temporary measure to get fuel into the eastern enclaves but it is no substitute for a permanent solution.'' </P>
<P> U.N. forces in the eastern enclave of Gorazde are already out of fuel and unable to carry out their Security Council mandate to protect it. The situation in nearby Zepa is similar. </P>
<P> The Gorazde units had only enough fuel in reserve to withdraw from the town in an emergency. </P>
