<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Saying Jay Leno's humor is on the wrong track, Amtrak has decided to bypass NBC stations. </P>
<P> Weary of being the target of Leno's jokes on ``The Tonight Show,'' Amtrak, the government-supported passenger train corporation, is protesting by pulling nearly $2 million of advertising from the NBC television network. </P>
<P> ``I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that NBC can write Amtrak jokes faster than we can spend advertising dollars on your network. I give up,'' Thomas Downs, Amtrak chairman and president said in a recent letter to the network. </P>
<P> Downs said Amtrak had been unfortunate enough to be involved in a series of accidents during the past year ``none of which was our fault'' and he was tired of hearing Leno joke about safety problems at the company. </P>
<P> In New York, a NBC network spokeswoman said the company was not prepared to discuss its business in the media. </P>
<P> ``We have high regard for all of our advertisers, including Amtrak, but we are not prepared to discuss our business partnerships in the press,'' she said. </P>
<P> In an Oct. 7 reply to Downs, NBC network CEO Robert Wright said he wished Amtrak had talked to him before pulling the advertising, but said he would bring the issue to Leno's attention. </P>
<P> ``He (Leno) is, in fact, very sensitive about advertisers and special interest groups. He is also one of the best stand-up comics in the business. We try our best to find a happy middle ground between those two points of view,'' Wright said. </P>
<P> Downs said Amtrak did not expect to control what was said on NBC, adding he was sensitive to free speech rights. </P>
<P> In the past few weeks, Leno has joked about Amtrak's problems. Responding to Amtrak's announcement that it would lay off 600 managers, Leno cracked the railroad wasn't going to fire them, just put them on a train. </P>
