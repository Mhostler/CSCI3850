<DATELINE>SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Two men were killed and at least four other people were wounded by a mortar bomb attack on a Sarajevo suburb Thursday, reporters on the scene said. </P>
<P> U.N. officials confirmed four ``detonations'' and 10 bursts of heavy machine-gun fire into the western suburb of Hrasnica, but gave no details except to say the attack came from the Bosnian Serb side of the line. </P>
<P> One of the dead was a soldier, Hasib Selilovic. Residents said he was killed by a mortar bomb while standing at the main bus stop in Hrasnica. </P>
<P> A mortar bomb or artillery attack later wounded a boy and a woman in central Sarajevo, U.N. and hospital sources said. Kosevo hospital admitted a seven-year old boy and a 51-year-old woman with shrapnel injuries. </P>
<P> Capt. Miriam Souchaki, a U.N. spokesman, confirmed three detonations in the city center shortly after nine pm local time, 5 p.m. EST. </P>
<P> Souchaki also said two U.N. military observers were taken prisoner and held blindfolded in a cellar by Bosnian Serb forces in Sarajevo for reasons unknown. The two were later released. </P>
<P> One French soldier was wounded Thursday evening by a rifle grenade near the Jewish cemetary on the frontline dividing Serb forces and the Muslim-led government army in Sarajevo. </P>
<P> Television footage shot in Hrasnica showed blood on the pavement, a bus with shrapnel holes and broken windows and the rosette impact of a mortar bomb with its tail fin nearby. </P>
<P> Television crews at Hrasnica hospital filmed four wounded people receiving treatment, one of whom subsequently died. </P>
<P> ``This one is over, this one is dead,'' hospital workers said as a man in civilian clothes was carried into the clinic on a stretcher. </P>
<P> The victim, suffering from head wounds and with his right thumb nearly severed, died a short while later. </P>
<P> Hrasnica is at the foot of a mountain supply route which forms Serb-besieged Sarajevo's only land link to the outside world. </P>
<P> Military and civilian transport on the route, which winds down the face of Mount Igman in view of Serb gunners, has come under repeated attack in recent months. </P>
<P> U.N. peacekeeping soldiers fired three warning rounds from a 90mm cannon Wednesday after Serb forces opened up on the route several times. </P>
<P> The latest attacks were part of a pattern of increasingly bold Serb challenges to U.N. authority. The Security Council has banned heavy weapons from a 12-mile radius around Sarajevo and can call on NATO warplanes to enforce the ban. </P>
<P> But the Serbs have used proscribed weapons regularly in their attacks on the Igman road and, if reports from witnesses are to be believed, in their assault on Hrasnica Thursday. </P>
