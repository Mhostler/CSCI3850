<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Mexican police Saturday detained a key suspect in the murder earlier this week of a senior ruling party official as speculation mounted that corrupt politicians may have ordered the hit. </P>
<P> Carlos Angel Cantu handed himself in to authorities in the border town of Matamoros and was flown to the capital for questioning, police in Matamoros said. </P>
<P> Attorney General Humberto Benitez has said Cantu was hired along with the confessed gunman, Daniel Aguilar, to murder Francico Ruiz Massieu, the second ranking leader of Mexico's long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). </P>
<P> Cantu, a friend of Aguilar, was allegedly with him when he killed Ruiz Massieu with a single bullet to the neck outside a Mexico City hotel Wednesday morning. </P>
<P> Benitez said Cantu ran off when Aguilar was seized seconds after the hit, but reporters in Matamoros said Cantu told them he was innocent Saturday. </P>
<P> Police are still searching for the man who allegedly contracted both Aguilar and Cantu to carry out the murder. </P>
<P> Ruiz Massieu's death has battered hopes of a period of stability following the PRI's victory in August 21 elections. </P>
<P> This year has already seen the assassination of the PRI's original presidential candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio, as well as a boody peasant uprising in the southern state of Chiapas and the kidnapping of two prominent businessmen. </P>
<P> The Colosio case has not yet been resolved. </P>
<P> Speculation on who ordered the latest killing reached fever pitch Saturday with the dominant conspiracy one of an unholy alliance between corrupt officials and drug barons. </P>
<P> The pro-government newspaper Excelsior said three legislators, including two from the PRI, were suspected of involvement in the killing. </P>
<P> Other press reports said Ruiz Massieu had been targetted by enemies made during his 1987-1993 term as governor of the violent southwestern state of Guerrero. </P>
<P> Police have detained at least 20 people in the northern state of Tamaulipas, a center of cocaine trafficking, in connection with the case but have not identified a motive. </P>
<P> An opinion poll in the newspaper Reforma showed that 72 percent of people questioned believe the murders of Colosio and Ruiz Massieu are linked. Twenty-two percent blamed divisions inside the PRI and 15 percent blamed drug gangs. </P>
