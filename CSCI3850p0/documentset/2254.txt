<P>  Preakness and Belmont Stakes winner Tabasco Cat and two-time defending Mile champion Lure head a record list of 126 horses pre-entered for the 11th Breeders' Cup Championship, race officials announced Wednesday. </P>
<P> The 126 pre-entered horses, which include 33 from Europe, breaks the previous record of 116 set in 1991. </P>
<P> The seven-race, $10 million Breeders' Cup series will be run Nov. 5, at Churchill Downs, home of the Kentucky Derby. </P>
<P> Kentucky Derby winner Go For Gin will challenge Tabasco Cat in the 1 1/4-mile $3 million Classic, the biggest race of thoroughbred racing's richest day. </P>
<P> Lure is on the pre-entry list for the $1 million Breeders' Cup Mile on turf, where he will try to make it three in a row after Cup victories at Santa Anita last year and Gulfstream Park in 1992. </P>
<P> Absent from the pre-entry list is Holy Bull, the favorite for this year's Horse of the Year award. </P>
<P> Holy Bull's owner-trainer Jimmy Croll missed the Breeders' Cup registration period for entry into the Classic and did not want to pay the $360,000 supplemental fee. </P>
<P> Also missing is 1993 Belmont Stakes winner Colonial Affair, forced into early retirement by a leg injury last Saturday. </P>
