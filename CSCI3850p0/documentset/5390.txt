<P>  Former Russian vice-president Alexander Rutskoi, who tried to overthrow Boris Yeltsin in 1993, Sunday agreed to stand as a candidate in next year's presidential elections, Itar-Tass news agency said. </P>
<P> Rutskoi's Derzhava (Power) political movement, meeting in Moscow, officially nominated the former air force pilot in a resolution which condemned Yeltsin for damaging Russia's statehood. </P>
<P> Rutskoi, who has little chance of winning, told the meeting that if elected, he would reunite Russia with Slav neighbours Ukraine and Belarus. </P>
<P> Yeltsin has yet to announce whether he will stand next year. If he does, his more serious challenge could well come from far-right leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky. </P>
<P> Rutskoi, a Hero of the Soviet Union, was elected with Yeltsin in June 1991 but slowly fell out with his boss and eventually ended up in the camp of former parliamentary chairman Ruslan Khasbulatov. </P>
<P> He barricaded himself in the White House parliament building last October and urged supporters to seize key Moscow buildings after a demonstration backing him routed police in the capital. </P>
<P> Yeltsin forced the rebels to surrender within a day by sending in tanks. Rutskoi was arrested but later amnestied in February 1994 by the new lower house of parliament. </P>
