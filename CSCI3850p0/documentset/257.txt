<P>  PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat said Saturday he hoped Arab states, including Jordan, would follow his lead and negotiate peace deals with Israel. </P>
<P> ``We hope that we'll have a comprehensive lasting peaceful solution in all tracks, in the Syrian track, with the Jordanian track, with the Lebanese track,'' Arafat said in remarks broadcast in English on Israel Television's Channel 2. </P>
<P> Umm Jihad, a member of the Palestinian self-rule authority, was asked by the television for her opinion on Jordanian King Hussein's decision to meet publicly with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in Washington on July 25. </P>
<P> ``He has all the rights to do what he wants to reach peace,'' she replied. </P>
<P> The television showed part of a rare lunch meeting in Gaza City on Saturday between Arafat, his wife Suha, Umm Jihad and an Israeli member of parliament, Yael Dayan. </P>
<P> Asked by Israel Radio if Arafat welcomed the announcement on Friday of the Hussein-Rabin summit, Dayan said ``He welcomes it but he is worried and doesn't hide the problems of issues which fall between the cracks or that are liable to be under dispute.'' </P>
<P> Dayan said Arafat mentioned the issues of border lines between the West Bank and Jordan, and Jerusalem, the holy city in which both the Palestine Liberation Organization and Jordan claim a stake and Israel regards as its undivided capital. </P>
<P> Israel and the PLO began talks this week on extending their May deal for Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho to the remainder of the occupied West Bank. </P>
