<P>  Three indigenous indians were killed in a clash between rival religious groups near the bitterly divided southern Mexican town of San Juan Chamula, officials said Friday. </P>
<P> The killers, members of the area's dominant group of so-called Catholic traditionalists, attacked four evangelical Christians with guns and sticks in the small village of Ikalumtic about an hour outside San Juan Chamula. </P>
<P> They murdered two men and one woman, and left another woman seriously wounded, a spokesman for the state government of Chiapas told Reuters. </P>
<P> The town of San Juan Chamula and the villages around it are the site of a decade-old conflict between the ''traditionalists'' and converts to the evangelical faith. </P>
<P> Between 10,000 and 20,000 suspected evangelicals have been violently forced from their homes by the traditionalists, who accuse them of failing to respect the region's traditions and its religion, which combines Catholic and ancient indigenous customs. </P>
<P> The evangelicals say they have been victimized because they refuse to drink alcohol, which is brewed and distributed by local chieftains known as ``caciques'' and is an important source of income in the area. </P>
<P> The three people killed Thursday were among about 600 evangelicals who had been expelled from the area, but returned to their communities last month. </P>
<P> A commission of state government officials and police chiefs traveled Friday to San Juan Chamula to try to open talks with the rival groups and restore peace, the government spokesman said. </P>
<P> Chiapas, one of Mexico's most backward and violent states, drew international attention with the New Year's Day uprising of about 2,000 armed indigenous peasant guerrillas of the Zapatista National Liberation Army. </P>
<P> More than 150 people were killed before a cease-fire was agreed in mid-January but the Zapatistas remained armed in their mountain and jungle strongholds and no peace agreement has yet been reached. </P>
