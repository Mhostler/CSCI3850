<P>  Alaska inaugurated Tony Knowles as its ninth governor Monday, in a ceremony that opened with Native dancing and closed with blessings in the languages of Alaska's Eskimo, Indian and Filipino populations. </P>
<P> The only Democrat in the nation to replace a Republican governor, Knowles eked out a 536-vote victory margin that was confirmed in a statewide election recount completed early Saturday. </P>
<P> In his inauguration speech, the former Anchorage mayor -- who has a history of very narrow election wins -- quipped that his nickname may become ``Landslide Knowles.'' </P>
<P> ``In a time of cynicism, when people feel their votes don't count, let this election be a reminder -- and one that I will never forget -- that in the miracle of democracy, you are the power,'' Knowles said. </P>
<P> Knowles, who got his strongest support from Natives in rural Alaska, is expected to pursue more environmental policies than his predecessor, Walter Hickel. </P>
<P> Already Knowles has ordered an end to this winter's wolf control, the controversial state policy that has dispatched state workers to kill wild wolves in order to boost herds targeted by big-game hunters from the Fairbanks area. </P>
<P> His inauguration speech, which promised economic development, included an environmental theme. </P>
<P> ``We will encourage development and investment in our oil, fisheries, tourism, mining and timber with the understanding that Alaska's bottom line is hiring Alaskans, adding value to our resources in Alaska and enhancing, not detracting from, the beauty and cleanliness of our home.'' </P>
<P> He likened Alaska's ``fish, wildlife and wild lands'' to a financial endowment that should be protected. ``If we invest in the principal through wise management, Alaskans today and future generations will prosper off its dividends,'' he said. </P>
<P> Radio personality Tom Bodett hosted the ceremony that inaugurated Knowles and Lt. Gov. Fran Ulmer, the first woman elected to statewide office in Alaska. </P>
<P> Politicians are generally believed to be ``conflicted or afflicted or just plain dumb,'' Bodett said. </P>
<P> ``But every once in a while, somebody comes along and you just know that they're one of the good ones. That's what I thought when Tony Knowles came along. And that's what I thought again when Fran Ulmer came along,'' the Homer, Alaska radio personality said. </P>
