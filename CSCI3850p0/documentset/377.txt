<P>  The U.S. military Monday denied aid relief agency charges that its first airdrop of supplies for Rwandan refugees had completely missed the target. </P>
<P> Commander Ron Morse, spokesman of the U.S. army's European Command in Stuttgart, said it was not true that the food airdrop had been aimed at an airstrip near Katale refugee camp outside the Zairean border town of Goma. </P>
<P> ``That is not correct,'' he told Reuters. ``Our aim was a private coffee plantation about 18 miles north of Goma picked by the United Nations because it was secure.'' </P>
<P> Aid workers described the U.S. military's first airdrop Sunday as a stunt that had wasted their time and resources, believing it to be aimed for the airstrip near Katale camp. </P>
<P> ``Our aircraft put more than 34,000 pounds of food where we intended to put it,'' countered Morse. ``We hit the zone even if we didn't hit it pinpoint.'' </P>
<P> He acknowledged that poor visibility had prevented one of the three planes dropping all its load but said that the others had released their bundles accurately. </P>
<P> U.S. spokesman Guy Shields said Sunday the planes had dropped a total of eight pallets. The original plan had been to drop 24. </P>
<P> Morse also confirmed reports that one pallet of food narrowly missed a French helicopter, adding that it was in the plantation because it had carried observers to the drop site. </P>
<P> A main criticism was the choice of drop zone. </P>
<P> Relief workers with the aid organization, CARE, said they had to send out six or seven empty trucks from Goma, 35 miles away to collect the U.S. aid. If the trucks had had more time to load up, they would actually have taken out more aid than the U.S. planes had dropped, a CARE official said. </P>
<P> ``I don't want to get into arguments about whether the site itself was the best,'' said Morse. ``It was chosen by the U.N. and we had no control over that.'' </P>
<P> He said the U.S. military had two aims in the mission. First, it wanted to validate the operation and secondly, it wanted to show relief agencies what was involved in dropping 1080pound food bundles instead of small packets. </P>
<P> ``Familiarization is the word,'' Morse said. </P>
<P> The operation was conducted in close cooperation with the U.N. and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the next stage was to discuss with the agencies how best to proceed. </P>
<P> Morse added that no airdrops were scheduled for Monday. </P>
<P> The U.S. aid effort got off to an uneasy start Saturday. A giant C-141 transport plane that had flown in from Germany loaded with just one heavy-duty forklift truck. </P>
<P> French military planes trying to land had to be diverted to other airports in western Zaire. And relief planes were forced to circle Goma while waiting for landing room. </P>
