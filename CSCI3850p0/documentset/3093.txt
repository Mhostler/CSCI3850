<P>  Nine of the 34 leaders attending this weekend's Summit of the Americas will be unescorted by a spouse -- due to soap opera-quality marital spats, personal preference or religious vows. </P>
<P> Two first ladies who have dramatically fallen out with their husbands will miss the chance to help President Clinton's wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, map out a strategy to protect children in the hemisphere. </P>
<P> Contrasting with the long, stable marriage of Venezuela's President Rafael Caldera and his wife Alicia, some other Latin American first couples have gone through uproarious rifts that even soap opera writers would find hard to match. </P>
<P> The marriage of Peru's Alberto Fujimori and his wife, Susana Higuchi, hit the rocks in October after she flew the nest for a couple of days, accusing him of abusing his powers to try and stop her from running for president. </P>
<P> Higuchi tired to make a presidential bid but failed to collect enough signatures and is now no threat to her husband's re-election plans. </P>
<P> Argentine President Carlos Menem has been unattached since he used armed guards to ban his wife, Zulema Yoma, from their official residence in 1991. </P>
<P> Yoma, who has since sued her husband for divorce, had also been playing political games behind Menem's back and telling reporters that the presidential Cabinet was full of crooks. </P>
<P> Menem, who now takes his dashing daughter, Zulemita, on official trips, is known for his penchant for beautiful women, a trait he shares with Brazil's Itamar Franco. </P>
<P> The divorced Brazilian president made front-page news around the world this year due to a photograph of him with a curvaceous Carnival dancer who wore a skimpy T-shirt and no underwear. </P>
<P> The scandal blew up to even greater proportions when the young woman revealed to reporters that Franco had been phoning her to ask her out on a date. </P>
<P> Neither Menem nor Franco have tried to run away from their reputations -- a luxury not available to more traditional-minded U.S. leaders. </P>
<P> Clinton's alleged extramarital adventures have spawned lawsuits, smear campaigns and countless late-night television jokes. </P>
<P> Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer, an 88-year-old nearly blind bachelor, has managed to steer clear from controversy. </P>
<P> When a reporter once asked him why he remained single, he retorted that he enjoyed the liberty of being able to get out of bed on any side he pleased. </P>
<P> Other unescorted leaders are Nicaragua's widowed president, Violeta Chamorro; Dominica's unmarried prime minister, Eugenia Charles; Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who only quit as a Roman Catholic priest last month; Jamaica's divorced Prime Minister P.J. Patterson and St. Vincent's Prime Minister James Mitchell, who is also divorced. </P>
