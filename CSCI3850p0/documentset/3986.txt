<P> (Updates, adds testimony, Amtrak)  The financial condition of Amtrak, the nation's subsidized rail passenger service, has reached the critical stage, government auditors said Thursday. </P>
<P> Kenneth Mead, transportation director of the General Accounting Office, the government watchdog agency, said ''Amtrak's financial condition has reached a critical stage'' and its recently announced $430 million annual cost reduction plan will not relieve its future problems. </P>
<P> ``Amtrak's plan is an aggressive first step, but it will not solve the railroad's longer term problems,'' he told the Senate Commerce Committee. </P>
<P> Mead said Amtrak's cost reduction plan announced in December was designed to close the gap between its operating deficit and federal grants for 1995. </P>
<P> However, the gap will expand in 1996 and by the year 2000 will cumulatively total $1.3 billion. </P>
<P> Amtrak said its reductions in service and employees will help put it on the road to recovery by the year 2002 without the need for federal subsidies, but the government auditing agency cast doubt on that. </P>
<P> Mead said Amtrak is counting on more support from state and local governments, a more flexible labor agreement and more capital to improve deteriorating equipment. </P>
<P> ``Without these changes in its operating environment,'' Mead said, ``the recently announced cuts will be just the beginning of route abandonments and service cutbacks.'' </P>
<P> Amtrak gets almost $1 billion annually in federal backing, including about $390 million in operating help. Its cutbacks include laying off some 5,600 workers and ending service between many towns and cities coast to coast. </P>
<P> There have been fears within Amtrak that its proposed federal subsidies will be sharply curtailed as the new Republican-led Congress slashes spending in line with its commitments to reduce federal subsidies. </P>
<P> Amtrak President Thomas Downs told the committee that the Amtrak board believes its future lies in the heavily populated routes such as the much-traveled Northeast corridor between Washington, New York and Boston. </P>
<P> ``The new Amtrak,'' he said, ``must be customer-driven and should promote potentially profitable produce lines, such as the Auto Train, and incrementally profitable businesses wherever possible.'' </P>
