<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The worst U.S. corporate polluters are blue-chip firms such as Exxon, Union Carbide and International Paper, according to a report released Wednesday by the Council on Economic Priorities, a public interest research group. </P>
<P> Texaco, Westinghouse, Southern Companies, Westvaco, and, for the third consecutive year, MAXXAM -- a lumber, aluminum and metal products maker -- also made the list of worst polluters. </P>
<P> The eight corporations named to the 1994 list emphatically expressed their unhappiness with the council's list and the methodology used to place them on it. </P>
<P> The Council on Economic Priorities, a New York-based non-profit organization, compiles the list of worst corporate polluters as part of its Campaign for Cleaner Corporations, which tries to identify polluters and recommend practical ways for them to lessen any harm they do to the environment. </P>
<P> Exxon, on last year's list of worst polluters, returned this year -- largely because of an Aug. 8 explosion at a Baton Rouge refinery in which two people died. </P>
<P> International Paper, the world's largest forest products company, also made the council's list for the second time, but it was credited with reduced federal environmental standard violations. </P>
<P> MAXXAM ``exhibited a flagrant disregard for the environment'' and was the only company to merit a third appearance on the council's annual list, the group said. </P>
<P> Southern Company, one of America's largest publicly owned utilities, was cited for its use of high-sulfur coal. </P>
<P> Texaco, also listed for the second time in a row, came under fire for activities at home and abroad, including its work in the Ecuadoran rain forest and a pipe failure that led to an explosion at its Los Angeles refinery in October 1993. </P>
<P> The council said that 10 years after a gas leak at Union Carbide's plant in Bhopal, India, killed more than 2,000 people, the chemical company is still ``an industry leader in environmental offenses.'' </P>
<P> Westinghouse Electric was cited for higher than average emissions for the electrical equipment industry. </P>
<P> The report prompted a storm of protest from the listed corporations. </P>
<P> ``We disagree wholeheartedly with CEP's assessment of our environmental record,'' said a spokesman for MAXXAM, calling the council's methodology ``non-scientific and biased.'' </P>
<P> Thomas Jorling, vice president of environmental affairs at International Paper, called the paper giant's inclusion on the list a travesty. He said International Paper had acted on the recommendations the council made last year and said its good faith effort to work with the group was not reciprocated. </P>
<P> Exxon rejected the council's 1994 report, calling it ''replete with unsubstantiated, unfair and inaccurate statements about Exxon.'' It said the company was making ``continuous efforts to improve its environmental performance.'' </P>
<P> Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse said the council's annual environmental report card was based on erroneous or ``simply out of date'' environmental data. </P>
<P> Texaco called the council's report ``biased, unbalanced and lacking in perspective and objectivity.'' It disputed the council's statement that it had refused to meet with its judges and researchers for the review process. </P>
<P> To prepare its list, the council analyzes more than 100 corporations with help of a panel of independent judges from environmental groups, the investment community and academia. </P>
