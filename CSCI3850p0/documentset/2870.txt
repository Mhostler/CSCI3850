<P>  Italy's Interior Minister Roberto Maroni announced an inquiry Monday into how three policemen arrested on suspicion of a string of murders and robberies had managed to escape detection for so long. </P>
<P> The officers, from the central city of Bologna and the seaside resort of Rimini, are suspected of 21 murders including the killing of three Carabinieri paramilitary police in 1991. </P>
<P> Other crimes about which the trio are being questioned include a series of hold-ups since 1987 at highway toll booths, a raid on a police armory and a post office robbery in which 42 people were hurt when a bomb exploded. </P>
<P> They are suspected of forming the ``Uno Bianca'' gang -- so-called because it used a white Fiat Uno as a getaway car. Police are also investigating possible links with a shadowy extremist group known as the ``Armed Falange.'' </P>
<P> The three policemen were named as brothers Roberto and Alberto Savi, aged 40 and 29, and Pietro Gugliotta, 34. A third brother, 34-year-old truck driver Fabio Savi, was arrested along with his Romanian girlfriend Friday. </P>
<P> ``These were actions carried out by police officers over a long time, on their own territory and in a manner which might have given grounds for suspicion,'' Maroni told a police union crime conference in Milan. </P>
<P> ``I hope that the internal inquiry on what has happened will stop at nothing and no one,'' he said, adding that the arrests should not damage the overall credibility of Italian police. </P>
<P> National police chief Ferdinando Masone, due to visit Bologna with Maroni Wednesday, said he was deeply disturbed that the suspected culprits were found among his ranks. </P>
<P> Police union leader Roberto Sgalla said the inquiry had to find out whether anyone in the Bologna force had sought to cover up the alleged crimes of its officers. </P>
<P> ``That is the best way to restore calm and confidence among policemen who have continued to do their duty,'' Sgalla said. </P>
