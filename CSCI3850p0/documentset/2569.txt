<P>  Amanda Knatchbull, the woman who turned down a marriage proposal from Britain's Prince Charles, is furious about a book which revealed details of their relationship. </P>
<P> The Sunday Express newspaper said the granddaughter of Earl Mountbatten of Burma was shocked when their romance was recounted in Jonathan Dimbleby's biography of the prince. </P>
<P> ``I hate anything being written about me. I never ever wanted a single thing said about me publicly,'' the newspaper quotes her as saying. </P>
<P> ``I live down here (southern England) with my family, and that's all I want out of my life. I don't enjoy this sort of unwanted attention.'' </P>
<P> Dimbleby's book said the heir to the throne noticed that Knatchbull had ``grown into a very good-looking girl'' when the prince visited her parents in the Bahamas in 1973. </P>
<P> When Charles proposed, Dimbleby said her refusal was ``considered, gentle and immediate,'' but the newspaper claimed she laughed when the prince popped the question. </P>
<P> ``What a funny idea,'' she is quoted as saying. </P>
<P> Knatchbull, 37, is married to real estate agent Charles Ellingworth and has two young sons. </P>
<P> Dimbleby's controversial book, which caused a sensation when it was published last month, also revealed details of his enduring relationship with Camilla Parker-Bowles and his loveless marriage to his estranged wife, Princess Diana. </P>
