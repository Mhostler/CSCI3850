<P>  The father of an American youth arrested last year for vandalism and mischief, was himself fined Friday for using abusive language after prosecutors decided not to proceed on two charges of assault. </P>
<P> Robert Freehill, 51, who pleaded guilty, stood silently while Magistrate Billy Low convicted him on three charges of uttering abusive words against a policeman, a university lecturer and a condominium resident. </P>
<P> ``The court must state its displeasure over your discourteous behavior and abusive manner, especially against the policeman,'' Low said. ``But you have the courage to plead guilty at the earliest opportunity and demonstrate remorse.'' </P>
<P> Freehill, a company regional director, was fined a total of Singapore $1,700 or 10 weeks in jail in default. He immediately paid the fine. </P>
<P> Deputy public prosecutor Shaiffudin Saruwan told reporters the prosecution decided not to proceed with two charges of assault, which carried stiffer punishment. He gave no reasons. </P>
<P> ``But we asked the judge to take into consideration the two charges in sentencing him,'' Shaiffudin said. </P>
<P> Freehill had been on bail of $6,800 and had had his passport confiscated. The court returned his passport on Friday. </P>
<P> Freehill's lawyer, N. Sreenivasan, said his client had been under considerable pressure due to harassment and the wide publicity given to the case. </P>
<P> ``He received nuisance calls and threatening letters since he was charged,'' Sreenivasan said. </P>
<P> Police sources said Freehill's case was unrelated to the vandalism case involving his son, Stephen. </P>
<P> Stephen, 17, was arrested for spray painting cars in the company of American Michael Fay, 19, a Malaysian minor, Hong Kong youth Shiu Chi Ho, 17, and others in September last year. He was also charged with mischief and keeping stolen property. </P>
<P> The vandalism and mischief charges were later dropped and Stephen was fined for keeping stolen property. If the vandalism charges had not been dropped and he had been convicted, he could have been sentenced to 12 or more strokes of caning on his bare buttocks. </P>
<P> Fay received four strokes of the cane on May 5, served 83 days in prison and paid a $2,340 fine for vandalism and other offences. </P>
<P> His caning sentence was reduced to from six strokes after appeals for clemency from President Clinton. </P>
<P> Shiu received six strokes of the cane on June 23. His sentence was reduced from 12 strokes following a clemency appeal to Singapore President Ong Teng Cheong. </P>
