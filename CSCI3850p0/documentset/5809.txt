<DATELINE>ST. HELIER, Jersey (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  British maritime officials began an investigation after more than 300 people were rescued Monday from a ferry that crashed into a rock off the coast of Jersey in the Channel Islands. </P>
<P> About 40 of the mostly German passengers were injured as they scrambled into lifeboats as waves of up to four feet pounded the badly listing French catamaran Saint Malo and water poured into her damaged hull. </P>
<P> The passengers were picked up by a flotilla of rescue ships or hoisted into helicopters. </P>
<P> ``The Jersey authorities have asked the Maritime Accident Investigation Branch of the Department of Transport to investigate on their behalf,'' a government spokesman said. </P>
<P> Thirty-three of the injured passengers were treated in hospitals in St. Helier, many with broken limbs. Others were cared for in the ferry terminal when they reached shore. Jersey police said 185 passengers were German, 75 British and 40 French. </P>
<P> The captain of the Saint Malo, which sails between the British-ruled Channel Islands and the French port of Saint Malo, issued a mayday Monday morning 15 minutes after leaving Jersey for a day trip to the island of Sark. </P>
<P> An eyewitness said the Saint Malo appeared to be taking a short cut through a passage near the Corbiere lighthouse which is passable at high tide. It saves about five minutes on the hour-long journey to Sark. </P>
<P> ``I saw her coming round the lighthouse doing the short cut that they normally do and I noticed she was coming in too close to the land,'' retired painter Dave Turner told reporters. </P>
<P> ``She came in too close and she started to turn out to miss the rock that she hit. But she hit it on her port side. She sort of jolted around and started to sink straight away,'' he added. </P>
<P> A passenger on the ferry gave a similar account. </P>
<P> ``Just as we came around Corbiere lighthouse it sort of went in the bay a bit and there was this rough grating noise, obviously we had gone over something. Then shortly after you could smell diesel (fuel), then it just tipped to one side,'' a passenger told BBC television. </P>
<P> St. Helier harbormaster Capt. Roy Bullen said small boats with experienced masters would use the short cut but people with less experience and larger ships would avoid the route. </P>
<P> A French doctor who treated the wounded aboard the ferry Le Trident, which picked up 97 passengers from the Saint Malo, also criticized security measures on the ferry. </P>
<P> ``There were no ladders on the Saint Malo and people had to throw themselves on top of each other in the liferafts. That is how they were injured,'' said Pierre Heinrich. </P>
<P> ``It's a miracle there were no dead. It is because the sea was relatively moderate at that point. But some people were very cold and shocked,'' he added. </P>
<P> Eric Avierinos, chairman of the ferry company Channiland, a subsidiary of the Anglo-French company Sealink, told a news conference in Saint Malo the boat ``hit a rock southwest of Jersey for undetermined reasons, opening a breach.'' </P>
<P> ``It was absolutely up to regulation standards and no technical problem can explain what happened,'' he said, adding the captain was an experienced sailor who knew the zone well. </P>
<P> The rescue operation lasted about an hour. ``People were very shocked, some were close to a nervous breakdown. There were lots of old people,'' said Lydie Bizolon, a French woman aboard the Trident. ``But they were very calm in the liferafts,'' she said. </P>
<P> French maritime authorities also opened an investigation into the accident involving the 3-year-old ferry. </P>
