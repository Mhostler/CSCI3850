<P>  The United States wants the General Assembly session which opened Tuesday to drop from its Middle East resolutions language dealing with matters still to be negotiated between Israel and the Palestinians. </P>
<P> ``We ... believe that resolution language referring to 'final status' issues should be dropped, since these issues are now under negotiation by the parties themselves,'' American U.N. envoy Madeleine Albright said in a letter sent to most U.N. delegations.  ``These include refugees, settlements, territorial sovereignty and the status of Jerusalem,'' she added. </P>
<P> These are matters which Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization agreed last year to discuss only at the start of the third year of a five-year interim period of Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. </P>
<P> Albright's letter, sent last month, dealt with a variety of issues due to come before the assembly, including economic and environmental matters and disarmament and arms control. </P>
<P> Concerning the Middle East, she wrote: ``The UNGA (U.N. General Assembly) should reinforce the peace process by promoting reconciliation, supporting agreements between the parties, and fostering economic development. </P>
<P> ``Adopting a positive resolution welcoming progress in the peace process, as we did in 1993, will test the U.N.'s new realistic approach.''  At the same time, she added, contentious resolutions that accentuated political differences without promoting solutions should be consolidated, improved or eliminated. </P>
<P> Albright also said Palestinian autonomy should be supported ``by redirecting resources from obsolete entities (such as the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices) to U.N. programs that assist Palestinians to develop the self-governing territories.'' </P>
