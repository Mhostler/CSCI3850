<DATELINE>OKLAHOMA CITY (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  When the Oklahoma City office building collapsed around him, Raymond Washburn, who has been blind for most of his life, heaved a pile of rubble off his legs and led a sobbing employee to safety. </P>
<P> Washburn, who lost his sight as a child, recalled Friday how he felt something fall on him as he was about to wait on a customer Wednesday morning at the concession stand he ran on the building's fourth floor. </P>
<P> ``I tried to run but I couldn't run,'' he said from St. Anthony Hospital, where he was being treated for post-traumatic stress. ``The stuff kept coming down.'' </P>
<P> But Washburn said that when he heard the cries of his employee Kim Wallace, ``I pushed real hard at the stuff that was on me and managed to get it up to where I could walk. </P>
<P> ``She grabbed hold of me and I told her, 'hold on, we've got to get out of here,''' said the 48-yearold Washburn, who normally travels with the help of a red-and-white cane. </P>
<P> He said that as he was helping the woman away from the scene of the blast, he did not realize they were heading toward the front of the building, which had been blown away. One of his customers warned them to turn around and they fled to safety down a back staircase. </P>
<P> Wallace suffered minor cuts, Washburn said. He said he heard no explosion but could smell smoke and thought there was a fire. ``I could feel glass, I could feel debris,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``I heard cries, I heard people holler. They were wanting the same thing we were wanting. We wanted help,'' he said. ``I would imagine the two of us were doing most of the hollering. I thought everything had caved in and we were gone.'' </P>
<P> Washburn, who has sold soup, sandwiches and candy from the concession stand for the eight years and is president of a national organization of blind vendors, now worries about what he will do next. ``My livelihood is gone,'' he said. And even if the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building is rebuilt, he said, ``I don't think I'd want to go back.'' </P>
