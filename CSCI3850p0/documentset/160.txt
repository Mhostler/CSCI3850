<DATELINE>BEIJING (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  China's leaders and diplomats from friendly countries Monday mourned President Kim Il-Sung at his Beijing embassy but there was no sign of representatives from South Korea, Japan or the United States. </P>
<P> Kim died in Pyongyang on Friday, reportedly from a heart attack. </P>
<P> A giant portrait of the Great Leader overlooked a large embassy function room, half of which was covered in floral tributes, into which visitors were ushered in in groups of 20 and bowed three times in front of the portrait, while somber music was played. </P>
<P> Chinese leaders including President Jiang Zemin, arriving in a fleet of black limousines, were swept into the embassy to pay their respects to a man who fought alongside many of China's Communist veterans in the anti-Japanese war. </P>
<P> Other visitors included Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk and diplomats from friendly nations with North Korea, such as Sri Lanka. </P>
<P> A spokesman for the United States said that, as of late afternoon, the embassy had received no instruction from Washington on whether to send a representative. </P>
<P> A Japanese diplomat said that, as Tokyo has no diplomatic relations with Pyongyang, his embassy had not sent anyone. </P>
<P> Witnesses said no one had come from the South Korean embassy. An embassy official was unavailable for comment. </P>
<P> Other visitors included Korean Japanese, ethnic Koreans from China and members of Chinese military families who knew Kim personally. </P>
<P> ``My father fought the Japanese with the late President,'' said a middle-aged Chinese woman dressed in black. ``I saw him only last year and he looked well. This is a great shock.'' </P>
<P> Another woman, also the daughter of a military family, said that Kim was the Chairman Mao of North Korea. Asked about the poor state of its economy, she said each country's own path of development must be respected. </P>
<P> ``He was a hero of the nation,'' said an ethnic Korean resident in China. ``North Korea will not copy China in its reforms but make its own way.'' </P>
<P> But not all the Chinese were so positive. </P>
<P> ``He was a dictator and forced us to give him aid,'' said one driver waiting outside the embassy. ``China has millions of poor people. Why should we have to give oil and grain to North Korea, which will never repay us?'' </P>
<P> ``In the 1950s we used to be close friends with North Korea,'' commented one taxi driver. ``But North Korea has become a backward country and fallen behind China. You never see North Korean goods in the shops, but they are full of goods from South Korea.'' </P>
<P> ``We do not want relations with countries that have nothing to give us,'' he said. ``We want something in return.'' </P>
