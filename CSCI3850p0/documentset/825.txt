<P>  A radical Palestinian group which taught ``Carlos the Jackal'' his guerrilla trade condemned Sudan Wednesday for handing him to France. </P>
<P> The Damascus-based Marxist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) led by George Habash praised Carlos, whose real name is Illich Ramirez Sanchez, and expressed its solidarity with him. </P>
<P> ``The PFLP condemns the handover of Carlos and considers it as a cheap action against an international struggler who served liberation movements,'' a spokesman for the group told Reuters. </P>
<P> He said Carlos, who appeared in court in France Tuesday after his capture in Sudan Monday, had joined the PFLP in the late 1960s but ended his ties with the group in the early 1970s. </P>
<P> ``The Sudanese government could have asked Carlos to leave the country had his presence constituted a danger or had it faced any pressure,'' the PFLP spokesman said. </P>
<P> ``No links or ties have existed with Carlos since he left the group. But we express our solidarity with him,'' he added. </P>
<P> The PFLP is part of an alliance of 10 radical Palestinian groups based in Syria that oppose the peace accord between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization. </P>
<P> The PFLP carried out guerrilla attacks against Western and Israeli targets in the early 1970s. </P>
<P> In Budapest, Hungary's top secret service official said former communist authorities allowed Carlos to live in Hungary in the 1970s and early 1980s out of fear of reprisals if he were deported. </P>
<P> Bela Katona, a minister without portfolio who supervises the country's civil secret services, said on radio that Hungary had closed its borders to Carlos after 1985. </P>
<P> Until then the world's most wanted guerrilla, now behind bars in a Paris jail, lived a life of luxury in communist Hungary, enjoying expensive hotels, women and the finest western liquor. </P>
