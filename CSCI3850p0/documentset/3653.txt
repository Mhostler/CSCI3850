<P>  Foreign ministers of Indonesia and Portugal agreed Monday that the United Nations should sponsor talks between rival East Timorese factions who support and oppose integration with Jakarta. </P>
<P> But, under an agreement mediated by U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the Timorese will not be allowed to address the crucial issue of their territory's political future 20 years after its annexation by Indonesia. </P>
<P> A statement issued after four hours of talks in Geneva said the objective of the dialog would be a ``free and informal exchange of ideas of a practical nature that might have a positive impact on the situation in East Timor...'' </P>
<P> But the statement added: ``The dialog will not address the political status of East Timor and will in no way constitute a parallel negotiating track or be a substitute for the ministerial talks under the auspices of the Secretary-General.'' </P>
<P> Indonesia invaded the territory in 1975 after the departure of its Portuguese colonizers. Its annexation a year later has never been recognized by the United Nations, which still formally considers East Timor to be under Portuguese administration. </P>
<P> Portuguese Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Durao Barroso welcomed the agreement, saying it had long been Portugal's aim to get the Timorese involved in the negotiating process. </P>
<P> ``This is a very important point, I think, because Portugal has always made it clear that the East Timorese should be associated with the process -- because after all we are discussing East Timor,'' Barroso told Reuters as he left the luxury hotel where the ministers held a working lunch. </P>
<P> But Barroso conceded that progress was slow toward a final political settlement of the East Timor issue. </P>
<P> ``It is not going as far as we'd like but you know they are very different the positions of Portugal and Indonesia. Indonesia invaded the territory and they do not consider it as a process of self-determination; they just consider it as a part, a province, of Indonesia,'' he said. </P>
