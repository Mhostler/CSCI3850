<P>  South Africa is facing the worst crime wave in its history, a regional police chief said Monday. </P>
<P> ``Never before in our history has South Africa been threatened by crime as it was now,'' said Lt. Gen. Sharma Maharaj, police chief in South Africa's industrial and commercial heartland, Gauteng province. </P>
<P> Maharaj told reporters no South African was immune to crime. ``It is an accepted fact that crime affects the life of every citizen in our country. Nobody is immune from this threat,'' he added. </P>
<P> A leading psychologist said last week police needed to do more to combat serious crime in South Africa, which he said was the world's most violent country outside of a war zone. </P>
<P> In 1994, on average 50 people were murdered in South Africa daily. The country also has a high rate of rape. </P>
<P> Maharaj said there were more than 69,000 burglaries last year and over 6,000 cars were hijacked, often at gun or knife-point, in Gauteng province, mainly in Johannesburg. </P>
