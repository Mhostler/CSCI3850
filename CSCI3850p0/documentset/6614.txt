<DATELINE>JAKARTA, May 17 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Some 210 animal species are near extinction in Indonesia because their habitats are being damaged by development projects and natural disasters, the official Antara news agency said on Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``These animals include 126 species of birds, 63 mammals and 21 reptiles,'' Soemarsono, director general of forest conservation and nature preservation, was quoted as saying. </P>
<P> A conservation department official confirmed the report and said Indonesia, home to a vast array of fauna and flora and the world's largest tropical forests after Brazil, must do more to ensure the longevity of some 500 protected species. </P>
<P> The official, who said the 210 species near extinction were included in the government's list of around 500 protected species, said many animals were endangered by factors such as logging, hunting, forest fires and development projects. </P>
<P> ``Obviously 210 is a big number. It is deplorable we have so many animals facing extinction,'' the official, who declined to be identified, told Reuters. </P>
<P> Soemarsono was quoted as saying the decreasing number of habitats would reduce the population of the animals. </P>
<P> ``If the fragmentation of the habitats can no longer be tolerated by the animals, they will disappear from Indonesia,'' Soemarsono said. </P>
<P> Apart from damage to the environment by humans, Indonesia is regularly hit by earthquakes, severe floods and forest fires. </P>
<P> Some species, such as the Javanese eagle and insect-eating birds of the eastern island of Sulawesi, have already been declared extinct in the last few years, Soemarsono said. </P>
<P> Antara also said Indonesia, one of the biggest timber producers in the world, had lost up to 100 species of tree because of extensive logging activities. It gave no time period. </P>
<P> Indonesia, whose tropical forest cover encloses some of the most inhospitable terrain in the world, has been accused by the World Bank of felling trees at faster than sustainable rates. </P>
<P> Environmentalists and officials also blame logging and traditional slash-and-burn farming as the main causes of forest fires last October in Sumatra and Kalimantan, Indonesia's part of Borneo island. </P>
<P> The fires, which razed five million hectares (12 million acres) of land, blanketed Singapore and parts of Malaysia in thick haze. </P>
