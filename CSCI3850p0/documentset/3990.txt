<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Clinton administration's uphill battle for congressional approval of its Mexico aid plan won a possible boost Thursday when the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said it would consider Mexico's request for a $7.7 billion standby loan. </P>
<P> Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin hailed the IMF action as he and other officials sought support for the U.S. plan to provide Mexico $40 billion in loan guarantees. </P>
<P> He told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: ``This IMF agreement demonstrates the support of the international community for dealing with this very serious problem.'' </P>
<P> In the House, meanwhile, negotiators reported progress on legislation to implement the guarantee plan. </P>
<P> ``We are near a final draft,'' Banking Committee Chairman Jim Leach, R-Iowa, said. </P>
<P> Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., who heads negotiations for the Democrats, said: ``We seem to be coming to agreement on the labor stuff'' -- referring to conditions sought by Democrats on Mexican labor issues. </P>
<P> The administration has proposed some issues be addressed by a side letter rather than as a condition on the guarantees. </P>
<P> Frank declined to specify how the issues would be handled but said: ``I think we will be able to work out both statement and conditions and the enforcement mechanisms.'' </P>
<P> After appearing with Rubin before the Senate committee, Secretary of State Warren Christopher told reporters: ``I believe we are making progress. We are beginning to see a package coming into view on this very difficult problem.'' </P>
<P> During the hearing Rubin said the planned IMF package -- the largest ever -- ``signals how important the international community considers the situation that we are now facing in Mexico.'' </P>
<P> He said the economic requirements to be laid down by the IMF were similar to those being sought by the United States and would reinforce them. </P>
<P> But the administration's loan guarantee plan aimed at shoring up the peso and helping Mexico out of a financial bind, is finding wide skepticism among members of Congress. </P>
<P> Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole told reporters earlier: ''We may have to change the proposal in some ways. The important thing is to reduce the risk to the taxpayer.'' He did not elaborate. </P>
<P> There was no immediate indication how the IMF action would affect congressional attitudes to the Mexico plan but some members had been asking why the United States was acting alone and whether it was taking an undue risk. </P>
<P> Committee members continued to voice doubts, saying the plan was difficult to explain to voters back home. </P>
<P> California Democrat Dianne Feinstein said she would insist on linking Mexican action on illegal immigration to the aid. </P>
<P> Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, a Kansas Republican, said she had been getting calls from her state from people who did not understand why Washington was proposing the loan guarantees. </P>
<P> But she also told of a Kansas restaurant firm that had had its Mexican expansion plans frozen by the financial crunch. </P>
<P> Appearing with Rubin before the committee in addition to Christopher was Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan. The three had argued the case for the loan guarantees before the House Banking Committee Wednesday. </P>
<P> Earlier Thursday, William Seidman, former head of the agency that led the bailout of the U.S. savings and loan industry, said that imposing conditions on the rescue plan would lead to Mexican resentment and foreign policy problems. </P>
<P> Critics at both ends of the political spectrum, reflecting growing public unease over the plan, have either opposed it or sought to attach political and economic conditions. </P>
<P> The administration also has conditions that include requiring payment from Mexican oil export revenues if needed. </P>
<P> Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said the U.S. and Mexican governments ``have created an unhappy scenario in which Mexico has grown dependent on us to remedy Mexico's financial problems.'' </P>
<P> He said that allowing the markets to ``run their course'' might provide a better way to solve Mexico's problem. </P>
<P> President Clinton, speaking by satellite to a meeting of the World Economic Council in Davos, Switzerland, said he was confident the package would eventually be approved. </P>
