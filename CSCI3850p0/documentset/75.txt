<P>  Secretary of State Warren Christopher hailed Yasser Arafat's arrival in Jericho on Tuesday as ``thrilling'' and said he was likely to meet the PLO leader on a Middle East peace mission later this month. </P>
<P> Christopher said that Arafat's return to the West Bank after 27 years was an important sign that life for Palestinians was beginning to change in major ways. </P>
<P> The secretary announced last week that he would start another peace mission to the Middle East on July 17. </P>
<P> In an interview with Reuters on his flight from London to Geneva for talks on Bosnia, Christopher said his Middle East trip would be important because ``this is the right moment to make progress'' on peace negotiations between Israel and Syria and between Israel and Jordan. </P>
<P> Many hard-line Israelis have condemned Arafat's visit to the Gaza Strip and the West Bank city of Jericho, launching vigorous protests against the Israeli government for allowing the trip. </P>
<P> The visit by the Palestine Liberation Organization chairman, which began Friday, took in areas that had been ruled by Israel since the 1967 Middle East War but are now under Palestinian self-rule because of the agreement signed in Washington last September between Israel and the PLO. </P>
<P> ``It was quite thrilling to see Arafat in Jericho this morning,'' Chrsitopher said. ``That's a very positive step forward.'' </P>
<P> He said there were ``indications'' that Arafat would make his headquarters between Gaza and Jericho and said: ``That's one more step in the implementation of the declaration of principles. ... It's beginning to show some change and improvement on the ground.'' </P>
<P> Christopher, pushing to follow up the Israel-PLO accord, has become directly involved in pursuing an agreement between the Israelis and Syrians, personally carrying peace proposals between the two sides. </P>
<P> Christopher said he would probably go to the West Bank on his next trip and would probably see Arafat since ``I generally see him whenever I go to the region now.'' But there were no definite plans for such a meeting. </P>
