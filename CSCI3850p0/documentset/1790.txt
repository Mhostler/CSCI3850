<P>  Farm groups were quick to lament the resignation of Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy Monday, but they were equally as quick to speculate on who might replace him. </P>
<P> Citing pressure from constant allegations of ethical improprieties, the embattled Espy said he will leave office December 31, telling a packed press conference he ``hoped the media will give as much ink to my exoneration as they have to the accusations.'' </P>
<P> The American Farm Bureau Federation, one of the largest farm organizations, said of Espy: ``I think he has been well accepted and well regarded in the agricultural community and we're sorry to see him resign. The impact of it will depend on who his replacement will be.'' </P>
<P> National Farmers Union vice president of government relations Larry Mitchell said he thought Deputy Secretary Richard Rominger was a possible replacement, as was Indiana Rep. Jill Long, one of the few women on the House Agriculture Committee. </P>
<P> ``It's very unfortunate, he was a secretary with much potential, much of which he used to help family farmers,'' Mitchell said in an interview. </P>
<P> However, the front-runner to replace Espy at this point is former North Dakota Govenor George Sinner, agriculture officials said. </P>
<P> A father of 10 who underwent heart bypass surgery in 1991, Sinner was first mentioned as a possible agriculture secretary candidate when Clinton first took office. </P>
<P> Another frequently mentioned replacement is outgoing Oklahoma Rep. Michael Synar. </P>
<P> Recently defeated in a Democratic primary runoff, Synar has consistently voted the Clinton agenda and is known to be close to the administration. </P>
<P> However, his attempt to raise grazing fees on public lands has made him unpopular. He also pushed for restrictions on tobacco advertising and stricter regulations on tobacco by the Food and Drug Administration. Both of these issues will work against his possible selection, observers say. </P>
<P> Farm Bureau Executive Director Richard Newpher speculated on possible replacements, including Undersecretary for International Affairs Eugene Moos. </P>
<P> Moos is an extremely popular administrator, much admired for his extensive foreign trade experience and long-time ties to the agricultural community. </P>
<P> Espy has been under fire since February for accepting illegal gifts and plane tickets, taking overly frequent trips to his home state of Mississippi at taxpayer expense and the appearance of favoritism in meat and poultry inspection legislation. </P>
<P> He will remain in office until December 31, 1994, and acknowledged he would be somewhat of a lame-duck administrator. </P>
<P> President Clinton accepted Espy's resignation ``with regret'' but added ``it was appropriate ... and would permit him to name a successor efficiently and facilitate the work of the department.'' </P>
<P> Clinton added that he was ``troubled by the appearance of some of the incidents and believe his decision to leave is appropriate''. </P>
<P> While Espy was generally liked on a personal level and admired for his persistent attempts to push for reorganization of the department, there are some that say this reform move is what ultimately bought him down. </P>
<P> When asked if he thought his attempts to modernize the meat and poultry inspection service were behind his demise, Espy responded with a wry smile ``I will let you work that out.'' </P>
