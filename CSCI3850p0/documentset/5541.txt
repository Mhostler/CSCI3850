<P>  Turkish President Suleyman Demirel arrived in Chile on Thursday for a three-day visit aimed at bolstering trade ties between his country and Chile's fast-growing economy. </P>
<P> Joined by an entourage which Chilean officials said numbered 190 people including many top Turkish businessmen, Demirel arrived from Argentina and was met by Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza. </P>
<P> ``His visit is mainly related to economic ties, which Chile is starting to develop in the Mediterranean area,'' said Deputy Foreign Minister Mariano Fernandez. </P>
<P> Asked if Chilean officials would raise the issue of Turkey's treatment of Kurdish separatists with Demirel, Fernandez said only that they would ``make our concerns known to the president.'' </P>
<P> ``But for Chile, the focal point is the intensification of our economic ties,'' Fernandez told reporters. Demirel, on a Latin American tour, continues on to Brazil on Sunday. </P>
