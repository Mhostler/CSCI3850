<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The House began debate on a welfare reform bill Tuesday that aims to make the most sweeping changes in social programs since the New Deal. </P>
<P> Republicans struggled to work out a consensus on the bill's abortion provisions, which have split the party and the conservative movement. </P>
<P> Even before the first vote was cast, lawmakers engaged in a shouting match over a speech by Georgia Democrat John Lewis that criticized the bill, using references to the Holocaust. </P>
<P> ``I urge my colleagues to open your eyes ... they are coming for our children, they coming for the poor, they are coming for the sick, the elderly, the disabled,'' Lewis said. </P>
<P> His statement prompted an emotional rebuke from Florida Republican Clay Shaw, a chief architect of the plan. </P>
<P> ``There is no one in this House that I have had more respect for ... for you to come on this floor and compare the Republicans to the reign of the Nazis is an absolute outrage,'' Shaw said. </P>
<P> During debate, Republican leaders tried to work out a compromise on provisions of the bill barring cash aid to unwed mothers under age 18 and barring additional aid to mothers who have more children while on welfare -- the ``family cap.'' </P>
<P> Catholic bishops and the National Right to Life Committee fear limiting aid will encourage poor women to have more abortions. But the Christian Coalition and other conservative groups believe cutting off aid will curtail illegitimacy. </P>
<P> ``We believe this bill is pro-life and pro-family because it challenges the culture that has led to the social acceptance of illegitimacy and abortion,'' said Gary Bauer, president of the Family Research Council. </P>
<P> Lawmakers delayed a session of the Rules Committee, scheduled to decide what amendments would be in order on the floor later this week, as they tried to work out a deal. </P>
<P> Lawmakers were ready to accept an amendment drafted by New Jersey Republican Chris Smith to give mothers vouchers, rather than cash, for baby supplies if they had children while on welfare. </P>
<P> But they wanted to modify an amendment by Oregon Republican Jim Bunn allowing states to provide vouchers or cash to guardians of unwed teen-agers who met certain rules. </P>
<P> There was also disagreement on a provision giving cash bonuses to states that cut illegitimacy rates. </P>
<P> ``On the one side you don't want to be offering cash inducement and encouraging young girls to get pregnant at 12, 13, 14 years of age,'' said House Speaker Newt Gingrich. ``On the other hand you don't want to be setting up an incentive for abortion.''  The welfare reform bill, a key element of the House Republicans' Contract with America, would give states unprecedented authority over cash welfare, school lunch and nutrition programs, saving the government about $66 billion over five years. </P>
<P> It would bar most welfare benefits to legal immigrants, cut the Supplemental Security Income program for poor, disabled children, require states to put welfare recipients to work after two years and limit benefits to five years. </P>
<P> Clinton wrote Gingrich Tuesday criticizing the bill as weak on work and tough on children. The president, who campaigned on welfare reform in 1992 but delayed action on the issue to focus on health care, held out hope for a bipartisan compromise. The Senate is expected to make major changes. </P>
<P> ``I have always sought to make welfare reform a bipartisan issue. I still believe it can and must be,'' Clinton said. </P>
<P> ``Unfortunately, the House Republican bill in its current form ... is too weak on moving people from welfare to work, not as tough as it should be on deadbeat parents and too tough on innocent children,'' he said. </P>
<P> Gingrich called Clinton's letter ``moderately encouraging.'' </P>
<P> The Congressional Budget Office said 2.8 million families would lose all or some of their cash welfare benefits in the next five years, a number that could rise sharply after the year 2000 as people reached the five-year limit on benefits. </P>
