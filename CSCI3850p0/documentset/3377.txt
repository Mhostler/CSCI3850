<P>  President Clinton has written to Pope John Paul calling for closer co-operation with the Roman Catholic Church on humanitarian aid, a senior American diplomat said Thursday. </P>
<P> Raymond Flynn, the U.S. ambassador to the Holy See, said Clinton proposed that U.S. aid organizations and the Church share information about crisis-hit areas to channel aid more effectively to its recipents. </P>
<P> ``I believe that by working together more closely and co-ordinating our responses to humanitarian crisis, we could significantly alleviate the suffering,'' Clinton wrote. </P>
<P> ``I hope that we can work together to better alleviate the human suffering in a world with too many man-made and natural disasters,'' he added. </P>
<P> Clinton proposed that Vatican officials study a system for exchanging information with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). </P>
<P> Flynn, a former mayor of Boston, told Reuters that a demonstrably efficient system to co-ordinate aid would help convince Americans to accept the large amounts of public money spent on aid. </P>
<P> ``The U.S. is the only remaining superpower in the world and the Catholic Church is its most important moral force,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``The people of the U.S. will support (aid) so long as they are assured that their tax dollars are going to women and children who are suffering.'' </P>
<P> Chief Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said the Holy See did not normally comment on the Pope's correspondence. </P>
<P> Clinton's move comes at a time of growing debate in the U.S. over how much aid the country should pay out. </P>
<P> The new chairman of the U.S. Senate subcommittee that controls foreign aid spending proposed last week to cut foreign aid to most parts of the world except Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Russia. </P>
<P> Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and incoming chairman of the Appropriations foreign operations subcommittee, proposed cutting the $13.7 billion foreign operations budget back to $12 billion. </P>
<P> Arch conservative Jesse Helms, a North Carolina Republican tipped to become the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, is a vigorous opponent of most U.S. foreign aid. The committee sets policy for foreign aid but does not control spending. </P>
