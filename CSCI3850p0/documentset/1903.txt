<P>  Middle East peacemakers are hot candidates for the 1994 Nobel Peace prize, but a tightlipped Nobel Institute has even refused to say if a winner has been chosen for Friday's award. </P>
<P> The Norwegian media has named Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and PLO chairman Yasser Arafat as probable winners of the prize for their 1993 Israel-PLO peace pact. </P>
<P> But the Nobel Institute appears determined not to give any hints before announcing the winner or winners Friday. </P>
<P> ``We are making use of the time until the 14th,'' Geir Lundestad, head of the Nobel Institute, told Reuters. </P>
<P> He declined to say whether the five-member Nobel committee had held its last meeting or if it had chosen a winner among the 132 nominees, of which 35 are organzations. </P>
<P> Elie Wiesel, the 1986 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, suggested the committee was agonizing over whether Rabin or Peres should share the award with Arafat. </P>
<P> ``I'm not on the Nobel jury but I know that they're having a hard time deciding,'' the Jewish author and human rights campaigner told Europe 1 radio in Paris last week. </P>
<P> The prestigious prize has never been shared by more than two candidates in its 93-year history. </P>
<P> Nobel guidelines, amended last year, suggest the award should be shared by no more than three people, but Lundestad has earlier said there seemed to be no strict rules. </P>
<P> The Nobel Committee may also decide not to award any prize and plough the money -- $950,000 -- back into the fund. The last time this happened was in 1972. </P>
<P> Six Nobel awards are made each year for outstanding achievements in medicine, chemistry, physics, economics, literature and peace. They were bequeathed in 1901 by Swedish inventor of dynamite Alfred Nobel. </P>
