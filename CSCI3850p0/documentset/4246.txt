<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif.(Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Second seed Michael Chang rifled 12 aces past fellow American Jonathan Stark on Wednesday for a 7-5, 6-4 second-round victory to reach the quarterfinals of the $328,000 San Jose Open Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``It was a good match overall,'' said the sixth-ranked Chang, who won titles here in 1988 and 1992. </P>
<P> ``I think we were both playing good tennis. It was pretty tight and I was fortunate to get that sole break in the first set. That kind of opened things up a little bit. I think he got frustrated in the first set after he fought so hard.'' </P>
<P> Third seed Jim Courier, ranked 11th in the world, gave fellow American Steve Campbell a lesson from the backcourt, beating the 24-year-old qualifier 6-2, 6-4 in 65 minutes to complete first-round play. </P>
<P> The former world No. 1, who led the United States over France in a Davis Cup tie over the weekend, admitted to fatigue but still managed to raise his record to 12-1 this year. </P>
<P> ``It was hard to get fired up,'' said Courier, who has won 31 of 33 sets this year. ``I felt flat coming out, but once we started, the juices started flowing and it was straight forward.'' </P>
<P> Chang had a tougher time before finally dispatching his hard-serving opponent. </P>
<P> He broke Stark at love in the decisive 11th game for a 6-5 lead before serving out the set. </P>
<P> The second set was levelled at 2-2 with back-to-back breaks before Chang took control with his new high-powered service game, which yielded just two points in the final three service games. </P>
<P> Stark thought Chang played well but admitted the break in the opening set was the difference in the one-hour, 24-minute match. </P>
<P> ``The key was when he got the break at 5-5 with some great passing shots,'' Stark said. </P>
<P> ``Anyone who plays him has to play at a real high level to beat him. Against Michael, you always have to hit that extra ball. He's tough and very competitive.'' </P>
<P> Stark added, ``He served well. It's something he worked on and it's really improved his game.'' </P>
