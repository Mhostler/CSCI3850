<P>  Peruvian authorities urged repentant guerrillas to turn themselves in and enjoy the benefits of an amnesty law due to expire at the stroke of midnight Monday. </P>
<P> President Alberto Fujimori warned guerrillas still in the field to surrender by the deadline or face tough prison terms. ''There are only a few hours before the deadline expires and there is no extension. I clearly warn you I will not back down,'' Fujimori said Sunday. </P>
<P> Fujimori urged guerrillas to turn themselves in before Tuesday ``or face arrest after the deadline which can mean a 20-year sentence.'' </P>
<P> The law was one of a series of anti-terrorism measures Fujimori's government decreed after declaring emergency rule in April 1992 in a bid to crush a Maoist insurgency and a smaller pro-Cuban guerrilla movement. </P>
<P> By mid-October, 5,416 Peruvians had sought amnesty under the law and 1,204 were enjoying its benefits, which in most cases meant exemption from conviction and sentencing, said Victor Perez, a lawyer who heads a government panel overseeing the law. </P>
<P> ``An important number'' of repentant guerrillas had turned themselves in recent days, especially in the north-central zone of Huanuco, Perez said. </P>
<P> ``We hope that by the time the law has expired we'll have a much higher number enjoying the benefits of the law,'' he said. </P>
<P> Local newspapers reported over the weekend that dozens of guerrillas were lining up to surrender at military posts in different areas of Peru but the reports could not be immediately confirmed. </P>
