<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Clinton administration has taken a series of steps it hopes will smooth over a row with Russia over proposals to expand NATO, including a written assurance Washington has no objection in principle to the ``new Russia'' becoming a full member, the Washington Post reported. </P>
<P> The newspaper, in its Sunday edition, quoted U.S. and NATO sources saying that alliance members also were working on a draft statement expressing satisfaction with the existing nuclear balance in Europe, thereby effectively ruling out deployment of nuclear missiles in former Soviet bloc nations. </P>
<P> The statement was being held ``in reserve'' as a future concession to Russia in the expectation that Russia and NATO would launch a special dialogue after next week's summit between President Clinton and President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow, diplomats were quoted as saying. </P>
<P> U.S. officials told the Post a decision on whether and when to issue the statement had not been made. </P>
<P> A senior Russian official said Saturday that Yeltsin planned to raise his objections to the proposed expansion of NATO early and often during the summit. </P>
<P> ``This will be a key issue,'' Defense Minister Pavel Grachev said. ``It will be raised when President Boris Yeltsin and U.S. President Bill Clinton meet face to face and the problem will later be diiscussed at formal talks.'' </P>
<P> Clinton, along with 50 or so other world leaders, will arrive in Moscow Tuesday to attend the celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe. He will hold summit talks with Yeltsin Wednesday. </P>
<P> The Post said that U.S. and Russian diplomats had worked ''frantically'' behind the scenes to find a formula to lessen Yeltsin's concerns over NATO expansion. </P>
<P> By assuring Yeltsin that NATO membership for Russia was a theoretical possibility, Clinton was seeking to address complaints from Moscow that the effect of NATO expansion would be to draw new lines across Europe, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> An administration official was quoted as saying it was important to show that the process was ``open and inclusive,'' even though nobody expected Russia to be admitted in the forseeable future. </P>
