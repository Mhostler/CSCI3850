<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Iraq promised to give U.N. arms inspectors the data they need to complete their information on Baghdad's past weapons programs, a senior U.N. official said Tuesday. </P>
<P> Charles Duelfer, deputy executive chairman of the U.N. Special Comission on Iraq, said the promise was made by Gen. Amer Rasheed, head of Iraq's Military Industrialization Commission. </P>
<P> ``He promised improved efforts in this direction ... to apply more vigor in efforts,'' Duelfer told Reuters. </P>
<P> Duelfer arrived in Baghdad Monday to press Iraq on what he described as ``significant gaps'' in information on past weapons programs, particularly biological warfare. </P>
<P> He met Rasheed Monday night and they expect to talk again before he leaves Baghdad Thursday. </P>
<P> ``It was a good meeting. We had an honest exchange of the technical issues and their importance,'' Duelfer said. </P>
<P> Duelfer's mission is to account for and dismantle Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, including its nuclear, chemical and biological arsenal, under the terms of the 1991 Gulf War cease-fire. </P>
<P> Bagdhad last Thursday recognized Kuwait, which it invaded in 1990, as an independent nation, another key U.N. demand. </P>
<P> But in New York Monday, the U.N. Security Council voted to maintain sanctions, which bar the export of Iraqi oil. </P>
<P> Duelfer said Iraq's supplying of missing data would help the United Nations have a complete picture of past programs. </P>
<P> Otherwise ``it will delay a favorable report by the commission to the Security Council,'' he said. </P>
<P> The long-term U.N. monitoring program, which is now provisionally operational, has not yet covered the biological area, he said. </P>
<P> Iraq must supply the world body with a complete inventory of its microbiology-related facilities to enable experts to verify that Baghdad will not experiment with biological agents for warfare purposes again, Duefler said. </P>
<P> ``We have little susbstantiation to verify the program,'' he said. </P>
