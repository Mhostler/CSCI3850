<P>  The United States has told Croatia of its ``profound disagreement'' wth Zagreb's decision to end the mandate of U.N. troops in Croatia March 31, the State Department said Thursday. </P>
<P> Spokeswoman Christine Shelly said the U.S. view had been conveyed to Croatia ``at senior levels within this administration'' but did not elaborate. </P>
<P> Croatian President Franjo Tudjman told the United Nations in a letter Thursday of his decision to end the mandate of the more than 12,000 U.N. troops in his country. </P>
<P> ``The U.S. has expressed its profound disagreement with the Croatian position, which could produce renewed conflict between the republic of Croatia and Krajina Serb forces,'' said Shelly. The Krajina Serbs, who fought Zagreb when it declared independence from Yugoslavia, occupy a third of Croatia. </P>
<P> ``We will be working with Croatia in the next days in an effort to restrict the adverse effects of this decision both within Croatia and in neighboring republics,'' Shelly told a news briefing. </P>
<P> She said Secretary of State Warren Christopher spoke Thursday to German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and expressed agreement with Bonn's view that the mandate of the U.N. Protection Forceshould be renewed. </P>
