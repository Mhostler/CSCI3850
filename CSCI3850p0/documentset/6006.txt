<P>  Honduran Foreign Minister Ernesto Paz has resigned over a passports-for-cash scandal involving his sister, President Carlos Reina said Monday. </P>
<P> ``The minister has announced to me his resignation upon his return from his current trip,'' Reina said. </P>
<P> Paz was in Indonesia at a meeting of non-aligned nations and was due back in Honduras later Monday, officials said. Reina did not say who would replace him. </P>
<P> ``It is his decision in view of the difficulties he has had that we all know about on the emotional side, a sister on trial,'' Reina said. </P>
<P> Maria de los Angeles Paz is on jail facing charges of influence trafficking to obtain passports and visas for travel to the United States in return for cash. </P>
<P> Paz has denied any involvement in the scandal and Reina, after announcing his resignation, called him ``a very respectable man.'' </P>
