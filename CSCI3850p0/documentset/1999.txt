<P>  The inhabitants of three tiny Caribbean islands go the polls Friday in referenda on whether to break away from the Netherlands Antilles. </P>
<P> St. Maarten, St. Eustatius and Saba -- with fewer than 10,000 residents between them -- will decide whether to follow the example of Aruba which in 1986 voted to become independent from the Netherlands Antilles. </P>
<P> Other options in the four-question ballots include maintaining the status quo as members of the Netherlands Antilles, reverting to being colonies of the Netherlands, or complete independence from both the Netherlands Antilles and Amsterdam. </P>
<P> The five-island Netherlands Antilles and Aruba, which depend heavily on tourism, are members of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. They have local autonomy but are subject to Amsterdam in foreign affairs. </P>
<P> A vote to break with the Antilles would give the three islands more independence in local affairs, which are now governed by a Curacao-based legislature. </P>
<P> Curacao, the capital of the Netherlands Antilles, voted last November to remain part of the group. Bonaire is due to vote Oct. 21. </P>
<P> Political observers said St. Eustatius and Saba were likely to vote to stay in the Netherlands Antilles. A close battle was predicted in St. Maarten, however, where many want a split with the Netherlands Antilles. </P>
<P> Any constitutional changes mandated in the referenda would have to be negotiated with the Netherlands government. </P>
