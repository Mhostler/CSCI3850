Inez DeFonseca, 60, was also ordered to pay almost $1.7 million in restitution to American Arbitration for bank fraud. She was sentenced Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Harold Baer. </P>
<P> DeFonseca, who had pleaded guilty in January, admitted that shortly after being promoted to vice-president in charge of disbursement to American Arbitration creditors in 1988, she engaged in an elaborate scheme to embezzle funds from her company through the use of dummy corporations and bogus creditor accounts. </P>
<P> DeFonseca, who left her company in 1992, also admitted she used the stolen funds to buy expensive art, jewelry and antiques. </P>
