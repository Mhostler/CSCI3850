<DATELINE>SINGAPORE (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Singapore government issued a lengthy and strongly worded rebuttal Saturday of 11th-hour claims by an ex-cellmate of hanged Filipina maid Flor Contemplacion that the maid was innocent of a double murder charge. </P>
<P> Contemplacion's execution has sparked major protests in the Philippines, where thousands of mourners turned out Saturday to give her body a hero's welcome as it passed through the streets of Manila and later in her hometown of San Pablo. </P>
<P> The cellmate, Virginia Parumog, came to Singapore in the small hours of Friday in a last-ditch effort by lawyers for the Contemplacion family to stay the execution. </P>
<P> Parumog went directly to a police station and signed an affidavit alleging that Contemplacion, a 42-year-old mother of four, did not kill another maid, Della Maga, or the three-year-old son of Maga's employers in 1991. </P>
<P> ``These claims are pure fabrication,'' a Home Affairs Ministry statement said. </P>
<P> Contemplacion was hanged just before dawn Friday despite appeals from Philippine President Fidel Ramos. </P>
<P> The Home Ministry said that Parumog claimed Contemplacion told her, while both were in Changi Prison, that when visiting Della Maga the two maids had discovered the boy, Nicholas Huang, had drowned. </P>
<P> In the affidavit Parumog claimed Flor told her that, ``Della immediately phoned her employer about the incident. Her male employer immediately rushed home. Very angry, the employer strangled Della's neck.'' </P>
<P> Then, the affidavit states, the employer called the police and implicated Flor in the double murder. </P>
<P> But, according to the Home Ministry, the facts are that when the police arrived Contemplacion was not at the scene. She was traced later through entries made in Della Maga's diary. In addition, the Home Ministry said, it was not the boy's father who phoned police it was the mother. </P>
<P> The Home Ministry statement dismissed other claims made by Parumog including that Contemplacion had undergone electric shock treatment while awaiting trial and had been drugged. </P>
<P> The ministry said Flor was given two electro-encephalogram (EEG) tests, one of which was ordered by her own defense psychiatrist. As for drugs, the ministry said, Flor was given medication only for headaches and a sore throat. </P>
<P> The statement also pointed out that Contemplacion had had ample opportunity to protest her innocence while in jail and had chosen not to do so. </P>
<P> Referring to Parumong, the Home Ministry statement stated she was arrested in Singapore on June 25, 1992, and had signed a statement that she had come to the island republic for prostitution and ``was charging Singapore $100 ($70) per sexual entertainment.'' </P>
