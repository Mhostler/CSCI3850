<P> ``We still have 16 people in hospital, of whom six are in a serious state,'' a consulate spokesman said by telephone. Other passengers suffered slight injuries. </P>
<P> The group of 43 Americans, mainly from Arizona, had set off from Barcelona early Saturday for the French religious shrine town. </P>
<P> The accident happened early on Saturday when the coach left the road near the town of Abrera and rolled over several times, a local government spokesman said. Heavy rain had made the road surface slick. </P>
<P> The consulate spokesman named the dead as Joan Ryan, Elsie Saint and Florence Hoskins. He was not immediately able to give their home towns. Next of kin were still being informed. </P>
