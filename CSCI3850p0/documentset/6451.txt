<P>  A nude painting by Italian painter Amedeo Modigliani set a new record for the artist at $12.4 million at Christie's auction house Wednesday night, amid a healthy sale of a collection of Modern works. </P>
<P> One of Modigliani's second series of nudes painted in 1917, ``Nu assis au collier'' had been estimated at $7 million to $10 million. His nudes were considered immoral by contemporaries. The model in this picture, whom Modigliani used in several paintings, is seated with one hand on her necklace and one between her legs. </P>
<P> ``La Poetesse'' by Joan Miro set a record for the artist for a work on paper, fetching $4.7 million, above estimates of $2 million to $3 million. Painted in 1940 as part of his Constellations series, the painting depicts an unorganized pattern of black lines and colored shapes. </P>
<P> In a week of night sales of Modern and Impressionist art at Christie's and Sotheby's auction houses, this collection of works from Ralph and Georgia Colin, was the most successful. All 76 works sold, bringing in a total of $38.2 million, well above pre-sale estimates of $24.7 million to $34.4 million. </P>
