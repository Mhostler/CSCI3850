<P>  About 30 Zairean police attacked the home of opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi in an assassination attempt Monday but he was unhurt, his spokesman Lambert Mende said. </P>
<P> Mende said the police drove up to Tshisekedi's house in the Limete suburb of Kinshasa in three vehicles. They forced the door, threw in tear gas grenades and a live grenade, then fired bullets through his office window. ``It was an assassination attempt,'' Mende said. </P>
<P> Mende said a member of Tshisekedi's UPDS party was shot and wounded in the attack but Tshisekedi was unhurt. </P>
<P> He said Tshisekedi came out of his office, confronted the police and they fled, taking away Tshisekedi's deputy personal secretary and the wounded man. </P>
<P> Zaire's new centrist Prime Minister Kengo Wa Dondo presented his program Saturday, promising to rein in government spending and bring the armed forces into line. </P>
<P> Tshisekedi, who says he is the rightful premier, has denounced Kengo's election as unconstitutional. </P>
