<P>  Malaysia, Vietnam and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees signed an agreement Tuesday to repatriate up to 5,000 remaining Vietnamese boat people from Malaysia, officials said. </P>
<P> ``With this pact, we hope to bring to a close the Malaysian chapter of the tragic saga of the Vietnamese boat people which began in 1975,'' Malaysian Foreign Ministry secretary-general Ahmad Kamil Jaafar said in his country's capital, Kuala Lumpur. </P>
<P> More than 250,000 Vietnamese fled the Indochinese country after the Vietnam War in 1975 on rickety rafts and boats to Malaysia and other Southeast Asian nations. </P>
<P> Ahmad Kamil said most of the Vietnamese refugees have been resettled in third countries while 4,116 others have voluntarily returned to Vietnam since March 1989. </P>
<P> ``However, there are still 4,913 such non-refugees remaining in this country. We hope to persuade all of them to return to Vietnam under the existing voluntary repatriation program,'' he said. </P>
<P> Ahmad Kamil signed the repatriation pact with Vietnamese ambassador to Malaysia Ngo Tat To and UNHCR representative Erika Feller. </P>
<P> The remaining boat people are housed in a refugee camp in Sungei Besi, a suburb south of Kuala Lumpur. Malaysia closed another Vietnamese refugee camp on the east coast island of Pulau Bidong in 1991. </P>
<P> Ahmad Kamil said Malaysia hopes to close the Sungei Besi camp August 31. </P>
<P> Ngo said Vietnam will welcome back all boat people although the country is still facing difficulties as it develops its economy. </P>
<P> UNHCR representative Feller said the U.N. body would spend $1.95 million to finance the program. </P>
<P> Apart from the pact between Malaysia and Vietnam, she said the UNHCR is also party to a similar pact between Vietnam and Indonesia, which is home to some 6,000 boat people. </P>
