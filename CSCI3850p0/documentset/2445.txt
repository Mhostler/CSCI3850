<P>  A Russian ``Dream Team'' of National Hockey League players lost the second game of their charity exhibition tour Sunday when they were beaten 5-4 by Torpedo Yaroslavl, Itar-Tass news agency said. </P>
<P> The all-star team looked to be totally in control when San Jose forward Sergei Makarov and Buffalo Sabres star Alexander Mogilny scored after 10:04 and 10:44 in the first period to build a 3-1 lead. </P>
<P> But Yaroslavl, cheered on by a capacity 4,500 crowd, pulled one back and then scored three unanswered goals in the second period to go 5-3 up. </P>
<P> Sergei Federov of the Detroit Red Wings, the NHL's Most Valuable Player last season, scored early in the third period but it was not enough. </P>
<P> The team, grouping many of Russia's finest stars, was put together to tour for 10 days to take advantage of the strike that has closed down the NHL. It beat Spartak Moscow 5-4 in the first game Friday. </P>
<P> The stars include the New York Rangers' Alexei Kovalev, Sergei Zubov, Sergei Nemchinov and Alexander Karpotsev, the first Russian players to have their names engraved on the Stanley Cup. </P>
<P> Another all-star is Vancouver Canucks' Pavel ``Russian Rocket'' Bure, who posted his second successive 60-goal NHL season in 1993-94. </P>
