<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Several tornadoes caused extensive damage in a central California town Saturday, heaping more misery on the state as it tries to recover from severe floods. </P>
<P> At least two tornadoes touched down in the San Joaquin Valley town of Chowchilla, 130 miles southeast of San Francisco, Saturday afternoon, a Chowchilla police dispatcher said. </P>
<P> She said the twisters caused extensive damage in a four- block area of the town, ripping off roofs and tearing down trees. There were no injuries, she said. </P>
<P> The tornadoes lifted up some small sheds and threw them several feet, ripped out many big trees at the roots and littered the area with debris, local news reports said. </P>
<P> In the wake of the tornadoes, the National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for several central California counties. </P>
<P> Tornadoes are rare in California, especially in winter, a weather service meteorologist said. </P>
<P> The tornadoes are the latest extreme weather to hit California, deluged by storms this week that killed 10 people, caused $300 million of damage and forced thousands of people to evacuate their homes due to flooding. </P>
<P> The storms inflicted heavy damage throughout the state, from Malibu in southern California to suburbs of the state capital Sacramento and northern California's wine country. </P>
<P> More heavy rain caused minor flooding Saturday along the Russian River in the Guerneville area of northern California, scene of some of the worst flooding earlier this week. </P>
<P> The small town, 50 miles north of San Francisco, was submerged by floods Tuesday, and evacuated residents were only allowed back to their homes Thursday to clean up the mud and mess left by the overflowing river. </P>
<P> The Russian River rose above 36 ft -- 4 ft above flood level -- Saturday, flooding some cabins in low-lying areas. The river was far below the crest of 48 feet it reached Tuesday. </P>
<P> California Gov. Pete Wilson called a special session of the state legislature for next Thursday to consider legislation to help flood victims. </P>
<P> Bills normally have to be in print 30 days before they can be acted upon, but in an emergency session they can be taken up immediately. </P>
<P> Wilson's spokesman Sean Walsh said the state legislature might pass measures such as property tax relief or a delay in payment of property taxes for flood victims who need to spend money on repairs. </P>
<P> The Republican governor added three more counties -- Alameda and Modoc in northern California and San Diego in the south -- to the 34 counties where states of emergency have been declared due to flooding. </P>
<P> President Clinton, due to visit California Monday and Tuesday, has declared a major disaster in the state and has promised federal aid for flood victims. </P>
<P> Clinton pledged in his weekly radio address Saturday that his administration will do everything in its power to help flood victims. </P>
<P> More than 5,500 flood victims, few of whom have flood insurance, have applied for federal aid. </P>
<P> Scores of roads in northern California remain closed due to flooding and some homes in the Russian River area are gradually slipping down hillsides due to mudslides, news reports said. </P>
<P> Officials were also concerned about a danger of flooding along the upper reaches of the Sacramento River in northern California. </P>
<P> Residents of Guerneville were busy Saturday cleaning thick mud out of their homes and putting destroyed property into debris boxes placed around town. </P>
<P> The Safeway supermarket chain sent five truckloads of donated food and supplies, worth more than $100,000, to Guerneville Saturday to be distributed free to residents. </P>
<P> Flood victims lined up to pick up bread, juice, canned roast beef, water and batteries donated by Safeway and other companies. </P>
<P> ``There's a lot of people in this community that have lost everything, virtually everything they owned,'' one woman in line, Mary Clement, said. </P>
<P> Safeway said the donation was a ``thank you'' to local residents who saved its Guerneville store from serious flooding. </P>
