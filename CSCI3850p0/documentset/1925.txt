<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  U.N. envoy Rolf Ekeus was quoted Tuesday as saying he feared Iraq had ruined its chances of obtaining a review of sanctions imposed four years ago after it invaded Kuwait. </P>
<P> Ekeus, the Swedish head of the U.N. Special Commission in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, told the daily Aftenbladet that Iraqi troop movements to the Kuwaiti border were a tragedy for the suffering Iraqi people. </P>
<P> ``This is very unfortunate. I had been convinced that sanctions would have been eased,'' said Ekeus, adding Iraqi President Saddam Hussein headed meetings he had in Baghdad last week. </P>
<P> ``Even the U.S. was prepared and the question (of easing sanctions) had moved on to another stage'' before Iraq moved troops near the Kuwaiti border, the 59-year-old Swede said. </P>
<P> ``This is a tragedy for the Iraqi people,'' he added. Ekeus said last week's meetings -- when he was attacked personally by the Iraqi media -- were difficult. </P>
<P> ``Saddam himself led the meeting. There was a very gloomy and depressing atmosphere ... There was a very hard tone from Baghdad's side, threatening. It was as though they wanted to force us to make certain statements and I refused to accept,'' he told the Stockholm daily from New York. </P>
<P> ``One doesn't treat a diplomatic envoy in this way. But it wasn't a personal vendetta. I believe rather that they were seeking a political goal,'' Ekeus added. </P>
<P> The Iraqi troop movements prompted the United States to rush troops, ships and aircraft to the Gulf region to guard against another strike less than four years after a U.S.-led coalition ejected Iraqi forces from Kuwait. </P>
<P> The Security Council will not review sanctions until mid-November and is not expected to seriously consider easing or lifting the embargo on oil exports until some time in 1995. </P>
<P> Baghdad had set an Oct. 10 deadline for action by the council on the sanctions because of a report from Ekeus. </P>
<P> Ekeus said he had started testing a crucial long-term monitoring program, the last major project in the Iraqi disarmament program. </P>
<P> But he did not give a time limit for the testing as Iraq had demanded, angering Iraq most of last week. </P>
<P> The completion of the weapons destruction program is linked to lifting the embargo on Iraqi oil exports although the United States has said it would interpret the resolution broadly and look for other areas of compliance. </P>
