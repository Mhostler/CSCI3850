<DATELINE>MOISHAHATI, Bangladesh, April 3 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  In this sunbaked village on Monday, a woman in a homespun sari posed a question to Hillary Rodham Clinton that showed the huge gap between the poor of South Asia and the people of the affluent West. </P>
<P> ``Do you have cattle in your home?'' the woman shyly asked the visiting U.S. first lady. </P>
<P> In Moishahati, women are buying cattle and taking a first step toward better lives for themselves and their families in this overpopulated, dirt-poor country. </P>
<P> They are doing this with money borrowed from the Grameen Bank, an institution that makes small loans to the poor, especially women, in villages throughout Bangladesh. </P>
<P> Mrs Clinton, on a goodwill tour of South Asia that previously took her and her daughter, Chelsea, 15, to Pakistan, India and Nepal, travelled to the southwest Bangladesh district of Jessore on a hot, noisy C-130 military transport to see how the bank operates. </P>
<P> Before returning to the capital, Dhaka, she also glimpsed the work of a family-planning clinic and a food-distribution centre partially financed by U.S. foreign aid. </P>
<P> Mrs Clinton, who Tuesday was to fly to Colombo, Sri Lanka, the last stop of her 12-day, 20,000-mile (32,000-km) journey, was accompanied by Bangladesh banker Muhammed Yunus, Grameen's founder. </P>
<P> He said he launched the operation, which has been copied in Africa and in the United States, in an effort to convince financial leaders that the poor deserve dignity and are good credit risks. </P>
<P> ``Any human being who has money in his hand commands respect,'' said Yunus, who told reporters that he had encountered resistance from the U.S. foreign aid agency USAID and the World Bank. </P>
<P> ``After Bill Clinton, everything changed,'' he said. </P>
<P> Her forehead adorned with a teep, the small colored dot that in most South Asian countries signifies marital status, the first lady looked at handicrafts made by the women to repay their loans and heard about indigenous opposition to the Grameen Bank. </P>
<P> It comes from money-lenders out to preserve their monopoly and fundamentalist Islamic clerics who want to limit the freedom for women, she was told. </P>
<P> One villager told Mrs Clinton the mullah in her mosque warned Grameen borrowers that ``if their children die, they will not pray for them.'' </P>
<P> Speaking through a translator, the woman said she planned to send her son to religious school ``so he'll become a decent mullah, not the other kind of mullah.'' </P>
<P> Mrs Clinton said during a brief give-and-take with the women, ``No, we do not have cattle in our home.'' But she said she believed strongly that it was important for women to earn their income ``like you are doing'' and that she would resume doing so herself after her husband left the White House. </P>
