<P>  Burma's military leaders are offering the United States a deal they hope will help bring down notorious opium warlord Khun Sa in exchange for a lifting of the arms embargo, The New York Times reported in its Friday editions. </P>
<P> The Times said the offer has been discussed with State Department officials in recent weeks, according to military officials in Burma. But the paper said the Clinton Administration, which has often been critical of the Burmese junta and its human rights record, is unlikely to be swayed by the offer. </P>
<P> Still, The Times said American officials say the proposal could be important, if it signals a new willingness by the army to destroy the opium operation run by Khun Sa. </P>
<P> Burma is the source of most of the world's opium, the raw material of heroin. Most of the opium grown there is cultivated in rugged mountainous areas controlled by Khun Sa, The Times said. </P>
<P> Khun Sa, who was indicted on narcotics charges in the United States in 1989, has recently declared himself president of a newly independent state on Burma's eastern border. Junta officials say he is responsible for most of the heroin on American streets, the New York Times said. </P>
<P> Burmese government forces launched an offensive against Khun Sa's strongholds in northeast Burma's Shan state late last year. Fighting, at times heavy, has continued since then. </P>
<P> The military government announced last month that almost 450 people from both sides had been killed in the campaign so far. </P>
<P> ``We've begun to hurt him,'' The Times reported Lieutenant Colonel Kyaw Thein, as saying. Thein -- a spokesman for the Burmese junta's anti-narcotic program. ``If we can, we would like to destroy Khun Sa's army and wipe it off the map.'' </P>
<P> But Burma would need help from the United States, which has cut off all aid to the junta, including military assistance, to protest human rights violations, Thein said, according to the paper. </P>
<P> The nation's leading dissident, Daw Aunt San Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, is about to enter her sixth year under house arrest in Yangon -- formerly Rangoon. </P>
<P> ``We alone cannot do this job,'' Colonel Kyaw Thein said of the drug war. ``If the U.S. really wants Khun Sa to be wiped out of this area, the first thing they will need to do is help us with arms and ammunition. We cannot buy any of that sort of thing,'' the Times quoted him as saying. </P>
