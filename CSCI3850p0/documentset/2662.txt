<DATELINE>DETROIT (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Michael Moorer, the 27-year-old heavy-weight boxer that George Foreman at the age of 45 crushed, is retiring according to a report Thursday. </P>
<P> Moorer, a Detroit native told the Detroit News he plans to return to school and hopes to pursue a career in law enforcement. </P>
<P> ``I don't want to box anymore,'' Moorer said. ``I'm going to go back to school. I've always wanted to pursue a career in the law enforcement area and I will not return.'' </P>
<P> Moorer, the first native of Detroit since Joe Louis to win the heavyweight title in 1937, defeated Evander Holyfield in a 12-round decision in April. Moorer's fight against Foreman 10 days ago was his only title defense and his only loss in 36 fights. </P>
<P> His loss to Foreman, coming on a late knockout, was one of the biggest upsets in boxing. </P>
<P> Moorer's promoter Bill Kozerski said he was not surprised by the announcement. </P>
<P> ``I'll support Michael in whatever career decision he makes,'' Kozerski told the News. ``I'm his friend before I'm his promoter. Whatever he wants to do to make himself happy, I'll be behind him 100 percent.'' </P>
