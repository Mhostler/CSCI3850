<DATELINE>CHICAGO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A couple who adopted a boy shortly after his birth almost four years ago pleaded with the Supreme Court Friday to stop him from being turned over to the natural parents he has never met. </P>
<P> But the high court refused once before to intervene in the case and it appeared the boy -- known in court records only as ''Baby Richard'' -- eventually would be taken from the couple who have raised him since he was four days old. </P>
<P> Assuming that the court would not step in, the boy's natural parents, Otakar and Daniela Kirchner, set a 5 p.m. Friday deadline for the adoptive parents to agree to a phased-in return of the boy or face the possibility that he will be forcibly removed from their suburban Chicago home. </P>
<P> Loren Heinemann, attorney for the Kirchners, said Friday he was ``upset and disheartened'' by the lack of response the boy's adoptive parents had made to the return proposal. </P>
<P> He planned to ask the Illinois Supreme Court, which earlier this week ordered the boy returned to the Kirchners, to serve an order on the adoptive parents telling them to give up the child. </P>
<P> But he also said the 5 p.m. deadline was flexible. </P>
<P> Heinemann said the Kirchner's proposal to gradually introduce the boy to his natural parents is a fair one. It involves continued contact with the adoptive parents as well as help from child psychologists in the transition, provided the adoptive parents agree to make no more legal challenges. </P>
<P> Daniela Kirchner, who is expecting a second child later this year, gave up the boy four days after he was born. She was not married to the Czech-born Kirchner at the time and he was out of the country when the child was born. </P>
<P> When he returned, she told him the baby had died. About two months after the birth Kirchner found out the baby was alive and began a series of legal challenges to recover the boy. </P>
<P> The case is similar to the ``Baby Jessica'' affair in which a three-year-old girl, weeping and strapped inside a car seat, was forcibly removed from her adoptive parents home in Michigan and returned to her natural parents in Iowa following a 1993 court battle. </P>
