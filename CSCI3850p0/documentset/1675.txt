<P>  The British and Chinese foreign ministers Thursday opened talks on the future of Hong Kong and other issues. </P>
<P> The meeting between British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen began about a half hour late because Qian was delayed in New York traffic. </P>
<P> ``They are discussing all issues relating to Hong Kong as well as bilateral issues between Britain and China,'' a British spokesman said. ``There will be fairly free-ranging discussions right across the board.'' </P>
<P> Beijing has vowed to cancel any democratic moves in Hong Kong in place when the British-ruled colony is handed back to China on July 1, 1997. </P>
<P> Earlier this month Beijing said the entire Hong Kong legislature would be disbanded, derailing Hong Kong's so-called ``through train'' -- the carry-over of legislators elected in 1995, the last polls prior to the 1997 transition. </P>
