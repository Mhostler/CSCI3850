<DATELINE>LONDON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A 14-year-old British boy who ``loves traveling'' ran away from home and ended up in Malaysia, paying his way with his father's credit card, his worried parents said Friday. </P>
<P> Peter Kerry of London pilfered his father's credit card to pay for the 8,000-mile journey but said in a telephone call to his parents he was now broke and stranded. </P>
<P> ``We don't know how he is or where he is at the moment...we are very, very worried and desperate to know where he is,'' his mother Pat Kerry said. </P>
<P> ``We are not angry with him -- we just want him back. I can't wait for him to come home and to give him a big hug.'' </P>
<P> Peter disappeared Tuesday night after his father, younger brother and sister went to a soccer match without him. </P>
<P> His father John, 59, said Peter was sulking after being scolded for leaving the family's video collection in a mess. </P>
<P> Peter called home Thursday night to tell his parents he was in Malaysia. He said he had run out of money and had been refused permission to stay at a hotel in the town of Johor Baharu on Malaysia's border with Singapore, and then hung up. </P>
<P> ``We don't think there is any particular reason why he has chosen Malaysia -- he just likes traveling,'' his mother said. ``He loves going on planes and trains and I think he may have chosen this country just because it is so far away.'' </P>
<P> She said she had told her son to contact the British embassy in Kuala Lumpur for help. </P>
<P> On previous occasions when Peter has run away from home, he has traveled around Britain by train and was stranded in Scotland. Last June he managed to board a flight to Paris. </P>
<P> British police are working with Interpol and Malaysian police in an effort to track Peter down. </P>
