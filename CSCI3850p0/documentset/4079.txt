<P>  South Africa's air force, involved in regional wars under apartheid but now given humanitarian tasks, marked its 75th anniversary Wednesday. </P>
<P> South Africa's first black Defense Minister, Joe Modise, headed the celebrations flanked by the white chiefs of the national defense force and the South African Air Force (SAAF) at the country's first air base, Swartkop, southwest of Pretoria. </P>
<P> Modise told hundreds of invited guests and air force personnel that while South Africa was under no immediate military threat ``security and financial provisions for security should ... not be neglected.'' </P>
<P> ``It is essential that South Africa maintain a technologically advanced National defense force and air force. Money spent on the air force is an investment in the interest of all of us,'' he said during the ceremony which included a parade, fly-over and presentation of a commemorative scroll by Britain's air force chief. </P>
<P> Modise, appointed by South Africa's first black president, Nelson Mandela, added that the air force's rapid response and high mobility made it an asset in a variety of roles, including peace and humanitarian operations and emergency relief. </P>
<P> Angola was the SAAF's main theater of foreign operations during the apartheid era of racial separation. In the 1980s SAAF planes made brief incursions into neighboring Mozambique, which supported anti-apartheid guerrillas. </P>
<P> Since the end of apartheid and Mandela's coming to power in last April's all-race elections, the air force's role has been one of rendering humanitarian assistance to other African states, including ferrying relief to Rwandan refugees and distributing election material to remote areas of Mozambique. </P>
<P> The head of Britain's Royal Air Force, Air Chief Marshall Sir Michael Graydon, presented a commemorative scroll to the SAAF chief, Lt. Gen. James Kriel. </P>
<P> SAAF squadrons served in North Africa and Europe during World War II. They dropped supplies into Warsaw during the German suppression of the 1944 uprising there, took part in the Berlin Airlift and its Flying Cheetah squadron served in Korea. </P>
