<P>  President Bill Clinton Thursday condemned the abduction of an Israeli soldier by Palestinian guerrillas and urged PLO leader Yasser Arafat to help get him freed. </P>
<P> ``President Clinton strongly condemns the cruel and cowardly abduction of Israeli Corporal Nachshon Waxman by the violent terrorist group Hamas,'' White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said in a statement. Hamas has claimed responsibility for the abduction. </P>

<P> ``The president expects Chairman Arafat to do all in his power to ensure Corporal Waxman's safe return to his family,'' Myers said. </P>
<P> ``The president shares the anquish and grief of the Waxman family and conveys the sympathy and prayers of the American people for his safe and speedy return,'' Myers said. </P>
