<P>  Black Magic made Young America disappear in the rear-view mirror as Team New Zealand took a 2-0 lead Monday in the best-of-nine America's Cup finals with a crushing 4 minute, 14 second win over Stars & Stripes. </P>
<P> Peter Blake's Team New Zealand, with only one defeat on the water in four months here, had to feel confirmed in their confidence of bringing yachting's greatest prize to their country for the first time. Their boat appears to be faster in all conditions they are likely to face here. </P>
<P> Saturday's 2:45 win had been impressive enough, and this time Dennis Conner's Stars & Stripes team, with just a week's practice on a borrowed boat, did not have the excuse of having to deal with unusual weather. </P>
<P> In contrast to Saturday's surprisingly rough seas for relatively low winds, Monday's seas were smooth in even lighter winds, and Black Magic I, helmed by Russell Coutts, just flew away. </P>
<P> The key to the race came when the Americans, with Paul Cayard at the wheel, won the start and chose the lefthand side. They guessed wrong. The New Zealanders, finding better wind on the right, pulled ahead within five minutes and never trailed again. </P>
<P> ``It's too bad. He was a little faster and he got a good break with the (wind) pressure there,'' Cayard said shortly after crossing the finish line. </P>
<P> ``The start wasn't ideal for us. But we got some speed quickly and some nice shifts and it all turned out okay,'' said Coutts. ``It was a good day to be in front.'' </P>
<P> The result reinforced the idea that the only chance for the mermaid -- Young America carries yellow and white profiles of a mermaid on either side of the light blue yacht -- to finish ahead of the Kiwis' big black boat is to take the lead early and defend it all the way round the course. </P>
<P> Blake, the Kiwi syndicate chief, said: ``The boat was going really well. Those were our conditions and, after Saturday, we had a feeling that we might be fine in the lighter winds and flat water that the Americans indicated they wanted.'' </P>
<P> The only leg on which Team New Zealand did not increase the lead was the last one, when the race was well in hand. </P>
<P> It was the fourth time in the 144-year history of the Cup that a challenger had gone up 2-0, and the challenger had gone on to win one of the three previous times. </P>
<P> In 1987, Conner himself blanked Australia's Kookaburra III 4-0 to take back the Cup he had lost four years earlier. In 1920, Ireland's Shamrock IV won two races from Resolute before falling 3-2. In 1934, England's Endeavour won twice before falling 4-2 to Rainbow. </P>
<P> Overall, challengers had won only 17 races against 87 victories for defenders coming into these America's Cup finals. </P>
<P> At the start, Cayard forced Coutts away from the line and to the right, crossing the line two seconds ahead and taking the lefthand side in what appeared to be a perfect start for the Americans. </P>
<P> But on the upwind opening leg, the Kiwis pulled ahead inside on the right, covered on the first tack, then allowed the boats to cross several times as the boats ranged fairly wide apart looking for the shifting winds. </P>
<P> In hindsight, Cayard probably should have tacked within the first 30 seconds of the race when he was going two knots faster and could have gained the righthand side. </P>
<P> The Kiwis rounded the first mark 39 seconds ahead despite a problem with their jib sheet just before the mark. </P>
<P> On the downwind second run the breeze picked up a bit, helping the trailing Americans eat a little into Black Magic I's lead in the early part of the leg, but they probably gybed too early approaching the mark, coming in at a bad angle and losing speed. Coutts rounded the second mark 50 seconds in front, a gain of 11 seconds. </P>
<P> The Kiwis, steadily increasing their margin, tacked on another 48 seconds at the third mark, 50 seconds more at the fourth to lead by 2:28. </P>
<P> Race 3 is scheduled for Tuesday. </P>
