<P>  Eight men, blindfolded and with their hands tied behind their backs, were beheaded in Saudi Arabia Wednesday, bringing to 36 the number of people the kingdom has executed this month. </P>
<P> Witnesses told Reuters that the eight were executed in a public square next to a mosque after prayers. </P>
<P> They said they heard at least one of the men was Pakistani when authorities read out the charges. </P>
<P> Saudi Arabia applies strict Islamic sharia law and executes murderers, rapists and drug traffickers. </P>
<P> ``They were led from vans, assisted from both sides. They were made to kneel on rugs and kneel a little bit forward,'' a witness said by telephone from the Red Sea port of Jeddah where the executions took place. </P>
<P> ``They open the top of their shirts and pull it around the shoulders,'' he said. Each was then beheaded with a sword, he added. </P>
<P> Diplomats in the conservative kingdom say public beheadings, mainly of drug smugglers, have been on the rise this year. </P>
<P> According to unofficial counts, 95 people have been executed in 1995. Some 85 were beheaded in 1993, the last year for which unofficial figures are available. </P>
<P> About 31 were beheaded in March and 28 in January. No beheadings were carried out in February, which coincided with the fasting month of Ramadan. </P>
<P> Public beheadings are usually held Fridays after the noon Muslim prayers but diplomats said some were carried out during week days due to a rise in the number of drug-related crimes in the oil-rich kingdom. </P>
