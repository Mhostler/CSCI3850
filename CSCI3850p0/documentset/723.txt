<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A federal grand jury Thursday indicted Democratic Congressman Walter Tucker on eight counts of extortion and two counts of filing false income tax returns, a U.S. Attorney said. </P>
<P> Tucker is charged with extorting $30,000 in bribes from Compton Energy Systems Inc, a business that sought to construct and operate a solid waste incinerator in the Los Angeles suburb of Compton between June 1991 and July 1992, when Tucker was mayor of Compton. </P>
<P> Tucker, who now represents the 37th District, which includes Compton, was scheduled to be arraigned August 22. </P>
<P> According to the indictment, Tucker received seven separate payments, six in cash and one in the form of a check, ranging from $1,000 to $10,000, in exchange for his support of the waste incinerator project. </P>
<P> He also demanded a $250,000 cash payment, the indictment alleges, and failed to include the payments he actually received on his 1992 and 1993 federal income tax returns. </P>
<P> The indictment said Tucker ``unlawfully demanded, solicited and obtained, under color of official right ... payments from persons whom he believed represented Compton Energy Systems.'' </P>
<P> ``Bribe taking by public officials can never be condoned as business as usual,'' U.S. Attorney Nora Manella told reporters at a press conference where the indictment was announced. </P>
<P> She said the ongoing investigation of the matter by the Federal Bureau Investigation, the U.S. Attorney's office and the Internal Revenue Service was the result of a tip, but she refused to divulge its source. </P>
<P> On the likelihood of further indictments as a result of the investigation, Manella said, ``I cannot predict what will result.'' </P>
<P> Asked if any of the payments allegedly made to Tucker could be considered campaign contributions for his successful bid for Congress in November of 1992, Manella said investigators concluded they were not. </P>
<P> ``If that's going to be the defense, it will come out at trial,'' Manella said. ``If there was any question in our minds as to whether these were campaign contributions, no indictment would have been sought.'' </P>
<P> Tucker, a Baptist minister whose father also served as mayor of Compton, was fired in 1988 from his job as a deputy district attorney with the Los Angeles County district attorney's office. </P>
<P> He later pleaded no contest to charges of altering an official document and lying about it to a judge. </P>
<P> He was elected mayor of Compton in April of 1991. </P>
<P> Tucker's lawyer, Johnnie Cochran, was unavailable for comment Thursday. </P>
