<DATELINE>LONDON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Gambling fever gripped Britain Monday as Britons hoping to become instant millionaires snapped up more than $11 million worth of tickets in the first 12 hours of the country's new lottery. </P>
<P> Britain joined the rest of Europe with its own National Lottery when Prime Minister John Major purchased the first ticket for the $3.2 million weekly prize. </P>
<P> Organizers expect about 80 percent of the population to buy a ticket at some point, with 30 percent becoming regular players. </P>
<P> The lottery expects to raise $14 billion for good causes over the next seven years and create a millionaire every week. </P>
<P> For $1.60, players choose six of 49 numbers on a scorecard. Anyone matching all six numbers drawn on television Saturday nights wins the jackpot. Five correct numbers plus a separate bonus number wins about $160,200. </P>
<P> British newspapers were full of advice for beating the 14 million-to-one odds of winning, ranging from consulting clairvoyants and reading a book on the law of averages by a math expert to letting pets choose the six numbers. </P>
<P> The popular Sun newspaper urged readers to rub their tickets on the large ``psychically charged'' red dot printed on an inside page to increase their chances. </P>
<P> But the Salvation Army warned players the lottery was ``a mug's game'' and only 40 cents of every dollar will go to charity. </P>
<P> Monday's launch is Britain's first national lottery since 1826 when such gambling was outlawed after Treasury officials ran off with the proceeds. </P>
<P> Half the lottery's proceeds will be paid out in winnings and just over a quarter to ``good causes'' such as charities, arts and sport. The rest will go to costs, commission and tax. </P>
