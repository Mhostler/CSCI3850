<P> They said Rachel Beniste, 46, and her husband had been trying to have children for 22 years. She gave birth to the three boys last week. </P>
<P> ``We tried every possibility, and we had reached the stage where we had decided to adopt, when we said we'd try (a test-tube fertilization procedure) just once more time. It worked,'' Beniste told army radio. </P>
