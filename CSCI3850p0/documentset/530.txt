<DATELINE>WARSAW (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  German President Roman Herzog apologized Monday for the suffering his nation caused Poland in World War Two in a gesture marking the 50th anniversary of the 1944 Warsaw Uprising against Nazi occupation. </P>
<P> Herzog said the anniversary of one of the bloodiest battles of the war, in which more than 200,000 Poles were killed, should launch new efforts to build a more united Europe. </P>
<P> ``Today I bow down before the victims of the Warsaw Uprising, as before all Polish victims of the war. I ask for forgiveness for what Germans did to you,'' Herzog said in a speech delivered in front of a huge monument to the uprising. </P>
<P> ``What we need is understanding, trust and good neighborliness,'' he said. ``That can only grow when our peoples put the dark aspects of their recent history completely into the open.'' </P>
<P> Although he was not the first German leader to apologize to Warsaw for the war, which began with the 1939 invasion of Poland, Herzog's gesture was a dramatic climax to four days of events commemorating the uprising. </P>
<P> About six million of Poland's inhabitants were killed during World War Two, including three million Jews. </P>
<P> The insurgents began the uprising on August 1, 1944, to try to take control of Warsaw before the Soviet army arrived. But they were forced to surrender by October 2 without achieving their aim and Moscow established communist rule. </P>
<P> On Monday, cars came to a standstill and pedestrians stood at attention in silence at 5 p.m. (11 a.m. EDT) as sirens wailed across Warsaw to commemorate the exact start of the 63-day battle 50 years ago in which the city was all but destroyed. </P>
<P> President Lech Walesa and other foreign leaders, including U.S. Vice President Al Gore, British Prime Minister John Major and officials from Russia, Australia, France, South Africa, New Zealand and Canada, declared old hatreds should be buried. </P>
<P> Russian President Boris Yeltsin was conspicuous in his absence -- he said he could not attend because he received his invitation too late and sent an aide, Sergei Filatov, instead. </P>
<P> Filatov, reading a message from Yeltsin, stopped short of any apology for the Soviet role in the uprising but said Russians bowed their heads in respect and hoped openness about the past would help build better ties. </P>
