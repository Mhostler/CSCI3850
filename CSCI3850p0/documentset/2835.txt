<DATELINE>LANDOVER, Md., Nov 26 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Chris Webber, making his first start for the Washington Bullets, missed a key foul shot but said he wasn't worried after the Cleveland Cavaliers scored a 96-94 comeback victory Friday. </P>
<P> With 36.6 seconds remaining in the game, Webber could have tied the game but made just 1-of-2 foul shots. Michael Cage's free throw with three seconds left sealed the Cavs' win. </P>
<P> But Webber, who finished with 13 points, eight rebounds and four blocks, said: ``All of you people in TV land who have been jumping on the bandwagon, we just lost. Don't be jumping off because we lost two games. There are 77 more games. We're going to be ready.'' </P>
<P> Webber, who forced Golden State to trade him in just his second season, added: ``I hate losing. It's something I'll never get used to. We have no excuses. We just lost. That's two straight games where we've lost a close one. As time goes on, we'll get those. We just didn't play well enough.'' </P>
<P> Tyrone Hill scored 21 of his 25 points in the second half to lead the Cleveland comeback. Hill also had 16 rebounds. </P>
<P> ``We were down 12, but we did what we had to do,'' said Hill. ``It wasn't a pretty game, but we won it.'' </P>
<P> Don MacLean scored 21 points to lead Washington, which lost its fourth straight. </P>
<P> ``They need a chance to gel and mesh. It takes some time,'' Cavs coach Mike Fratello said of the Bullets. ``Their roster is a terrific young roster and, God willing, without injuries, their future is bright.'' </P>
<P> In Dallas, the young Mavericks had a learning experience as Jimmy Jackson scored 31 points and Jamal Mashburn added 27 in a 101-91 win over the Portland Trail Blazers. </P>
<P> The Mavericks led by 16 points with 6:56 left but Portland went on an 18-4 run, closing within 91-89 with 1:49 remaining. That was as close as the Blazers got. </P>
<P> Said rookie Jason Kidd, who had 13 points, 10 assists and four steals: ``We were playing against a veteran ball club which has been there before. They fought hard but we held.'' </P>
<P> The new Dallas point guard added: ``We're a young ballclub and we're going to make mistakes. We still have a lot of learning to do. This was a good learning experience.'' </P>
<P> Clifford Robinson and Clyde Drexler led Portland with 19 points each. </P>
<P> In Sacramento, Mitch Richmond scored a season-high 33 points, including two key throws in the final seconds of overtime, to lead the Kings to a 108-105 victory over the Denver Nuggets. Randy Brown added 18 points for Sacramento. </P>
<P> Robert Pack netted 24 points and Bryant Stith added 23 for the Nuggets. </P>
<P> In Boston, Shaquille O'Neal scored 36 points and Anfernee Hardaway added a career-high 35 as the Orlando Magic rallied for their sixth straight win, 124-118 over the Celtics. </P>
<P> Dino Radja scored 30 points to lead Boston. </P>
<P> In Los Angeles, Kenny Anderson had 22 points and 14 assists as the New Jersey Nets held on for a 107-102 victory over the winless Clippers. </P>
<P> Harold Ellis scored 19 of his 24 points in the fourth quarter to rally the Clippers, now 0-12. Los Angeles is five losses shy of the all-time NBA record of 17 straight defeats to open a season, set by Miami in its inaugural season, 1988. </P>
<P> In Atlanta, Vlade Divac scored 15 points and Tony Smith and Antonio Harvey added 13 apiece off the bench as the Los Angeles Lakers beat the Hawks 92-87. </P>
<P> At Indiana, Rik Smits scored a season-high 30 points and Reggie Miller added 22 as the Pacers rallied for their fourth straight win, 111-106 over the Milwaukee Bucks. </P>
<P> Todd Day tied a career high with 30 points for the Bucks. </P>
<P> At Detroit, Kevin Willis scored a season-high 30 points, including eight during a fourth-quarter surge, as the Miami Heat posted their first road win of the season, 111-97 over the Pistons. </P>
<P> At Minnesota, Clarence Weatherspoon scored 19 points as the Philadelphia 76ers routed the Timberwolves 109-71. </P>
<P> Only Donyell Marshall's tip-in during the final seconds prevented Philly from allowing a team-record-low 69 points. </P>
<P> Minnesota's 71 points was second lowest total in its history. The 38-point defeat was the worst in team history. </P>
<P> At Utah, Karl Malone scored 27 points and dished out eight assists as the Jazz pummelled the Chicago Bulls 124-94. </P>
<P> Scottie Pippen led the Bulls with just 15 points. </P>
<P> In San Antonio, Gary Payton scored eight of his 21 points during a 25-2 first-quarter surge as the Seattle SuperSonics cruised to a 114-94 win over the Spurs. </P>
<P> Sean Elliott led the Spurs with 27 points. David Robinson added 20 points, 11 rebounds and five blocks. </P>
