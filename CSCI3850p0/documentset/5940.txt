<DATELINE>HELSINKI, April 22 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  More than 1,000 passengers and crew were evacuated from a Baltic car ferry after it ran aground off Helsinki on Saturday, reviving fearful memories of last year's Estonia disaster which killed 900. </P>
<P> All 977 passengers and most of the 120 crew were taken off the MS Tallink, travelling from the Finnish capital to Tallinn in Estonia, when it grounded off the fortress island of Suomenlinna in the morning mist. No one was seriously injured. </P>
<P> Passengers described how they heard ``a terrible crash'' as they breakfasted in the cafeteria while the ship picked its way through a crop of small islands outside Helsinki harbour. </P>
<P> ``I looked up and saw we were very close to a big cliff. I thought how can a big ship like this go so near? Then there was a crunch,'' Kristina Ahman, 50, with a group taking donated farm equipment to Latvia, told Reuters. </P>
<P> ``There were no announcements except for something in Estonian. Then the lights went out and the engine stopped.'' </P>
<P> The ship, with a 10 degree list, was towed back to port within four hours of the accident, Finnish news agency STT said. There was no evidence of any oil spillage. </P>
<P> ``At first, the Estonia was all I could think of,'' said Merja, 30, travelling with her three year-old son. ``People were telling us to stay calm. I think I was crying all the time.'' </P>
<P> More than 900 people were killed last September when the ferry Estonia sank in rough seas in the Baltic off Finland while on a voyage from Estonia to Sweden. </P>
<P> Helsinki Rescue Service chief Rainer Alho told a news conference the cause of the accident was not clear. Conditions were calm although there was a slight mist and a harbour pilot was still aboard the Estonian-registered vessel. </P>
<P> He said only one passenger was slightly injured in the arm during the rescue operation, involving the ferry's own lifeboats, inflatable liferafts and coastguard tugs. A passing ferry also put down lifeboats and helicopters lifted people to Suomenlinna, STT said. </P>
<P> Returning passengers said there was no panic, but complained they were poorly informed immediately after the ship grounded. </P>
<P> ``It took 10 to 15 minutes after the crash before the sirens went off, and there was no information in between,'' said Ahman. Evacuation instructions were given only in Estonian. </P>
<P> Popular day and weekend trips between Finland, Sweden and the Baltic states are just starting to revive after the Estonia disaster. Thousands of Finns make the three to five-hour trip to Tallinn to buy cheap food and alcohol. </P>
<P> The voyage can be hazardous in winter as ships get trapped in heavy ice. In March 1994 over 1,000 passengers and crew had to abandon the ferry Sally Albatross when it ran aground in icy waters in the Gulf of Finland. Three days later passengers were stranded on another ice-bound ferry for almost 24 hours. </P>
<P> Built in France in 1972, the 8,139-tonne MS Tallink is operated by the Finnish-Estonian joint venture Tallink Oy. No one at the company was available for comment. </P>
