<P>  Japanese police said Sunday that a secret underground bunker at the complex of a doomsday sect they raided was a warehouse for storing chemicals. </P>
<P> ``It turns out the underground bunker we found yesterday was a warehouse,'' a member of the police squad which searched the bunker told reporters at the site in Kamiku Isshiki, at the foot of Mt Fuji, 60 miles west of Tokyo. </P>
<P> ``That (separate) building with pipes coming out of the side is some kind of laboratory,'' said the officer, who declined to be identified. </P>
<P> The officer said it appeared members of the Aum Shinri Kyo (Supreme Truth Sect) had been taking chemicals from the underground bunker to the laboratory where they might have been synthesised into gas. </P>
<P> ``Yes, the possible gases they could have made here include sarin,'' he said, adding this was only speculation. He said police had not found sarin anywhere at the complex. The nerve gas sarin was identified as the agent used in last Monday's attack on the Tokyo subway system which killed 10 and injured 5,000 people. </P>
<P> The officer said the large underground warehouse contained a range of articles -- including some small bottles of chemicals -- but did not have any barrels of chemicals. He refused to give a description of the laboratory. </P>
