<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  South African President Nelson Mandela and Cabinet colleagues have agreed to take substantial salary cuts to show the way in an austerity regime. </P>
<P> An official statement Sunday on the pay cuts appeared to be the government's answer to a relentless outcry that South Africa's first black rulers were riding a gravy train of high salaries and generous benefits. </P>
<P> Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said Mandela, his two deputy presidents and 27 Cabinet ministers had agreed to pay cuts of up to 20 percent as an example of government belt-tightening. </P>
<P> ``The belt-tightening program will be implemented within a broader framework of programs aimed at transforming all levels of the public sector,'' Mbeki said in the statement. </P>
<P> Mbeki said the current public service wage bill took up 54 percent of government expenditure excluding interest on government debt. Overall, government consumption expenditure swallowed 21 percent of Gross Domestic Product, he said, adding that it was a comparatively high figure for a growing economy. </P>
<P> Mbeki said Mandela's salary would be cut by 20 percent from $201,000 to $161,000. </P>
<P> Mbeki and former president F.W. de Klerk, now a co-deputy president, would also cut their pay by 20 percent from $175,000 to $140,000 a year. </P>
<P> Cabinet ministers' salaries would be cut by 10 percent from $137,000 to $123,000 a year. </P>
<P> The 460 parliamentarians and other political office-bearers would also be asked to consider salary sacrifices. </P>
<P> Mbeki said the Cabinet was also considering other ways of shedding the government's fat cat image. These included plans to limit annual increases to five percent for Cabinet ministers and to re-examine the use of first-class travel and costly hotels by politicians and public servants. </P>
