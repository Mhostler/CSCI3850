<P>  Silvio Berlusconi's center-right Freedom Alliance failed Monday to secure the emphatic victory in regional elections that it had sought to precipitate a snap general election, computer projections showed. </P>
<P> Based on early returns, they put the Berlusconi camp narrowly ahead with 42.5 percent of votes to 40.3 for a center-left grouping in the 15 of Italy's 20 regions which voted for new presidents and assemblies Sunday. </P>
<P> The Abacus institute forecasts indicated control of the regions could split 8-7 in favor of one or other bloc. </P>
<P> They said the ex-communist Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), mainstay of the center-left, was set to emerge as the biggest party with 25.0 percent of votes to 23.0 for Berlusconi's free-market Forza Italia. </P>
<P> Sunday's elections were the biggest test of support since Berlusconi resigned as prime minister last December when the federalist Northern League party pulled out of his government. </P>
<P> The media tycoon repeated his call for a June general election Sunday night, after early exit polls had shown his coalition with almost 45 percent of the vote. </P>
<P> ``This is a confirmation, if any were necessary, that there is a need to go to the polls immediately,'' Berlusconi said. </P>
<P> But many political commentators Monday said the projections showed Italy split down the middle. </P>
<P> They said the outcome should allow President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro to resist pressure from the Berlusconi camp to dissolve parliament and give stop-gap Prime Minister Lamberto Dini more time to complete his limited program of reforms. </P>
<P> ``The right did not really get the significant victory...to justify an immediate disbandment of parliament and the calling of new elections,'' political scientist Franco Pavoncello of the John Cabot University in Rome told Reuters. </P>
<P> La Stampa newspaper called the projected result a stalemate between two rival blocs shaping up to fight a general election under a bipolar political system slowly forming in Italy. </P>
<P> ``The right, even if it won, has not won well enough to force early elections in June. The left, even though it held up, knows it's not ready for a fresh contest,'' La Stampa said. </P>
<P> Dini, a former central banker and treasury minister under Berlusconi, was named in January to head a government of technocrats from outside Italy's hung parliament, where he is backed by the center-left and the League. </P>
<P> Dini is expected to present a proposal on pension reform -- the last item on a four-point program -- later this week. </P>
<P> Political commentators expect a general election in Italy this year, four years early, but say it now looks increasingly likely to be delayed until October as the PDS has proposed. </P>
<P> The party and allies argue that Dini must be given time to draw up the outlines of a 1996 budget and that anti-trust laws need to be put in place to break Berlusconi's grip on the media through his ownership of three national television networks. </P>
<P> The projected center-left showing Sunday excluded the League, which ran alone in the north and was forecast to poll 7.0 percent, and the far left Communist Refoundation party, credited with 8.6 percent. </P>
<P> Catholic economist Romano Prodi, who hopes to lead the center-left in a general election, said the projected results showed a broad coalition could defeat the Freedom Alliance. </P>
<P> ``A united front will multiply our strength and these elections confirm that very clearly,'' Prodi said. </P>
