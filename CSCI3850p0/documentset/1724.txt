<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The maker of the popular anti-depressant drug Prozac was accused in a civil trial Friday of selling an ``indefensible'' product that puts users at risk. </P>
<P> In opening statements at the trial of a group of suits stemming from a 1989 shooting rampage in which eight people died, the lead plantiffs' attorney said drug manufacturer Eli Lilly and Co bore responsibility for the deaths because the killer had been taking Prozac. </P>
<P> ``We think the evidence is clear. This drug presents a serious risk to a particular group of people,'' said attorney Paul Smith. </P>
<P> ``We expect that Lilly is not going to defend this drug because it is indefensible,'' he said. </P>
<P> Prozac, the world's top selling anti-depressant and Lilly's biggest selling drug, is used by more than 12 million people worldwide, including more than eight million Americans. </P>
<P> Lilly officials said the drug was exhaustively tested and was safe, and that responsibility for the deaths lay solely with the gunman. </P>
<P> Prozac was one of 11 drugs found in the system of Joseph Wesbecker after the 47-year-old pressman opened fire inside the Standard Gravure printing plant. </P>
<P> Before he killed himself with a pistol, Wesbecker, who also carried an AK-47 assault rifle, shot eight of his former co-workers to death and injured 12 others. One person was hurt trying to flee the carnage. </P>
<P> The 23 plaintiffs who include victims, their relatives, and Wesbercker's sons are suing Lilly and four other defendants in Jefferson Circuit Court for $50 million. Victims at the trial showed the lingering effects of the rampage -- several walked with the aid of canes or walkers and one was in a wheelchair. </P>
<P> ``Lilly invented this drug, Lilly tested this drug, Lilly researched this drug and Lilly marketed this drug for people like Joseph Wesbecker,'' Smith said. </P>
<P> Lilly attorneys said Wesbecker had the potential to launch the rampage before he began taking Prozac. </P>
<P> ``Joseph Wesbecker's attack on Standard Gravure was not the act of a man suddely turned mad by Prozac,'' Lilly attorney Edward Stopher said. </P>
<P> ``This was a premeditated massacre. Prozac did not prevent him from doing what he said what he was going to do,'' he added. </P>
<P> Stopher read to the jury a detailed biography of Wesbecker's life, saying Wesbecker had told people he blamed Standard Gravure for a mental illness he suffered. He said he would take revenge on the company. </P>
<P> Attorney Joe Freeman described what he said was an extensive testing process in more than 200 clinical trials. ``Lilly underwent exhaustive testing,'' he said. </P>
<P> The trial is the first of some 160 lawsuits involving Prozac to go to trial, and Lilly officials said 92 of those suits have been dismissed. </P>
<P> The trial is expected to last two to three months. </P>
<P> Other named defendants in the suits include Wesbecker's doctor, Shea Communications Inc, which owns Standard Gravure, Hall Security Services Inc, which provided security at the plant, and Wesbecker's sons, who are also plaintiffs in a separate action in the case. </P>
