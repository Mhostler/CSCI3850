<P>  Britain sent a second navy ship to the Bay of Biscay Monday to protect its fishing fleet against possible attack by rival Spanish tuna fishermen -- who have declared war on the use of giant drift nets. </P>
<P> ``We received a request from the Cornish fishermen,'' said fisheries minister Angela Browning. ``They were rather cautious about going there today without extra protection.'' </P>
<P> British fishermen have complained that Spanish ships have surrounded them, threatening crews and cutting nets, in a mounting ``tuna war'' over fishing methods in the Atlantic. </P>
<P> Spanish fishermen have vowed to protect the tuna fisheries from the drift-net techniques of fleets from Britain, France and Ireland. The Spanish vessels use lines and argue that the drift nets decimate the fishing grounds. </P>
<P> The sending of a second Royal Navy ship also followed the clearing of a British trawler of allegations it used an oversized drift net in the disputed tuna fisheries off the Galician coast. </P>
<P> The Charisma was boarded by British navy officers and its nets were seized. It was escorted hundreds of miles back to Devonport, southern England, on Sunday only to be released without charge. </P>
<P> An inspection showed its net was just 500 feet longer than the 1.55 mile European Union limit -- well within approved tolerances for stretching. </P>
<P> Browning said the navy had been acting on a tip from a European Commission inspector. </P>
<P> Apparently reflecting some official embarrassment at the Charisma incident, Browning said the navy protection ships would carry spare nets for British fishermen. The Royal Navy patrol boat Alderney will join the Anglesey. </P>
<P> ``We believe the Royal Navy presence there will be adequate,'' she said. ``As far as I am concerned the Cornish fishermen have every right to be there fishing for tuna.'' </P>
<P> The Spanish have some support from the environmental group Greenpeace which has sent its Rainbow Warrior ship to the area, prompting angry confrontations with French authorities. Greenpeace argues the drift nets are catching not just tuna but thousands of dolphins and sharks. </P>
