<P>  President Clinton Wednesday said Postmaster General Marvin Runyon has decided to continue selling a Christmas stamp depicting the Madonna and Child Jesus, reversing plans to discontinue the stamp. </P>
<P> ``For 28 years, Americans of all faiths and stations in life have purchased this commemorative Christmas stamp,'' Clinton said in a statement announcing the decision. </P>
<P> ``I am pleased with the postmaster general's decision to allow this holiday tradition to continue,'' Clinton said. </P>
<P> White House officials said Clinton had asked Runyon to reconsider a decision to discontinue issuing the traditional stamp in 1995. </P>
<P> Postal authorities had decided to stop issuing the holiday stamp to avoid the appearance of fostering a religious belief. Instead, a stamp was to be issued bearing the image of a Victorian angel. </P>
<P> Runyon, in a statment distributed by the White House, said he was taking the action ``because the Madonna and Child stamp has occupied such an important place in our stamp program for so many years and is so meaningful to so many Americans.'' </P>
<P> He said that ``while it is, of course, important that public agencies respect the rights and preferences of people of all faiths, I am confident we can do so and still extend the appropriate holiday greets to all of our customers.'' </P>
<P> Various religious groups and some members of Congress protested the decision to stop issuing the stamp, which has been sold every year since 1978. </P>
