<P>  Muslim countries should meet to consider jointly recognizing Israel if it returns the occupied Golan Heights to Syria, Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said Thursday. </P>
<P> ``Once the Golan Heights issue is settled, I believe Muslim countries will sit together and take a decision on this issue through consensus, just as the European Union sits together and takes decisions by consensus,'' she said on a visit to Paris. </P>
<P> Noting that Israel had made peace with Palestinians and with Jordan, Bhutto told France's Diplomatic Press Association: ``It is the issue of the Golan Heights that is still outstanding and we look for a resolution of this.'' </P>
<P> Pakistan is a member of the Islamic Conference Organization, which groups Arab and other Muslim states. </P>
<P> Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria during the 1967 Middle East war. </P>
