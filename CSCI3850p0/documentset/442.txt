<P>  A special U.N. mission left late Wednesday for Somalia to evaluate reductions in the 19,000-strong U.N. force, particularly in Mogadishu, the capital. </P>
<P> Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali a week ago said the United Nations should look at its concentration of soldiers in Mogadishu, where security was deteriorating and the U.N. troops could do little to stop it. </P>
<P> The mission will be led by Major-General Timothy Dibuama, the military adviser to Boutros-Ghali, to discuss reduction of troops with the U.N. command in Mogadishu and humanitarian agencies, a U.N. statement said. </P>
<P> In response, the Security Council, in a letter, asked Boutros-Ghali to make specific recommendations on force numbers by mid-August. </P>
<P> ``The council members share your serious concern at the very little forward movement registered in the Somali national reconciliation process (and) at the recent deterioration of the security situation in Somalia,'' said the letter from Council President Jamsheed Marker of Pakistan. </P>
<P> The Security Council is due to renew the force mandate and troop strength in September. The mandate for the troops was changed in March after American and European forces pulled out, to exclude offensive action. </P>
<P> The council has said the U.N. Operation in Somalia, known as UNOSOM, would stay in the northeast African country until March 1995. </P>
<P> Boutros-Ghali in his report said UNOSOM's recent success has been ``achieved by diplomatic rather than military means.'' </P>
<P> ``I am inclined therefore to think that it may be feasible to commence a reduction in the level of troops at present assigned to UNOSOM,'' he said. </P>
