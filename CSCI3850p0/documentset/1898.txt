<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Arab gunmen burst into a popular Jerusalem nightlife area Sunday night, killing an Israeli and wounding at least 14, near a hotel housing visiting U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. </P>
<P> Police said two of the gunmen were killed during the attack on the Nahalat Shiva outdoor promenade, packed with pub and cafe goers, at around midnight. </P>
<P> Israeli security men said police sealed off the King David hotel a few hundred yards away, where Christopher was staying. U.S. security men said they were aware of the incident but the hotel itself was quiet. </P>
<P> Christopher arrived in Israel Sunday at the start of another Middle East visit to try to bridge gaps in peace talks between Israel and Syria. </P>
<P> ``At approximately 12 midnight two terrorists arrived in a vehicle at the Nahalat Shiva area in Jerusalem and opened fire in the direction of the pedestrian mall. Police arrived at the scene within 10 minutes,'' police spokesman Eric Bar-Chen said. </P>
<P> ``The two terrorists were killed and seven Israelis were wounded,'' he said. Officials at four hospitals reported receiving 14 injured people. </P>
<P> Witnesses reported confusion at the scene, the site of taverns and cafes, with bloody clothing strewn around. Police defused at least four grenades found in the area and said they would continue searching for devices through the night. </P>
<P> Dozens of Israelis tried to lynch at least two Arabs bystanders. Some 20 to 30 police officers were needed to rescue the Arabs from the angry crowd. </P>
<P></P>
<P> ``I saw one terrorist shooting at us. He was killed two minutes afterwards by a soldier. He had a Kalashnikov (automatic rifle) and a few grenades. I think he threw them but they didn't go off,'' Schlam said. </P>
<P> Another witness, Noam Goren, a waiter at one of the cafes, said: ``We saw two attackers, one of them wearing a red mask. I saw five people who got shot, two of them appeared to be seriously hurt, they were not moving.'' </P>
<P> Police said they killed the two Arab gunmen. Earlier reports of a third attacker were ruled out by a police spokesman. </P>
<P> Israel Radio earlier said the incident apparently began near Jerusalem's walled Old City where shots were heard. A special police unit arrived and clashed with a number of gunmen who then fled to the West Jerusalem nightlife area and opened fire. </P>
<P> Israeli President Ezer Weizman, arriving at the scene of the attack, was confronted by a heckler who shouted: ``Is this the price of peace?'' </P>
<P> Israeli hardliners oppose government moves to strike peace deals with Israel's Arab neighors and the large Palestinian community. </P>
