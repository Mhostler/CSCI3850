<DATELINE>NORFOLK, Va.(Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  John Salvi, the student hairstylist charged in deadly attacks on two Boston-area abortion clinics last week, will be arraigned Tuesday on a charge of shooting into a building, police said Monday. </P>
<P> Salvi, 22, was arrested Saturday after he allegedly shot up the outside of a Virginia abortion clinic, ending a nationwide manhunt for the gunman accused of killing two people and wounding five at two Brookline, Mass., clinics. </P>
<P> Virginia authorities could opt to drop the local charge, paving the way for extradition proceedings to return Salvi to Massachusetts to face the murder charges, law enforcement sources familiar with the case said Monday. </P>
<P> If Salvi waived an extradition hearing, he could be returned to Massachusetts as early as Tuesday evening, the sources said. </P>
<P> Norfolk sheriff's deputies said Salvi had spoken to police investigators but had refused requests from reporters for interviews. </P>
<P> Local officials said there were no abortion-related protests in the city Monday following a noisy demonstration of support for Salvi outside the city jail Sunday in which a small group held a prayer vigil. </P>
<P> During the demonstration, one protester shouted, ``Thank you for what you did in the name of Jesus'' into a megaphone while others carried signs saying ``Free John Salvi, Protector of Life.'' </P>
<P> Salvi is being held in Norfolk on a charge of shooting into an occupied building, a felony, for allegedly firing more that 20 rounds into the Hillcrest Clinic, this city's only abortion clinic. </P>
<P> No one was injured in the Norfolk attack, but some of the shots passed through two sets of windows and narrowly missed abortion protesters on the street. </P>
<P> The Hillcrest clinic has been the target of numerous protests and several acts of violence since its opening in 1973, nine months after the Supreme Court legalized abortion. </P>
<P> Salvi faces two counts of murder and five counts of violent assault with intent to murder in the Massachusetts attacks, which occurred about 10 minutes apart at the Planned Parenthood and Preterm Health Services clinics in Brookline. </P>
<P> Shannon Lowney, 25, a Planned Parenthood receptionist, and Leanne Nichols, 38, who held a similar job at Preterm Health Services, were killed in the Brookline attacks Friday. </P>
<P> CBS Radio reported Monday that Lowney's grandfather died of a heart attack immediately upon hearing of his granddaughter's death. </P>
