<P>  Romanian communists announced plans Wednesday to revive their party amid protests against the release of the last communist leaders jailed on charges linked to the December 1989 revolution. </P>
<P> The so-called ``initiative group'' issued a statement planning a ``15th congress of Romanian communists,'' the state news agency Rompres reported. </P>
<P> Earlier, groups representing former revolutionaries and political prisoners protested the release from jail of Ion Dinca and Ludovic Fazekas, the last communist leaders jailed for the shooting of demonstrators in the revolution that ousted Stalinist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. </P>
<P> Ceausescu led the 14th communist party congress in November 1989, a month before the popular uprising that led to his execution by firing squad. </P>
<P> The communist party was dissolved in the 1989 revolt that left more than 1,000 people dead and thousands wounded. </P>
<P> Romania has since moved gradually toward a multi-party system with free elections held in 1990 and 1992. </P>
<P> With the release of Dinca and Fazekas, all 87 communist leaders and senior secret police jailed since after 1990 have been freed for health reasons, on parole or by presidential pardon. </P>
