<P>  The leader of Germany's Jewish community warned Monday that neo-Nazi ideology, once largely confined to violence-prone gangs, had begun spreading among intellectuals. </P>
<P> Ignatz Bubis, chairman of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, said the new circles of far-right thinkers were more dangerous than skinheads and other thugs who have attacked foreigners and others since German unification in 1990. </P>
<P> ``The state will be able to cope with the violence, but the intellectuals supply the ideology that lures young people and makes them into violent criminals,'' Bubis told German radio. </P>
<P> ``This is a recent phenomenon. You do not find these intellectuals among the violent perpetrators,'' he added. </P>
<P> Bubis said many of the new far-right ideologues believed they were preventing racist violence by adopting neo-Nazi slogans as a way of drawing militants off the streets and into the mainstream political process. </P>
<P> ``They do not see that they themselves become the ones who give far-right radicals their ideas,'' Bubis said. </P>
<P> But he also praised what he saw as the refusal of many Germans to accept right-wing radicalism, pointing to a public outcry this month when a court showed understanding for a convicted far-right leader, Guenter Deckert. </P>
<P> The court in the southwestern city of Mannheim handed Deckert a suspended one-year sentence for denying the Holocaust ever happened, a crime for which prosecutors had demanded he serve two years in jail. </P>
<P> The public protested, and Bubis said, ``I consider that a positive sign.'' </P>
