<DATELINE>MINSK, Belarus (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Corruption-buster Alexander Lukashenko took office as the first president of post-Soviet Belarus Wednesday and quickly named a cabinet headed by a market reformer. </P>
<P> Lukashenko, his hand on the Belarussian constitution approved a scant four months ago, uttered the brief oath in the rarely-used Belarussian language, pledging to uphold the country's laws. He vowed to lift his people out of poverty and and shore up the country's fragile statehood. </P>
<P> Within three hours the former state farm director, who won a landslide election victory on promises to lower prices and clear out corrupt officials, had proposed a cabinet line-up led by pro-market banker Mikhail Chigir as prime minister. </P>
<P> ``The main task is to ensure a dignified life for our citizens,'' Lukashenko, 39, said in a brief address. ``God permit that our people feel some relief within the next year.'' </P>
<P> He said he would uphold individual rights and freedoms and defend the newly acquired statehood of Belarus, a country of 10 million sandwiched between Russia and Poland. </P>
<P> ``The only dictatorship that can exist in a state striving for world integration can be a dictatorship of law,'' he said to warm applause from a packed parliament. </P>
<P> Lukashenko has said since his victory that the country's coffers are empty and that Russian help will be needed. One of his first tasks will be to oversee a proposed monetary union with Moscow which officials on both sides say cannot be completed as scheduled by next month. </P>
<P> The cabinet list, to be approved by parliament, included new foreign and defense ministers but kept on the finance minister and at least two deputy prime ministers. </P>
<P> ``I stand for market reforms. Belarus cannot be an island among states moving toward market reforms,'' Chigir, the prime minister-designate, told reporters. </P>
<P> ``For the moment, I am for state-regulated prices but this is not a normal procedure. I will pursue reforms.'' </P>
<P> Stanislav Bogdankevich, a market advocate unexpectedly kept on as central bank chief, predicted Chigir would move ahead with changes. ``Lukashenko's program will be pro-market,'' he said. ``There is simply no other way to proceed.'' </P>
<P> The former Soviet republic's ambassador to Britain, Vladimir Senko, was proposed as foreign minister to replace Pyotr Kravchenko, who held the job since independence in 1991. </P>
<P> Anatoly Kostenko, head of the Belarussian military district under Soviet rule, was nominated as defense minister instead of Pavel Kozlovsky, also in place since independence. </P>
<P> A team of four deputy prime ministers included a mix of pro-market specialists and conservatives. Pro-market Finance Minister Stepan Yanchuk remained in his post. </P>
