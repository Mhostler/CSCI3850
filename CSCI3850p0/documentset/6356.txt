<DATELINE>MANILA, May 8 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  At least five people were killed in scattered violence on Monday as Filipinos turned out in large numbers to vote in national and local government polls. </P>
<P> Election officials also reported rampant vote-buying, especially in the capital of Manila. </P>
<P> Three people were killed in a bomb attack at a public market in Maguindanao province in the south, radio reports said. There were two separate killings in Zamboanga and Eastern Samar, also in the south. </P>
<P> Violence and cheating traditionally accompany elections in the Philippines, one of Asia's most turbulent democracies. In the run-up to Monday's elections, about 30 people died in campaign-related violence. </P>
<P> Resurreccion Borra, executive-director of the Commission on Elections, said in a television broadcast that the going rate for a vote was between 200 and 300 pesos ($8 to $12) in various parts of Manila. </P>
<P> Long lines of people gathered outside polling stations after they opened at 7 a.m. (2300 GMT Sunday). </P>
<P> President Fidel Ramos, who has said the polls are a referendum on his three-year-old administration, appealed for a peaceful election. </P>
<P> ``Let us not forget what we fought for at EDSA in 1986 in winning back our democracy,'' he told reporters, referring to the popular uprising which overthrew the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos. </P>
<P> Marcos's widow, Imelda, and son Bongbong are both standing in the elections. Imelda is running for the House of Representatives from her native Leyte province while Bongbong is aiming for the Senate. </P>
<P> ``Our democracy is imperiled by terrorism, cheating, the use of guns, goons and gold, warlordism, terror and violence. we must not allow this to happen again,'' Ramos said after voting in his hometown of Asingan in Pangasinan province north of Manila. </P>
<P> ``Today is an opportunity for the 36 million Filipinos to make sure democracy will flourish in our country,'' he said. </P>
<P> Ramos added the polls would ensure economic stability and progress in the Philippines. </P>
<P> Political analysts say his coalition party needs at least seven of the 12 seats at stake in the Senate to be able to claim a convincing victory. </P>
<P> Also at stake are all 204 elected seats in the House of Representatives and tens of thousands of local government positions. </P>
<P> Ramos came to power in 1992 with just over 23 percent of the vote and political analysts said these polls give the electorate a chance to cast their verdict on the sweeping economic reforms he has made the centrepiece of his administration. </P>
