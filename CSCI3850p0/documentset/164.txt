<P>  According to a Hungarian businessman, getting rid of dangerous heavy metals in your body will soon be as easy as going to the bathroom. </P>
<P> Lajos Szakacsi, head of the company Avevita Kft, said he is going to market a new oat-bran extract pill that will soak up lead and radioactive strontium carried in the bloodstream. </P>
<P> The pill, called Avenan, is in the final stages of clinical trials and will go on sale in Hungary in December, he said. Because it is a health supplement rather than a medication, it can be approved after a simple registration procedure. </P>
<P> Szakacsi would like to market Avenan in the former Soviet Union, where the 1986 explosion at the Chernobyl power plant and other nuclear accidents have spread a large amount of radioactive heavy metals into the environment. </P>
<P> Avenan contains a highly concentrated form of oat bran fibers that can rid a lifetime accumulation of lead in months, Szakacsi said. Normal oat bran cannot do this, he added. </P>
<P> While moving through the intestines, the fibers in Avenan absorb the lead they encounter and leave the body with them, said an employee of Avevita. </P>
<P> Preliminary findings indicate that the fibers can also absorb strontium, a heavy metal, said Istvan Pap, an Avevita employee. </P>
<P> Strontium replaces calcium in the bone, and radioactive strontium is common near sites of nuclear accidents. </P>
<P> Lead pollution is high throughout Eastern Europe, where few cars run on unleaded fuel and much of the outdated heavy industry is highly polluting. In some areas of Hungary, the air contains 10 times the acceptable level of the metal. </P>
