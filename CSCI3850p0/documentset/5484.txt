<P>  President Clinton told an exuberant union audience Wednesday that he opposes Republican efforts to repeal a law that requires workers on federal construction projects to be paid prevailing local wages. </P>
<P> Clinton's backing of the depression-era Davis-Bacon law prompted a standing ovation from a national conference of the AFL-CIO's Building and Construction Trades Department. </P>
<P> ``I'm not for repealing Davis-Bacon,'' the president said. </P>
<P> ``Like every other law, it shouldn't be abused,'' he said. ''But it is a decent thing to say that the government should stand on the side of good wages and the real wages in the community that are good and fair.'' </P>
<P> Although Clinton stopped short of vowing to veto a repeal of Davis-Bacon by the Republican-led Congress, Vice President Al Gore told members of the AFL-CIO's policy-making Executive Council in February that they could count on a veto of any such legislation if it reaches the president's desk. </P>
<P> The Davis-Bacon law has already come under fire in Congress, where the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee and a House Education and Economic Opportunity subcommittee have passed bills to repeal it. </P>
<P> Opponents of Davis-Bacon, chiefly the Associated Builders and Contractors, contend that it benefits only organized labor, will cost taxpayers more than $2.6 billion over the next five years and discourages the entry in construction trades of unskilled workers, often minorities and women. </P>
<P> Davis-Bacon backers, mainly labor unions, say it relies primarily on free market principles to determine local wages, helps millions of skilled workers stay in the middle class and promotes higher-quality workmanship. </P>
<P> Union leaders also said their apprentice programs have brought more minority workers into the construction trades than those of non-union employers. </P>
