<P>  Two Algerian policemen and two gunmen were killed Tuesday in a shootout outside the Italian embassy in Algiers, Italian television reported. </P>
<P> It said the gun battle erupted some 20 yards from the embassy gates when three gunmen attacked a police patrol but quoted Italy's ambassador to Algeria, Patrizio Schmidlin, as saying the assault was not aimed at the embassy itself. </P>
<P> Fourteen foreigners, including seven Italian seamen who had their throats slit, have been killed in Algeria in the past six days in attacks blamed by the army-backed government on Muslim fundamentalist guerrillas. </P>
<P> Italian television said the three gunmen had driven up to the embassy in a truck and opened fire on a police patrol. The Italian news agency ANSA said one of the gunmen had been captured and a third policeman wounded. </P>
<P> More than 3,700 Algerians and at least 49 foreigners have been killed in 30 months of political violence since the government cancelled elections which the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), since outlawed, had been set to win. </P>
<P> Mirko Tremaglia, chairman of the Italian Chamber of Deputies foreign affairs commission, said Tuesday that the Rome government should consider evacuating 650 Italian workers from Algeria unless political stability returned. </P>
