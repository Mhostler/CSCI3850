<P>  Chalk one up for mother love, at least in the canine world. </P>
<P> Nine newborn Rottweiler puppies were recovering peacefully in a south Florida animal shelter Tuesday after their mother dug frantically through the day Monday to rescue them after their owner buried them alive. </P>
<P> Police said Robert Humrighous, 41, of this Fort Lauderdale suburb, told them he buried the puppies Sunday because he decided he did not want more dogs. </P>
<P> But the dog's mother struggled so valiantly to save her offspring that neighbors were alerted and called police. </P>
<P> Miraculously, the little dogs were rescued a day after they were buried, all of them alive. </P>
<P> Though the nine puppies, their mother and another dog were removed from Humrighous's care, he had not been charged with any crime by Tuesday afternoon. </P>
