<P> ``The voice of the masses expresses the Iraqi attitude ... It is the rejection of this unfair resolution,'' Saleh told reporters. </P>
<P> ``They (Iraqi people) have no alternative but to demand the full lifting of sanctions. There is no other choice.'' </P>
<P> Saleh was leading a demonstration of about 5,000 Iraqis in the heart of Baghdad. They shouted slogans condemning the resolution as a desperate U.S. attempt showing the bankruptcy of the Clinton administration. </P>
<P> The U.N. Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution Friday allowing Iraq to sell $2 billion worth of oil over six months mainly to buy food and medicines in short supply since it imposed sanctions on Baghdad after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. </P>
