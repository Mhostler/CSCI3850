<P>  The administration is weighing the possibility of President Clinton issuing an order banning government contractors from using replacement workers, White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry said Saturday. </P>
<P> ``The president and this administration starts with the philosophical premise that to use striker replacements is a bad thing for labor-management relations and runs contrary to effective collective bargaining,'' McCurry said. </P>
<P> Responding to questions stemming from a report in Saturday editions of the Washington Times, McCurry said officials were examining issuing an executive order that would ``allow the federal government to terminate contracts in cases where the contractor uses replacement workers.'' </P>
<P> ``Right now it is being looked at by experts at the inter-agency level,'' McCurry said. ``It is not in a position yet where a final recommendation can go to the president.'' </P>
<P> When asked if Vice President Al Gore might make such an announcement on Monday when he addresses the annual meeting of the AFL-CIO labor organization in Bal Harbour, Fla., McCurry said the chances of that happening were ``very remote at this point ... We still have a long ways to go.'' </P>
