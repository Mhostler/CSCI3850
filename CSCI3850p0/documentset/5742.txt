<DATELINE>ZAKHO, Iraq, April 14 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The commander of Turkey's cross-border operation against Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq warned the guerrillas on Friday they would be attacked if they used two U.N. refugee camps at Atrush as bases. </P>
<P> ``The camps are under U.N. auspices and outside our operation zone so we don't want to go in, even though we could. But if they attack us from there they will be punished,'' Lieutenant General Hasan Kundakci told Reuters in northern Iraq. </P>
<P> Kundakci, inspecting a military post 45 km (28 miles) east of the Iraqi town of Zakho, said Turkey would try to persuade the United Nations to expel suspected rebels from the two camps near the village of Atrush, which hold about 13,000 refugees. </P>
<P> ``If they don't sort it out, we'll have to think of something from a military point of view. If they (the rebels) sit in the camps doing nothing we won't act but if they come and kill our innocent civilians and soldiers they will be punished,'' he said. </P>
<P> The general did not specifically say his troops would attack the camps. </P>
<P> Officials of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees have denied that separatist rebels of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) are inside the camps but say there are PKK sympathisers among the refugees who have fled fighting in Turkey and Iraq. </P>
<P> Kurdish refugees in the camps told Reuters on Thursday they had close ties to the PKK, and supported its goal of a Kurdish homeland in southeast Turkey, but denied that the camps were used as guerrilla bases against Turkish forces. </P>
<P> U.N. security sources and foreign aid workers said, however, that PKK rebels often stayed at the camps, nestled in valleys either side of the hill-top village of Atrush, about 80 km (50 miles) from the border with Turkey. </P>
<P> The guerrillas hid their weapons nearby before entering the camps and frequent searches had revealed no arms, they said. </P>
<P> Turkey launched its biggest military operation of modern times on March 20, sending 35,000 troops into northern Iraq in pursuit of PKK rebels who maintain bases there. </P>
<P> The United Nations moved several thousand civilians to the safety of the Atrush camps which were set up last year. </P>
<P> Turkish Brigadier-General Huseyin Erim told Reuters on Wednesday that he had a list of PKK members hiding in the Atrush camps. He did not say how many he believed were there. </P>
