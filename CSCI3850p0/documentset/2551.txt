<P>  Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer said Friday he paid about $100,000 for an insurance policy that ended his ties in a controversial Lloyd's of London investment. </P>
<P> Breyer released a letter from Graeme King, the senior manager in Lloyd's Financial Recovery Department, confirming that he had purchased the insurance to cover all of his Lloyd's liabilities and was no longer was a member of the insurance syndicate. </P>
<P> During Senate Judicairy Committee confirmation hearings last summer, Breyer was criticized about his rulings in eight cases concerning pollution when he was a U.S. appeals court judge in Boston in pollution cases. At the time, he was an investor in a Lloyd's syndicate that faced heavy loses from pollution lawsuits. </P>
<P> Breyer denied any impropriety. He became a ``name'' or investor in Lloyd's in 1985, joining a syndicate that was responsible for several insurance policies for losses from pollution and asbestos damage. Because of unexpectedly large damages, the syndicate remains liable for outstanding claims. </P>
<P> King, said in his Nov. 9 letter that Breyer has asked ``for a brief press release'' about his action. ``Your deposits will be returned to you as soon as possible,'' he said. </P>
<P> In the unlikely event that the insurer from whom Breyer bought his coverage goes bankrupt, King said Lloyd's would assume the liability, ``as has been the case throughout Lloyd's history.'' </P>
<P> Supreme Court spokeswoman Toni House said Breyer would continue ``for a time'' to recuse himself from cases before the high court involving Lloyd's. </P>
