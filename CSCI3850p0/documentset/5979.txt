<P>  Egypt tried, but failed, to turn back a Libyan airliner that violated a U.N. air embargo by flying 150 pilgrims to Saudi Arabia last Wednesday, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said. </P>
<P> ``We knew of the plane after we discovered it in our airspace and, naturally, we tried to turn it back but we couldn't because we couldn't treat it as an enemy plane,'' Mubarak told reporters after he opened a chemicals factory in Sinai on Sunday. </P>
<P> ``So it completed its course -- it was night and we had no other option, and it landed in Saudi Arabia, the pilgrims got off and the plane returned to Libya immediately,'' the Monday edition of al-Ahram newspaper quoted Mubarak as saying. </P>
<P> Libya flew the plane from Tripoli to the Saudi city of Jeddah hours before the United Nations authorised Egypt to transport 6,000 pilgrims directly from Libya to and from Jeddah. Egypt's national carrier EgyptAir began its operation on Thursday. </P>
<P> Mubarak said a second Libyan plane that took off from Benghazi on Wednesday did not complete its journey. </P>
<P> The ban on flights to and from Libya is part of U.N. sanctions imposed in 1992 after Tripoli refused to hand over two men wanted in the West in connection with the bombing of a Pan Am plane over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, which killed 270 people. </P>
