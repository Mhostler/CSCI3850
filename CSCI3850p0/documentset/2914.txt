<P>  A British convoy held hostage since Saturday by Bosnian Serbs was released late Tuesday night and arrived in the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo early Wednesday morning, a U.N. spokesman said. </P>
<P> ``The convoy arrived in Sarajevo this morning and everything seems to be fine with them,'' said Major Herve Gourmelon, a spokesman for the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Sarajevo. </P>
<P> ``We believe the other British convoy is still stuck and we have no word on the movement of the Dutch.'' </P>
<P> U.N. sources say 43 British peacekeepers were on the convoy that arrived in Sarajevo Wednesday. They had been prevented from leaving the eastern Bosnian enclave of Gorazde, where about 60,000 Muslims are surrounded by Serbs. </P>
<P> A second British convoy, carrying 20 engineers into Gorazde, still had not made it to its destination Wednesday morning. </P>
<P> Two Dutch convoys with 102 soldiers were also halted Saturday, one headed into the enclave of Srebrenica and the other headed out. </P>
<P> Dutch authorities said Tuesday they had received assurances the convoys would be released, but the United Nations had no word of their status Wednesday morning. </P>
<P> The United Nations reports more than 200 other peacekeepers are being held hostage by Bosnian Serbs to prevent possible NATO air strikes against Serb troops who have entered the U.N.-designated ``safe area' of Bihac town in northwestern Bosnia. </P>
