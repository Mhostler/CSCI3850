<DATELINE>SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A convoy of U.N. ambulances arrived in Sarajevo Wednesday carrying 116 sick or wounded Bosnian Muslims evacuated from the east Bosnian enclave of Gorazde. </P>
<P> The convoy of 18 Norwegian and Canadian U.N. vehicles reached Sarajevo at about midnight after driving for several hours over icy mountain roads from the mountainous Gorazde enclave, which is surrounded by Bosnian Serb forces. </P>
<P> Earlier, U.N. peacekeepers had evacuated 66 Serb patients out of Gorazde to the nearby Serb town of Kopaci as part of a deal between the combatants, U.N. spokesman Maj. Koos Sol said. </P>
<P> Relatives of the Bosnian Muslim patients waited in the cold for the ambulances to arrive at Sarajevo's main Kosevo hospital after an evacuation that required laborious negotiations beforehand with Serb authorities. </P>
<P> The evacuation deal marked the first time in the war that rival Bosnian government and Serb faction in the Gorazde area had signed the same agreement. </P>
<P> U.N. officials had described the evacuation as a positive sign of Serb intentions but expressed disappointment that Bosnian Serb negotiators had reneged on earlier promises to reopen roads in Sarajevo to civilian traffic. </P>
<P> The Serbs had told U.N. commanders they would reopen the roads for commercial traffic Wednesday, more than six months after closing them in July after an attack on a British U.N. convoy. </P>
<P> Following talks with the Bosnian government at Sarajevo airport Tuesday, however, they agreed to allow only eight international humanitarian organizations to begin using the roads across the U.N.-controlled airport on Wednesday. </P>
<P> A Muslim-led Bosnian government official said the decision to continue barring civilian traffic threatened to derail a New Year truce. </P>
<P> ``This is a complete collapse (of the cease-fire process),'' Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic told Reuters. </P>
<P> A resumption of commercial traffic along the ``blue routes'' would have provided a vital source of food to the people of the capital and eased the isolation of a city under siege for more than 1,000 days. </P>
<P> Talks between the combatants on the release of prisoners of war and information on missing persons also failed to produce agreement, U.N. spokesman Gary Coward said. </P>
<P> The setback arose as fighting eased between government troops and Muslim rebels allied to Serbs in the northwestern Bosnian enclave of Bihac -- the worst clashes since a cease-fire was declared across the former Yugoslavia on Jan. 1. </P>
<P> France and Germany made new appeals for peace, with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe warning that Bosnia could again erupt ``in flames.'' </P>
