<P>  South African President Nelson Mandela will travel to the United States in October for a state visit, it was announced in both countries Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``President Mandela today accepted an invitation from President Bill Clinton to visit the United States on a state visit from October 4 to 6,'' a statement issued by Mandela's office said. </P>
<P> The statement said it would be the first state visit by a South African head of state to the United States. </P>
<P> In Washington, White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said President Clinton was looking forward to the event. </P>
<P> She said Clinton ``believes this visit will be an occasion for all Amerians to celebrate and rejoice in the birth of a new South Africa.'' </P>
<P> ``In the 100 days since his inauguration, President Mandela has given tangible meaning to his commitment to lead a non-racial society forward to address the social and economic legacies of apartheid,'' Myers said. </P>
<P> ``His visit will help strengthen our partnership with the democratic South Africa in pursuit of peace and prosperity,'' she said. </P>
<P> She noted that Vice President Al Gore, his wife Tipper Gore and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton had attended Mandela's inauguration in May. Clinton also met Mandela at the White House in July 1993. </P>
<P> Mandela's visit to Washington will be preceded by a stopover in New York on October 3, when Manela will address the U.N. General Assembly, the South African statement said. </P>
