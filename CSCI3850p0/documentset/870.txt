<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Onboard computers aborted the launch of the U.S. space shuttle Endeavour Thursday after the engines had started and less than two seconds before liftoff. </P>
<P> The National Aeronautics and Space Administration blamed a fuel-pumping mechanism on one of the mighty engines. </P>
<P> NASA said it would be at least a month before repairs are made and six astronauts can try again to get a 10-day Earth science mission off the ground. The engines must be replaced. </P>
<P> Boyce Mix, a NASA engine project manager, said the faulty pump was pushing liquid oxygen at a temperature slightly higher than normal through one of the shuttle engines. </P>
<P> ``We've got a problem with the engine that there's not a ready explanation for,'' Mix said. </P>
<P> Loren Shriver, chairman of NASA's mission management team, said the computers worked as designed and prevented a disaster. ``The system is designed so that if something like this happens, it won't lift off,'' he said. </P>
<P> The incident cost NASA $650,000 and put into question target dates for the next several shuttle flights, including an historic visit to the Russian Mir space station next year. </P>
<P> One hour after the aborted launch, the crew climbed out safely, looking sweaty but smiling, and shaking hands with technicians who opened the spaceship's hatch. </P>
<P> Endeavour commander Michael Baker said the six men heard a muffled rumble, felt the engines vibrate, and waited for ``that big kick'' from the two solid-fuel booster rockets that ignite at liftoff, ``but it never happened.'' </P>
<P> NASA initially said the engines had been snuffed only milliseconds before liftoff. They later revised that statement, saying the shutdown began 1.9 seconds before the appointed liftoff time of 6:54 a.m. EDT. </P>
<P> Mix said the process takes about five seconds, and that is why orange flames were visible beneath the tail of the shuttle as much as three seconds after liftoff time. Fire protection systems at the launch pad sprayed water on the shuttle. </P>
<P> Technical glitches distracted ground crews during the launch countdown, but none appeared related to Thursday's heart-stopping abort. </P>
<P> In addition to Baker, crew members are co-pilot Terrence Wilcutt, flight engineer Daniel Bursch and mission specialists Steven Smith, Peter ``Jeff'' Wisoff and Thomas Jones. </P>
