<P>  Colorado's attorney general and district attorneys from four counties said Wednesday they would jointly investigate charges of misconduct leveled against both the Democratic and Republican candidates for governor. </P>
<P> ``The grouping of both Republicans and Democrats should allay concerns that political considerations might influence the response to allegations by either side,'' said attorney general Gale Norton, a Republican who is running for re-election. </P>
<P> Gov. Roy Romer, a Democrat running for a third term, told the Rocky Mountain News this week he used State Troopers to provide personal services for his family. </P>
<P> Charges have surfaced that the campaign of his Republican opponent, Bruce Benson, has conducted misleading telephone polls and has sent campaign literature that does not have disclosure information required by law. </P>
<P> The district attorneys also represent both parties. Romer is leading Benson, according to recent polls. </P>
