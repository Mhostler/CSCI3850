<P>  Syria Thursday made its first direct criticism of Jordan for signing an agreement ending the state of war with Israel and said Damascus was not in a rush for what it called an ``incomplete'' peace with the Jewish state. </P>
<P> The government daily al-Baath described the Washington declaration as a ``surprise development'' and a ``violation'' of the principles on which the peace process was launched nearly three years ago in Madrid. </P>
<P> It said the declarations, signed by King Hussein of Jordan and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin following their first public meeting in Washington on Monday, will negatively affect Arab interests. </P>
<P> ``The surprise developments and violations including the Gaza-Jericho deal and the Washington declaration could not overwhelm the fact that peace will fail and evaporate if it is not just and comprehensive,'' al-Baath said. </P>
<P> ``These developments (peace deals) came to affirm that unilateral and partial deals would negatively affect the causes, interests and rights of Arabs,'' it said. </P>
<P> Syria, whose own peace talks with Israel are deadlocked over Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights and future ties, had strongly criticised the Gaza-Jericho deal between the PLO and Israel. </P>
<P> Al-Baath said a confrontation between the PLO and Jordan, ignited by Monday's summit agreement between Rabin and Hussein which guaranteed Jordan special powers over the Muslim shrines of Jerusalem, showed that separate deals would create problems for Arabs. </P>
<P> A senior aide to PLO chairman Yasser Arafat described Israel's agreement to maintain Jordan's role at Muslim shrines in Jerusalem as violating the PLO-Israeli peace agreement, signed in September. </P>
<P> ``The dispute between Jordan and the PLO over Jerusalem -- which is still under occupation and which will probably continue to be so after those who have rights abandoned their rights -- confirms that separate deals will bring disasters to Arabs,'' al-Baath said. </P>
<P> It said that Syria had clearly and openly repeated its commitment to coordination and solidarity among Arab states taking part in the peace process. </P>
<P> ``But Syria announced with the same clarity that it is not in haste for incomplete peace which will lead to nothing but to disasters to the interests of the Arab nation,'' al-Baath said. </P>
<P> Syria wants Israel to withdraw fully from the Golan, a strategic plateau captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war. Israel says it is ready for a partial pullback in return for full normal ties with Damascus. </P>
