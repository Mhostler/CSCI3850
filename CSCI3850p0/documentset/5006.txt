<P>  China said Saturday it would hold grand celebrations to mark this year's 50th anniversary of the end of the war with Japan and told Tokyo it should never forget the conflict. </P>
<P> ``The war 50 years ago brought deep sufferings to the people around the world, especially to the Chinese people,'' Chinese Premier Li Peng told a news conference after the close of the annual session of parliament. </P>
<P> ``We will never forget it,'' he said. ``We hope that through grand celebrations the Chinese people as well as people around the world, including the Japanese people, will not forget that war and will not let that kind of thing happen again.'' </P>
<P> China was a principal victim of Japan's military expansion into Asia in the 1930s which culminated in Tokyo's involvement in World War II. </P>
<P> Beijing is to commemorate Japan's August 1945 defeat with a series of activities, including a new film, ``The Nanjing Massacre,'' chronicling Japanese atrocities in China. </P>
<P> China maintains that in 1937 invading Japanese troops killed more than 300,000 people in the eastern city of Nanjing -- then known as Nanking -- in what has become known as the ``Rape of Nanking.'' </P>
<P> Some revisionist historians, officials and lawmakers in Japan deny that the massacre took place. The incident remains a controversial issue in both countries. </P>
<P> Several Japanese ministers have resigned after making comments -- which have enraged Asian neighbor -- playing down Japan's wartime atrocities. </P>
<P> Relations between China and Japan have improved, and Li said he hoped this would continue into the 21st century. </P>
<P> ``Today both the Chinese and the Japanese governments have stated they will maintain friendly, cooperative relations. We believe this is wise,'' he said. </P>
