<DATELINE>TORONTO (Reuter</DATELINE>
<P>  The Toronto Maple Leafs made three trades for the stretch drive Thursday, including the acquisition of left wing Benoit Hogue from the New York Islanders for highly regarded goaltending prospect Eric Fichaud and two draft picks. </P>
<P> The Maple Leafs picked up center Paul DiPietro, a key member of Montreal's Stanley Cup championship run in 1993, from the Canadiens for a future fourth-round draft choice and dealt right wing Nikolai Borschevsky to the Calgary Flames for a sixth-round draft choice in 1996. </P>
<P> Fichaud, a 19-year-old who was the 16th pick of last season's entry draft, was dealt because Toronto already has quality young goaltenders in Felix Potvin and Damian Rhodes. </P>
<P> He played this past season for Chicoutimi of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, where he was 21-19-4 with a 3.44 goals-against average. </P>
<P> Hogue quickly fell out of favor with Islanders coach Lorne Henning and has suffered through a subpar season, tallying just six goals and 10 points in 33 games. In 258 games for the Islanders, the 28-year-old Hogue had 105 goals and 124 assists for 229 points. He has 150 goals and 191 assists for 341 points in 454 career games. </P>
<P> The 24-year-old DiPietro had four goals and five assists in 22 games for Montreal this season, his fourth with the Canadiens. In 154 lifetime games, DiPietro has 25 goals and 44 assists for 69 points. During Montreal's Cup run in 1993, DiPietro had eight goals and 13 points in 17 playoff games. </P>
<P> The 30-year-old Borschevsky had 48 goals and 65 assists for 113 points in 142 career games, all with Toronto. He had five assists in 19 games for the Leafs this season. </P>
<P> The National Hockey League trading deadline is Friday. </P>
