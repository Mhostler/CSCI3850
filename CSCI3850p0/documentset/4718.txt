<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, Germany (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Some 17,000 workers from Germany's chemicals sector demonstrated in central Frankfurt Saturday to press their demands for a 6 percent wage rise. </P>
<P> ``The firms are in a position to pay without suffering,'' Hermann Rappe, head of the IG Chemie trade union, told a rally. </P>
<P> IG Chemie, Germany's second most powerful industrial union, narrowly failed to clinch a pay deal in marathon 14-hour talks with employers nearly two weeks ago. </P>
<P> The next round of pay talks has been set for March 8. </P>
<P> Insiders say both the union and employers are waiting for the outcome of a strike in the key engineering sector, now in its ninth day, before committing themselves to a deal. </P>
<P> Bavarian engineering industry employers said Saturday they would make a firm pay offer to the IG Metall engineering union when wage talks in that sector resume Monday. </P>
<P> Talks there collapsed nine days ago after 2 3/8 months when employers refused to make a firm pay offer in response to IG Metall's 6 percent wage claim and insisted the union discuss cost-cutting measures. </P>
<P> Strikes will continue in Bavaria despite the talks. </P>
