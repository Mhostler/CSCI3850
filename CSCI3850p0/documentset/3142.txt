<P>  Two U.S. senators who crossed into South Korea Monday after visiting the communist North said the new Republican-controlled Congress would examine the U.S.-North Korea nuclear accord, but would not scuttle it. </P>
<P> Senators Frank Murkowski and Paul Simon, who held a news conference in Seoul after crossing the border between the two Koreas at the truce village of Panmunjom, said a new Congress would mean changes in domestic policy but not foreign. </P>
<P> ``As far as any efforts to scuttle the agreement, I don't anticipate any. The agreement will be examined thoroughly,'' said Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska who had criticized the accord. </P>
<P> Murkowski had questioned the U.S. compromise on earlier demands that North Korea let international inspectors examine two off-limit nuclear waste sites which could reveal evidence of a suspected nuclear weapons program. </P>
<P> The two senators met with South Korean President Kim Young-sam and Foreign Minister Han Sung-joo just before the conference. </P>
<P> They said that while in North Korea they met with Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam but not the country's new leader Kim Jong-il. ``We did not meet with Kim Jong-il although we had requested it,'' said Paul Simon, a Democrat from Illinois. </P>
<P> ``It was explained to us that he is still in a period of mourning for his late father,'' Murkowski said. </P>
<P> During their visit to the communist state they said they discussed ways to improve relations between Washington and North Korea and to ensure the North faithfully implements the accord with the United States. </P>
<P> A major point, Simon said, was that the sooner relations between the United States and North Korea are improved ``the sooner there can be full and open inspection of nuclear facilities in North Korea.'' </P>
<P> He said they also told the North Koreans that dialog with the government of South Korea was important. </P>
<P> ``The North Koreans expressed that they wanted better relations with the United States, and we said we wanted better relations too, but that there cannot be unless (there are) improved relations with South Korea,'' Simon said. </P>
<P> Simon also told North Korea that ``restraint was necessary by both governments to improve relations.'' </P>
<P> In the Geneva accord in October, the United States said it would arrange the supply of new nuclear reactors to North Korea worth $4 billion. The North agreed in return to freeze its existing nuclear program, which the West suspects was designed to make atomic weapons. </P>
<P> The senators said they delivered a letter to Kim Jong-il via North Korea's foreign ministry requesting the establishment of a joint task force to recover the remains of U.S. servicemen listed as missing in action from the Korean War. </P>
<P> ``They responded through the foreign ministry that it had been reviewed and would proceed to achieve that,'' Murkowski said. </P>
