<DATELINE>SZAJOL, Hungary (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  An express train derailed at full speed and slammed into a hostel and waiting room at a provincial railway station in central Hungary Friday, killing at least 21 people, police said. </P>
<P> Another 60 were injured, some seriously, and rescuers were using dogs to search the wreckage of the train and buildings for more dead. </P>
<P> The disaster occurred as the express was travelling fron Nyiregyhaza in eastern Hungary to Budapest. It was Hungary's the worst rail accident in 26 years. </P>
<P> One carriage of the train smashed through the ground floor walls of a hostel for railway workers. It brought the two floors and roof crashing down on top of the trackside building at Szajol station 75 miles east of Budapest. </P>
<P> Two first class carriages sliced into the waiting room at and lay embedded, their windows shattered, in the remains. An electric power pylon collapsed onto what was left of the waiting room. </P>
<P> One carriage was crushed to a third of its normal length. </P>
<P> A Reuter photographer at the scene said he had seen a body sliced in half lying inside one of the wrecked railway carriages. Another body was trapped under a wheel block which had been sheared off a carriage and remained on the track. </P>
<P> Rescue workers, climbing over a carpet of suitcases, bags, clothes bottles and half-eaten food flung from the train, were cutting bodies out of the wreckage. </P>
<P> ``We have confirmed so far that 21 died in the accident and 60 people were injured,'' police spokesman Laszlo Garamvolgyi told a news conference at the scene of the accident. </P>
<P> But rescue workers, using dogs to look for the injured and dead, said more bodies might be found. </P>
<P> ``We still don't know if there are any more people inside the buildings,'' said one firefighter at the scene. </P>
<P> The Hungarian news agency reported that of the injured ferried to nearby hospitals by a fleet of over 30 ambulances, seven were ``gravely injured'' and two ``critically injured.'' </P>
<P> People stood near the scene silently stunned or in tears. Some tried to comfort each other. </P>
