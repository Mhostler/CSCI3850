<P>  Canadian gunboats stood guard over disputed fishing grounds off the Newfoundland coast Friday as Canada's seizure of a Spanish fishing trawler on the high seas escalated into a major diplomatic row. </P>
<P> In the face of potential European Union retaliation, Prime Minister Jean Chretien took a tough, defiant stance the Canadian Press (CP) news agency reported. </P>
<P> ``If I had wanted to be the friend of everybody internationally I would have shut up, but that's not my style,'' Chretien told a cheering crowd of his Liberal Party in Winnipeg. </P>
<P> ``We had to show the Canadian flag and to show it with some decency and firmness so the people would understand,'' the Canadian Press reported him as saying in his first speech since the Spanish ship Estai was seized. </P>
<P> On Thursday, Canadian gunboats fired across the bow of a Spanish trawler and seized it after a high speed chase in fog-bound waters. Canada has refused to release the boat as demanded by the EU. </P>
<P> In Brussels, angry EU ambassadors met in an emergency session in Brussels Friday and demanded that Canada immediately release the Estai. </P>
<P> They asked the European Commission to draw up a list of potential retaliatory measures against Canada. </P>
<P> In a strongly worded statement, the ambassadors demanded that Ottawa immediately release the Spanish vessel, calling the seizure ``an illegal and totally unacceptable act.'' </P>
<P> But Canadian gunboats were watching for any return of Spanish fishing vessels into a disputed area of the North Atlantic. </P>
<P> Canadian Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin acknowledged Friday that a Canadian destroyer, the Terra Nova, was patrolling off Canada's east coast. </P>
<P> Chretien told his party supporters in Winnepeg that Canada acted ``not in the interests of Canadian fishermen, but of mankind'' to stop fishing abuses that could lead to the disappearance of turbot stocks off the Canadian shore, CP said. </P>
<P> The Canadian prime minister added he personally approved the procedures to stop the Estai, including firing across the ship's bow, according to CP. </P>
<P> ``They (European fishing boats) have to follow the rules. It's not for nothing that the captain (of the Estai) dropped his nets in the bottom of the ocean,'' CP quoted him as saying. </P>
<P> In Madrid, the Spanish government said a Spanish patrol boat was ready to sail from the southern port of Cadiz as soon as a European Union inspector arrived to accompany it, with instructions to protect other Spanish ships in the area. </P>
<P> Canada has passed a law that allows it to seize ships in international waters if it believes they are overfishing. But several nations say they do not recognize Canada's jurisdiction in international waters. </P>
<P> ``This is an act of premeditated aggression that goes against international law, an unprecedented act because it happened in international waters,'' Agriculture and Fisheries Minister Luis Atienza told a news conference in Madrid. </P>
<P> Tobin vowed to detain any Spanish or Portuguese fishing vessels moving into the disputed region to catch Greenland halibut, also known as turbot. </P>
<P> Canadian government planes are carrying out a close surveillance off the coast, he said. </P>
<P> Thousands of people are expected to gather in St. John's harbor in the Canadian province of Newfoundland at midday Saturday when the seized Spanish fishing vessel, the Estai, arrives in port under Canadian government control. </P>
<P> A fleet of anywhere from 14 to 17 Spanish trawlers was hovering in deep water just outside Canada's territorial waters, while another 10 Portuguese ships were also massed in the area off the Grand Banks. </P>
<P> Tobin heightened his attack on the Spanish fishing fleet Friday, saying it was overfishing well above allowed quotas with the complicity of the Spanish government and the European Union. </P>
<P> ``It is a sophisticated plan directed by the companies and it is my belief that the government of Spain and EU cannot be unaware of it,'' Tobin told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. </P>
<P> ``We are doing this as a last resort. We are doing this because it is clear to us that if we don't move now this stock will disappear,'' a defiant Tobin told reporters Friday. </P>
<P> Overfishing for cod in the region, what was once one of the richest fishing grounds in the world, has made that species almost extinct, throwing close to 30,000 Newfoundlanders out of jobs. </P>
<P> ``Five years ago the European Union said of the cod stocks what it is saying today about turbot,'' said Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells. ``It is obvious they don't care what the ultimate consequences are, their sole interest is in getting as much fish as they can as soon as they can.'' </P>
<P> The dispute flared after the EU rejected its share of a quota for Greenland halibut fixed by the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) for 1995 and instead set itself a much higher limit. </P>
<P> Canada has imposed a 60-day moaitorium for all fishing for the Greenland halibut by its fishermen and all others. </P>
