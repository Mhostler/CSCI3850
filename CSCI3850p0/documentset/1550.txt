<P>  Seven Romanian senators have protested to the United States over Washington's nominee for Bucharest ambassador -- the president of the American Jewish Committee who negotiated the emigration of Romanian Jews. </P>
<P> ``We, as representatives of the Romanian people, are indignant at the designation of Alfred Moses as U.S. ambassador in Romania,'' the parliamentarians said in a statement made available to Reuters Thursday. </P>
<P> President Clinton last month nominated Moses, who dealt with former communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu on the emigration of Romania's once large Jewish minority, to succeed career diplomat John Davis. </P>
<P> Moses has told his Senate confirmation hearing he knows the country well, having visited regularly since 1976. </P>
<P> ``The oppression there was obvious,'' he was quoted as saying in a statement issued by the U.S. Embassy in Bucharest. </P>
<P> But in their protest note, sent to right-wing senator Jesse Helms, the Romanian politicians said it was precisely that experience in Romania that made Moses unacceptable. </P>
<P> ``The Romanian people have not yet fully recovered from the physical and psychological ordeals inflicted upon them by the Ceausescu regime,'' said the seven, apparently backed by the the anti-Hungarian Romanian National Unity Party (RNUP). </P>
<P> They accused Moses of playing down the excesses of the Ceausescu administration when he testified before Congressional inquiries in the 1970s and 1980s. Ceausescu was ousted and shot in a bloody 1989 revolution. </P>
<P> ``Mr. Moses is not welcome as ambassador in Romania,'' they said. ``His accreditation would jeopardize good bilateral relations and fuel extremism in this volatile area of Europe.'' </P>
<P> Romanian-U.S. ties have been on the rebound with the resumption of most-favored-nation trading privileges in 1993. </P>
