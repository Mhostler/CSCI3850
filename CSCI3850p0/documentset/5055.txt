<P>  The United States has submitted the names of several women for the top post of UNICEF, the U.N. Children's Fund, in an effort to frustrate a European campaign for the prestigious post. </P>
<P> UNICEF has been headed by an American since it was founded in 1946 and until several months ago Washington was confident its candidate, Dr William Foege, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, would get the job.  The new names include Carol Bellamy, director of the Peace Corps and former New York City Council president, sources at the United Nations told Reuters. </P>
<P> Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali is known to want to choose a woman for executive director of UNICEF, following heavy criticism this month that women occupy only 15 percent of the upper management posts. </P>
<P> James Rubin, the chief spokesman for U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright told reporters Monday: ``Because of America's financial and and political commitment, the job should go to an American and we decided that the best way to assure that outcome was to submit additional names.'' </P>
<P> But the 15-member European Union, saying it contributed collectively about half of the UNICEF budget, has lobbied Boutros-Ghali to choose a European for the job. </P>
<P> The executive directorship of UNICEF became available earlier this year with the death of James Grant, the legendary American director who died of cancer. </P>
<P> The EU has proposed three candidates, two of them women, in an ongoing behind-the-scenes battle with Washington.  But to make their case stronger they attempted to unite behind one candidate, but were unable to do so entirely. </P>
<P> Consequently, France's ambassador, Jean-Bernard Merimee, whose country currently holds the EU presidency, was expected to tell Boutros-Ghali that some 13 member states support Elizabeth Rehn of Finland, diplomats said. </P>
<P> Rehn, a former Finnish defense minister, was narrowly defeated for president of her country last year. </P>
<P> Britain, however, is backing Richard Jolly, currently the acting director of UNICEF. Belgium is supporting Anne-Marie Lizin, a member of the Belgian and European parliaments and vice-president of the Socialist International. </P>
<P> The agency, which provides basic health, nuturition, sanitation and education to the world's children, has an income of $1 billion and a staff of 7,500 in 131 countries. </P>
<P> UNICEF currently is coping with a fraud scandal in its Kenya office, the worst in its history. Three employees were fired while 14 other were suspended, pending the conclusion of an investigation. </P>
