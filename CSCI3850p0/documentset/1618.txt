<P>  Singapore's air pollution index was the worst on record Tuesday as thick smoke from forest fires raging in Indonesia continued to blanket the island and surrounding areas. </P>
<P> The pollution standard index (PSI) rose to 142 by Tuesday afternoon from 110 Monday, a spokesman for the environment ministry said. </P>
<P> ``It's the highest PSI recorded so far,'' he told Reuters. Singapore began using the index in 1991. </P>
<P> Readings between 101-199 are considered unhealthy but most people can continue normal activities. The spokesman said soot and ash pose the biggest problem. </P>
<P> Indonesia says the fires may have been started deliberately for political reasons as logging concession-holders, farmers, tribespeople and new migrants to far-flung areas compete for land. </P>
<P> The haze has covered this tiny island and much of peninsular Malaysia for a month as forest fires blaze on Indonesia's Sumatra and Kalimantan. </P>
<P> Raging fires, fanned by tinder-dry land and coal and peat deposits, have destroyed vast tracts of forest, oil palm and rubber and have hampered airline flights on Kalimantan, Indonesia's half of Borneo island. </P>
<P> Forests the size of the Netherlands were destroyed in a major fire on Kalimantan in the early 1980s. </P>
