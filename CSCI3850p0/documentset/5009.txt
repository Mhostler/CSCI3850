<P>  The chief of a military observer mission supervising a peace accord signed by Peru and Ecuador will arrive in Peru Sunday to coordinate the mission's tasks, an official statement said Saturday. </P>
<P> Lieutenant General Candido Vargas de Freire of Brazil was to go to the northern city of Piura and then to Bagua to coordinate the mission for a week to 10 days after having spent a week in Peru, the statement from the 40-member mission said. </P>
<P> He was to be accompanied by Ambassador Julio Cesar Gomes do Santos, representing Brazilian President Fernando Cardoso. </P>
<P> The mission comprises 40 military officials from Argentina, Brazil, Chile and the United States -- the four guarantors of the 1942 Rio de Janeiro Protocol which defined the borders between the two countries. </P>
<P> The 40 observers will be stationed in both countries. They will supervise the cease-fire, the separation of forces and the eventual demilitarization of the conflict zone. </P>
<P> The statement, sent through Peru's Foreign Ministry, added that no incidents had been reported in a disputed border area in the Cordillera del Condor since Thursday. </P>
<P> ``Information available from the bases of Coangos (in Ecuador) and PV1 (in Peru) in the last two days indicate no incidents have been registered between the belligerent forces,'' the statement said. </P>
<P> Aside from a skirmish in the disputed area last week in which a Peruvian died and another was wounded, officials of the four mediating countries said there had been no clashes since Peru and Ecuador ratified a cease-fire accord Feb. 28. </P>
<P> Peru and Ecuador had fought for a month in a disputed border zone in rugged jungle terrain in the Cordillera del Condor. At least 75 Peruvians and Ecuadorans died in the fighting. </P>
