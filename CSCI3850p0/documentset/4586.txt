<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Egyptian authorities have hanged two Muslim militants sentenced to death for killing a German tourist and two Egyptians in the Red Sea resort of Hurghada, security sources said Monday. </P>
<P> The two men, Mohamed Atallah Omar and Rabie Mohamed Mahmoud, were hanged last week at a Cairo prison and the bodies were buried under tight security Friday in their village in the southern province of Qena, they said. </P>
<P> The government broke with normal practice and did not announce the hanging because the sentence, issued by a military court last December, was carried out during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. According to Islamic teachings, Ramadan should be a month of peace devoted to fasting and prayers. </P>
<P> The two militants were convicted of killing the tourist in Hurghada last October as part of the campaign by the Gama'a al-Islamiya (Islamic Group) to deprive the Egyptian government of tourism income and to draw world attention. </P>
<P> In an attempt to deter militants, President Hosni Mubarak started referring cases of violence to military courts in late 1992. Local and international human rights groups have criticized the courts as falling short of the standards for a fair trial. Defendants have no right to appeal and proceedings do not usually take more than one month. </P>
<P> The military courts have sentenced 62 people to death since December 1992. Forty-five people have been executed, two are on death row and 15 are on the run. </P>
<P> More than 660 people have been killed in violence between Egyptian police and Muslim militants over the past three years, including eight tourists. </P>
