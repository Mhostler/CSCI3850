<P>  South Korea said Wednesday it was withdrawing its diplomats from Algeria because of the murder last month of a South Korean businessman and fears of a worsening political situation in the country. </P>
<P> ``As of today, all three diplomats, including Ambassador Kwon (In-hyuk), and their families are to be withdrawn from Algiers because of the danger of possible terrorist attacks,'' a Seoul Foreign Ministry official told Reuters. </P>
<P> ``The withdrawal is a tentative measure,'' he said. ``Local employees at the embassy will carry out their normal duties and the councilor will stay in Paris to control them.'' </P>
<P> Kang Dae-hyun, a senior local representative of South Korea's Daewoo Group, was gunned down by Muslim fundamentalists near his home outside Algiers on Oct. 12. </P>
<P> Dozens of foreigners have been murdered in Algeria since September last year when they became caught up in the conflict between fundamentalists and military-backed authorities. </P>
