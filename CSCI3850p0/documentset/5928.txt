<DATELINE>SARAJEVO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Bosnian Serb forces lifted a blockade on the departure of a United Nations envoy from Sarajevo Friday but refused to allow U.S. and German diplomats to leave the airport to enter the city. </P>
<P> The Bosnian Serb army, which surrounds Sarajevo, had told American and German envoys from the major powers' Contact Group that they could not leave the airport to drive into the city, Western diplomats in Sarajevo said. </P>
<P> U.N. special envoy Yasushi Akashi delayed his flight to try to persuade Bosnian Serb military officers at the U.N.-operated airport to lift the veiled threat against the American and German representatives. </P>
<P> In New York, the United States ambassador to the U.N., Madeleine Albright, said it was unacceptable that the Serbs had prevented the Western diplomats from entering Sarajevo after landing at the airport earlier aboard a U.N. plane. </P>
<P> Alrbight told reporters she had requested the U.N. secretariat to ask Akashi, who was about to leave the city, to remain with them until the matter had been cleared up. </P>
<P> The diplomats, Robert Frasure of the United States and Michael Steiner of Germany, represent their countries on the five-nation Contact Group trying to broker an end to the conflict in Bosnia. </P>
<P> The incident marked the lastest humiliation suffered by Western powers at the hands of Serb forces besieging the city. </P>
<P> Bosnian Serb liaison officers at the airport Monday denied permission for the U.S. ambassador to Bosnia, Victor Jackovich, to board a U.N. flight out of the city, forcing him to drive out on a mountain road frequently fired at by Serb gunners. </P>
