<P>  The Security Council Friday condemned former Rwandan leaders and armed groups for intimidating Rwandan refugees living in camps in neighboring countries, especially Zaire, and welcomed a recent agreement under which 1,500 Zairean troops will help maintain order. </P>
<P> Up to a million minority Tutsis and Hutu moderates were massacred last year on the orders of Hutu leaders after President Juvenal Habyarimana's plane was shot down in April. </P>
<P> When the Tutsi-led Rwanda Patriotic Front took over the government in July, Hutu leaders, troops and militia fled abroad, including many responsible for the genocide. </P>
<P> They now control some of the camps housing up to two million refugees, mainly Hutus, preventing them from returning home and telling them they would face reprisals if they did. </P>
<P> A long statement read at a Security Council meeting expressed grave concern at reports of ``continuing intimidation and security problems in the camps, particularly in Zaire.'' </P>
<P> The council reaffirmed its ``condemnation of actions of former Rwandese leaders living in the camps, and of former government forces and militias to prevent, in some cases by force, the repatriation of the refugees.'' It also expressed concern at the security threat to relief workers. </P>
<P> The council welcomed a Jan. 27 agreement between Zaire and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) under which some 1,500 Zairean troops are to be deployed in the camps in that country, together with a contingent of UNHCR security advisers. </P>
<P> Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said in a report last month about 5,000 U.N. troops would be needed to keep order in the camps. But only one of 60 countries he had asked to provide soldiers had agreed to do so, and the arrangement with Zaire was the best available alternative, he said. </P>
<P> Rwandan Ambassador Manzi Bakuramutsa, who is a Security Council member, has complained bitterly about what he considers the failure of the United Nations to ensure the safety and repatriation of the refugees. </P>
<P> Council sources said he raised strong objections to the council statement and proposed an alternative text, but was partly placated by the addition of a reference to a recent agreement between Zaire and Rwanda on the return of refugees and property. </P>
<P> The council said moves to provide security in the camps must be accompanied by further efforts in Rwanda to ensure that refugees ``can return to their homes without fear of retribution and persecution.'' </P>
<P> It stressed that ``the presence of refugee camps should only be temporary and that the return of the refugees to their homes in Rwanda remains the ultimate goal.'' </P>
<P> The council also referred to the importance of ensuring that accurate information about the situation in Rwanda is disseminated among the refugees and urged the speedy start of broadcasts by a radio station to be operated by the 5,500-strong U.N. force currently in Rwanda. </P>
<P> The council encouraged the work of an international tribunal set up last year to try those accused of atrocities in Rwanda, and also backed efforts to rebuild Rwanda's judicial system. </P>
