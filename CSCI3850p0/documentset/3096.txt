<P>  A diary kept by a Maldivian woman arrested for allegedly spying on India's space program described a plot to kill Maldivian President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom with a human bomb, a police officer said Friday. </P>
<P> T.V. Madhusoodanan, director-general of police in southern Kerala state, told Reuters the diary belonged to Mariam Rasheeda, who was arrested in mid-October for allegedly buying space secrets with sex and money. </P>
<P> Another Maldivian woman, two Indian rocket scientists and two businessmen have also been arrested in the sex, money and secrets scandal, India's biggest spy case. </P>
<P> Madhusoodanan said the plot described in Rasheeda's diary involved a woman named Seetha in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu. </P>
<P> He said Rasheeda told police Seetha was to strap a bomb to her body and jump before a car carrying the Maldivian leader. </P>
<P> Under interrogation, Rasheeda said she belonged to the National Security Force in the Maldives and was sent to India to inquire into the plot to kill Gayoom, which she said was hatched by presidential rival Illias Ibrahim. </P>
<P> The diary notes, written in the official Maldivian language of Dwivegi, were read to crime branch police by a sixth-grade Maldivian schoolboy, Ibrahim Izhan, who lives in Trivandrum. </P>
<P> ``The notes said that not only our president but also a minister would be assassinated,'' Izhan told Reuters. ``I was frightened on reading it.'' </P>
<P> The boy said a Maldivian minister was to be assassinated on the Maldives' independence day, Nov. 11. </P>
<P> ``Simultaneously Seetha wearing a belt bomb would jump in front of the car carrying President Gayoom the same day,'' the boy said. </P>
<P> Izhan said Rasheeda came to lunch at his parents' house in late October, then departed leaving two bags. ``The last we heard was that she had been arrested,'' he said. </P>
<P> Rasheeda and a second Maldivian woman, Fauzia Hassan, allegedly were intelligence operatives for an unknown foreign country who obtained vital defense secrets from a scientist at the Indian Space Research Organization, Nambi Narayanan. </P>
<P> A magistrate in Trivandrum Wednesday turned Rasheeda over to the Central Bureau of Investigation to be held under the Official Secrets Act. </P>
<P> Defense officials said the secrets pertained to highly confidential flight test data from India's experiments with rocket and satellite launches. </P>
<P> India hopes one day to carve a niche in the profitable satellite launch market. It denies the rocket program is being used to develop long-range missiles. </P>
<P> The ring is also alleged to have leaked secret technology for submarine communication. </P>
