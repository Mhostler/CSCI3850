<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Stars & Stripes scored its second consecutive win Thursday to even up the America's Cup defender finals while Team New Zealand continued its relentless advance in the challenger competition. </P>
<P> Dennis Conner's Stars & Stripes beat America3 (cubed) to vault into equal first place with Kevin Mahaney's Young America and the nearly all-women America3 team at two points each, wiping out the points advantage its two opponents carried into the three-boat, 12-match defender finals. </P>
<P> Young America came into the round with two bonus points, America3 one and Stars & Stripes none. </P>
<P> ``We were on the ropes and now we're better,'' said Tom Whidden, tactician on Stars & Stripes. ``Nothing's changed and we still have to win races.'' </P>
<P> He added: ``Do I think we're the fastest boat out there? No.'' </P>
<P> Luck rather than boat speed gave Conner the jump he needed to control the race when he picked up a wind shift on the first leg and rode it into the lead. </P>
<P> Leslie Egnot, steering America3's boat Mighty Mary, then fell out of touch with her opponent, who went on to lead around every turning mark. </P>
<P> Spinnaker halyard problems on board America3 prevented Egnot's team from flying the spinnaker properly on the final leg and Conner consolidated his winning margin to two minutes, 50 seconds. </P>
<P> While the defender teams are riding a roller-coaster, Peter Blake's Team New Zealand is cruising without a bump or swerve. </P>
<P> Thursday's victory over John Bertrand's One Australia was Team New Zealand's 33rd victory since the trials began in January. It has yet to be beaten on the water. </P>
<P> Now down 2-0 in the challenger finals, One Australia is in the desperate situation of playing catch-up with a team that looks unbeatable. The Australians need to take five of the next seven races to win the challenger berth in the America's Cup. </P>
<P> Bertrand is looking for the recovery he achieved in 1983 when, down 3-1 in the America's Cup itself, he took three straight races to win the Cup from the United States for the first time in its 132-year history. </P>
<P> Both victors, Stars & Stripes and Team New Zealand, stamped their authority on their opponents on the first leg, rounding the first turning mark ahead, controlling the race from the front, and finishing without ever losing the lead. </P>
<P> Stars & Stripes jump ahead came after it was pushed to the left by America3, picked up a fortuitous wind shift and rode it into a healthy lead. </P>
<P> Team New Zealand was simply faster around the track. One Australia gained on just one leg before going down to a one minute, 57 second loss. </P>
<P> Racing continues on Friday with Young America, which came into the defender finals as the favourite, aiming for its first win of the finals against America3. Team New Zealand will be looking to move within two victories of the five it needs to win the challenger finals. </P>
<P> ``We've won two races, still need three,'' said Brad Butterworth, afterguard on Team New Zealand. ``We feel we've got an edge and hopefully we can carry it on.'' </P>
