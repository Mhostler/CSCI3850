<P>  The Palestine Liberation Organization said Monday its Gaza military court sentenced two Hamas militants to three years in jail as accomplices in the killing of a fellow Palestinian suspected of collaborating with Israeli authorities. </P>
<P> It was the first time the PLO court, set up under Israeli and U.S. pressure for a crackdown on radical Islamic groups in self-ruled Gaza, had jailed Hamas activists for involvement in collaborator killings. </P>
<P> Palestinian Prosecutor-General Khaled Al-Qidra said the court, meeting overnight, sentenced Said Abu Khalifa, 40, and Salah Asalia, 24, both residents of Gaza's Jabalya refugee camp, to three years each. </P>
<P> He said they had aided senior Hamas guerrilla Kamal Kheil in the killing of a Palestinian two months ago, burying the body in an effort to hide evidence. </P>
<P> Kheil died in an explosion in a Gaza apartment three weeks ago. The PLO said Kheil, suspected of killing dozens of collaborators, blew himself up accidentally while handling explosives. </P>
<P> Hamas, which said Kheil was killed by Israeli agents, vowed revenge. One week later Islamic guerrillas killed seven Israelis and a U.S. tourist in two suicide bombings near Jewish settlements in Gaza. </P>
<P> The court, set up by PLO leader Yasser Arafat, began working this month after the double attack. It has so far sentenced seven Hamas activists and three Islamic Jihad men to jail terms. </P>
