<P>  The head of the Roman Catholic Church in Austria, Cardinal Hermann Groer, denied Friday that he sexually abused a male pupil 20 years ago. </P>
<P> Groer, 75, resigned Thursday as head of Austria's Bishops' Conference, nearly two weeks after the man made the allegations. </P>
<P> ``The massive and increasing attacks against me have shaken and disturbed many well-meaning and faithful people, causing unrest and doubt even in the Church,'' Groer said in a signed statement published in the Saturday edition of the daily Neue Kronen Zeitung. </P>
<P> ``So I see that I am obliged to reject the content and form of these defamatory and destructive criticisms,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``In this denial, I also include all these sweeping suspicions of priests and others teaching religion as well as the well-attended schools of the Roman Catholic Church.'' </P>
<P> The bishop of Graz-Seckau, Johann Weber, who took over from Groer as chairman of the national Bishops' Conference, said earlier that the cardinal wanted to remain silent over the sexual allegations made against him. </P>
<P> ``The damage to his reputation is irreparable. It is extremely unjust,'' Weber, reading a statement, told a news conference. </P>
<P> Weber said Groer, Archbishop of Vienna, had first accepted re-election as chairman of the conference, which ended on Thursday. He reconsidered and gave up the post. </P>
<P> ``We understand his position. It is surely his right to remain silent,'' said Weber. </P>
<P> Austria's largest lay Roman Catholic lay group, Catholic Action, and leading theologians had urged Groer to break his silence and make a statement on the allegations. </P>
<P> Josef Hartmann, a former pupil at a Roman Catholic school for boys, said in an interview with the news magazine Profil last week that Groer sexually abused him 20 years ago. Groer was then a teacher at the school at Hollabrun, near Vienna. </P>
<P> Hartmann told Profil he had spoken out now because Groer issued a document in February saying those who had sex outside marriage or abused young boys would never enter God's kingdom. </P>
