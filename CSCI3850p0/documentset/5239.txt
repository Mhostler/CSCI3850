<P>  The United States and New Zealand have made ``some progress'' on changing a ban keeping U.S. nuclear ships from its harbors but President Clinton and Prime Minister Jim Bolger did not resolve the dispute in talks Monday, a White House spokesman said. </P>
<P> Relations between the two nations soured in the 1980s when a Labor government under Prime Minister David Lange banned nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed vessels from New Zealand's territorial waters. </P>
<P> Although relations have improved, there has been no public indication of a softening in New Zealand's nuclear position, which continues to generate broad support. </P>
<P> ``They did discuss the anti-nuclear legislation, which remains on the books in New Zealand,'' White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry told reporters. </P>
<P> ``The president indicated that until that issue is resolved it would not be possible for the United States to have the same type of security relationship that we had prior to passage of that legislation,'' he said. </P>
<P> McCurry said, ``There has been some progress in the general discussion of that (nuclear) issue but it certainly remains unfinished business, as the president indicated to the prime minister.'' </P>
<P> He did not elaborate on the type of progress that has been made. Bolger has discussed the nuclear issue with other U.S. officials this year, including Secretary of State Warren Christopher. </P>
<P> Bolger did not talk with reporters following his 45-minute meeting with Clinton, the first visit by a New Zealand prime minister to the White House in 11 years. </P>
<P> McCurry said the two leaders discussed several other issues as well, noting ``they talked a great deal about trade.'' </P>
