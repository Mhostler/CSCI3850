<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A little luck and a favorable ruling on a goal off Petr Nedved's skate pulled the New York Rangers into a three-way tie for sixth place in the Eastern Conference playoff hunt Thursday. </P>
<P> Nedved's disputed goal broke a tie midway through the third period as the Rangers beat the Hartford Whalers 3-2. </P>
<P> ``(Steve) Larmer made a great pass to me from the corner,'' said Nedved. ``As I was sweeping the stick it went off my skate into the net. I felt a little push from behind which forced me into the net. I knew they would count the goal.'' </P>
<P> ``I thought the goal might be disallowed,'' said Hartford goalie Sean Burke. ``It went off his skate. What can you say if they reviewed the play and allowed the goal? We just have to move on and set our sights on Washington on Friday.'' </P>
<P> Officials ruled Nedved was pushed into the crease and did not intentionally use his skate to put the puck in the net. </P>
<P> The Rangers, Whalers and Washington Capitals all have 41 points, leading the Buffalo Sabres by one point in the Eastern Conference playoff scramble. </P>
<P> ``They are one of the teams in the hunt, so this was a big win for us,'' said New York goalie Glenn Healy. </P>
<P> Sergei Zubov, who started the game-winning play with a dump-in that reached Larmer off the boards, tied the game 2-2 on a power play 4:41 into the third. </P>
<P> The Whalers led going into the third after second-period goals by Paul Ranheim and Andrew Cassels. </P>
<P> Alexander Karpovtsev opened the scoring for the defending Stanley Cup champion Rangers, who have won four of their last five games. </P>
<P> Mark Messier, who helped set up two goals, has 13 assists in his last five games. </P>
<P> Burke made 37 saves for Hartford while Healy stopped 25 in his first start since April 9. </P>
<P> In Philadelphia, Mikael Renberg scored with 8:29 left to break a tie as the Flyers clinched their first playoff berth in six seasons with a 2-1 victory over the New York Islanders. </P>
<P> The Flyers, who lead the Atlantic Division by seven points over New Jersey, ended the NHL's longest playoff drought by reaching the post-season for the first time since 1988-89. </P>
<P> ``We've accomplished something, now we want more,'' said Philadelphia star center Eric Lindros. ``I believe we can compete for the Stanley Cup, I really believe that.'' </P>
<P> Kirk Muller gave the Islanders a 1-0 lead with a shorthanded goal in the first period. </P>
<P> Lindros tied the game with a power-play goal, his 25th, 59 seconds into the second period. </P>
<P> At Tampa Bay, Jason Wiemer scored his first NHL goal and Chris Gratton added a pair of assists as the Lightning defeated the Quebec Nordiques 5-2. </P>
<P> The win kept alive Tampa Bay's faint playoff hopes. The Lightning are 11th in the Eastern Conference, tied with Florida with 37 points. </P>
<P> Alexander Selivanov, John Tucker, Brantt Myhres and Wiemer put the Lightning up 4-1 with four straight goals in the first and second periods. Paul Ysebaert added an empty-net goal with one second left. </P>
<P> Peter Forsberg had both Quebec goals. </P>
<P> Quebec dropped its second straight game since losing Owen Nolan, the NHL's leading goal scorer, to a shoulder injury. </P>
<P> At Florida, Mark Fitzpatrick stopped all 17 shots he faced and Jesse Belanger scored the game's only goal with 9:10 remaining as the Panthers kept their flickering playoff hopes alive by beating the New Jersey Devils 1-0. </P>
<P> The Panthers moved within four points of the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. </P>
<P> In Ottawa, Ray Bourque's power-play goal with 4:15 remaining capped a furious Boston comeback as the Bruins scored four unanswered goals to rally for a 6-5 win over the Senators. </P>
<P> It was the third straight win for the Bruins, who found themselves behind 5-2 early in the third period after trailing 4-0 in the second. But Mariusz Czerkawski, Ted Donato and Sandy Moger tallied to tie the game. </P>
<P> The Bruins' game-tying and winning goals came on a major power play as a result of a boarding penalty to Ottawa's Troy Mallette, who cut Cam Neely on the play. </P>
<P> Ottawa's winless streak is 16 games at 0-15-1, including six consecutive defeats. </P>
<P> In Vancouver, Trevor Linden scored twice in the first 32 seconds of the second period to lift the Cancuks into a 2-2 tie with the Calgary Flames. </P>
<P> Robert Reichel and Sandy McCarthy scored in the opening period to stake the Flames to a 2-0 lead. </P>
<P> Calgary, atop the Pacific Division, is 7-2-1 in its last 10 games and maintains an eight-point lead over the second-place Canucks. </P>
