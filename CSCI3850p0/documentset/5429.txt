<P>  Jurors in the O.J. Simpson double murder trial were shown a bloody glove Monday that prosecutors hope will help to convict the football hero in the murders of his ex-wife and her friend. </P>
<P> The glove, found at Simpson's estate, was unveiled by police criminalist Dennis Fung as the trial took a new direction, moving from marital abuse, barking dogs and disappearing luggage to the collection and testing of blood and other physical evidence. </P>
<P> Fung, wearing protective latex gloves, opened a brown paper bag and took out the right-hand glove he said he collected from a narrow walkway behind Simpson's estate. </P>
<P> He described apparent blood drops on the glove at the time as being ``shiny but dry.'' </P>
<P> The glove matched evidence produced earlier in the case by prosecutor Marcia Clark -- a left-hand glove found lying beside the bodies of Simpson's ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman. </P>
<P> It was the first time the jury had seen the glove, which Detective Mark Fuhrman, a key prosecution witness, testified he found on Simpson's property. </P>
<P> The results of DNA tests on blood at the murder scene outside Nicole Simpson's Brentwood townhouse and at Simpson's mansion two miles away are seen as crucial in the case. </P>
<P> Simpson has pleaded not guilty to murdering his ex-wife and Goldman on the night of June 12 last year. There were no eyewitnesses to their stabbing deaths and the murder weapon has never been found. </P>
<P> With the case taking a new direction, fresh players came on stage for both the prosecution and the defense. </P>
<P> The new attorneys, all experts in the complex legal arena of DNA testing, or the ``genetic fingerprinting'' of blood, were presented to the jury. </P>
<P> Prosecutors Rock Harmon and Hank Goldberg took over for the DNA phase of the case. Harmon, who has a reputation as a tough, no-holds-barred lawyer, is a deputy district attorney from Alameda County in northern California. </P>
<P> Goldberg, who will present much of the testimony for the prosecution, is on loan from San Diego County. </P>
<P> For the defense, attorneys Barry Scheck, Peter Neufeld and Robert Blazier were set to attack the prosecution's scientific evidence. </P>
<P> Scheck and Neufeld, both New York lawyers, are seen as the most formidable team in the legal field of DNA testing. Blazier, from Sacramento, Calif., specializes in a particular form of DNA testing called PCR testing. </P>
<P> Legal analysts said the DNA testimony over the next month was likely to be highly technical and mostly boring. </P>
<P> A hint of what was to come was given by Goldberg during an argument over whether the prosecution be allowed to use a display board during Fung's testimony. </P>
<P> Goldberg said the board was ``simply a way of being able to establish something that otherwise would be extremely tedious, boring and time-consuming. </P>
<P> ``This way it is only going to be slightly tedious, boring and time-consuming.'' </P>
<P> Fung, a lead criminalist with the Los Angeles Police Department, said he and a junior criminalist arrived at Simpson's mansion at 7:10 a.m. local time on June 13 to collect blood samples found there. </P>
<P> The defense has said it intends to attack the way in which the samples were collected, saying sloppy work led to the contamination of the blood spots taken from Simpson's driveway and in the foyer of his home. </P>
<P> Fung also testified to collecting blood evidence from Simpson's white Ford Bronco. </P>
<P> Prosecutors claim Simpson, who became a sportscaster and TV pitchman after his dazzling football career, drove the Bronco to his ex-wife's home, committed the murders, and then returned in time to take a limousine to the airport. </P>
<P> Simpson claims he was at home when his ex-wife and Goldman were killed. </P>
