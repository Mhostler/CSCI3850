<P> ``It is a critical vote for U.S. leadership in the world and it is a critical vote for the health of the U.S. economy,'' Gore said, referring to a GATT vote scheduled to be taken in a special session of Congress set to begin in late November. </P>
<P> Gore implicitly rejected a request to President Bill Clinton by Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, who will head the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in the Republican-majority Senate that will convene in January, to delay consideration of GATT until that Congress meets. </P>
<P> ``Delay of the GATT would mean the death of the GATT, pure and simple,'' Gore said. ``Anybody who says 'delay the GATT' is really calling for a death sentence on the biggest tax cut in the history of the world and a death sentence on a measure critical to our economic health here in the United States.'' </P>
<P> Earlier on Wednesday, Bob Dole of Kansas, prospective majority leader in the Republican-led Senate, said he hoped flaws that he sees in GATT could be ``fixed'' and the agreement passed this year, as Clinton wants. But he left open the possibility it will have to be deferred, as Helms and other critics want. </P>
