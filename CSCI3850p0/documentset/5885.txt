<P>  The death toll from the devastating car-bombing of an Oklahoma City federal building was expected to climb higher Thursday but the number of people reported missing in the blast has decreased, an official said. </P>
<P> Oklahoma City Fire Chief Gary Marrs said the official count remained at 36 dead, including 12 children. But he told reporters 700 people had called in to report that they had escaped the building's collapse in a car bombing Wednesday. </P>
<P> Authorities earlier said more than 300 people were unaccounted for after a massive car bomb ripped through the nine-story structure. Without citing new figures, Marrs said the count of those missing in the blast was decreasing as calls poured in. </P>
<P> Unofficial estimates have put the number of people inside the building at the time of the explosion at anywhere from 500 to 900. </P>
<P> Marrs said search crews had spotted more bodies in the rubble that had not yet been added to the official death count. ``The count will rise today,'' he told reporters. </P>
<P> Some unconfirmed reports have put the death toll at more than 100. </P>
