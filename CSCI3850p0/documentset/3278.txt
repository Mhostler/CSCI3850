<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Mexico's Attorney General, Antonio Lozano, named a new prosecutor Friday to investigate the slaying of two key political figures and promised to take the probes ``to their ultimate consequences.'' </P>
<P> Lozano, who took office Dec. 1, appointed Pablo Chapa Bezanilla to take charge of the investigations into the March murder of former presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, and the September slaying of ruling party secretary general Francisco Ruiz Massieu. </P>
<P> The enquiries, Lozano said, would be aimed at ``clearing up to their ultimate consequences these deeds that so shocked Mexico.'' </P>
<P> He also said he would continue investigating the killing of Guadalajara Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas, who was slain in a shoot-out alledgedly between rival drug gangs at the city's airport in May 1993. </P>
<P> Chapa's predecessor, Mario Ruiz Massieu, quit the post in late November saying top ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) officials were trying to block the investigation into the slaying of his brother, Francisco. </P>
<P> The accused PRI officials denied the charges. </P>
<P> New President Ernesto Zedillo broke tradition by naming Lozano, who is not a member of the PRI, to the cabinet post, saying the clearing up of the killings should be one of his top priorities. </P>
<P> Mario Aburto, a 24-year-old mechanic, has been sentenced to 42 years for the murder of Colosio, but many Mexicans believe he did not act alone. </P>
<P> Some 15 people have been jailed for the killing of Ruiz Massieu, but the alleged mastermind of the crime, former PRI deputy Manuel Munoz Rocha is still at large. </P>
