<P>  With a little help from his friends, former Beatle Paul McCartney has treated a privileged audience to a premiere of his new classical piece for piano. </P>
<P> During ``An Evening with Paul McCartney and Friends'' at St James's Palace in London on Thursday, McCartney raised tens of thousands of pounds (dollars) for the Royal College of Music and performed for the first time with singer Elvis Costello. </P>
<P> The 300 guests, including heir to the British throne Prince Charles, heard the young Russian, Anya Alexeyev, play ``A Leaf,'' a solo piece for piano by McCartney who has long yearned to be recognised as a composer of classical music. </P>
<P> ``Everyone was absolutely thrilled,'' said Susan Sturrock, publicity officer of the Royal College of Music. ``It was an interesting piece. People enjoyed it very much.'' </P>
<P> Alexeyev, a 23-year-old graduate of the college,is a long-time McCartney fan but she never expected to be the first to perform his new work. ``I enjoyed it a lot,'' she said by telephone. ``I didn't find it that difficult, although I have never played anything like it before.'' </P>
<P> McCartney shied away from playing the classical piece himself but joined Costello and the Brodsky Quartet in playing old Beatle hits ``Yesterday,'' ``Eleanor Rigby'' and a solo encore of ``Lady Madonna.'' </P>
<P> ``When I was approached to help put together this evening, I was honoured to have been asked to do so but -- perhaps more importantly -- glad to be given the chance to help young aspiring musicians,'' he said in a statement. </P>
<P> With John Lennon, McCartney became one of popular music's most successful composers. Lennon was killed by a crazed fan in New York in 1980. </P>
