<P>  Government and rebel leaders of the former Soviet republic of Tajikistan signed an agreement in Tehran Sunday to stop fighting by November 5, the official Iranian news agency IRNA said. </P>
<P> It said the temporary cease-fire would go into effect after the deployment of a ``U.N. control mechanism'' on the border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan, where the rebel forces and tens of thousands of civilians have taken refuge. </P>
<P> Opposition forces, many of them Muslims with whom Iran has sympathy, lost power to communists after a bloody clan war in 1992. Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States back the government forces, and Russia has 25,000 troops in Tajikistan. </P>
<P> The truce was reached after two rounds of peace talks in Moscow and Tehran in April and June and a further 10 days of negotiations in Tehran this month, with the mediation of U.N. envoy Ramiro Piriz-Ballon and participation of Russia and Iran. </P>
<P> November 6, just one day after the cease-fire must come into effect, Tajikistan is to have presidential elections and a referendum on a new constitution. IRNA said the two sides will have 25 days to swap 92 prisoners. </P>
