<DATELINE>TAICHUNG, Taiwan (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Taiwan's government hit out at illegal public buildings Thursday after 64 died in the island's worst fire, but many people blamed the government. </P>
<P> Flames engulfed a three-story restaurant and karaoke complex in this central Taiwan city Wednesday night, trapping its victims behind sealed windows and metal slats as they tried to get to a single exit. </P>
<P> Bystanders described the building as an ``iron cage'' because of the metal slats that surrounded its upper stories, and firefighters said the dead lay heaped near doorways and windows, having choked on poisonous smoke. </P>
<P> It was the deadliest recorded fire in the history of Taiwan since the island was made the seat of the Republic of China in 1949. Twelve people were injured, four of them critically. </P>
<P> The exact cause of the fire remained unknown. </P>
<P> Premier Lien Chan said the entertainment complex, called ``Weierkang'' or ``Welcome,'' was partially illegal and he vowed that any government unit found to have acted wrongly would be punished. </P>
<P> ``To maintain public safety is the most important link in government policy,'' Lien was quoted by government spokesman Jason Hu as telling a meeting of parliament. </P>
<P> ``But we still have major public safety incidents involving death and injury and that shows that regulations are not being practised,'' Hu quoted Lien as adding. </P>
<P> Lien said he would call an urgent meeting to discuss safety procedures. </P>
<P> ``We should immediately and strictly punish those units if they are found to have done wrong,'' he added. </P>
<P> A senior construction official in Taichung, Tsai Chung-hsiung, said on state television the building's upper stories had been illegally added and did not meet safety standards. </P>
<P> More than 1,321 people have died in 35,764 fires in Taiwan since 1991 but Wednesday's blaze, which raged for more than 90 minutes from around 7.30 p.m. (local), took the heaviest toll on life, police said. </P>
<P> Many of the fires in public places in recent years have swept through crowded entertainment venues, drawing sharp criticism of their safety standards. </P>
<P> Karaoke parlors, or KTVs as they are known, are a popular form of entertainment. Each is made up of a warren of private rooms in which customers sing along to the words of tunes played on television screens. </P>
<P> Many people in Taichung laid the blame squarely at the government's door. </P>
<P> ``The government has no determination. People's lives seem worthless,'' said a man who identified himself only by his surname, Chang. </P>
<P> ``The government will talk about safety procedures for a couple of days and then nothing will happen,'' he added. </P>
<P> A woman who lost her 21-year-old daughter, Yang Yu-ru, in the blaze said the only way she could recognize the young woman's charred corpse was through the necklace she was wearing. </P>
<P> ``Even in my worst dreams I could not imagine this would happen. She was only 21. A life just begun,'' Yang's mother said as she stood outside a morgue in Taichung. </P>
<P> One of 200 onlookers who gathered before the smoldering shell of the once gaily adorned building said he would never trust such structures. </P>
<P> ``I would never eat in a place like that. It's an iron cage,'' said one man. ``I'd prefer to eat at a street-side stall.'' </P>
