<DATELINE>KUTA, Indonesia, April 15 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Top executives from leading Asia-Pacific banks on Saturday urged the region's finance ministers to remove obstacles hindering the flow of capital by streamlining rules governing capital markets. </P>
<P> The three-hour inaugural meeting of the informal APEC Financiers Group on Indonesia's tourist island of Bali, ahead of the APEC finance ministers' meeting on Sunday, also sought greater transparency in capital markets, sources said. </P>
<P> ``One item we have recommended to the finance ministers meeting is the need to streamline rules on financial disclosures which vary from country to country,'' one Asian banker told Reuters. </P>
<P> ``We have also recommended a standard rating system for the 18 member countries of APEC (Asia- Pacific Economic Cooperation),'' he said. ``Such differences are hindering capital flow.'' </P>
<P> Some 40 bankers attended the meeting, including Toyoo Gyohten, chairman of the Bank of Tokyo, Goldman Sachs International vice-chairman Robert Hormats, Pridiyathorn Devakula, president of Thailand's Export-Import Bank, and James Riady of Indonesia's Lippo Group. </P>
<P> At a news conference, Hormats, spokesman for the financiers group, declined to reveal the recommendations to be forwarded to the finance ministers' meeting but said they touched on capital flow and the financing of infrastructure. </P>
<P> Hormats said the meeting also ``broadly touched on the volatility of currencies'' but did not delve into the specifics as it was not on the agenda. </P>
<P> Gyohten said that although the financiers did not specifically discuss the yen-dollar crisis, the delegates agreed to pursue sound economic policies as the basis for the healthy development of the capital markets. </P>
<P> ``We also agreed that all governments concerned pursue fiscal and monetary policies which are more conducive,'' he said. </P>
<P> The currency turmoil and efforts to dampen the soaring yen are expected to dominate the finance ministers meeting, which is scheduled to be opened by Indonesia's President Suharto. </P>
<P> The yen's surge against the U.S. dollar would impact the economies of many Asian countries, including Indonesia, 40 percent of whose UD$87.6 billion foreign debt is denominated in yen. </P>
<P> Japan on Friday cut its discount rate and introduced an economic package aimed at ending the turmoil but the markets have largely shrugged off the move. </P>
<P> ``The package has been anticipated by markets to a large degree,'' Hormats said. ``I think further deregulation of Japan's economy will help to reduce the upward pressure on the yen.'' </P>
<P> ``But this will take time as the Japanese government will need to build a political consensus to do that,'' he said. </P>
<P> Hormat said the United States, in turn, had to reduce its budget deficit and increase its savings rate to help strengthen the dollar. </P>
<P> He said that although the currency situation has stabilised over the last few days, he did not expect the turmoil to be resolved soon. </P>
<P> ``The currency markets are very psychological. Once negative psychology develops against a currency, intervention doesn't seem to help very much,'' he said. </P>
