<DATELINE>TUNIS, Tunisia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Algerian troops have now killed nearly 800 Muslim rebels after an ambush and week-long battle in the rugged Ain Defla, southwest of Algiers, the Algerian evening newspaper Le Soir D'Algerie said Monday. </P>
<P> The latest death toll given by the newspaper appeared to indicate either that around 200 rebels had been killed in mopping up operations over the weekend, or more bodies had been found from the original ambush and subsequent battle. </P>
<P> Sunday, the paper said troops, personally led by Gen. Said Bey, commander of the region around the capital Algiers, had killed at least 600 Muslim rebels and were still hunting survivors from about 900 guerrillas. </P>
<P> The guerrillas were trapped after a tip-off to the army as they converged in the region for a congress of the country's feared Armed Islamic Group (GIA). </P>
<P> There was no independent confirmation of the report, which came as Algerian President Liamine Zeroual Monday resumed talks with political figures about elections later this year. </P>
<P> Also Monday, suspected Muslim rebels shot and killed the director general of Algeria's leading government-controlled newspaper El Moudjahid in the capital Algiers, the official Algerian news agency APS reported. </P>
<P> Algerian security officials, in a statement carried by APS, named the victim as Mohamed Abderrahmani. </P>
<P> Gunmen shot him at a crossroads in the Ruisseau area at the foot of the Muslim fundamentalist stronghold of Kouba in southern Algiers as he was heading to the paper's headquarters in the city center, the statement added. </P>
<P> His murder brought to at least 34 the number of journalists and media executives killed in Algeria since June 1993 when Muslim guerrillas turned their guns on newsmen, accusing many of supporting the army-backed government. </P>
<P> Last Tuesday suspected militants killed Boukerbache Ali, a former journalist with the government newspaper El Djoumhoria who had set up his own private television production company. A day earlier a woman state television journalist was shot and seriously wounded and her sister was killed. </P>
<P> Up to 40,000 people have been killed in Algeria since Muslim militants took up arms against the military-backed government after it cancelled elections in January 1992 which the fundamentalist party was poised to win. </P>
