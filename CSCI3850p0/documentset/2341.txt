<P>  The flamboyant head of Russia's MMM investment firm stunned his supporters Tuesday by telling them their shares were temporarily invalid in a move that seemed certain to shatter his reputation as a people's hero. </P>
<P> About 3,000 shareholders, many of whom had taken to the streets to support Sergei Mavrodi during criminal proceedings, had massed at MMM's main Moscow offices following his triumph in parliamentary elections Monday. </P>
<P> But the mood of expectation and elation swung abruptly to fury and bitterness as the crowd heard a statement from Mavrodi in which he said the validity of old shares would be suspended from Nov. 1 to Jan. 1. </P>
<P> People exploded with anger, hissing and whistling in derision and throwing MMM share documents into the air like confetti after the announcement which left them with no hope of trading in their securities. </P>
<P> Some tossed bottles at the entrance of the heavily guarded building in southern Moscow. </P>
<P> ``From today, Mavrodi has lost confidence. He should have accepted old shares back at the nominal value but not abolish them,'' said metalworker Ivan Ivanov. </P>
<P> Mavrodi, 39, despite being under investigation on tax evasion charges, had become a cult figure among MMM shareholders by successfully portraying himself as the little man pitted against a bureaucratic state. </P>
<P> Thousands of people from all walks of life had staged street demonstrations and marches in his defense while he was in jail. </P>
<P> But his announcement Tuesday seemed to have exploded his reputation as a martyr to the cause of free enterprise in the new Russia. </P>
<P> ``Many people have mortgaged their cars and their apartments to buy these shares and now these thieves have stolen all our money,'' said 70-year-old Olga Vladimirova. </P>
<P> MMM promised dividends of 3,000 percent a year, and millions of individuals made fortunes before the bubble burst and payments stopped. </P>
<P> Critics said MMM was a classic pyramid scheme, using income from new investors to buy back shares from old investors at ever-rising prices. The game ended when investors stopped buying new shares and cash supplies dried up to buy old shares back. </P>
