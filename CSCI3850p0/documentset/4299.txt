<DATELINE>LA JOLLA, Calif.(Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  With scarcely a pause to savor last week's win at Pebble Beach, Peter Jacobsen shot a four-under-par 68 at Torrey Pines Saturday to take a three stroke lead into the final round of the $1.2 million Buick Invitational golf tournament. </P>
<P> Jacobsen stood at 15-under-par 201, three strokes better than Hal Sutton, who also shot 68, and Kirk Triplett, who moved into contention with a 66 that tied the day's low round. </P>
<P> ``Obviously there is a big emotional carry over from last week, which helps,'' said Jacobsen. ``Many guys before me have won twice in a row, so it's been done.'' </P>
<P> Jacobsen grabbed the lead for the first time at Torrey Pines when a birdie on the sixth hole brought him to 12 under par. But a three-putt bogey on eight dropped him back into a seven-way tie for the lead. </P>
<P> Others briefly sat atop the leaderboard over the next few holes on the windswept course before Jacobsen regained the lead permanently when he chipped in from 35 feet for eagle at the par-five 13th. </P>
<P> Birdies on 14 and 16 took him to 15-under and a three-stroke margin. </P>
<P> ``The wind was a problem, and the pin positions were unbelievably tough,'' said Jacobsen, who picked up his fifth career win last week to end a five-year title drought. </P>
<P> ``My lead is not safe. A lot of guys will be pulling out the stops and gunning for me, just like I did last week at Pebble when I was three behind on Sunday.''  Last week's victory put Jacobsen at the top of the PGA Tour money list with $254,961. He could nearly double that by picking up the $216,000 winner's check on Sunday. </P>
<P> ``The fun part about it is that I'll be looking forward to hearing that alarm clock ring tomorrow,'' Jacobsen said. </P>
<P> ``I'll be excited to get here. I'll be excited to put my tee in the ground, excited when it's my turn to hit.'' </P>
