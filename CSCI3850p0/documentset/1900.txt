<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Alberto Fujimori Sunday chose a businessman and an academic as his vice-presidential running mates a day after announcing he would seek a second term next April, a presidential spokesman said. </P>
<P> Ricardo Marquez, a 47-year-old textile manufacturer and current president of the National Industrial Society, will be the candidate for first vice-president, the spokesman said. </P>
<P> For the post of second vice-president, Fujimori chose 52-year-old Cesar Paredes Canto, who heads the National Assembly of University Deans. It was from that same post that Fujimori launched his successful candidacy for president in 1990. </P>
<P> Fujimori went to a poor Lima shantytown Saturday night to announce he would again seek Peru's presidency, saying he needed another five-year term to complete a process of ``national reconstruction'' begun in 1990. </P>
<P> Fujimori's selection of his vice-presidential candidates came as something of a surprise in political circles, where there was much speculation he would instead designate two cabinet ministers. </P>
<P> Four ministers resigned from their posts Friday. </P>
<P> Nevertheless, Fujimori has been close to the business sector and Paredes Canto, currently dean of the University of Cajamarca in northern Peru, was seen as offering a good balance to represent Peru's provinces. </P>
<P> Fujimori, who had said he would register his candidacy Sunday, told reporters late in the day that he now planned to go to the National Electoral Board early Monday. </P>
<P> About a dozen other candidates, including former United Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, have declared their candidacies for Peru's highest office. </P>
<P> Fujimori may also face the highly unusual situation of running against his own wife, Susana Higuchi, in the presidential race if she makes good on her pledge to register her candidacy Tuesday. </P>
<P> The 56-year-old son of Japanese immigrants, Fujimori rose from obscurity to beat renowned novelist Mario Vargas Llosa in the 1990 elections. More than four years into his five-year term, he enjoys a popularity rating of about 65 percent. </P>
