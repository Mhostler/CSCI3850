<P>  Rwanda's government will name 200 officials and army officers of the former regime who it says planned a campaign of genocide which killed one million people, Prime Minister Faustin Twagiramungu said Thursday. </P>
<P> Twagiramungu told Reuters his government would also grant amnesty to ordinary Hutus who took part in the killings between April and July last year following the assassination of Hutu military strongman Juvenal Habyarimana. </P>
<P> ``Are we really going to give an amnesty to some people? Yes,'' he said. </P>
<P> The amnesty would be considered once the government had published a list of 200 former politicians, administrators and army officers it had firm evidence had helped ``plan, instigate and enforce the killings,'' he said. </P>
<P> Twagiramungu's government took power in July when rebels of the Tutsi-dominated Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) ousted the remnants of Habyarimana's regime. </P>
<P> Most of the victims of the genocide were Tutsi and hundreds of thousands of Hutus fled into neighboring Zaire, Burundi and Tanzania after the rebel victory, fearing they would be killed in revenge. </P>
<P> Twagiramungu said publication of the list would reassure the refugees, who have spurned government appeals to return home, that the government does not consider all of them criminals. </P>
<P> ``How can you say who will be pardoned until we know who is guilty? In the first place we have to name them, tell the world we will try X,Y and Z. We cannot try all the rest,'' he added. </P>
<P> But the prime minister, a moderate Hutu who narrowly escaped being killed and lost many relatives in the slaughter, said the refugees must show remorse for the tragedy. </P>
<P> Tuesday, four legal officers arrived in Kigali to set up a United Nations tribunal to bring the perpetrators of the killings to justice. </P>
<P> A U.N. plan to send 5,000 peacekeepers to police camps in Zaire was dropped because member states would not contribute troops, U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said Wednesday. Those camps hold about 1.2 million refugees. </P>
<P> U.N. refugee officials are examining options for a police force, including a possible force of about 2,000 Zairean troops under U.N. control but no decisions have been made. </P>
