<P>  Former President Daniel Ortega called on Nicaraguans Monday to take to the streets in support of a strike protesting government austerity measures and credit policy. </P>
<P> Transport workers and agricultural producers, with backing from Ortega's leftist Sandinista Front, have called for a nationwide strike, but police have so far reported virtually no sign of abnormal activity. </P>
<P> ``We're making a call for mobilization,'' Ortega said in a news conference broadcast on Nicaragua's top-rated radio station. ``And the struggle takes place in the streets, not just with words.'' </P>
<P> Past calls by Ortega have led to large demonstrations, but there was no immediate reaction Monday. </P>
<P> Ortega urged Sandinistas and their sympathizers to direct protests against the government tax policies of President Violeta Chamorro, who defeated Ortega in a 1990 election, and Managua Mayor Aleman, the Sandinistas' arch rival. </P>
<P> Strike leaders are calling for peaceful demonstrations in opposition to government austerity measures that have resulted in rising costs for energy and water. They also oppose tight credit policy at state-owned banks, saying it stifles production and increases unemployment, estimated at 60 percent. </P>
<P> Police chief Fernando Caldera said before Ortega's radio appeal that the country ``is totally calm.'' </P>
<P> He said a blast had damaged a window at a church in the northwestern city of Leon early Monday, but he was unsure whether it was related to the strike. </P>
