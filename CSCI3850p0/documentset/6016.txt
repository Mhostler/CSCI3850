<DATELINE>CAIRO, April 25 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  PLO and Israeli negotiators arrived in Cairo on Tuesday for the 15th round of talks on Palestinian elections, which are nine months behind schedule. </P>
<P> Saeb Erekat, head of the Palestinian delegation, told reporters the teams would focus on the participation of Jerusalem residents in the polls. </P>
<P> He said this round of talks was important because it was the last before a meeting in Cairo on May 7 between Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and Nabil Shaath, who is in charge of planning in the Palestinian self-rule Authority. </P>
<P> Peres and Shaath will discuss the stalled expansion of self-rule in the West Bank. </P>
<P> The Israeli delegation to the election talks was headed by Yoel Singer. </P>
<P> The last round of talks two weeks ago was marred by suicide bomb attacks by Palestinian radicals opposed to the 1993 PLO-Israeli peace accord. </P>
<P> Palestinian elections and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the West Bank form the second phase of the 1993 accord on Palestinian self-rule. Voting should have taken place last July but has been delayed by disagreements, mainly over who can vote and who can stand for election. </P>
<P> Israel is reluctant to pull out its troops from the West Bank while radical groups continue their attacks against Israelis. Palestinians refuse to hold elections in the presence of Israeli forces. </P>
<P> Israel and the PLO have set a new deadline of July 1 to reach agreement on the expansion of self-rule authority into the West Bank. </P>
