<P>  Former Formula One and IndyCar motor racing champion Nigel Mansell has filed suit against a British investment firm, blaming it for bad advice that led to extensive losses. </P>
<P> Mansell, a former resident of central Florida, filed suit against the banking house Coutts & Co. on Monday contending he lost $600,000 because of its bad investment advice. </P>
<P> A story in Tuesday's St. Petersburg Times reported that the Briton bought about $7.8 million worth of foreign securities and other holdings from Coutts in February 1994 while he was living in Clearwater, Florida. </P>
<P> In the suit, Mansell contends the transactions were improper because Coutts & Co. wasn't registered to sell securities in Florida and the securities themselves weren't licensed for sale in Florida. Because of this, the suit alleges, the sales were technically illegal and Coutts should reimburse him for his loss. </P>
<P> Coutts & Co. has asked the court to dismiss the case, or move it, because it was not properly served. </P>
<P> Mansell, who left IndyCar racing after his second season on the U.S. circuit to resume his Formula One career, moved to the Isle of Man last year, putting his 66-room mansion in Clearwater up for sale for $15 million. </P>
<P> The house is still on the market but at a reduced price. </P>
