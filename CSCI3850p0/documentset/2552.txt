<DATELINE>POTSDAM, Germany (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A German was sentenced to four years in prison Friday for holding an Angolan refugee captive in an apartment for more than two months, sexually molesting him and forcing him to do household chores. </P>
<P> A second accused, a juvenile, was given a two-year suspended sentence. </P>
<P> A third man also on trial for the same offenses hanged himself last week, blaming news media for hounding him to death. </P>
<P> The court in the city of Potsdam ruled that 24-year-old Christian Glowatzki had abused asylum seeker Silva dos Canga under threat of violence while keeping him imprisoned in Glowatzki's apartment from October to December 1992. </P>
<P> Prosecutors had demanded a sentence of five-and-a-half years for Glowatzki and three for co-accused Sylvio Schirrmeister. </P>
<P> Both had denied the charges but admitted during pre-trial investigations that they had often abused foreigners for fun while drunk. </P>
<P> Africans and other foreigners have frequently been victims in waves of racist attacks since Germany's unification in 1990. </P>
