<P>  Buckingham Palace Tuesday laughed off a German royal lookalike's claim to be the illegitimate half-brother of Prince Charles, heir to the British throne. </P>
<P> ``Ears, nose and lips amazingly similar -- has Charles's German half-brother turned up?'' ran Tuesday's front-page headline in Germany's mass-circulation Bild newspaper. </P>
<P> Alongside a picture of the prince was one of Guenther Focke, a 48-year-old television engineer with protruding ears similar to Charles'. He is German but, Bild said, lives in the central English town of Corby. </P>
<P> ``I'm certain Prince Philip is my father. Don't I look like him?'' Focke was quoted as saying in Bild. </P>
<P> ``I don't want money from the royal family, just to meet my father,'' Focke said. </P>
<P> Focke, born a year before Prince Philip married Princess Elizabeth, now Britain's queen, claimed to have established he was the son of Greek-born Philip but gave no proof. </P>
<P> Royal aides poured cold water on the story. </P>
<P> ``This is just total gossip. We know nothing about this man whatsoever,'' said a spokeswoman for Buckingham Palace. </P>
<P> According to Focke, his late mother never revealed the identity of his father. She told Focke only that his father was a sailor and cosmopolitan blue-blood whom she had met in the German port of Bremerhaven. </P>
<P> It was Focke's aunt Auguste who spotted a similarity between Focke -- born July 12, 1946 -- and a newspaper photograph of a younger Prince Philip. </P>
<P> Philip, a naval officer, was second in command of the destroyer Whelp and was present for the final Japanese surrender in the Bay of Tokyo on September 2, 1945. Records of where he spend the next couple of months are sketchy. </P>
