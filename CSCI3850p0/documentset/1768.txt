<DATELINE>INNSBRUCK, Austria (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A woman with binoculars looked helplessly on as her 60-year-old husband plunged to his death over a cliff in the Austrian Tyrol Sunday. </P>
<P> Elmar Koell, a native Tyrolean, was hunting on a mountain when he tripped and fell. His wife rushed to administer first aid but he was dead by the time a rescue helicopter arrived, the Austrian news agency APA reported. </P>
<P> Koell was one of four climbers killed over the weekend in Tyrol. Two Germans roped together plunged 1,000 feet to the rocks below, and in a separate incident a man from Munich lost his balance on a cliff-edge in the Kaiser range, falling fatally as his son and two friends watched. </P>
