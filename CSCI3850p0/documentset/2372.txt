<DATELINE>ASSIUT, Egypt (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  More than 410 people were killed in southern Egypt Wednesday, most of them when blazing fuel flooded into a village from a depot struck by lightning in a rainstorm, officials in the southern town of Assiut said. </P>
<P> A health official said hospitals in the area had received 229 corpses from the stricken village of Dronka and a security source said another 122 corpses were on the ground there. </P>
<P> Flash floods triggered by the storm killed 63 other people in Assiut and neighboring provinces, security sources said. </P>
<P> Lightning struck the depot's eight fuel tanks Wednesday morning toward the end of the storm that raged across much of Egypt for up to five hours. </P>
<P> Officials said three of the storage tanks holding aircraft or diesel fuel for the army exploded and spilled burning fuel into the village, 200 miles south of Cairo. </P>
<P> More than 200 houses in Dronka were destroyed and at least 20,000 villagers fled toward the provincial capital Assiut city, five miles east. </P>
<P> Those who escaped the inferno said many families were trapped in their homes and that dozens of people were missing. </P>
<P> ``It was like napalm,'' said one man named Abdel Mohsen. </P>
<P> Three of his brothers, aged six, eight and 11, were killed when burning fuel burst into their home, he said. They had been getting ready to go to school. </P>
<P> A woman with burns on her face and her hands said her two young children died in the fire. </P>
<P> The health official said rescue workers had not reached some of the damaged buildings, including two five-story structures from which there are no known survivors. </P>
<P> One of the fuel tanks was still ablaze late Wednesday and five others threatened to catch fire if the wind changed, officials said. The tanks, part of a defense ministry strategic reserve, stand about 65 yards apart. </P>
<P> Thick black smoke covered the area on Wednesday evening but firefighters decided to let the fire burn itself out, the security sources said. </P>
<P> People who escaped the inferno said many families were trapped in their homes and that dozens of people were missing, including at least 10 men caught in a mosque during dawn prayers and a maintenance crew working at the tank farm. </P>
<P> In Cairo the interior ministry gave an initial estimate of 30 people killed and 20 injured in the fire. </P>
<P> It said floods in the Assiut area had killed another 28 people. Security sources in the south said flash floods in the provinces of Assiut, Sohag and Qena had killed 63 people. </P>
<P> The governor of Assiut declared a state of emergency and sent rescue units with tents and blankets for the homeless. He said it was too early to say how many people had been killed. </P>
<P> On Wednesday evening there were fresh reports of flash floods in the villages of Bosra, Rifa and al-Zawiya, all in the Assiut area. Many roads are now impassable. </P>
<P> In al-Zawiya the flood waters had reached the second floor of buildings and five acres of land has mysteriously subsided by about 6 feet. </P>
<P> The rain itself stopped in the morning but it is still running off the hills to the east and west of the Nile valley. </P>
<P> The fuel tanks at Dronka are operated by a subsidiary of the state-run Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC). </P>
<P> EGPC officials in Cairo declined to comment on the incident. One said a team of experts was traveling to Assiut to assess the damage to the tanks. </P>
<P> The blaze also destroyed fields in the village and a Christian cemetery. </P>
<P> Meteorologists in Cairo told Reuters the storm was one of the worst in the country's history. </P>
