<P>  China has scrapped a film import quota system and plans to import ``Forrest Gump,'' giving many Chinese moviegoers their first glimpse of an Oscar-winning best picture, film importers said on Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``There will be no more film import quota in the future,'' Qiu Cuiding, head of the America department of the state import monopoly ChinaFilm Export and Import Corp, said in a telephone interview. </P>
<P> The dismantling of what Hollywood has called the most frustrating barrier to China's entertainment market is in line with a landmark U.S.-China trade accord reached in February. </P>
<P> ``We hope the import of high quality foreign films would boost the standard of domestic movies,'' Qiu said. </P>
<P> The quota of about 60 foreign movies a year was introduced to protect China's state-owned studios, which generally put Communist Party propaganda above artistic merit or entertainment value in the 200 films they make each year. </P>
<P> ChinaFilm officials said the number of foreign movies imported was likely to rise, but declined to give a specific annual figure. </P>
<P> Film imports would be determined by the market, they said. </P>
<P> The company has imported 12 foreign movies so far this year, ordered another six and shown four blockbusters. </P>
<P> China is to import 10 hit foreign films a year soon after their general release as part of reforms announced in 1994. </P>
<P> ``We are very interested in Forrest Gump,'' Weng Li, spokesman for ChinaFilm, said. </P>
<P> Gump, the story of a near idiot who thrives amid the tumult of the 1960s, won Oscars last month for best picture, best actor, best director, best adapted screenplay, best visual effects and best editing. </P>
<P> China previously imported movies only years after their release when the price had fallen. </P>
<P> The U.S. blockbuster ``True Lies,'' the fourth of the 10, is to open in theatres in Beijing on Thursday, six days after it began showing in Shanghai. </P>
<P> The showing of the action film, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, was delayed by two months because of the U.S.-China dispute over copyright piracy. </P>
<P> The first film imported under the reforms, ``The Fugitive'' starring Harrison Ford, earned 20 million yuan ($2.3 million). </P>
<P> China Film officials expect ``True Lies'' to be even more successful. Profits from showing of the 10 blockbusters will be shared by the Chinese and foreign contractors, replacing flat-fee import licencing. </P>
<P> China's censors will continue to control the content of foreign films. </P>
<P> ``Movies with sex and too much violence will not be allowed in by censors lest they have a bad influence on our youth,'' ChinaFilm's Weng said. </P>
<P> ``China will keep the examination of foreign films to make sure their contents are in line with the Chinese situation and laws,'' the Xinhua news agency quoted ChinaFilm deputy general manager Wang Zengfu as saying. </P>
<P> Movies will continue to be dubbed into Chinese. </P>
