<P>  Refugee advocates Tuesday planned a ''massive demonstration'' to protest U.S. detention of Haitian children at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, as the military continued to return Haitians to their homeland from the naval base. </P>
<P> Air Force Master Sgt. Tina Sims, spokeswoman at Guantanamo, said 26 children and nine adults were flown to Haiti Tuesday morning, leaving about 409 Haitians at the base. </P>
<P> Most Haitians remaining at Guantanamo -- the last of more than 20,000 brought to the base during an exodus of boat people from Haiti last summer -- are children under the age of 18 held at the base without adult relatives. </P>
<P> The detention and forced repatriation of Haitians, while tens of thousands of Cuban boat people are allowed to enter Florida from the base, has inspired a groundswell of protest. </P>
<P> Almost all Haitians brought to Guantanamo last summer have been repatriated, some willingly and some under protest. Several civil rights and refugee organizations said they would protest the new policy Friday afternoon in front of the Immigration & Naturalization Service building in Miami.  The Clinton administration has defended its differing refugee policies on the grounds that U.S. troops restored democracy and safety to Haiti with the return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide last fall, while Cubans at the base would face forced repatriation to a communist dictatorship. </P>
<P> Washington also announced this month that Cubans picked up at sea will forcibly repatriated, reversing a 30-year policy that allowed them to enter the United States. </P>
