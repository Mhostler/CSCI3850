<DATELINE>KIEV, Ukraine (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Ukrainian Prime Minister Vitaly Masol, a conservative holdover from the Soviet era, resigned Wednesday and was replaced by the former head of the country's security service. </P>
<P> President Leonid Kuchma announced Masol's resignation during a Cabinet meeting, presidential spokesman Mykhailo Doroshenko said. </P>
<P> Masol's resignation had long been expected, as he frequently made statements at odds with Kuchma's reformist policies, but its timing was something of a surprise. </P>
<P> First Deputy Prime Minister Yevhen Marchuk was appointed acting premier pending parliamentary approval of the resignation. Officials said Masol was expected to leave on a long vacation. </P>
<P> ``The president expects that Masol's resignation will reflect positively on the process of reforming the economy,'' spokesman Mykhailo Doroshenko said. ``But there will be no drastic changes in the course of economic reforms.'' </P>
<P> Masol served as prime minister when Ukraine was still a Soviet republic, resigning in 1990 when university students staged mass demonstrations in Kiev to demand his dismissal. </P>
<P> Then-President Leonid Kravchuk reappointed him to the job just over a week before losing to Kuchma in an election. </P>
<P> Marchuk took charge of Ukraine's SBU security service -- successor to the Soviet KGB -- before Ukraine won independence from the Soviet Union and served in the post three years. </P>
<P> Under Kuchma, he was made one of three first deputy prime ministers and headed a special committee on fighting corruption. </P>
<P> Marchuk is expected to be a more palatable choice for the parliament, bitterly divided between conservatives and reformers and often antagonistic toward Kuchma. </P>
