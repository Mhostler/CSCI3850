<P>  One Israeli soldier was killed and one wounded when a guerrilla bomb hit their patrol in southern Lebanon Tuesday, security and pro-Israeli militia sources said. </P>
<P> The violence on the last active Arab-Israeli frontline coincided with Secretary of State Warren Christopher's tour of the region to advance stalled Syrian-Israeli peace talks. </P>
<P> The sources said the blast targeted Isreali soldiers on patrol near their military post at Ras Bayyadah in the western sector of the Jewish state's occupation zone in southern Lebanon. </P>
<P> No group immediately claimed resonsibility for the attack. </P>
<P> The soldier was the first Israeli fatality in Lebanon since Oct. 29, when pro-Iranian Muslim Hizbollah (Party of God) guerrillas killed a soldier in the Israeli-held border ``security zone.'' </P>
<P> Earlier Tuesday guerrillas attacked a post manned by Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army militia on the edge of the zone. No casualties were reported in that assault. </P>
<P> Israeli and militia forces retaliated with artillery fire to the north of the zone near some guerrilla-held villages but no one was hurt, the sources said. </P>
