<DATELINE>SANTA ANA, Calif.(Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The local government agencies that invested in Orange County's now bankrupt investment pool can withdraw up to $1 billion in total to meet their payrolls and cover their bills, a bankruptcy judge ruled Thursday. </P>
<P> U.S. Bankruptcy Judge John Ryan approved the interim guidelines that will let the agencies withdraw up to 30 percent of the money they invested, or enough to meet emergency spending needs. </P>
<P> ``I think this is a fair agreement, not based on fears of what may happen, but on hopes of trying to resolve this satisfactorily,'' Ryan said. The guidelines will be in effect through Jan. 31. </P>
<P> The judge freed up the funds as the County Board of Supervisors gave departments until Jan. 10 to review their budgets and come up with cost-cutting plans. </P>
<P> The county said Thursday it expects cutbacks of government employees and anticipates making modifications to contracts with unionized workers. </P>
<P> The county disclosed two weeks ago that it suffered a loss from bad investments -- now estimated at $2.02 billion -- and filed for bankruptcy to protect what capital it had left from its creditors. </P>
<P> The scandal led to the resignation of county Treasurer Robert Citron. His successor and protege, Matthew Raabe, was also replaced Thursday. </P>
<P> The county named Thomas Daxon, a former Oklahoma auditor who was brought in Dec. 12 as a special consultant to the treasurer's office, as acting Treasurer for four months. </P>
<P> Citron's investment strategy -- which bet interest rates would fall when in fact they rose sharply -- led to the biggest bankruptcy filing ever for a U.S. municipality. </P>
<P> California's Orange County is by far the largest county hit in the growing scandal over shoddy investments with taxpayer funds, and it has moved quickly to try and restructure the fund and make up for the losses. </P>
<P> Tom Hayes, head of the county's financial restructuring team, said Thursday the pool had sold about $3.5 billion worth of securities so far, including $1.2 billion in derivatives. </P>
<P> Meanwhile, criminal investigators were looking for evidence of whether Citron and Raabe were aware of the problems in the fund and to what extent they advised the Board of Supervisors. </P>
