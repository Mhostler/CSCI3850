<P>  Defending champion John Daly renewed his love affair with Atlanta Country Club to take a one-stroke lead after Friday's second round at the $1.3 million BellSouth Atlanta Classic. </P>
<P> ``I know exactly what club I'm going to hit off every tee here and that helps a lot,'' said Daly, who posted eight birdies on his way to a five-under-par 67 in a moderate afternoon breeze. </P>
<P> He posted a 10-under-par 134 halfway total, one stroke better than fellow Americans Michael Bradley (65) and Jim Gallagher (70). </P>
<P> Former British Walker Cup player Stephen Keppler (69) was among a group two strokes behind. </P>
<P> Keppler, 34, a metropolitan Atlanta club pro who has been living in the United States for a decade, needed a birdie at the par-five final hole to tie for the lead, but he stumbled with a bogey after thinning his approach shot over the green. </P>
<P> Daly, the PGA Tour's longest hitter, is famous for his prodigious length, but it was good iron play and assured putting that vaulted him to the lead. </P>
<P> ``I only missed two greens and I'm putting really solid,'' said the 1991 PGA Championship winner. </P>
<P> ``I'm making a lot of 10-footers and that's keeping me in it. It's great to come back here and be leading. It's awesome to be in this situation again. It's been quite a while.'' </P>
<P> Daly has not won since his one-stroke triumph here 12 months ago, his third PGA Tour victory, but he started the tournament in a good frame of mind despite missing the cut at Houston last week. </P>
<P> ``I hit the ball too good in Houston to miss the cut,'' he said. </P>
<P> Only nine strokes separated the 75 players who made the cut at one-under 143. Among the casualties were 12-time PGA Tour winner Corey Pavin, left-hander Phil Mickelson and British Open runner-up Jesper Parnevik of Sweden. </P>
<P> Earlier Friday, 32 players returned to complete the first round following Thursday's long rain delay. Gallagher and Bill Porter were the first-round leaders at seven-under 65. </P>
