<P>  Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, opened an office in Washington Tuesday to the dismay of Britain, which regards the group as associated with a ``terrorist organization''. </P>
<P> It was the first office opened by the organization in the United States. Two Sinn Fein aides laid out brochures and newspapers in the three-room suite in a high-rise building close to Washington's diplomatic quarter. </P>
<P> The office was decorated with pictures of Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams, who is now visiting Washington and has been given permission by President Clinton for the first time to raise funds for his organization in the United States. </P>
<P> British Prime Minister John Major was angered by Clinton's decision to accord Adams a warm welcome, which included an invitation to a White House St Patrick's Day reception Friday. </P>
<P> Sinn Fein can already raise funds in Ireland and Britain but the British object to the group tapping the funding resources of the 40-million-strong Irish diaspora here while Adams has not specifically renounced violence as a means to settling the Northern Ireland dispute. </P>
<P> Speaking to reporters in Jerusalem during a Middle East tour this week, Major said Sinn Fein was ``still directly associated with a fully-formed terrorist organization.'' </P>
<P> U.S. officials, supported by Dublin and many Irish-American politicians, say their accommodation of Adams is helping to foster the ongoing peace process in Northern Ireland. The IRA declared a cease-fire last September after a campaign to end British rule in the province. Pro-British Protestant guerrillas followed suit. </P>
