<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The lesbian half-sister of House Speaker Newt Gingrich will be a grand marshal of San Francisco's Lesbian/Gay Freedom Day Parade in June, the organizers said Thursday. </P>
<P> Parade committee president Robert Allen said Candace Gingrich had confirmed in a telephone call earlier this week that she would accept an invitation to be one of four grand marshals at the June 18 parade. </P>
<P> ``She said she would be honored to do it. It would be fun,'' Allen told Reuters. </P>
<P> He said Candace Gingrich's participation would draw publicity to the parade and would also send a message on behalf of the gay and lesbian community: ``We're here, deal with it.'' </P>
<P> San Francisco's annual Lesbian/Gay Freedom Day Parade is one of the biggest gay events in the country. Allen said he expected some 400,000 people to attend this year's event, the 25th annual San Francisco parade. </P>
<P> Candace Gingrich, 28, has become a celebrity since her famous half-brother became House speaker after the Republican victory in last November's election. The contrast between her life and views and Gingrich's has been the focus of many press reports. </P>
<P> She is a gay, liberal Democrat whereas Gingrich, 51, is a conservative Republican who has called for ``toleration'' of gays but has said he does not believe in either promoting or condemning homosexuality. </P>
<P> Allen said the grand marshals, who are given a prominent place in the parade and have the opportunity to address the crowd, were honorary positions. </P>
<P> ``We try and select people who have made significant achievements for our communities or are really good representatives,'' he said. </P>
<P> Organizers said the other marshals at this year's parade will be Prathiba Parmar, a British independent filmmaker and writer, Drago Renteria, director of San Francisco's deaf gay and lesbian center, and Jose Sarria, described as San Francisco's pioneer drag queen. </P>
<P> Gingrich and his half-sister had a highly publicized reunion in Washington last month when she joined gay activists lobbying Congress for AIDS funds and protection from job bias. </P>
<P> Asked if his half-sister's sexual orientation conflicted with his advocacy of traditional family values, Gingrich replied last month: ``I have a sister who I love. Period.'' </P>
