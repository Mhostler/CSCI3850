<P>  A majority of Japanese fear the crisis over North Korea's suspected nuclear arms program could worsen under new leader Kim Jong-il or that he could even start a war, a survey released Thursday showed. </P>
<P> The daily Yomiuri Shimbun reported that 67 percent of 2,100 eligible voters said they were uneasy with the rise of Kim Jong-il, son and designated heir of President Kim Il-sung, who died on July 8 at the age of 82. </P>
<P> Only 11 percent said they expected Kim Jong-il to improve North Korea's relations with the rest of the world, especially through direct talks with South Korea. </P>
<P> Asked what they thought of North Korea's pending talks with the United States, 50 percent said they saw no hope for them while 34 percent said they expected the talks to at least bear some fruit. </P>
<P> About 46 percent of respondents said Japan should normalize relations with North Korea but there was no need to hurry, while 38 percent said Japan should make an all-out effort. </P>
