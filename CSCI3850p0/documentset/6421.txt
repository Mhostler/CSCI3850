<P>  Argentine President Carlos Menem promised further government spending cuts if he wins re-election May 14, but not in education, health, justice or pensions. </P>
<P> ``Rest assured that we will cut what we can from public spending,'' Menem said, speaking in a late night television interview. He said he still did not know where the cuts would come from, adding that it would not be an easy job to trim more public fat. </P>
<P> ``I don't think there is much left to cut,'' Menem said, warning that Argentina's provincial governments -- many with hefty budget deficits -- would be expected to join in the belt-tightening. </P>
<P> The cuts would come on top of $4 billion in public spending reductions since November, just before the Mexican crisis blew up. </P>
<P> All but two opinion polls so far have shown Menem winning a first-round victory over his nearest rival, Jose Bordon of the center-left Frepaso alliance. </P>
