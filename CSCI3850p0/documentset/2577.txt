<P>  President Clinton reassured the Philippines Sunday of continuing U.S. concern over possible toxic waste at former American bases here. </P>
<P> He declined, however, to commit the United States to any further expenditure until the full extent of the problem had been assessed. </P>
<P> ``We have no reason to believe at this time that there is a big problem that we left untended,'' Clinton told a news conference at the end of a 22-hour visit to this former U.S. colony. </P>
<P> ``But we are concerned. We want Subic Bay to be a vast economic resource course for the Philippines in a way that preserves the environmental heritage of the area,'' he said. </P>
<P> Philippine officials said that in talks with President Fidel Ramos, Clinton had promised full cooperation in studies to assess the waste problem at the former Subic Bay naval base and Clark air base. </P>
<P> Subic and Clark closed in 1992 after the Philippine Senate rejected a new bases treaty and are now being converted into economic development zones. </P>
<P> Ramos told the joint news conference that Clinton had also promised the United States would continue to work for the welfare of another American legacy -- the thousands of children abandoned by their U.S. servicemen fathers. </P>
<P> Ramos said he also appreciated Clinton's help on veterans' benefits for Filipino soldiers who fought under U.S. command during World War Two. </P>
<P> He gave no specifics of Clinton's promise of assistance. </P>
<P> The veterans have campaigned for years for the benefits in recognition of their wartime service. </P>
<P> Clinton then left the Philippines for Indonesia to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Jakarta. </P>
