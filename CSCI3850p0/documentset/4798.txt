<P>  The House Wednesday voted to make it harder for shareholders of companies to file fraud suits because the price of their stock dropped sharply. </P>
<P> The bill, which passed 325-99, is aimed at ``strike'' suits filed on behalf of shareholders who allege that the companies they invested in misrepresented their financial prospects. It would set stricter standards of proof for securities fraud lawsuits, impose a loser-pays rule and establish plaintiff steering committees for class-action suits. </P>
