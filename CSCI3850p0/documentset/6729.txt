<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  About 7.2 million people were eligible to vote -- three times -- Sunday in the first general election since Belgium became a federal state in 1993 with more autonomy for linguistically divided regions. </P>
<P> Voting, compulsory in Belgium, was based on a system of proportional representation. The first results from the poll were expected around noon EDT Sunday. </P>
<P> The voting procedure was more complex than usual this time because, in addition to federal government, voters directly elected regional parliaments. </P>
<P> Electors cast three ballots -- for the Senate, then for the lower house and finally for regional councils in Dutch-speaking Flanders, francophone Wallonia, bilingual Brussels and the German-speaking region. </P>
<P> People in the German-speaking region voted four times as they can elect members to the French and German-speaking councils. </P>
<P> Parliamentarians will be elected to a regional council for a five-year term while the federal Senate and lower house members will serve four years. </P>
<P> The federal lower house, the decision-making chamber, will have 150 members against the previous 212. </P>
<P> The Senate, whose role will be restricted to constitutional matters and arbitrating between the federal institutions, has been slashed to 71 members against the current 184. </P>
<P> The number of federal ministers remains at 15, including the prime minister. </P>
<P> The Flemish Council will have 124 members while the French-speaking council will have 94. The Brussels-Capital Council will have 74 members and the Council of the German-Speaking community 25. </P>
<P> Under the 1993 reforms, more autonomy is granted to the regional councils which now control foreign trade, education, cultural affairs, environmental issues and linguistic policy. </P>
<P> All of the regional councils have the power to pass decrees, ordinances and regulations. </P>
<P> The key dossiers of finance and fiscal affairs, defense, social security, foreign affairs and justice are controlled at a federal level. </P>
<P> If there is no clear victory for the outgoing national government, there could be months of political wrangling before a new one takes over from the current center-left coalition made up of Socialist and Christian Democrat parties from the francophone and Dutch-speaking groups. </P>
<P> The two Christian Democrat parties, CVP and PSC, are usually the largest group in the lower house. Because of this and their pivotal position in the political spectrum, they have provided most prime ministers. The present incumbent is Jean-Luc Dehaene of the Flemish CVP who heads a coalition government. </P>
<P> After the poll, King Albert is likely to appoint a go-between to take soundings among all the parties on forming a coalition. </P>
<P> When that mission is completed, the king names a mediator to form a government. The mediator usually, but not always, becomes the prime minister. </P>
<P> If the two opposition Liberal parties make significant gains, the Liberal VLD leader Guy Verhofstadt may be the first person to be asked to try to form a coalition. But if he does not succeed, Dehaene could re-emerge as prime minister. </P>
<P> Political analysts say a tri-partite coalition -- with Christian-Democrats, Socialists and Liberals -- would make government difficult and seems unlikely. </P>
<P> Analysts expect that if it proves impossible to form a majority with the two traditional political groupings, the Greens or possibly a regional party will be invited in. </P>
