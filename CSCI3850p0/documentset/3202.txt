<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  An Ethiopian court described Wednesday how feudal Emperor Haile Selassie was ``strangled in his bed most cruelly'' by Marxist usurpers nearly two decades ago. </P>
<P> Survivors of Ethiopia's royal family say the trials of ousted dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam and 66 of his military deputies that began Tuesday are laying to rest some of the ghosts of the bloody revolution but that the last act in the story is far from over. </P>
<P> Mengistu remains in exile in Zimbabwe and will be tried in absentia. Many of the accused could face the death penalty if found guilty of killing thousands of people. </P>
<P> ``It has had an enormous emotional effect on our lives,'' said Mulugeta Asrate, the emperor's second cousin who was in court as charges detailing the killings under Mengistu were read out. </P>
<P> His mysterious death has long been recorded in popular legend but has never been described officially. The charges allege the execution was ordered in writing by Mengistu's men. </P>
<P> ``The years have been a nightmare. Through these trials I want to forget that,'' said Mulugeta, who was 21 at the time of the 1974 revolution when his father, Prince Asrate Kassa, was murdered along with 59 imperial ministers and aristocrats. </P>
<P> Until military officers of the junta or ``dergue'' seized power, Ethiopia's ``creeping revolution'' had been peacefully organized by students and trade unions. </P>
<P> The emperor initially went along with reforms that dismantled centuries of feudalism. </P>
<P> On Sept. 12, 1974, the dergue officially declared itself the country's new leadership and Haile Selassie was deposed. </P>
<P> Mulugeta, today a London-based sales consultant, said he remembered watching the frail 82-year-old emperor leaving his Jubilee Palace after being told he must step down by Debella Dinsa, a military officer, who is among the defendants. </P>
<P> ``They said they had to take him away in a Volkswagon. He took it with absolute grace,'' Mulugeta said. </P>
<P> The diminutive monarch, wearing commoners' clothes rather than his regal robes, and not allowed to take along his chihuahua, Lulu, was driven to the Grand Palace which he was never to leave again. </P>
<P> In late November 1974, Mengistu came to dominate the dergue and the 60 imperial ministers and aristocrats held in the champagne cellars of the Grand Palace were taken out and shot. </P>
<P> The Addis Ababa court charged that on Aug. 23 the next year, the dergue signed the order to get rid of the emperor once and for all -- but the murder was committed secretly. </P>
<P> Ethiopians say Ashetu, one of Haile Selassie's page boys, spoke to his master for the last time three days later when army officers ordered the servants to leave. His story, even if highly sentimental, strikes a chord with many Ethiopians. </P>
<P> ``Ashetu said he looked to the east where there was a church, and there were tears in his eyes,'' said Teshome Gabre-Mariam Bokan, the royal family's lawyer and the one-time imperial attorney-general. </P>
<P> Next morning Ashetu found the emperor dead in his bed and the room stinking of ether, Teshome said. Ashetu could be produced among the thousands of witnesses expected to appear in the trials. </P>
<P> A skeleton, almost certainly that of Haile Selassie, was dug up beneath a latrine in the palace grounds in 1992 on guidance from those who say they buried him. </P>
<P> No forensic tests have been carried out to prove positively that it the skeleton was that of the emperor. </P>
<P> The bones were placed in St. Mary's orthodox church, the mausoleum for Haile Sealassie's great uncle Emperor Menelik II - - the warrior king who carved out the borders of modern Ethiopia and founded Addis Ababa late last century. </P>
<P> The remains have stayed in the church because the royal family will not bury them until the emperor is given a state funeral in recognition of his 50-year reign during which he helped bring the nation out of the medieval ages by establishing schools, hospitals and modern communications. </P>
<P> Ethiopia's new government, dominated by former guerrillas who overthrew Mengistu three years ago but who still back the principles of the 1974 revolution, will only allow the burial to be a private event. </P>
