<P>  Rwanda's senior diplomat in Kenya flew home early on Friday after Kenyan authorities told him to leave, embassy officials said. </P>
<P> Kenya's foreign ministry had no immediate comment about the departure of Major Jackson Nziza, the embassy's charge d'affaires. One senior ministry official said diplomatic relations between countries were not discussed in public. </P>
<P> ``He (Nziza) is gone. He left this morning after being asked to do so by the Kenyan government. He is now in Kigali,'' a Rwandan embassy official who declined to be named told Reuters. </P>
<P> Government officials in Kigali said they had learnt Nziza had been expelled but could not give details. </P>
<P> Nziza, a senior member of the Tutsi-dominated Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) which took power last July after driving out the Hutu government of late president Juvenal Habyarimana, came to Kenya two months ago. He replaced Habyarimana's envoy who was fired by the new RPF-approved government. </P>
<P> Senior members of Habyarimana's government and his powerful widow Agathe are either living in exile in Kenya or are regular visitors. Some are wanted in Kigali for their alleged role in last year's genocide of up to one million Tutsis and allied Hutus. </P>
<P> Their presence in Kenya has soured relations with Kigali, diplomats say. </P>
