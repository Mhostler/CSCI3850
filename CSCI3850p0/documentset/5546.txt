<DATELINE>TOKYO, April 7 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The feeble U.S. dollar slipped to a post-World War Two low below 84 yen in mid-afternoon Tokyo trade on Friday, dealers said. </P>
<P> Aggressive dollar selling by U.S. brokerages on the heels of earlier selling by Asian operators undermined the dollar and Japanese banks also chipped in with scattered sales, they said. </P>
<P> The dollar has now fallen some 3.5 percent against the yen this week alone, and is down more than 17 percent this year. </P>
<P> The fresh drop flew in the face of persistent efforts by the Bank of Japan to prop up the greenback by buying dollars. </P>
<P> It also came only hours after Japanese cabinet ministers pledged to take fresh steps to counter the yen's surge against the U.S. currency. </P>
<P> ``The government should strengthen its stance against the currency problem,'' Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura told a news conference following a cabinet meeting on Friday morning. </P>
<P> Takemura said economic ministers had thrashed out the problem of what steps to take against the yen's rise, and Transport Minister Shizuka Kamei said the government could unveil a comprehensive economic package as early as next week. </P>
<P> ``I have repeatedly said Japan should take bold measures to combat the yen's appreciation. I still want monetary and fiscal authorities to make their utmost efforts,'' trade minister Ryutaro Hashimoto told a separate news conference. </P>
<P> Economists said they expected some fiscal steps in the form of additions to an already planned supplementary budget for the business year begun April 1. They still figured the Bank of Japan would, reluctantly, cut its official discount rate, now at a record low of 1.75 percent. </P>
<P> BOJ Governor Yasuo Matsushita, in an unusual nod to those expectations, told a gathering of business executives in Osaka, western Japan, that more Japanese monetary steps might be needed depending on the economy. </P>
