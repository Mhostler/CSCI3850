<P>  Vietnam's Finance Minister Ho Te on Sunday called for financial reform across the communist-run nation but warned that bureaucracy and red tape would hamper the process. </P>
<P> Te said the reforms were needed to tackle economic problems such as balancing the state budget, making state spending more efficient and improving tax policies. </P>
<P> ``Administrative reforms in the field of finance are a matter of great urgency,'' Te wrote in the Sunday edition of the official Vietnam News daily. </P>
<P> ``There will be a lot of obstacles down the road due to bureaucracy, red tape and the absence of qualified staff,'' he added. </P>
<P> Starting this year, Te said, top priority must be given to balancing the state budget, reviewing tax collection policies and revamping the national accounting system. </P>
<P> He said outdated documents and cumbersome procedures added up to unnecessary red tape. </P>
<P> Vietnam embraced market-orientated policies in the late 1980s after the country, one the world's poorest, stagnated under government central planning for more than a decade following the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. </P>
<P> But the government has struggled with implementing reforms and has been criticised by foreign investors for dragging its feet on improving the business climate across the nation, which is home to 72 million people. </P>
<P> Te said a new accounting system would be applied on July 1 to simplify accounting rules and reduce administrative proceedures. </P>
<P> The new system would also guarantee a true reflection of financial activities and allow the correct assessment of business dealings, he added. </P>
<P> He said the Finance Ministry was consolidating by defining the parameters of authority at each bureaucratic level, with circulars issued to help balance government expenditures and revenues. </P>
