<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A lawyer, due to appear in California as a DNA expert for O.J. Simpson, was threatened with jail Monday if he fails to show up in a New York court to defend a client here. </P>
<P> New York State Supreme Court Judge Harold Rothwax and attorney Peter Neufeld shouted and screamed at each other in an argument over a scheduling conflict between the two cases. </P>
<P> Neufeld this week was expected to represent a man accused of killing a New York policeman. </P>
<P> At one point the judge ordered Neufeld, a leading DNA expert, jailed immediately but tempers cooled after lawyer William Kunstler stood up in court and asked both sides to relax. </P>
<P> The Simpson murder trial in Los Angeles clashes with the scheduled start Thursday of the trial of Pedro Gill, a restaurant busboy accused of killing a policeman by tossing a bucket off a New York City rooftop in October 1993, . </P>
<P> Football star Simpson, whose career took him from football star to work as a sportscaster, actor and TV pitchman, has pleaded not guilty to the murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson, 35, and her friend Ronald Goldman, 25. They were stabbed to death outside Nicole Simpson's townhouse on June 12. </P>
<P> Admission of key DNA evidence obtained from blood samples in the case is the subject of a hearing in California Dec.12. </P>
<P> Rothwax holding Neufeld to a Dec. 1 committment in New York warned him, ``If you are not ready and you fail to appear for Gill, I will hold you in contempt and I will put you in jail. You will answer 'ready' on December 1.'' </P>
