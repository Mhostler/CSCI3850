<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Republican senators Tuesday chided President Clinton and others for appearing to link the Oklahoma bombing to hate talk over the airwaves. </P>
<P> In a speech at Des Moines, Iowa, on Monday, Clinton attacked ``loud and angry voices'' that were trying to sow paranoia and hate. </P>
<P> Although he used the word ``airwaves'' he did not identify his target. But radio talk show hosts reacted angrily. </P>
<P> In a Senate speech Tuesday, Oklahoma Republican Don Nickles deplored what he called efforts by ``some politicians and pundits'' to extract ``partisan advantage'' from the bombing tragedy, which killed at least 86. </P>
<P> ``The very idea that someone might be playing politics with this ... is offensive,'' Nickles said. </P>
<P> Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole, asked about Clinton's speech later, told reporters, ``Well, I think it's on the edge, but I haven't made a judgment.'' </P>
<P> He said that at a sensitive time while bodies were still being removed from Oklahoma's City's federal building ``none of us ought to be speaking.'' </P>
<P> Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, who like Dole is seeking the Republican presidential nomination, told reporters that two factors were at work - ``a mindset that you can't hold the criminals that did it responsible, and secondly I think there is the potential that some people see to play politics with this terrible tragedy.'' </P>
<P> He added: ``I think the president was beginning to get on thin ice here.'' </P>
<P> Another presidential contender, Sen Richard Lugar, R-Ind., praised Clinton's leadership but said the president would have to calm his rhetoric or risk undermining bipartisan support for anti-terrorist legislation. </P>
<P> Earlier the Senate voted 97-0 to approve a resolution condemning the bombing. </P>
<P> The resolution commended Clinton's ``rapid actions'' to aid bombing victims and seek the perpetrators, and supported seeking the maximum penalty, including the death penalty, for those responsible. </P>
<P> It also said the Senate ``will expeditiously approve legislation to strengthen the authority and resources of all federal agencies involved in combatting such acts of terrorism.'' </P>
