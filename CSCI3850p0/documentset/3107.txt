<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky., (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A man who killed eight co-workers in 1989 did so not because he was taking the drug Prozac, but because he was mentally ill and had a grudge against his employer, attorneys for Eli Lilly & Co. argued Friday. </P>
<P> ``Prozac had nothing to do with it at all. That was a premeditated, planned and executed murder,'' said Ed Stopher, lead counsel for Lilly, which makes Prozac. </P>
<P> Attorneys for Lilly made closing arguments Friday after 11 weeks of testimony in a lawsuit brought against the drug giant, Joseph Wesbecker and his employer, Shea Communications Inc. of Atlanta, over a Sept. 14, 1989, massacre at a Shea printing plant in Louisville. Wesbecker, a disabled pressman, opened fire on his co-workers, killing eight. </P>
<P> Twelve survivors of the massacre and the families of the eight victims filed suit in Jefferson Circuit Court seeking $50 million in damages, punitive damages and unspecified compensatory damages. The trial began Sept. 26. </P>
<P> Attorneys for the plaintiffs were to make their closing statements later Friday. </P>
<P> The plaintiffs argued that Prozac -- Lilly's wildly profitable, and controversial, anti-depressant -- caused Wesbecker, 47, to explode and shoot 20 co-workers before killing himself. </P>
<P> ``This product is defective and unreasonabley dangerous because Lilly failed to provide adequate warnings concering the drug,'' said the plaintif's lead counsel, Paul Smith. </P>
<P> Prozac, first marketed in the United States in 1988, is the world's best-selling anti-depressant. The drug increases levels of the brian chemical serotonin, which regulates mood and increases brain function. Low levels of serotonin are found in patients who are depressed, suicidal or aggressive. </P>
<P> Smith argued in court that there was no way to know for sure the effect of Prozac on serotonin levels. </P>
<P> He said Prozac is an unsafe and dangerous drug that can cause violent and homicidal behavior and that statistically the drug causes more hostility and intentional injury than comparable drugs. </P>
<P> ``This is black and white,'' Smith said. ``The drug is causing people to commit hostile acts and intentionally injure others.'' </P>
<P> ``These people's lives would never have been ruined if it had not been for the Prozac,'' Smith emplored. ``Prozac caused these people's tragedies.'' </P>
<P> But Lilly's attorneys noted that 15,000 people had participated in tests of the drug, and said it was safe. </P>
<P> ``Was Prozac a substantial cause in the shooting? This is a safe, effective medicine that has helped millions of people who have a terrible disease,'' said John McGoldrick, another Lilly attorney, during Friday's statement. </P>
<P> Dr. Lee Coleman, a psychiatrist, testified that he prescribed Prozac to be taken by Wesbecker about a month before the shooting. Three days before the bloody onslaught, Coleman said he halted treatment, describing his patient as angry, agitated and his condition as deteriorating. </P>
<P> In his notes on that session, Coleman wrote ``Prozac?'' as if to indicate the drug might be behind his patient's mood. </P>
<P> But Stopher argued Friday that Coleman was not aware of much about Wesbecker when he wrote the note. He said the doctor had not been told of statements Wesbecker made to friends, who testified in the case, that Wesbecker had homicidal and suicidal thoughts, bitterness toward his employers and had made threats to kill his supervisors. </P>
<P> Witnesses also had testified that Wesbecker blamed his mental illness on his employer's indifference and began stockpiling weapons and ammunition, telling co-workers of a series of bizarre schemes to destroy the plant and give away his property before he began taking Prozac. </P>
<P> ``Standard Gravure (the plant) refused to recognize that his mental illness was a handicap. Fellow pressmen teased him, and, though warned repetitively, Standard Gravure had no security at the entrance where Joseph Wesbecker gained entrance,'' Stopher said. </P>
<P> The lawsuit is the first of about 160 lawsuits filed against the drug manufacturer for alleged harm caused by Prozac to reach litigation in a court of law. </P>
<P> Ninety-two other civil cases have been dismissed. </P>
