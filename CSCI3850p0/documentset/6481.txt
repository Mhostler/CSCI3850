<P>  Kremlin forces pounded rebel positions in southern Chechnya with artillery and rockets Thursday night, effectively wrecking any chance of extending a cease-fire. </P>
<P> The Russian forces started bombarding the village of Serzhen-Yurt, as well as rebel bases in nearby mountains, at around 9 p.m. (1 p.m. EDT). </P>
<P> Shells and rockets exploded every 20 seconds as the Russian troops concentrated on their targets, igniting fires in Serzhen-Yurt, some 12 miles south of the shattered Chechen capital Grozny. </P>
<P> The strike rate later fell to one explosion every five minutes but the attack did not stop. </P>
<P> Air force planes dropped countless flares over the entire area, lighting up the skies for miles around. </P>
<P> Local residents said helicopter gunships had earlier attacked the village for the second consecutive day. </P>
<P> The future of the largely-ignored cease-fire was in any case in doubt after Moscow's commander in Chechnya said his forces would destroy separatist groups once the truce expired at midnight (4 p.m. EDT Thursday). </P>
<P> The shelling is also a blow to President Clinton, whose administration late Thursday renewed an appeal for the truce to be extended indefinitely. </P>
<P> A Kremlin source had earlier told Interfax news agency that President Boris Yeltsin was considering whether to extend the truce, which he originally declared to placate world leaders who came to Moscow to mark the victory over Nazi Germany. </P>
<P> But Yeltsin aide Viktor Ilyushin later told Itar-Tass news agency the Russian leader had given no instructions on prolonging the two-week cease-fire. </P>
<P> Interfax quoted Lt.-Gen. Mikhail Yegorov, Moscow's military commander for Chechnya, as saying the cease-fire had ``brought no positive results from a military point of view.'' </P>
<P> ``Once it expires at midnight, federal troops...will continue to disarm and destroy illegal armed units,'' he said. </P>
<P> A Russian officer at a roadblock outside the southeastern town of Shali said his men had been ordered to close the road to Vedeno -- 25 miles to the south of Grozny -- where rebel headquarters are now situated. </P>
<P> ``We are all on alert. Come back tomorrow and you may see a war,'' said one soldier at the roadblock. The troops said two of their men had been killed Wednesday by Chechen snipers. </P>
<P> But not all the servicemen were in the mood for battle. </P>
<P> ``We were given the day off yesterday to wash ourselves and to prepare for fighting,'' said one. ``We want to go home. This is not our war. We are here and others are sitting in Moscow.'' </P>
<P> Movladi Udugov, spokesman for the rebel Chechen government, told Reuters eight people had been killed in air and artillery attacks Thursday. The figure could not be confirmed. </P>
<P> Wednesday in Moscow, Clinton urged Yeltsin, who sent troops into Chechnya on December 11 to crush an independence bid, to extend the truce. </P>
<P> But Yeltsin said at a joint post-summit news conference that Russian armed forces were no longer fighting in Chechnya because they had handed the operation over to Interior Ministry troops. </P>
<P> Minutes after he spoke, helicopter gunships made a mockery of his words by blasting Serzhen-Yurt. </P>
