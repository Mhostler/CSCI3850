<P>  More than 100 Somalis formerly employed by the United Nations blocked the runway at Mogadishu's U.N.-controlled airport Thursday, delaying the departure of Pakistani troops from the Somali capital. </P>
<P> Chanting ``UNOSOM (U.N. Operation in Somalia) is a thief'' and ``UNOSOM down,'' demonstrators sat on the runway and beneath the plane due to take off as part of the U.N. troop pullout from Somalia. </P>
<P> They demanded payment for what they said were outstanding annual leave and sick days before they were laid off by UNOSOM. </P>
<P> Pakistani troops backed by eight armored troop carriers and vehicles mounted with machineguns surrounded the demonstrators, some of them women. Some held their U.N. identity cards in the air. </P>
<P> Officers told clan elders among the former U.N. employees they would not negotiate with them until they left the runway. </P>
<P> After delaying the takeoff of the chartered plane loaded with 450 Pakistani troops for more than an hour, the demonstrators dispersed peacefully at the request of elders. </P>
<P> U.N. military spokesman Col. Mohamed Tahir said the incident was a result of misinterpretation of financial rules. </P>
<P> The last civilian staff and U.N. troops have withdrawn to the sea port and the beachside airport in the final days of their two-year failed mission to reconcile Somalia's warlords. </P>
<P> As the pullout gains momentum, the busiest office at the airport is the finance section paying out more than $1 million per day to Somali contractors and staff before the end of the month. </P>
<P> Some 20 international U.N. civilian staff and the 450 Pakistani troops flew out of Mogadishu later Thursday, taking the number of U.N. troops left in Somalia to fewer than 6,500. </P>
<P> UNOSOM spokesman George Bennett said the U.N. telephone switchboard would be pulled out by Feb. 21 and a U.S.-led task force to protect the final pullout would seal off the seaport. </P>
<P> Tahir said the Egyptian contingent of 1,200 troops would leave by Feb. 20. The United Nations hopes all its staff and troops will be out by March 6, well ahead of a March 31 deadline. </P>
<P> On Feb. 24 the U.N. commander, Lt.-Gen. Aboo Samah of Malaysia, hands over to U.S. Lt.-Gen. Anthony Zinni, whose combined task force will help extricate the U.N. rearguard of some 2,500 Pakistani and Bangladeshi soldiers. </P>
