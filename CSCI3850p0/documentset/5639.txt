<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Clinton signed Monday a $3 billion defense bill saving the military from deep cutbacks this year, and he commended the Congress for acting quickly on it, the White House said. </P>
<P> The measure included a provision to cut off U.S. loans to Mexico if Congress is not given documents on the loan deal. Administration officials have said the deadline would be met, but the president did not mention it in a statement he issued on the bill. </P>
<P> The bill, passed by the House and Senate last Thursday, will replenish Pentagon accounts drained by U.S. military operations in Haiti, Somalia, South Korea, Kuwait, Cuba and over Bosnia. </P>
<P> ``I commend the Congress for its action on my request to replenish the Department of Defense for funds used to perform contingency operations in the Persian Gulf, Somalia, Rwanda, Haiti and elsewhere,'' Clinton said in the statement. </P>
<P> ``These funds are required to ensure that our forces are provided the resources they need to continue their superb performance,'' he said. </P>
<P> Clinton and the Pentagon had warned that severe training and combat readiness cuts would have to begin right away without the money because some accounts are dry. </P>
<P> The president said he was pleased that several non-military programs were continued by the bill, including funds for dismantling the weapons of mass destruction in the former Soviet Union and helping the Russians remove troops from the Baltic states. </P>
<P> Clinton and Democrats had wanted $275 million included in the bill to write off Jordan's $480 million U.S. debt as a reward for its peace agreement with Israel last year. </P>
<P> But Republican leaders put the Jordan debt relief in a different bill that Congress will not complete for weeks. Clinton said it remained urgent that Congress pass the debt relief: ``I urge the Congress to support this American promise.'' </P>
<P> In a break with past practice, the defense bill takes $2.7 billion of the $3 billion out of other defense and domestic programs and $360 million from payments from Gulf allies for the U.S. buildup in Kuwait last year. </P>
<P> Republican defense leaders called that a warning to Clinton and future presidents not to commit U.S. troops to military operations abroad without Congress's approval. </P>
<P> A provision attached to the bill last week also would cut off remaining U.S. loans to Mexico from a $20 billion deal if Clinton does not give Congress all documents on the deal and how Mexico is using the money to revive its economy. </P>
<P> The White House and Treasury Department assured Congress the deadline would be met but Secretary Robert Rubin criticized Congress for adding the measure. </P>
