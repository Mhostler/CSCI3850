<P>  Congress will pass a crime bill before the start of its summer recess in August, House of Representatives Speaker Thomas Foley predicted Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``We are going to have a crime bill. We are going to pass it before we leave in August, I hope by the end of the month (July),'' Foley told reporters. </P>
<P> The bill has been stalled in a House-Senate conference committee since last month, mainly over language that would allow appeals of death sentences if racial bias in sentencing can be shown. The conference has only held one formal meeting. </P>
<P> The provision is in the bill passed by the House in April, but is not part of the Senate bill approved last November. </P>
<P> Opponents of the racial bias section say it would effectively abolish the death penalty in most states and have threatened a Senate filibuster if it is in the final bill. </P>
<P> ``If you support the death penalty, you can't support the racial justice act. The two are mutally exclusive,'' Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said in a statement. </P>
<P> Supporters, including black members of Congress, say a greater percentage of blacks and other minorities are sentenced to death than whites for murder, especially if the victim is white. </P>
<P> Foley said members of the conference were trying to modify the racial bias provision in a way that would be acceptable to both sides. </P>
<P> The bill includes the ``three strikes and you're out'' mandatory life sentence for anyone convicted of three violent crimes. It also authorizes funds to hire up to 100,000 local police and build more prisons. </P>
<P> Another issue in dispute is a ban on 19 types of semi-automatic weapons that is part of the Senate bill. The House has passed the ban as a separate bill so the conference will have to decide whether to include it. </P>
<P> President Clinton supports the ban but it is strongly opposed by the National Rifle Association. </P>
