<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A proposed constitional amendment to limit the terms of House and Senate members has split the normally solid Republican House majority, making it unlikely the measure will pass next week. </P>
<P> The House Judiciary Committee has endorsed an amendment that would limit House and Senate members to 12-year terms, but would not bar them from running again after a two-year break. </P>
<P> But many freshmen House Republicans want a six-, eight- or 12-year lifetime limit and some leaders, including Assistant Republican Leader Tom DeLay of Texas, oppose any term limits. </P>
<P> House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who backs a 12-year limit, says he is not upset by the divisions among his party. </P>
<P> ``Well, it is a free country,'' Gingrich told reporters Wednesday. ``Term limits is a relatively new idea. </P>
<P> ``So I am not offended when somebody says on something as profound as term limits that they are troubled,'' he said. </P>
<P> A term limits amendment was one of the 10 points in the Republican ``Contract with America'' being pushed through the House in the first 100 days of this session. The 230 House Republicans have voted as a bloc on almost all bills so far. </P>
<P> Gingrich said he would urge members to support a 12-year limit in the vote expected next week. </P>
<P> An amendment must be passed by a two-thirds majority in both the House and Senate and ratified by 38 states to become part of the Constitution. An amendment for a 12-year limit is also pending in the Senate. </P>
<P> A term limits supporter said Republicans who opposed the measure were violating their promises to the American people. </P>
<P> ``I suppose we are supposed to just forget about the GOP contract when it comes to anything that affects these guys personally -- they seem to have done so,'' Cleta Mitchell of the private Term Limits Legal Institute said in a statement. </P>
<P> Term limits for members of Congress have been approved by 22 states, but the laws are being reviewed by the Supreme Court, which may rule that only Congress can set the terms. </P>
<P> Term limit supporters say it will make members more responsive to the public and prevent a small group of long-term incumbents from controlling Congress. Opponents say voters now have the power to end terms at any election. </P>
<P> Presidents are limited to two four-year terms under an amendment ratified in 1951. </P>
