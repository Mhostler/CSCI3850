<P>  Asian Games organizers Tuesday demanded a curfew on athletes and the confiscation of their passports after about 10 athletes from up to five countries disappeared. </P>
<P> The organizers, who speculated that the athletes left to find illegal jobs, also announced increased patrols around the athletes village and rushed police reinforcements to ports, railway stations and airports. </P>
<P> The demands were made at an emergency meeting between the organizers and heads of the 7,300 athletes from 43 nations attending the games. </P>
<P> A nationwide search was on for the missing athletes -- four from Sri Lanka, three from Nepal, two from Pakistan and possibly ones from Iran and Yemen. They all disappeared in the past four days. </P>
<P> The average wage for a Japanese manual worker is about $3,000 a month, far more than would be earned by many athletes in their home countries. </P>
<P> Team officials from Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Nepal all made formal requests to police to track down their athletes. </P>
<P> Toshihiko Ito, deputy secretary-general of the Games organising committee, said officials fear the number may increase as athletes take advantage of the chance to disappear into Japan's workforce where many of their countrymen are already illegal aliens. </P>
<P> The missing Sri Lankans were an 800-meter runner and three cyclists. The Pakistanis were canoeing competitors and the Nepalese were two soccer players and a karate coach, Ito said. </P>
<P> Japan, which has strict immigration laws, has relaxed them for the Asian Games and airport authorities have already foiled three mass attempts by illegal aliens to enter the country under the cover of the games. </P>
<P> The Justice Ministry said Japan deported 2,686 foreigners, most of them illegal workers from Asia, after a nationwide crackdown in July on illegal immigrants. </P>
