<DATELINE>KWANGJU, South Korea, May 18 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Thousands of South Koreans gathered at a cemetery on Thursday to remember at least 200 protesters killed during the 1980 crackdown on a civil uprising in this city. </P>
<P> ``Husband, how could you leave me? Why did you leave me and the children? I want to be with you,'' one woman wept in front of a grave on the 15th anniversary of the revolt. </P>
<P> Her husband, Im Soo-choon, who died at the age of 38, was among those killed when elite paratroopers armed with M-16 rifles stormed into Kwangju in May, 1980, to quash the 10-day rebellion against military rule. </P>
<P> Elderly women, dressed in traditional white mourning robes, walked to the graves of loved ones and broke down in tears. </P>
<P> People, most holding flowers in their hands, walked in a row past the graves of more than 100 buried at the Mangwol-dong cemetery on the hilly outskirts of Kwangju. </P>
<P> ``I was too young at the time to understand. But now I still don't understand why our military had to shoot their own people,'' said Kim Seung-hee, a 21-year-old university student. She said she did not know any of those buried there, but hoped to learn more about the uprising. </P>
<P> During the rebellion, protesters demanded an end to martial law imposed by then-military strongman Chun Doo Hwan and seized control of Kwangju for several days. </P>
<P> Official figures put the death toll at 200, but witnesses said many more were killed. </P>
<P> Kwangju residents said the truth must be revealed, and those responsible punished. </P>
<P> ``It's been 15 years and still no one knows the truth. The truth must be told,'' said a man in his 30s. </P>
<P> On Wednesday, tens of thousands of Kwangju residents watched students re-enact the 1980 crackdown near a government building. </P>
<P> Unlike previous anniversaries when the event was marked by fire-bombs and tear-gas, students vowed to hold peaceful rallies. </P>
<P> Dissidents blame the crackdown on Chun, who became the nation's president months later, and Roh Tae-woo, an army general who succeeded Chun. </P>
<P> The Kwangju crackdown remains a political problem for Kim Young-sam, who was sworn in as the nation's first president in 1993 without a military background. </P>
<P> President Kim has declared the victims national martyrs, but rejected calls for a full-scale inquiry into the tragedy. </P>
<P> Since Kim became president, he has been unable to visit the Mangwol-dong cemetery. In January, he cancelled a scheduled visit there because of threats of anti-government demonstrations. </P>
