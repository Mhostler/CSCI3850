<P>  Angry commuters set two trains on fire Friday in the second violent protest in a week against long delays on the railroad network into India's commercial capital, a railway spokesman said. </P>
<P> Hundreds of commuters stoned railway property and set fire to platform stalls at Bombay's suburban Borivali station as they were left stranded by the breakdown of a train on the city's Western Railway. </P>
<P> Firemen were battling to put out a blaze in six coaches of the ``Flying Ranee'' express, caught in the rioting that broke out after the line was blocked by the stalled train. </P>
<P> Another 12-coach train was also set on fire and services were curtailed, the railway spokesman said. </P>
<P> Rioting first broke out at Kandivli, the next station down the line, after harried commuters whose tempers were frayed by a downpour on their way to work found out that traffic had halted. </P>
<P> It was the second outbreak of rioting by angry commuters within a week. Last Friday, thousands of commuters went on the rampage at 11 suburban stations after a train derailment forced the cancellation of 500 trains into Bombay, a city of 12 million people that is the country's banking and commercial center. </P>
