<P>  Briton Paul Barney, who survived seven hours in a life raft after Tuesday night's Baltic ferry disaster, told Thursday how six of 11 other people who scrambled aboard the craft died before rescuers reached them. </P>
<P> Coastguards resumed an air and sea search Thursday of the area where the ferry sank with the loss of more than 800 lives in one of the biggest peacetime maritime disasters this century. </P>
<P> As rescuers held out little hope of finding anyone else alive in addition to the 138 survivors already recovered, Barney gave Sky News television his account of what happened. </P>
<P> ``The boat lurched really severely. I was thrown off my bed and things started to slide in the cabin,'' Barney, 35, said from his hospital bed in Mariehamn on the Finnish island of Aland where he is being treated for hypothermia and shock. </P>
<P> ``I tried to make my way up to the exit but that got harder as the ship started to list more and more,'' said Barney, a landscape architect from Pangbourne in southern England. </P>
<P> ``I hung around there for a while and realized there was still a bit of time. But there were no life jackets at all anywhere, in the restaurant or near the exit. </P>
<P> ``The only life jackets were at the end of the boat which was far too dangerous to get to.'' </P>
<P> He said: ``I just kept myself going because I wanted to live. I knew I had to survive.'' </P>
<P> Barney managed to find a life raft with 11 others but they could only watch as rescue helicopters passed nearby several times unable to see them in the darkness and high seas. </P>
<P> ``Hope was beginning to disappear because the weather got really severe. There were seven and eight feet waves coming over us. Every time we got slightly warmer, we got drenched again. </P>
<P> ``I got thrown out a couple of times. Only six of us got off the life raft alive, I'm afraid.'' </P>
