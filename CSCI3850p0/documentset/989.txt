<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Senators Thursday put President Clinton's cherished health reform on hold until early September, deciding they would head home for a summer break after dealing with the controversial crime bill. </P>
<P> The delay makes it harder for lawmakers to complete work on complex health legislation in time for the November congressional elections, but senators said they expect negotiations on a scaled-back compromise to continue through the break. </P>
<P> ``It's time to make an all-out effort to find common ground,'' said Senator Harris Wofford, a Pennsylvania Democrat who has been a strong ally in Clinton's drive to provide health benefits to the 39 million uninsured Americans. </P>
<P> Clinton had hoped that the House and the Senate would pass health reform before the end of August, and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell had intended to keep Senators working on it through their summer holiday. </P>
<P> The Senate has already worked through half of its recess, and Mitchell faced mounting pressure from Senators who were exhausted and who were up for re-election this year. </P>
<P> The House of Representatives has put health reform off until early September. A stalemated Senate, which debated health for two weeks without making any headway, was further thrown off track by an unexpected clash between Repubicans and Democrats over crime legislation. </P>
<P> At the same time, a group of Republican and Democratic moderates, known as the ``mainstream coalition,'' is still working on the final points of their plan that they hope will form the basis of a compromise that can pass the full Senate. </P>
<P> ``I think we now have the confidence in ourselves that we can move forward and get the support that's necessary to get a bill,'' said Vermont Senator Jim Jeffords, a mainstream group member and the only Republican to back Clinton's plan. </P>
<P> Time is running out for health reform supporters who hoped to enact legislation before congressional elections. After the Senate and House pass legislation the two sides will have to work out their differences before handing a bill to the president for his signature. </P>
<P> The date for reconvening is not firm but will probably be either September 8 or September 12. </P>
<P> Despite Clinton's threat to veto any legislation that does not provide health insurance to all Americans, the House and Senate efforts are centering on bills that fall far short of that goal and deal mainly with insurance market reforms and broadening access to health care for the working poor. </P>
<P> ``I have to deal with the reality of getting the most I can,'' said West Virginia Democrat Senator Jay Rockefeller, one of the core group of Democrats backing universal coverage, who hopes a compromise acceptable to him does emerge. </P>
<P> He and his allies are hoping for a clear signal from the mainstream group that they are willing to bend some on their plan. But Senator John Chafee, a Rhode Island Republican who has helped lead the group of 15 to 20 Senators, has not signaled that much flexibility. </P>
<P> The strategy during the break, according to several Democrats, is to have key players and their staff keep negotiating to sort out those areas they can agree on from those that will have to be fought out on the Senate floor. </P>
<P> Wofford said that when they get back senators should work around the clock to enact legislation even if it does not give everybody everything the want. </P>
<P> ``We want to create the expectation and pressure for further steps to be taken by every Congress hereafter,'' Wofford said. </P>
