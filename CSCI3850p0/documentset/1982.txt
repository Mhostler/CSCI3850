<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A federal jury Wednesday awarded Olympic gold medalist Al Joyner $51,501 in damages in his civil rights lawsuit against four police officers who forced him to his knees at gunpoint during a 1992 traffic stop. </P>
<P> A lawyer for the 34-year-old track star, who had sought more than $4.5 million in damages, said the officers ``took something from this man that just doesn't have a dollar amount.'' </P>
<P> Joyner, who had cited mental trauma resulting from the incident as his reason for dropping out of competition for a spot on the U.S. team in the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, vowed to participate in the 1996 Games, where he said he would ``have my day in court on the field.'' </P>
<P> Joyner, who won a gold medal for the triple jump at the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, had been training for the Barcelona Games when he was stopped on Sunset Boulevard on May 8, 1992. </P>
<P> Only days after the devastating Los Angeles riots with tensions still running high, Joyner was ordered out of the car, forced to kneel at gunpoint and handcuffed briefly. </P>
<P> He was released after officers rechecked the license plate and found it belonged to his wife, legendary Olympic sprinter Florence Griffith Joyner. Minutes later, he was stopped again as part of an investigation into a hit-and-run accident. </P>
<P> Joyner contended that the encounter was so psychologically draining that he had to withdraw from competition for the U.S. Olympic team, thus losing thousands of dollars in endorsements and appearance fees. </P>
<P> His wife broke down in tears on the witness stand Tuesday as she recalled the day Joyner returned home after the incident. </P>
<P> Joyner's lawyer, John Burton, had asked for a multimillion-dollar award, but defense attorney Victor Alexandroff had urged jurors to give him no more than a token $1 award, saying the officers acted with justification. </P>
<P> Alexandroff had described Joyner during the trial as a washed-up athlete who was looking for an excuse to pull out of upcoming track meets. </P>
<P> The jury deliberated for a day and a half before returning a verdict of $50,000 in compensatory damages. They also ordered one officer to pay Joyner $1,500 and another to pay $1 in punitive damages. </P>
<P> Alexandroff said Joyner's lawyers had turned down an offer to settle the case for $500,000 a week before the trial began.  U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter had ruled before the trial that the first traffic stop amounted to an arrest ``without probable cause,'' and the jury was only to determine the amount of damages. Hatter ruled that the second stop did not violate Joyner's rights. </P>
