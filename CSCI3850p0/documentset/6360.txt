<P> Lennart Hallberg, spokesman for engineering concern Skanska, denied the French news agency report. </P>
<P> Hallberg said a rumour had spread that two western-looking men had been seen in the Colombian countryside and a local radio station had broadcast the news that they were Swedes Danny Applegate and Tommy Tyrving. </P>
<P> ``For an unknown reason a local radio station stated that the two men were Danny and Tommy. The information was later retracted by the radio station,'' Hallberg said. </P>
<P> Applegate and Tyrving, working on a dam project, were kidnapped in December by guerrillas from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) near the construction site of a hydroelectric plant near the town of Tierralta, about 250 miles (420 km) northwest of Bogota. </P>
