<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Clinton signed Monday a $3 billion defense bill saving the military from deep cutbacks this year, and he commended the Congress for acting quickly on it, the White House said. </P>
<P> The measure included a last-minute provision to cut off U.S. loans to Mexico if Congress is not given documents on the loan deal. Clinton administration officials have said the deadline would be met so the loans would not be in jeopardy. </P>
<P> ``The president about three minutes ago signed into law H.R. (House Resolution) 889, which is the defense supplemental bill,'' White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters Monday afternoon. </P>
<P> ``We'll have a statement shortly in which the president commends the Congress for its expeditious action on his request to provide these funds necessary to defense readiness and preparedness,'' McCurry said. </P>
<P> The bill, passed by the House and Senate last Thursday, will replenish Pentagon accounts drained by U.S. military operations in Haiti, Somalia, South Korea, Kuwait, Cuba and over Bosnia. </P>
<P> Clinton and the Pentagon warned that severe training and combat readiness cuts would have to begin right away without the money because some accounts are dry. </P>
<P> But in a break with past practice, the bill takes $2.7 billion of the $3 billion out of other defense and domestic programs and $360 million from payments from Gulf allies for the U.S. buildup in Kuwait last year. </P>
<P> Republican defense leaders called that a warning to Clinton and future presidents not to commit U.S. troops to military operations abroad without Congress's approval. </P>
<P> A provision attached to the bill last week also would cut off remaining U.S. loans to Mexico from a $20 billion deal if Clinton does not give Congress all documents on the deal and how Mexico is using the money to revive its economy. </P>
<P> The White House and Treasury Department assured Congress the deadline would be met but Secretary Robert Rubin criticized Congress for adding the measure. </P>
