<P>  Argentina's military, fresh from a historic apology over ``dirty war'' crimes, used Navy Day celebrations Wednesday to lobby for higher salaries and more budget allocations. </P>
<P> ``It's difficult to work today in the Navy, and more so to be a military man,'' Navy Chief Enrique Molina Pico said at a formal ceremony with government officials. </P>
<P> ``Budget restrictions affect the force's professional performance and us, its men, at a personal level, and what's worse, at a family level,'' he continued. </P>
<P> Molina Pico spoke two weeks after he broke a 20-year silence on the brutal means used by the last dictatorship to crush suspected left-wing rebels during the ``dirty war'' of the late 1970s. </P>
<P> The budget claim coincided with reports that Navy Commander Alfredo Astiz, convicted in absentia in France for the murder of two nuns, could be promoted. The French ambassador described the reports as ``shameful and shocking.'' </P>
<P> Argentina's once-ruthless armed forces, which staged six coups this century, have been stripped of nearly all their clout under President Carlos Menem's Peronist government. </P>
<P> Menem, who was re-elected to another four-year term Sunday, pardoned the ``dirty war'' crimes of the 1976-83 regime. </P>
<P> He also crushed a mutinous front led by veterans of the 1982 Falklands war against Britain and clipped the military's wings by slashing their budget and abolishing the draft. </P>
<P> Demands for higher wages have since fallen flat. ``Efforts should be made to better allocate funds,'' Defense Minister Oscar Camilion said Wednesday, denying any budget hike. </P>
<P> Despite having mastered the military, Menem's re-election campaign was eclipsed two weeks ago when the top brass suddenly came clean on the ``dirty war'' crimes. </P>
<P> Their dramatic apologies shifted the campaign focus away from Menem's economic record to human rights. </P>
<P> Menem, himself jailed for several years by the dictatorship, has pronounced the dirty war chapter closed. </P>
