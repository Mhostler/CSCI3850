<P>  Panamanian and U.S. officials are looking for a missing $800,000 that could have been taken in an international bank heist, Panamanian officials said Wednesday. </P>
<P> A transfer of dollars from Panama's central bank to the U.S. Federal Reserve in Miami turned up $800,000 short, the government-run National Bank of Panama said in a statement. </P>
<P> Panama uses the dollar as its national currency and depends on the United States for the printing and disposal of its money. The National Bank sends old bills to the Federal Reserve for it to destroy regularly. </P>
<P> But for the first time in the decades-old transfer, money is missing, the National Bank said. </P>
<P> Cash was transferred in Panama on Nov. 18 from the National Bank to Brinks, Panama S.A. in Panama, and later taken by Brinks to Miami's Federal Reserve branch, it said. The transactions were filmed as always, according to the bank. </P>
<P> It said Panamanian and U.S. officials will investigate to determine what happened to the missing money. </P>
