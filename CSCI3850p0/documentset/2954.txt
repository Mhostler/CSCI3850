<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A two-time world rollerskating champion was shot dead by unidentified gunmen in Colombia's northwestern city of Medellin Thursday, police said. </P>
<P> Guillermo Leon Botero Naranjo was walking with his mother through a central neighborhood when he was shot three times by two gunmen riding together on a motorcycle, police said. </P>
<P> Leon Botero, 22, was dead upon arrival at nearby El Rosario hospital. </P>
<P> The killing came on the eve of the first anniversary of the death of drug lord Pablo Escobar. Army and police, who killed Escobar in a rooftop gunfight December, 1993, had been patrolling Medellin's streets all day in anticipation of any violence that might break out. </P>
<P> Police said they had captured the two assailants after they crashed their motorcycle into a taxi while trying to flee from the scene. One of the gunmen was injured in the accident. </P>
<P> Police said they later found in one assailant's pants pockets a piece of paper with the name and address of the former champion. </P>
<P> The motive was still unknown, they added. </P>
<P> The Caracol radio network said Leon Botero, who won the rollerskating world championship twice, was elected Colombia's Athlete of the Year in 1992. It said he had won the championships in Italy and Colombia but did not give the years. </P>
<P> The shooting was done in the same style that Escobar's hired killers used to kill the city's police officers. </P>
<P> Friends and family of the deceased head of the Medellin cartel were preparing to hold masses in churches throughout the city to commemorate his death. </P>
