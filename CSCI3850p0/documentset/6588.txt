<P>  The Philippines' Commission on Elections (Comelec) Tuesday rejected a move by former first lady Imelda Marcos to proclaim herself a winner in last week's elections to Congress. </P>
<P> Marcos Saturday defied Comelec and proclaimed herself the winner of elections on her native Leyte Island, warning of unrest if she is unseated and her son, Ferdinand Jr, ends up cheated out of victory in the race for the 12 national seats in the Philippine Senate because of alleged vote padding. </P>
<P> ``She cannot assume office,'' Comelec Commissioner Manolo Gorospe told reporters. </P>
<P> The Comelec disqualified Marcos before the vote because she failed to meet residency requirements to enable her to run for Congress. Under the law, a candidate must be a resident in hir or her district for at least one year. Marcos has been a resident of Leyte for seven months. </P>
<P> The Supreme Court refused Tuesday to issue an order allowing Mrs. Marcos to take her seat in Congress and told Comelec to comment on her petition protesting against its decision disqualifying her. </P>
<P> New cases of alleged fraud cropped up in the counting of votes for the Senate when Comelec discovered several government candidates received up to 10,000 more votes in their favor. </P>
<P> ``The Comelec will require the provincial board of canvassers to explain the discrepancies in the tally forms,'' Comelec Executive Director Resurreccion Borra said. </P>
<P> The opposition has accused some Comelec and government officials of being involved in vote fraud by padding the number of votes candidates loyal to President Fidel Ramos have received. </P>
<P> ``This government has shamelessly cheated in the elections,'' Miriam Defensor-Santiago, an opposition candidate who is almost sure of winning a seat in the Senate, told Catholic bishops in a speech in Manila. </P>
<P> Comelec has angrily denied the charges while spokesmen for Ramos's Lakas Party have called the opposition sore losers. </P>
<P> ``This is a fantasy,'' retorted Interior Secretary Rafael Alunan, whose office has been accused by Senator Ernesto Maceda, president of the Nationalist People's Coalition, of rigging the vote in the polls. </P>
<P> Government candidates maintained a firm 9-3 in an officially sanctioned quick count for the 12 seats in the Philippine Senate. Ferdinand Jr was not among the top 12. </P>
<P> Election officials said the drawn-out count, which was conducted manually under candlelight in some areas, will be finished by next week. </P>
