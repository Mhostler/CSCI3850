<P>  Hundreds of Israelis fasted for one day Wednesday in solidarity with a handful of activists on hunger strike for the 18th day against Israel returning the Golan Heights to Syria in a peace deal. </P>
<P> ``We are striking against my government, my party that (has) decided to retreat from all of the Golan Heights,'' said Michael Landsberg, one of the veteran hunger strikers and a member of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's Labor Party. </P>
<P> He said up to 300 people joined his group's fast for one day Wednesday. </P>
<P> The protesters wore white shirts saying they were on hunger strike and sat under a tent perched on the edge of the strategic plateau looming over Israel's Sea of Galilee. </P>
<P> Syria demands the entire heights, which Israel occupied in the 1967 Middle East war. Israel says it could make a limited pullback, but refuses to discuss how far until Syria says whether peace means full ties, open borders and trade. </P>
<P> Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin recently lashed out at the hunger strikers, saying they represented anarchy. </P>
<P> Rabin has promised to hold a referendum before ``any significant withdrawal from the Golan.'' </P>
