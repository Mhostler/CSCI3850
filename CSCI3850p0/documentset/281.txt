<DATELINE>NICE, France (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Youths set fire to 17 cars in a parking lot in the French Riviera city of Nice to avenge the death of a youth of Arab origin shot by an unknown gunman, police said Monday. </P>
<P> It was the second outbreak of ethnic violence in France in one weekend following a shootout in the northwestern town of Dreux in which one young man was killed and eight were wounded, officials said. </P>
<P> Police in Nice said half a dozen masked youths poured gasoline on cars at random and set them ablaze early Sunday in the same parking lot where a 19-year-old immigrant was found fatally wounded last week. </P>
<P> In Dreux, police were questioning two French youths who were alleged to have opened fire at random in an immigrant neighborhood late Saturday, before police intervened and shot one of them dead early Sunday. </P>
<P> The wounded, one of whom was seriously injured, were young men of North African origin hit by shotgun fire from a passing car, local officials said. </P>
<P> Dreux, with a large Muslim immigrant population, has long been a focal point for racial tensions in France. </P>
<P> From 1987 to 1993 it was the only constituency in France to have elected a member of parliament from the anti-immigrant, extreme rightist National Front party of Jean-Marie Le Pen. </P>
<P> The deputy, Marie-France Stirbois, was narrowly beaten in new general elections last year. </P>
