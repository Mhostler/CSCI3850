<P>  George Burns, the 98-year-old Oscar-winning comedian, has canceled his annual appearance at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas but the venue is taking reservations for his 100th birthday gig, an operator said Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``He's canceled. But we're taking reservations for 1996,'' said a Caesars' switchboard operator who identified herself as Ginny. </P>
<P> ``He's scheduled to play here from Jan. 18 through Jan. 22, 1996, though that could be changed. We're taking reservations right now,'' said the operator. </P>
<P> The operator said she had no further information on Burns' condition but a hospital spokesman in Los Angeles said Burns was recovering from surgery. </P>
<P> The comedian was discharged in September from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center after surgery to drain excess fluid from the surface of his brain. The fluid buildup was caused by a head injury suffered when he fell in his bathtub at his Beverly Hills home. </P>
<P> ``He hasn't worked for a while. He had surgery several months ago. I imagine they canceled because he's not yet ready to do it,'' said Ron Wise, a spokesman for Cedars-Sinai. </P>
<P> Burns has continued to play show dates through his 90s and had also been booked to star at the London Palladium on his 100th birthday in 1996. </P>
<P> In his 80s Burns became a film star, won an Oscar, resurrected his fading stage career, became an author and went on to make hit records. </P>
<P> He won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance as a retired comedian in the film version of Neil Simon's ``The Sunshine Boys'' (1975) and his career soared. </P>
<P> At age 95, he became the oldest-ever Grammy award nominee, with a nod in the spoken-word category for ``Gracie -- A Love Story.'' </P>
