<P>  Russia, in its first public reaction to Friday's NATO air strikes near Sarajevo, expressed alarm but said the Bosnian Serbs had provoked the attacks. </P>
<P> A Foreign Ministry spokesman, quoted by the official Itar-Tass news agency, stopped short of endorsing NATO's action. But he said: </P>
<P> ``It is deplorable that the Serbs themselves gave grounds for this turn of events, acting recently, it would seem, on the principle 'the worse things get, the better for us.''' </P>
<P> This first reaction was in line with Moscow's sharp criticism over the past few days of the Bosnian Serbs for rejecting the latest international plan to end the conflict in the former Yugoslav province. </P>
<P> The Kremlin, under pressure from Russian nationalists, portrays itself as a guarantor of Serb interests. But it enthusiastically backed Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's attempts to pressure the Bosnian Serbs into accepting the plan. </P>
<P> President Boris Yeltsin reacted angrily to earlier NATO air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs, demanding the right to be consulted in advance. It was not immediately clear whether NATO commanders or U.N. officials had consulted Moscow this time. </P>
<P> U.N. commanders requested the strike after Bosnian Serb forces raided a depot inside a 12-mile exclusion zone set up by the United Nations in February and took back a tank and other heavy weapons they had previously surrendered. </P>
<P> U.N. officials said later that the Bosnian Serbs had promised to return all the weapons immediately and regretted the incident. </P>
<P> The flare-up followed the Bosnian Serbs' rejection of a peace plan drawn up by the ``contact group'' of Russia, Germany, France, Britain and the United States, which would split Bosnia roughly equally between Serbs and a Muslim-Croats alliance. </P>
<P> Russia has invested some prestige in so far fruitless efforts to use its influence to persuade the Bosnian Serbs to accept the plan, which would involve surrendering territory. </P>
<P> The brief Foreign Ministry comment, a few hours after the attack, said Russia was deeply concerned at the turn of events. </P>
<P> ``Now, when the process for a peaceful settlement of the Bosnian crisis has been intensified, flare-ups of this type can only complicate the political efforts that are being made,'' Tass quoted the spokesman as saying. </P>
