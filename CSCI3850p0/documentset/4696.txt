<P>  The prosecution in the O.J. Simpson case Thursday vigorously attacked the testimony of a key defense alibi witness, pointing out inconsistencies and accusing her of lying under oath. </P>
<P> Rosa Lopez, a live-in housekeeper at Simpson's neighbors, has said she saw the football legend's white Ford Bronco parked outside his mansion at about the time the prosecution alleges he was murdering his ex-wife and her friend two miles away. </P>
<P> But Deputy District Attorney Christopher Darden suggested that the crucial time of 10:15 p.m. on June 12, which the prosecution says was approximately when the murders occurred, was suggested to Lopez by defense team investigator William Pavelic. </P>
<P> ``Did Mr. Pavelic tell you or mention to you first that you saw the Bronco at 10:15 p.m. or 10:20 p.m.?'' he asked Lopez. </P>
<P> She answered that all she told the investigator was that it was after 10 p.m. when she took her employer's dog for a walk and saw the vehicle. </P>
<P> Darden started his cross-examination by questioning Lopez closely on her claim for unemployment benefits and her statement to the court last Friday that she had made airline reservations. </P>
<P> Pointedly reminding her that she was under oath, Darden twice accused her of lying about the reservations and Lopez insisted that she had not lied. </P>
<P> The witness admitted she had not made reservations for a flight back to her native El Salvador, as she had previously testified. </P>
<P> ``That was a lie, correct?'' Darden asked her. </P>
<P> ``I didn't remember that I hadn't made reservations previously,'' Lopez replied, speaking through a Spanish language interpreter. </P>
<P> But she agreed that she told the court she had made reservations last Friday when in fact she had not. </P>
<P> ``And you lied?'' Darden asked. ``No,'' Lopez replied. </P>
<P> The housekeeper gave her testimony on videotape so that it could be preserved for possible later viewing by the jury, which was not present in court. </P>
<P> Lopez, who has lived in the United States for 27 years, has stated she intends to go home to El Salvador and not return because her life has been ``destroyed'' by the media attention paid to her over the so-called ``trial of the century.'' </P>
<P> Simpson, a star running back who gained later fame as a sportscaster, actor and TV pitchman, has pleaded not guilty to the stabbing deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. The prosecution claims he drove to Nicole Simpson's home in his Bronco and stabbed the two to death. </P>
<P> Blood smears were found on the Bronco the next morning, but the results of DNA tests on that blood have not yet been disclosed. </P>
<P> Lopez is also being pursued by the Salvadoran press in her absence from the country, and the daily La Prensa Grafica newspaper reported Thursday she had changed her name three times. </P>
<P> The paper said Lopez was born with the name Reyes Lopez but later changed it to Maria Reyes Martinez Lopez, and then Rosa Maria Lopez Martinez before adopting her current name. </P>
<P> It said reporters had located Lopez's stepdaughter, Maria Cruz Rogel, in the eastern province of Cabanas and that she said Lopez had promised to return soon to live with her in El Salvador. </P>
<P> In his aggressive cross-examination of Lopez, Darden also questioned her on whether or not she had applied for unemployment benefits. </P>
<P> ``When you told us last Friday you hadn't filled out an unemployment insurance application form that wasn't true was it? That was a lie, correct?'' he said. </P>
<P> Lopez said she had been referring to a form given to her at the unemployment office which she had taken home and had not filled out. </P>
<P> But she acknowledged that she had filled out a form at the unemployment office and had requested unemployment benefits. </P>
<P> Darden also indirectly accused Cochran of coaching Lopez from his seat at the defense table, asking her if she had seen the attorney using hand gestures to dictate her answers. </P>
<P> Lopez said she had seen no hand movements from Cochran and had not been looking at him during her cross-examination. </P>
<P> The prosecutor also asked her about being coached by Cochran over last weekend and during a morning recess Thursday. Lopez replied that all he had said was that she should always tell the truth. </P>
<P> The remark brought a loud, apparently derisive laugh from Darden which Cochran immediately objected to. Judge Lance Ito admonished Darden, who immediately apologized. </P>
