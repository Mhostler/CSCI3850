<P>  France has earmarked $110 million to prevent silting around Mont St Michel and to keep the medieval abbey tourist site as an island, officials said Tuesday. </P>
<P> The island in St. Michel Bay on the northern French coast is connected to the shore just (nearly a mile away by a causeway used by tour buses and cars. </P>
<P> But the causeway prevents seawater from swirling normally in the bay, leading to silting, and will be replaced by a bridge, officials said. </P>
<P> Mud flats and sand have become increasingly visible around the island, which is visited by three million people annually and has had an abbey for 1,000 years. </P>
