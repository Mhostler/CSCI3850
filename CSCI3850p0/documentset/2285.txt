<DATELINE>KUWAIT (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Kuwaitis love President Clinton, visiting their small country Friday to show U.S. support against Iraq, but fears exist that growing dependence on Washington may not be totally beneficial. </P>
<P> They may not love him as much as they did George Bush, who came to their rescue after Iraq's 1990 invasion, but enough to gladden his heart and possibly help his popularity ratings at home. </P>
<P> The admiration by almost all Kuwaitis of U.S. presidents for their tough responses to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is not necessarily shared by everyone around the region that contains the world's richest oil reserves. </P>
<P> Gulf Arab governments, led by Saudi Arabia, regard their alliance with Washington as a strategic necessity. </P>
<P> They hope it will keep at bay what they see as potential predators among tens of millions of impoversihed neighbors who envy them the wealth that changed their mainly nomad and impoverished communities into ultra-modern, high-tech states in less than 50 years. </P>
<P> Business communities generally share the concerns of their governments and see the Washington link as healthy insurance. </P>
<P> But many senior officials and some businessmen express concern in private about what they see as an increasing dependence on the U.S. that is antagonizing large sections of society brought up on a diet of anti-American rhetoric. </P>
<P> ``Many ordinary people don't like it ... It is feeding an Islamic backlash that could be dangerous in the long-term,'' one Gulf diplomat said. He and others like him, however, do not necessarily see another way out for their governments. </P>
<P> The six states of the Gulf Cooperation Council -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates -- are surrounded by potentially hostile 60 million Iranians and 20 million Iraqis to the east and north, and 13 million Yemenis in the southwest. </P>
<P> They do not completely trust the 20 million Levantines -- Palestinians, Jordanians, Syrians and Lebanese to the north -- and fear the rise of a hostile power across the Red Sea in Egypt. </P>
<P> Muslim militants in Egypt, which has a population of nearly 60 million, are waging a violent campaign against the country's pro-western government. </P>
<P> Even in their own countries, they are often outnumbered by expatriate workers who have flocked to the Gulf in millions for a share of the oil bonanza that the sparsely populated states of the region were in no position to exploit on their own. </P>
<P> They have so far not been able to develop a joint regional military deterrent despite the billions of dollars they spent on arms purchases, mainly from the United States. </P>
<P> ``They (Gulf rulers) see enemies and dangers all around them .. I don't think they have much choice,'' one banker said. ``But that does not mean that their people like it,'' he added. </P>
<P> The sight of American troops in the land of Islam already angers purists who see it as a sign of weakness and corruption. </P>
<P> One Gulf diplomat said that resentment was fed by the fact that the Gulf states are having to pay the cost of U.S. and other allied deployment. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait between them paid some $100 billion of the allied costs of the 1991 Gulf war. </P>
<P> ``We know they are here to protect their own interests and not for love of Gulf Arabs,'' he said. </P>
<P> When Secretary of State Warren Christopher came to Kuwait earlier this month to meet Gulf foreign ministers, ``burden-sharing,'' as he called it, was at the top of his agenda. </P>
<P> He asked them, and the Gulf states agreed, to pay for the cost to the U.S. of sending its planes, warships and thousands of soldiers to the Gulf in response to the massing of 80,000 Iraqi troops close to Kuwait's border. The bill for American troops alone is expected to run to some $1 billion. </P>
<P> A Gulf diplomat who attended the talks reacted warily: ``When the British colonized us, they used to pay us. Now the Americans are doing the same but they want us to pay for it.'' </P>
<P> He was referring to payments that Britain, which treated most Gulf states as protectorates until the early 1970s, used to make to Gulf rulers before oil started to enrich them. </P>
