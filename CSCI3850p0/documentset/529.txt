<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Alleged ``Hollywood Madam'' Heidi Fleiss and her physician father Monday pleaded not guilty to federal charges of laundering money from her high-priced call-girl ring. </P>
<P> They also pleaded innocent to charges of making false statements to obtain a bank loan and Heidi Fleiss denied a single count of tax evasion. </P>
<P> U.S. Judge Consuelo Marshall, who presided over Monday's arraignment, set a trial date of October 11. </P>
<P> Fleiss, 28, and her father were indicted by a federal grand jury Thursday on six counts of money laundering, one count of conspiracy and two counts of making false statements to obtain a bank mortgage. </P>
<P> Dr. Fleiss, 60, was also charged individually with making four more false statements to obtain a mortgage. </P>
<P> Heidi Fleiss pleaded not guilty last year to charges that she ran a high-priced call girl ring catering to stars and entertainment moguls. Her trial in that case, in which she is charged with five counts of pandering and one of possessing cocaine, is set to begin August 22. </P>
<P> Heidi Fleiss' lead attorney, Anthony Brooklier, said outside court Monday he expects the state case to proceed first. </P>
<P> Prior to their arraignment, father and daughter made a brief initial federal court appearance before a U.S. magistrate Monday. They were asked if they had seen the indictment and had been read their rights before being taken away for processing. </P>
<P> Brooklier's partner, Donald Marks, said Fleiss is ``very upset that her father is charged.'' </P>
<P> Philip Heller, the attorney for Dr Fleiss, declined to comment on the case. </P>
<P> Brooklier said he would use the federal case to bring out the names of Heidi Fleiss' alleged customers. He said the indictment mentioned checks made out to Heidi Fleiss and he would bring a motion before the federal court asking ``who are the authors of the checks.'' </P>
<P> Referring to the state case, Brooklier said, ``The prosecution seems reluctant to come up with these names. They've been protecting these ... people for months now. I want to see who wrote these alleged checks. I also want to know why these people aren't being charged.'' </P>
<P> According to the federal indictment, Fleiss and her wealthy father hatched an elaborate plot to hide earnings from her prostitution business. The elder Fleiss is alleged to have opened several bank accounts in his name into which his daughter deposited her prostitution earnings. </P>
<P> The federal indictment alleges that Fleiss used her illegal earnings to put a $54,000 cash down payment on a $1.6 million villa in Beverly Hills and that her father knowingly submitted false loan applications for the property and got a $1-million bank loan by stating that he was the buyer. </P>
<P> Authorities claim the mortgage payment of $7,618.38 a month was charged to an account in Dr. Fleiss' name that he had set up to launder his daughter's prostitution proceeds. </P>
<P> Heidi Fleiss is also accused of submitting a tax return for 1992 showing that she earned $33,000 when her call-girl operation that year netted hundred of thousands of dollars. </P>
<P> If convicted on all charges, Heidi Fleiss faces a maximum sentence of 188 years in prison and a fine of $5.5 million. Dr Fleiss faces a maximum sentence of 305 years in prison and a $9.2-million fine. Both are free on unsecured bonds of $50,000 each. </P>
