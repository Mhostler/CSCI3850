<P>  Azerbaijan's President Heydar Aliyev said Thursday he was ready to provide guarantees for the Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh, but demanded the withdrawal of occupying troops which he said came from neighboring Armenia, and the return of 50,000 Azeri refugees. </P>
<P> In a speech to the General Assembly, he said: ``As a result of ... aggression, more than 20 percent of the territory of Azerbaijan are under occupation of the armed forces of the Republic of Armenia.'' </P>
<P> Armenia's President Levon Ter-Petrossian told the Assembly the previous day his country had no territorial claims against Azerbaijan and that a six-year-old conflict which has taken thousands of lives was being waged by the Armenian inhabitants of Nagorno-Karabakh who were seeking self-determination. </P>
<P> Nagorno-Karabakh is embedded in Azerbaijan, which has administered the enclave since 1923. </P>
<P> ``We are prepared to provide for guarantees to the Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh ... We are also prepared to discuss the status of Nagorno-Karabakh within the Azerbaijani state,'' Aliyev told the U.N. Assembly. </P>
<P> ``However, there are norms and principles which are everlasting to us, namely, sovereignty and territorial integrity, evacuation of all the occupied territories, return of refugees to their homes, including 50,000 Azerbaijani refugees to their native land in Nagorno-Karabakh.'' </P>
<P> Aliyev said only by implementing Security Council resolutions confirming Azerbaijan's sovereignty and integrity and demanding the complete withdrawal of all occupying forces would be it be possible to conduct productive negotiations aimed at a stable cease-fire and ensuring security for the whole population of the region. </P>
<P> He said a proposal by Armenia for an international separation force to be stationed along what he called ``the perimeter of the occupied Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan'' would only turn the troops into ``a tool for freezing the situation and make them hostages of its annexationist policy.'' </P>
<P> Aliyev told reporters that he had met Ter-Petrossian Tuesday but that the two had failed to make any progress on the issue of the town of Susha and the Lachin region, occupied by the Armenians. </P>
<P> ``In particular we stressed that when we are talking about the withdrawal of Armenian forces from occupied territoties we include Susha and Lachin,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``We could not reach any agreement between the Armenian and Azerbaijani side on this question ... We held to the idea that we should hold to the cease-fire.'' </P>
