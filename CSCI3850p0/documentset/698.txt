<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A Catholic security guard was shot dead by a suspected Protestant extremist Wednesday in Northern Ireland's third killing in a week, police said. </P>
<P> The gunman opened fire at the middle-aged victim as he sat in his hut next to a supermarket in a mainly Protestant area of the city, a spokesman for the Royal Ulster Constabulary said. </P>
<P> Unconfirmed reports said the attacker was riding a bicycle, enabling him to make a quick getaway. </P>
<P> Protestant militants waging an increasingly vicious campaign in support of British rule in Northern Ireland were the chief suspects in the ride-by shooting after killing a pregnant Catholic woman earlier this week. </P>
<P> Extremists belonging to the outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force killed the woman in her bedroom Sunday, stirring a wave of revulsion among a people grown accustomed to atrocity during the 25-year guerrilla conflict. The victim, Kathleen O'Hagan, 38, was shot dead in front of one of her five children. </P>
<P> The following day, the Irish Republican Army (IRA) hit back with the murder of a butcher and part-time soldier, Trelford Withers, 46. </P>
<P> The IRA wants to reunite the Protestant-majority province with the predominantly Catholic Irish Republic, ending seven decades of partition on the island. </P>
<P> The latest bout of bloodshed follows republicans' rejection of an Anglo-Irish peace plan that promised to include the IRA's political allies Sinn Fein in political talks if the guerrillas renounced violence. </P>
