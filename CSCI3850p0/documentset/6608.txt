<P>  Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio has hired R. Thompson & Co., a Washington-based consulting firm, to represent Guatemala in the United States, the company announced Tuesday. </P>
<P> Guatemala is investigating allegations revealed in March that the Guatemala army killed a U.S. citizen and a guerrilla leader married to a U.S. lawyer. </P>
<P> De Leon will supervise the firm's activities on Guatemala's behalf, which will include periodic briefings for U.S. government officials, Congress, interest groups and the media on Guatamala's efforts to reform its democratic institutions, human rights and economic and trade relations. </P>
<P> In a statement announcing the move, R. Thompson & Co. said it would ``take no action and make no comments on matters relating in any way to any specific incident of human rights abuse.'' </P>
<P> Instead, the company's efforts would be aimed at ensuring that ``all interested U.S. officials and observers are aware of the steps that the De Leon government is taking to reform Guatemala.'' </P>
<P> Guatemala's army has a long history of human rights abuses. Rights groups say the army has killed more than 100,000 Guatemalans over the last three decades. </P>
<P> The company gave no financial details on its contract with Guatemala, but said the deal would initially last for six months followed by three possible six-month renewals, for a total of two years. </P>
<P> Robert J. Thompson founded the firm in 1983 after serving in several senior posts in the Reagan administration. </P>
