<P>  A senior Peruvian official accused Ecuador Wednesday of provoking Peru along their disputed border and trying to drag its neighbor into an arms race. </P>
<P> ``We are the victims of insistent and consistent provocations from Ecuador,'' Peru's deputy foreign minister Eduardo Ponce said in the Chilean capital of Santiago. </P>
<P> ``The Peruvian government's policy ... is not to give in to the arms race or arms escalation which Ecuador has initiated,'' he told reporters after meeting Chilean officials. </P>
<P> Peru, whose brief border war with Ecuador was supposed to have ended with a cease-fire last month, Tuesday accused its neighbor of attacking Peruvian forces with mortars and gunfire along their jungle border. It said one soldier was killed in what it called Ecuador's second cease-fire breach in the past week. </P>
<P> ``These are violations of the cease-fire, in the face of which Peru is maintaining an attitude of strict observance ... of its commitments'' under the truce, Ponce said. He dismissed any suggestion that Peru might also be guilty of violations. </P>
<P> ``It's truly fantasy, it's ridiculous to say that Peruvian troops fired at a point inside Peruvian territory where there are international observers,'' he said. ``They (Ecuadorans) have been firing at a place very near where forces are concentrated in Peruvian territory, a place called Observation Post Number One, which is exactly where the international observers are.'' </P>
<P> Fighting broke out along an undemarcated stretch of their Amazon frontier in late January. At least 75 people died in about a month of fighting by official counts, although news reports from the front suggested a much higher death toll. </P>
