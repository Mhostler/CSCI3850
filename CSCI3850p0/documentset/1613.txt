<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P> By Joanne Kenen  George Mitchell had one big wish before retiring from the Senate. Despite countless hours of the most intense efforts, he did not get it. </P>
<P> Mitchell, the Senate Majority Leader, wanted a health care bill.  ``I believe all Americans have a right to affordable, high quality health care,'' the Maine Democrat said Monday as he reluctantly put a halt to health reform efforts for the year. </P>
<P> ``I told (the president) it would be difficult under the circumstances. It turns out I was right.'' </P>
<P> Mitchell took his colleagues by surprise last March 4 when he announced that he was leaving the Senate where he has served since 1980. </P>
<P> A few weeks later, the former federal judge surprised them again by declining a Supreme Court appointment for fear that confirmation hearings could interfere with his quest for health care. </P>
<P> He did not rule out becoming the next baseball commissioner, still a possibility for the die-hard Red Sox fan who jokes that managing 28 egotistical multimillionaire team owners will be a cinch after dealing with 100 U.S. Senators. </P>
<P> The third shock came just a week later when Mitchell, 61, announced his engagement to 35-year-old Heather MacLachlan, a Montreal-born executive at a New York sports marketing firm.  In his low-key but deliberate style, Mitchell spent months trying to get President Clinton's historic universal health care bill, or at least legislation resembling it, through a Senate that could scarcely have more bitterly divided. </P>
<P> He lowered his expectations and tried to get his own whittled-down bill through. But despite concessions made in search of consensus, that bill laboriously sank in August after unproductive debate and a thinly disguised filibuster. </P>
<P> He retrenched once again, and tried to work out a compromise with the bipartisan ``Mainstream Coalition'' led by his old friend, John Chafee, a Rhode Island moderate Republican with whom he had been able to do business in the past on such landmark legislation as the 1990 Clean Air Act, another issue close to Mitchell's heart.  But the mainstream health effort too fizzled out. </P>
<P> Mitchell, who says he gave health care ``my close attention and all my energy,'' says he does not regret his decisions. </P>
<P> His allies say no one could have worked harder.  ``History will show that George Mitchell is one of the greats of the Senate. He is respected for his fairness and decency on both sides of the aisle,'' said Massachusetts Democrat Edward Kennedy, a champion of health reform for years. </P>
<P> Mitchell has remained silent on his own plans -- including the wedding date -- over the past few months. </P>
<P> A calm, almost exaggeratedly deliberate man with a wry and subtle sense of humor, Mitchell seldom displays anger in public. But his leadership years have been trying times.  He was the top Democrat when Republican President Bush controlled the White House. Despite his understated style, he knows how to play partisan hardball. </P>
<P> ``Mithchell's purpose, his goal was simply to bring my presidency down, and to some degree he deserved credit for that,'' Bush once said.  Now, with Democrats controlling the White House and both branches of Congress, he faces a Republican Senate opposition that uses all tactics at its disposal to delay or derail Democratic initiatives. Democrats control 56 seats, but Republicans, by using filibusters or parliamentary maneuvers, can with only 44 votes often thwart the majority party. </P>
<P> Mitchell's rise from small-town New England to the pinnacle of the Senate was characterized by methodical progress through college, the army, law school, and state politics. </P>
<P> He was appointed to the Senate in 1980 when Senator Edmund Muskie quit to take the post of Secretary of State. He won election two years later, and in 1988, Democrats chose him as majority leader. </P>
<P> Mitchell was born August 20, 1933, in Waterville, Maine, the fourth son of a janitor and his Lebanese immigrant wife. His brothers and one sister still live there and he tries to go back to Maine every weekend. </P>
<P> He paid his way through law school by studying at night and working as an insurance adjuster by day. He has one adult daughter from his first marriage. </P>
