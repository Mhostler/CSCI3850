<P>  Pope John Paul told Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera Friday democracy had come a long way in his country but there was still room for improvement. </P>
<P> ``In recent decades Venezuela has known how to combine significant economic progress with the development of a program of freedom...and the vitality of a democratic system,'' the Pope said. </P>
<P> But he told Caldera during an official visit to the Vatican that while ``democracy has won on some fronts'' in the oil-rich nation other goals still had to be met. </P>
<P> The pope, who visited Venezuela in 1985, said this included ``internal renewal of democracy itself, which, with honesty and transparency, serves the common good of all citizens.'' </P>
<P> He said true development should aim at ``combatting and eventually eradicating hardship and extreme poverty.'' </P>
<P> The military ruled Venezuela until 1958 and sought to seize power again in two failed coup attempts in 1992. </P>
<P> But critics have worried that Caldera's two-year-old government has increased its reliance on soldiers to settle civilian disputes, such as street riots and prison violence. </P>
<P> Last June, Caldera suspended key constitutional liberties, such as protection from search and arrest without warrants, in a crackdown on crime. </P>
<P> The president invited the pope to make another visit to the south American country. </P>
<P> Caldera is in Italy for the pope's beatification Sunday of Mother Maria de San Jose, a Venezuelan nun who founded a religious order. </P>
<P> Beatification is the penultimate step before sainthood in the Roman Catholic Church. The nun, who died in 1967, is the first Venezuelan citizen to be beatified. </P>
