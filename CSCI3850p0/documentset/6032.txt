<P>  A Massachusetts man was charged Tuesday with threatening to blow up a federal building in New Bedford, Mass., the Justice Department said Tuesday in a case unrelated to the Oklahoma City bomb blast. </P>

<P> If convicted, Navarro faces a maximum five-year prison term and a $250,000 fine. </P>
