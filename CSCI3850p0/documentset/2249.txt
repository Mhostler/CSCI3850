<P>  Mortgage lenders continued to reject home loan applications from blacks at more than twice the rate of those for whites in 1993, according to government data released Wednesday. </P>
<P> Despite government and industry efforts to combat lending discrimination, the statistics issued by bank regulators show that racial disparities in home lending persist and that differences in income do not fully explain the gap. </P>
<P> It was the fourth straight year in which black mortgage applicants were rejected at more than twice the rate of whites. </P>
<P> ``It shows there is a problem that reflects economic injustice among minorities as well as discrimination against them,'' said banking consultant Karen Shaw. </P>
<P> The data showed that 34 percent of black applicants for conventional home mortgages nationwide were denied credit in 1993, versus 15.3 percent of white applicants. </P>
<P> Also, 25.1 percent of Hispanic home-buyers were denied home loans, along with 14.6 percent of Asians. </P>
<P> ``Although 1993 denial rates for conventional home-purchase loans were lower for each racial or ethnic group, significant differences across groups continue to be found,'' the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council said in its report. </P>
<P> The FFIEC is made up of the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the National Credit Union Administration, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Office of Thrift Supervision. </P>
<P> The report said income differences account for some of the disparity, but it pointed out that ``other factors are more important'' because white and Asian applicants in all income groups had substantially lower denial rates than black, Native American or Hispanic applicants. </P>
<P> Among the poorest applicants, for example, 32.3 percent of black applicants were denied a home loan while 19.3 percent of whites were rejected. </P>
<P> The report said the extent to which racial discrimination accounts for the disparity is not known. It said a poor credit history or no credit history was the most frequently cited reason for loan denials. </P>
<P> The data supplied under the 1992 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act reflects information submitted by about 9,650 banks, thrifts, credit unions and mortgage companies. </P>
<P> Community advocates seized on the statistics as further evidence banks have not gone far enough to extend loans to minority and low-income borrowers. </P>
