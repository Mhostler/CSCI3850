<P>  The Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas on Friday objected to Jordan's rebuking its representative in Amman and said it hoped Jordan would refrain from such acts in future. </P>
<P> PLO head Yasser Arafat, conducting a crackdown on Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Gaza after suicide bombings against Israelis there, sent an envoy to Jordan on Thursday to protest at Hamas issuing ``inciting statements from Amman,'' a PLO official said. </P>
<P> On the same day, Jordan's Interior Minister warned the Hamas spokesman in Amman, Ibrahim Ghosheh, against making any statements to the media in the name of Hamas. </P>
<P></P>
<P> ``We in Hamas hope that this unfortunate incident will not be repeated in the future particularly since the movement represents the hope of the nation and is in the forefront in defending it against the Zionist fierce aggression.'' </P>
<P> It accused Arafat's Palestinian self-rule Authority (PA) of inciting Jordan against Hamas and said the Palestinian people backed Hamas which ``will not submit to any repression or threats from any side.'' </P>
<P> The PA, running Gaza and Jericho since May, said on Wednesday Hamas's ``practical leadership'' was in Jordan despite what it said was Amman's pledge to prevent militant activity. </P>
<P> Hamas, the PLO's main rival, opposes the self-rule peace deal with Israel and has vowed to wreck it. </P>
