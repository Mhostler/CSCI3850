<DATELINE>LONDON, April 13 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Telephone numbers in Britain will require an extra prefix digit from Sunday. </P>
<P> Area code numbers will have an extra ``1'' added -- for example London numbers will start 0171 or 0181 instead of 071 or 081. Overseas callers normally drop the zero at the beginning. </P>
<P> The rule excludes five cities -- Bristol, Leeds, Leicester, Nottingham, and Sheffield -- which will have totally new codes. </P>
<P> A statement from British Telecommunications Plc, the country's major telephone company, said the changes were needed to cope with higher demand, particularly from fax machine users. </P>
<P> The extra digit opens the way to providing an extra eight billion telephone lines. Sixteen million pounds ($25 million) has been spent on an advertising campaign in newspapers and on television to warn of the impending changes on ``Phoneday.'' </P>
<P> Callers dialling the old code from Sunday will hear a recorded message explaining their mistake. Britain's international country code, 44, remains the same. </P>
