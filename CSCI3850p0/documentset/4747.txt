<P>  Zapatista rebel leaders in Mexico's southern state of Chiapas have rejected a peace plan presented by President Ernesto Zedillo before legislators could sit down to debate it. </P>
<P> Maya Indian leaders of the Zapatista National Liberation Army released a statement late Sunday saying Zedillo's proposal was ``arrogant'' and should be rejected by Congress, which is expected to discuss the initiative Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``It signifies a true step backwards on the path of a dignified and just solution to the conflict,'' they said. </P>
<P> Zedillo last week proposed suspending arrest orders for top Zapatista leaders, notably their charismatic military chief Subcommander Marcos, for 30 days so talks can begin. </P>
<P> But he said they will not be able to carry weapons into any talks and the proposed suspension of arrest orders will only be extended if the peace process is going well. </P>
<P> Congress, which is dominated by the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, is expected to approve Zedillo's plan. </P>
<P> In rejecting the proposal, the rebels did not mention the weapons ban or their demand the army pull out of territory it has seized in a recent sweep through their jungle strongholds but said they were being set up for betrayal. </P>
<P> ``The bad government ... continues to treat us like criminals and this is no more than a trap to complete the political persecution against us,'' they said, adding that the proposal is ``humiliating, undignified, arrogant and unjust''. </P>
<P> They said Zedillo's plan to include legislators in groups charged with negotiating a peace accord and then pushing through its details would leave the rebels in a minority. </P>
<P> They did not reject dialogue outright but instead asked Zedillo and a special legislative group to come up with another proposal ``allowing a definitive solution to the conflict''. </P>
<P> The statement was not signed by Marcos, who is holed up at a base deep inside the Lacandon Jungle. </P>
<P> The Zapatistas took up arms on New Year's Day 1994 to demand national democratic reforms, greater autonomy for Mexico's indigenous peoples and sweeping land and judicial reforms in Chiapas. </P>
<P> Zedillo, like his predecessor Carlos Salinas de Gortari, offered to pour money into the state's poor indigenous communities but has firmly resisted rebel efforts to bring national issues to the negotiating table. </P>
<P> Initial peace talks broke down in March last year. </P>
<P> After months of military and political stalemate, Zedillo last month ordered Marcos' arrest and sent thousands of troops into the Lacandon Jungle to capture him. </P>
<P> But Marcos escaped with his troops to their strongest jungle bases and Zedillo decided to again push for talks. </P>
