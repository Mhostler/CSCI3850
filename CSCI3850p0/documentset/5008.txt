<P>  European Union foreign ministers called Saturday on the leaders of Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia to meet to head off a new outbreak of war, but rejected Serbia's demand that sanctions be lifted first. </P>
<P> At an informal meeting in the medieval walled city of Carcassonne in southern France, ministers from the 15-nation bloc said they were deeply concerned about the prospects for fresh fighting in former Yugoslavia. </P>
<P> ``The risk of renewed hostility is high,'' French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, host of the meeting, told reporters. </P>
<P> ``There is plentiful information that arms are flowing into the area and that all sides are preparing for the resumption of war,'' he said. </P>
<P> The ministers also said Croatia must allow sufficient U.N. peacekeepers to stay on its soil, with a unified command for all of former Yugoslavia, if it wanted negotiations on a trade agreement with the EU to open. </P>
<P> Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring said U.N. forces must not be given ``a mission impossible.'' </P>
<P> The five-power Contact Group -- Russia, the United States, France, Britain and Germany -- has called for the leaders of Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia to hold a last-ditch summit to avert a new outbreak of bloodshed in former Yugoslavia. </P>
<P> German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said the EU ministers had agreed they must keep pressure to bring about the meeting. </P>
<P> The ministers flatly rejected Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's demand that United Nations sanctions on his country be lifted finally before he would attend such a summit. </P>
<P> ``This is out of the question for us,'' he told reporters. </P>
<P> Juppe blamed Milosevic for stalling the peace initiative but said the Contact Group must show greater unity, implicitly criticising Russia which has supported the Serbian demand. </P>
<P> He said the EU had three objectives -- to maintain a U.N. force in Croatia, to ensure a continued ceasefire and to stage the summit to work towards a political settlement. </P>
<P> There is particular concern that Croatia could erupt in new bloodshed following a decision to halve the U.N. Protection Force in the country. </P>
<P> Croatian President Franjo Tudjman initially demanded that the entire 12,000-strong UNPROFOR withdraw from Croatia after their mandate expires March 31, only to agree under intense pressure to allow 5,000 to remain. </P>
<P> Belgian Foreign Minister Frank Vandenbroucke said: ``We have to ensure that enough troops remain on the ground to fulfil the mandate with all guarantees for safety.'' </P>
<P> Spring said there was agreement among the EU ministers for a clear command structure to be set up between the Croatian-based UNPROFOR troops and the secretary general of the United Nations. </P>
