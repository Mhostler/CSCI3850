<P>  Cuba said Wednesday it was concerned by reports that U.S. authorities were taking steps to make it easier for Cuban rafters to escape from camps at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay. </P>
<P> A front-page report in the ruling Communist Party newspaper Granma said Cuba wanted clarification on U.S. policy at the base, on the southeast tip of Cuba. Some Cubans who want to return home are escaping rather than waiting to be returned through official channels. </P>
<P> Granma said that last Friday a group of 728 Cubans who had asked to be returned home were moved to the limits of the base. </P>
<P> It said this move, which was followed by the escape of some 58 Cubans from the area, was in line with what the U.S. camp commander, Brig. Gen. Raymond Ayres, had said earlier last week. </P>
<P> It cited a Reuter report in which Ayres said authorities were considering a plan to facilitiate the escape of Cubans from the base. Ayres was quoted as saying he was concerned it would not be possible to stop would-be escapees from leaving and he was considering moving them closer to the Cuban border to make their journey easier. </P>
<P> The day after the group of 728 Cubans were moved, some 20 people left the camp, and 38 more escaped Sunday, Granma said. It added that even if escapees swam from the base, they still encountered mined areas before reaching Cuban territory. </P>
<P> Official voluntary repatriations of Cuban rafters were stalled last month by an injunction issued by a Miami judge. A federal appeals court overturned this last Friday, paving the way for a third flight of rafters to Havana. But hundreds more Cubans are waiting passage home and their frustration has been growing. </P>
<P> ``This is the chaotic U.S. policy,'' Granma said. ``While a judge bars voluntary repatriations through the appropriate and safe channels, a general at the base sends these same people into the mine fields.'' </P>
<P> ``We hope to be informed of the official position of the United States government on these facts,'' the newspaper added. </P>
<P> Granma said that responding to Ayres' comments, Cuban authorities contacted the U.S. Interests Section in Havana Thursday, expressing ``incredulity'' at what he had said and asking for clarification. </P>
<P> A clear reply had not yet been given, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> Some 23,000 Cubans have been held in camps at Guantanamo since mid-August when President Clinton reversed a decades-old policy of welcoming Cuban refugees to the United States. A further 9,000 rafters are being held at camps in Panama. </P>
