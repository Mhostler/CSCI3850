<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A former prosecutor accused of covering up the murder of his brother, assassinated senior ruling party official Francisco Ruiz Massieu, deposited almost $7 million in a U.S. bank account last year, the government said Tuesday. </P>
<P> It said in a statement that U.S. customs officials told Mexico that former deputy attorney general Mario Ruiz Massieu's account at Texas Commerce Bank in Houston was boosted with deposits totalling $6.94 million between March and November last year. </P>
<P> Mario Ruiz Massieu led the investigation into the murder of his brother last September but is now himself accused of covering up evidence which pointed to the involvement of Raul Salinas, brother of former President Carlos Salinas. </P>
<P> Ruiz Massieu was arrested by customs agents in the United States last Friday as he attempted to leave on a flight to Spain with $46,000 in cash he had not fully declared. </P>
<P> News reports said Mexican officials solicited U.S. help in nabbing Ruiz Massieu, whom they say was thought to be en route to Monaco. </P>
<P> The attorney general's office in Mexico said it had asked U.S. authorities to hold on to Ruiz Massieu so he can be extradited to face charges in Mexico. His lawyer, however, said Ruiz Massieu will request political asylum in the United States because he fears for his life in Mexico. </P>
<P> He is accused of intimidating witnesses in his brother's murder case and of doctoring evidence to protect Raul Salinas, who was arrested last week and jailed at a maximum security prison outside Mexico City. </P>
<P> The case judge ruled Monday that there is enough evidence for Salinas to go to trial for allegedly ordering the hit against Francisco Ruiz Massieu, who was secretary-general of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party. </P>
<P> Former President Salinas launched, then cancelled a hunger strike last week to clear his name in the case amid allegations he participated in the Ruiz Massieu cover-up. </P>
<P> In the New York Times Tuesday, unidentified government officials said there were indications Mario Ruiz Massieu had briefed Salinas on the investigation while he was still in office. </P>
<P> But following Salinas' announcement he would go on a hunger strike, the government of President Ernesto Zedillo issued a statement saying there was nothing linking the former president to the case. </P>
<P> Prosecutors have not unveiled a motive in the Ruiz Massieu murder, but have said there was a strong personal feud between Raul Salinas and Francisco Ruiz Massieu. Many Mexicans believe Ruiz Massieu was killed because of opposition to his reformist policies. </P>
