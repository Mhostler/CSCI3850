<P>  Rwandan Vice President Paul Kagame accused France on Tuesday of having blocked international aid to his civil war-ravaged homeland. </P>
<P> ``There were clear indications that France was blocking aid to Rwanda and this is what we have learned from different members of different countries, that there was that attempt,'' he told a news conference. </P>
<P> ``At the moment, what is flowing in Rwanda are promises about the assistance, not the assistance itself, so I think we are having more promises than the actual assistance,'' Kagame, a major general who is also defense minister, said in response to a question. </P>
<P> Kagame, on an official visit to the United States at the invitation of Defense Secretary William Perry, did not specify a reason for the alleged interference by France, which had had close relations to Rwanda's former ethnic Hutu-led government. </P>
<P> The Hutu army was defeated in July by the Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF), dominated by the Tutsi minority, whose members tend to speak English rather than French. </P>
<P> The Patriotic Front took power after the killing of up to 1 million Tutsis this spring by extremist Hutus. </P>
<P> Kagame said he had so far been unable to arrange a meeting with French officials to discuss the alleged interference with aid. </P>
<P> ``I think the French seem to have maybe relaxed a bit. I'm not sure because we have not been able to meet and discuss these problems. And we are not the ones to blame for that. I think they've made it very difficult for us to do that,'' he said, referring to holding talks. </P>
<P> A French Embassy spokesman, Jean-Christophe Belliard, dismissed Kagame's criticism as totally unfounded. </P>
<P> ``This came two weeks after we had just given full aid to Rwanda,'' he said in a telephone interview. </P>
<P> Belliard said France was responsible for about one-fifth of a European Union aid package to Rwanda equivalent to $81 million. </P>
