<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Clinton administration, rejecting calls for sharp restraints on its arms exports, Friday announced a policy that would allow it continued wide latitude to sell weapons to U.S. friends and allies. </P>
<P> A set of policy guidelines issued by the White House also presaged an aggressive campaign by officials and diplomats to help U.S. arms makers with overseas sales of approved items in a bid to match the efforts of foreign competitors. </P>
<P> A statement by White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry said the new policy would restrain arms sales that might be destabilizing or threaten regional peace and security. </P>
<P> But, it said: ``The United States continues to view transfers of conventional arms as a legitimate instrument of U.S. foreign policy.'' </P>
<P> McCurry said such sales were ``deserving (of) U.S. government support when they enable us to help friends and allies deter aggression,'' promote regional security and help U.S. and allied forces work together. </P>
<P> Clinton's decision ends an 18-month debate within the administration over whether the United States should be following a more restrained policy toward selling conventional arms, as urged by many private arms control groups. </P>
<P> The Washington Post reported Friday that Clinton had in the end rejected appeals by Democratic lawmakers and the government's own Arms Control and Disarmament Agency calling for tougher restraints on exports. </P>
<P> A senior State Department official, Eric Newsom, made clear there would be no change in export practice, telling reporters the new policy document ``codifies policies over the last two years.'' </P>
<P> Whether the new policy would increase or decrease U.S. arms sales was ``a question impossible to answer'' said Newsom, deputy assistant secretary for political-military affairs. </P>
<P> In the last fiscal year, the United States sold some $12 billion in conventional arms to other nations, a figure little changed from previous years. </P>
<P> But the U.S. share of the global market has grown dramatically as annual world sales have shrunk from around $60 billion to some $30 billion over the last four to five years, largely due to the collapse of Russian arms exports. </P>
<P> The guidelines said the United States would unilaterally curb the flow of arms ``in cases where unilateral action is effective or necessitated by overriding national interests.'' </P>
<P> These could be cases involving ``pariah states,'' cases where the United States wanted to preserve its technological edge or regional security, and transfers involving human rights issues or indiscrimate casualties such as land mines. </P>
<P> But the guidelines did nothing to suggest that sales would be curbed to U.S. allies in the volatile Middle East such as Israel or Saudi Arabia. Officials often argue such sales are stabilizing since they deter aggression by other countries. </P>
<P> Newsom insisted that ``our arms transfer decisions will not be driven by commercial considerations ... (but) will be made fundamentally on national security grounds.'' </P>
<P> But, he said in remarks likely to be well received by U.S. arms manufacturers, once a sale was authorized ``it is important that U.S. defense firms receive the support of the United States government in seeking to make that sale.'' </P>
<P> The administration would be instructing U.S. officials to support marketing efforts by American companies bidding for defense contracts and back up Pentagon participation in international air and defense trade exhibitions. </P>
<P> ``I think it's pretty clear that for other major suppliers around the world their companies have the very active support of their governments at all levels,'' he said. ``Our goal here is simply to level the playing field for American companies.'' </P>
