<P>  China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping has circulation problems and his health could face a ``rapid change'' at any time, one of his physicians was quoted as saying in the latest edition of the German news weekly Der Spiegel. </P>
<P> ``Blood circulation in the brain is no longer fully functional and the heart is also no longer getting enough blood,'' Wu Jieping, described as one of the team of doctors treating 90-year-old Deng, was quoted as saying. </P>
<P> Wu told the magazine, which released the comments Saturday in advance of publication, there could be a ``rapid change'' at any time. </P>
<P> Speculation that Deng may be nearing death has been fanned by his failure to appear at this year's Lunar New Year celebrations, and by comments from his daughter Deng Rong. </P>
<P> In an interview with the New York Times last month, Deng Rong said her father's health was declining by the day, but in a more recent interview she sought to calm intense speculation by denying that he could no longer walk or stand. </P>
<P> Wu told Der Spiegel Deng also suffered from Parkinson's disease, which affects the nervous system. ``Such ailments accumulate at this age,'' he said. </P>
