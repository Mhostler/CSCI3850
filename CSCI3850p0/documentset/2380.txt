<P>  China has asked its neo-Marxist know-it-alls to test their knowledge in a nationwide quiz on the theories of China's paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping. </P>
<P> The winner gets 2,000 yuan, ($235) and gets to assume the role of national ideological model. </P>
<P> The Economic Daily published the 45-question quiz Thursday, one day after bookshops nationwide began selling the heavily-promoted second edition of Deng's selected works. </P>
<P> It invited readers to send in the answers, along with their name, employer and job title, by Dec. 31. Entries will be checked by a high-level committee headed by Yuan Baohua, chief of the prestigious Research Institute for Workers' Ideology. </P>
<P> If there is more than one perfect entry, the champion of Deng Xiaoping Thought will be determined by a lottery. </P>
<P> The winner will have to determine the correct answer to ideological brain-twisters such as: The Chinese Communist Party started from humble beginnings to overcome all obstacles because of A) revolutionary military strength or B) a belief in Marxism and communism. </P>
<P> The correct answers will be revealed in January. </P>
<P> The organizing committee said the quiz was designed to encourage people to study more deeply and better understand Deng's works. </P>
<P> Public enthusiasm for such study, compulsory in the days of Deng's less-pragmatic predecessor, Chairman Mao Tsetung, has waned. </P>
<P> Today most political books similar to Deng's are bought by state enterprises and other official work units using public funds, rather than individuals spending their own savings. </P>
