<DATELINE>BOMBAY, India (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  India deployed thousands of paramilitary troopers in Bombay and elsewhere in the volatile western state of Maharashtra for the second half of crucial assembly polls Sunday. </P>
<P> Some 27 million people were eligible to vote in 139 constituencies, 34 of them in Bombay, the country's financial hub and scene of bloody sectarian violence two years ago. </P>
<P> Success in the polls, one of a series of assembly elections which began in November and will end in mid-March, is widely seen as vital for Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's government. </P>
<P> They will also determine the fate of Maharashtra Chief Minister Sharad Pawar, a Rao rival who staked a claim to the Congress leadership, and thus the prime minister's job, in 1991, in succession to the assassinated Rajiv Gandhi. </P>
<P> Now Pawar is struggling to hold on to power in the state against a formidable rightwing Hindu alliance of the regional Shiv Sena (SS) group and the nation's main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). </P>
<P> A record 75 percent of 26 million voters cast their ballots in the first half of the Maharashtra elections on Thursday. </P>
<P> Bombay police said 3,500 paramilitary troopers were deployed in the state capital along with 3,300 men from the state's reserve police force and about 30,000 regular policemen to ensure peaceful polls. </P>
<P> ``The police have made all possible arrangements for free, fair and smooth functioning of the elections,'' said O.P. Bali, the policeman in charge of law-and-order in Bombay. </P>
<P> ``The city is peaceful and there is no tension,'' he added. </P>
<P> A police spokesman said security forces were taking no chances despite the apparent calm. ``We are particularly watching the sensitive areas of Bombay very closely,'' he said. </P>
<P> He was referring to areas where Hindus, the overwhelming majority of India's 900 million people, and Muslims from the 120-million-strong minority might clash. </P>
<P> One such area was the giant slum of Dharavi, widely reckoned to be Asia's biggest, the spokesman said. </P>
<P> The most emotional issue in Bombay, which had its echo across the state, was a string of bomb blasts in March 1993 which killed 260 people in the city. </P>
<P> Pawar's government has linked the blasts to Bombay's Muslim underworld, saying it wanted revenge for the demolition by Hindu zealots of a mosque in the northern town of Ayodhya in December 1992. The demolition triggered nationwide communal violence. </P>
