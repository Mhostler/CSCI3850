<P>  Cuba's President Fidel Castro and a senior Vatican envoy have discussed Pope John Paul's ideas about the role of the Catholic church in tackling social problems, especially helping the poor, a Cuban newspaper said Sunday. </P>
<P> The Communist youth weekly Juventud Rebelde said the meeting Friday night between Castro and Cardinal Roger Etchegaray took place in a cordial atmosphere. </P>
<P> It occurred near the end of a four-day visit to Cuba by Etchegaray, his third to the island in the last few years. </P>
<P> Juventud Rebelde gave no indication of any possible future visit by the pope to Cuba, the only Latin American state to which he had not yet traveled. </P>
<P> A Communist Party official present at Friday's meeting told reporters the idea of a papal visit was not raised. </P>
<P> Juventud Rebelde said Castro and Etchegaray discussed the Vatican's plans to celebrate with an ecclesiastical jubilee the entry of the third millenium in the year 2000. This would focus on the church's commitment to social problems, particularly directed toward the poor. </P>
<P> Etchegaray also held talks with Cuba's Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina during his visit. </P>
<P> Cuba's government had moved to improve relations with the Catholic church and other religious organizations. But differences persist between the government and the Cuban Catholic hierarchy about how much of a role and voice the church should have in the country's social and political life. </P>
<P> The archbishop of Havana, Msgr. Jaime Ortega, was recently made a cardinal by the Vatican. </P>
