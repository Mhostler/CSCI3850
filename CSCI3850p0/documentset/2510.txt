<P>  Russian nationalist and politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky breezed into the United Nations Wednesday and said it was a better place 15 or 20 years ago. </P>
<P> He also denied he had ever been a KGB agent -- although he would have liked to have been one -- or that he was either anti-Semitic or half-Jewish. But he said he would be happy to embrace a Jewish parent if one could be found for him. </P>
<P> ``I must say that I don't particularly like the policy pursued in the United Nations in recent years. That policy was more positive in its consequences 15 to 20 years ago,'' he told a news conference of the U.N. Correspondents Association. </P>
<P> ``I am against embargoes being imposed, as they have been imposed against Iraq, Libya, former Yugoslavia,'' he said, speaking mostly through an interpreter. </P>
<P> Embargoes did not harm the leadership of target countries while women, children and the sick suffered, he said. </P>
<P> ``If I were president of Russia, the Russian representative...would use his power of veto against any embargoes, against blockade against any state in the world.'' </P>
<P> Zhirinovsky, who has a reputation for being anti-Semitic, said people blamed journalists ``who represent the Jewish minority'' for welcoming the destruction of the Soviet state, while new businesses in Russia were ``headed mostly by Jews, and a lot of the population understand that most of the money in these banks or structures are dirty money.'' </P>
<P> ``But this is not our position,'' he stressed. ``This is the understanding of the people,'' he added, according to his interpreter. But a Russian-speaker present said he actually used the phrase: ``This is the objective reality.'' </P>
<P> Regarding reports he once worked for the KGB intelligence apparatus, he said: ``I have never been a KGB agent. I'd like to have been. But only communists were recruited as KGB agents and the KGB personnel were 100 percent communist.'' </P>
<P> Questioned about his ethnic origins, he replied: ``Many people say that one of my parents is a Jew. I am not aware of that. My parents are both Russians. If you find me a Jewish parent I would be happy to embrace him, to kiss him, but unfortuantely all my relatives are Russians. </P>
<P> As for his own political prospects, he said, ``We will take take part in the presidential elections. The current leadership in Russia is making gross mistakes.'' </P>
