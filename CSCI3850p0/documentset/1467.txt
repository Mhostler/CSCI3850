<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Virginia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The United States claimed the inaugural Presidents Cup Sunday when Fred Couples won the competition's ``dream match'' against Nick Price with a conceded birdie putt on the 18th hole. </P>
<P> Couples gave the Americans an insurmountable lead in the three-day international competition against the International team after four of his teammates had won their individual matches on a windy day filled with exciting golf. </P>
<P> Still suffering from a back ailment that limited his participation in this Ryder Cup-like event, Couples hit his nine iron approach on the 429-yard last hole to within two feet with his match with Price all square. </P>
<P> The Zimbabwean, lying two just off the green, conceded Couples' putt and then just missed the chip shot which would have kept the match going. </P>
<P> ``It was great shot, but that's the way golf is,'' Price said of Couples' approach, which landed on the elevated back right side of the green and almost rolled into the hole. </P>
<P> ``I just hit a lucky shot where I was trying to hit the bank (on the green) and it rolled to the hole,'' Couples said of his winning shot in the dream match-up of the day. </P>
<P> ``I had a great time playing with Nick,'' Couples said. ``I wanted to play him. I thought it would make me play better. </P>
<P> ``But I really didn't care what happened in our match as long as the team won.'' </P>
<P> Couples' 1-up victory gave the U.S. team 17 points out of a possible 32, ensuring that they will hold the big gold and silver cup until this event is staged again in two years. </P>
<P> The U.S. side eventually prevailed 20-12 in the 32 matches played over three days. </P>
<P> Before Couples' dramatic come-from-behind victory the U.S. side had been all but assured of winning the cup when Jay Haas, Jim Gallagher, playing captain Hale Irwin and Jeff Maggert won their individual matches. </P>
<P> ``It was a fantastic display of golf,'' Irwin said after he contributed to the victory with a 1-up triumph over Australian Robert Allenby. </P>
<P> The Americans might have clinched earlier in the day if the event had used the same format as the Ryder Cup, but four matches that ended 18 holes all square went into sudden death, rather than giving each side one half point. </P>
<P> Of the 12 matches, Americans eventually won six, International players two and the other four were declared halved after the cup was decided. </P>
<P> However, that was no indication of how close the competition was throughout, especially Sunday. </P>
<P> Of the dozen singles matches, eight went to the 18th hole -- or farther -- and several of the U.S. victories came when the Americans overcame deficits on the back nine holes of the Robert Trent Jones Golf Club. </P>
<P> In addition to Couples' 1-up defeat of Price -- leaving the International team's brightest star without a victory -- Davis Love rallied to beat Australian Steve Elkington 1-up with birdies on the last two holes. </P>
<P> ``It was close all the way until the end,'' Love said of his battle with Elkington, in which neither player was ever more than one hole ahead. </P>
<P> ``I was pushimg hard to try to catch up,'' added Love, who was 1 down before winning birdies on the last two holes. </P>
<P> Couples, who played only morning matches the first two days because of his back, birdied three of the last five holes to catch Price, who had been 3 up after nine holes. </P>
<P> ``We had a really great match,'' Price said. ``I think we both played the same high standard of golf.'' </P>
<P> Australians Peter Senior and Craig Parry registered the International side's only victories in the 12 singles. </P>
<P> Senior won the first three holes and coasted to a 3 and 2 victory over John Huston while Parry came back from an early two-hole deficit to beat Corey Pavin 1 up. </P>
<P> Pavin, a veteran Ryder Cup player and a renowned match-play competitor, played surprisingly poorly against Parry in the last pairing of the day. </P>
<P> The International side, which had lost the first seven matches of the competition Friday, was given a psychological boost Sunday by Greg Norman, who had to withdraw from the team last week with an intestinal illness. </P>
<P> Norman, the No. 2 ranked player in the world, rode the long, hilly golf course on a cart with his wife, cheering on his teammates. </P>
<P> ``His presence meant a lot to the team,'' said Price, the world's top-ranked player, who had to carry much of the burden for his team after Norman withdrew. </P>
<P> ``It was too bad that Greg couldn't play,'' Couples said. ''I thought it was great seeing him.'' </P>
<P> However, despite that inspiration and some excellent play by the visitors, the Americans somehow found ways to win. </P>
<P> ``Where are all those guys who said we were favored this week,'' Price wondered. </P>
