<P>  Kermit the Frog is to follow in the footsteps of Mother Teresa and former President Ronald Reagan and address Oxford University's famed debating society. </P>
<P> He will talk about life, love and the environment -- but he does not intend raising the delicate subject of Miss Piggy, the Muppet character who pursues him on television and in films. </P>
<P> ``His life has been the university of life and he wants to talk about it,'' Adrienne Garner, spokeswoman for Jim Henson Productions told Reuters Tuesday. ``He is the original green, having lived in a swamp. He is close to environmental concerns.'' </P>
<P> But she said: ``Kermit and Miss Piggy are just professional colleagues. Anything between them is in her mind and not his.'' </P>
<P> Kermit, with a little help from puppeteer Steve Whitmire, plans to speak for about 20 minutes during his October 27 address at one of Britain's most famous universities. But Kermit is not overawed by the Oxford Union. ``He was at Bill Clinton's inaugural and has been mixing in illustrious company for most of his career,'' Garner said. </P>
