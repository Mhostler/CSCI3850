<DATELINE>PARIS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  His political career in shreds after his election defeat, French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur Thursday made his last official call at the Elysee presidential palace he once looked certain to conquer. </P>
<P> Outgoing socialist President Francois Mitterrand accepted his resignation and asked him to stay on as caretaker until a replacement chosen by conservative President-elect Jacques Chirac takes over next week. </P>
<P> Balladur, who tumbled in four months from runaway favorite to a first-round presidential election defeat, was quiet as he left after the 35-minute meeting. Poker-faced, he waved to cameras and said, ``Goodbye.'' </P>
<P> A retinue of 10 Republican guards in flamboyant, full-dress military uniform saluted -- a special courtesy from the president, Elysee sources said. </P>
<P> ``I thank you for the work accomplished over these two years in difficult circumstances,'' Mitterrand said in answer to Balladur's resignation in letters exchanged Wednesday and then released by the president's office. </P>
<P> Chirac continued consultations to form a government, likely to be headed by Foreign Minister Alain Juppe. </P>
<P> Elysee sources said Mitterrand, 78, would hand over to his 62-year-old successor next Wednesday or Thursday, ending his record 14-year tenure with a simple ceremony without any speeches. </P>
<P> Balladur gave Le Monde newspaper a glowing account of his 26-month tenure, saying the situation ``was worse than anyone had imagined'' when he took power. </P>
<P> ``In two years, France has gone from deep recession to healthy, non-inflationist, job-creating growth,'' he said in an interview. </P>
<P> Reflecting with some bitterness on his defeat without ever mentioning Chirac's name, he said many voters failed to perceive the reforms he had carried out.  In remarks which sounded like a political testament, he told Le Monde that the war in Bosnia, resumption of nuclear tests and currency stability were the main issues facing the next government. </P>
<P> He said France must tell the United Nations that it would definitely pull its 4,800 peacekeepers out of former Yugoslavia if the warring parties failed to recognize each other and agree on a lasting cease-fire within the next two months. </P>
<P> Balladur added that despite efforts to achieve computer-simulated nuclear tests, France was likely to need to break a three-year moratorium and carry out some nuclear tests. </P>
<P> ``We'll need to say how many and over what period,'' he said. </P>
<P> He also said most of the world's economic problems in the past 20 years had been caused by monetary upheavals, and the European Union needed to adapt its monetary system to achieve currency stability among those members who could not join the single currency. </P>
<P> ``Barring this, the single (EU) market will explode,'' he said. </P>
<P> The former Chirac protege who irritated the president-elect by running against him, said that, barring exceptional circumstances, he would be silent until the fall. He would then seek to regain his seat in the National Assembly in a Paris special election. </P>
<P> ``I will not be the first former premier sitting in the National Assembly. Nor the last,'' he said. </P>
<P> Aides said he also would run for the Paris city council in municipal elections next month and create a political think-tank, as he did while in opposition from 1988 to 1993. </P>
