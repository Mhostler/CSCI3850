<P>  Democracy parties staved off a strong challenge from pro-Beijing candidates to emerge victorious in Hong Kong's last municipal elections before the 1997 handover to China, voting returns showed Monday. </P>
<P> Sunday's elections were marked by a strong turnout, despite China's pledge to abolish all elected tiers of government set up by Britain at the end of its 150 years of colonial rule. </P>
<P> The Democratic Party, whose leaders were denounced by China as traitors in the aftermath of the 1989 Tiananmen killings, won 23 seats against eight taken by the main pro-Beijing party, the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB). </P>
<P> ``It shows China should listen more to the people of Hong Kong,'' said Democratic Party co-founder Szeto Wah after his win in a tough battle against long-serving Elsie Tu, one of the DAB's stars. </P>
<P> For both sides, the elections were less about mundane municipal affairs such as garbage collection and public hygiene, than a dress rehearsal for September's Legislative Council elections to the highest of Hong Kong's three tiers of representative government. </P>
<P> China has pledged to abolish the new Legislative Council even before its scheduled five-year term has expired. </P>
<P> The turnout was about 40 percent higher than in the previous municipal elections in 1991. </P>
<P> A smaller pro-democracy party, the Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood, which advocates a less confrontational attitude to China than the Democratic Party, won eight out of the nine seats it contested, giving a significant lead to the democracy camp. </P>
<P> Seven of the 59 constituencies were uncontested. Independents won the remaining seats. </P>
