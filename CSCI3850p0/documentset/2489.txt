<P>  Tax-wary Florida voters approved a state constitutional amendment to limit revenue increases Tuesday. </P>
<P> With nearly half of the precincts counted, yes votes for Amendment 2 held steady at 60 percent, according to figures from the state Division of Elections. </P>
<P> Under the proposal, revenue growth for any year cannot exceed the average growth rate in personal income over the previous five years. </P>
<P> ``The electorate clearly has a continued belief that government needs to be limited in terms of size and scope,'' said Mike Johnson, an analyst for Kidder Peabody and Co Inc. </P>
<P> He said the flurry of revenue-limiting amendments on the state ballots this year may be linked to anti-incumbent fervor. </P>
<P> ``There are a lot of gubernatorial, senatorial races, a lot of nasty elections. People are throwing out tax issues as a weapon,'' he said. ``The opponents of the limits have a difficult time explaining why they're against limiting taxes. The messages are very emotional.'' </P>
<P> The Florida measure exempts revenues pledged to bonds, and allows the Legislature to override the limit with a two-thirds vote. </P>
<P> Municipal bond analysts predicted the measure would have no immediate effect on Florida's credit rating, but they said the limits could have an impact eventually if the fast-growing state cannot raise the money it needs for roads and schools. </P>
<P> ``It does place some limits on the flexibility of state government,'' Johnson said. </P>
