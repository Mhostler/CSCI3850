<P>  Friends and rivals in the sport of diving reacted with shock and sympathy to the news that former Olympic champion Greg Louganis was stricken with AIDS. </P>
<P> ``It is pretty devastating to all of us,'' said Kent Ferguson, 3-meter springboard world champion. ``For me, it's particularly devastating because Greg is a hero, somebody I've always looked up to.'' </P>
<P> Ferguson, a former teammate of Louganis's on the U.S. national team, said: ``I care about him as a very good friend. I think it's good for him to talk about it so he can live his life in freedom, free from worry and fear.'' </P>
<P> Louganis, in an interview to be broadcast on ABC television Friday, revealed he knew he had the deadly virus six months before the 1988 Seoul Olympics. Even after cracking his head on a diving board during the competition, Louganis decided to continue and swept the golds. </P>
<P> ``Greg never would have done anything to put any other diver at risk. That's not his makeup,'' Ferguson said. ``The fact that (U.S. coach) Ron O'Brien agreed with Louganis validates it even more.'' </P>
<P> Dr Sammy Lee, Louganis's diving coach during troubled adolescent years in which he battled depression, alcoholism, suicide tries and dyslexia, said: ``He's a fighter and he will fight this like he has fought everything else bad in his life. </P>
<P> ``This doesn't take away from the fact he is the greatest diver ever in the history of the sport.'' </P>
<P> Italian platform gold medallist Klaus Dibiasi watched a 16-year-old Louganis claim silver on the platform at the 1976 Olympics and emerge as his heir apparent. </P>
<P> ``It is a very sad day in diving...very sad,'' Dibiasi said. ''He is a great man and an incredible ambassador for diving.'' </P>
<P> Ron O'Brien, seven-time Olympic coach and one of Louganis's closest friends, who knew that Louganis had tested positive for the AIDS virus before the Seoul Games, declined comment. </P>
<P> ``This guy is the greatest and most well-known performer in the sport,'' O'Brien said. ``I am honoring his wishes not to say anything until the show airs.'' </P>
<P> ``Greg was the ideal teammate, he was always putting us first. We love and respect him. He would not have endangered the lives of others if he thought he could contaminate other people,'' she said. </P>
<P> International Swimming Hall of Fame executive director Sam Freas said Louganis's place in diving history is secure. </P>
<P> ``He's the greatest diver of all time and a heck of a person,'' said Freas. ``He deserves any recognition he gets because he's a great person. </P>
<P> ``I pray that a miracle takes place.'' </P>
