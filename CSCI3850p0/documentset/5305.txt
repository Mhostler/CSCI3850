<P>  Russia's main state-owned broadcaster is to split into separate television and radio companies in the latest stage of a controversial media shake-up following the killing of star TV journalist Vladislav Listyev. </P>
<P> Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin met leaders of the huge state company for two hours Wednesday to discuss the changes, under which the main state-owned television network is to be replaced April 1 by the part-privatized Public Russian Television. </P>
<P> ``The common view was that it was expedient to split Ostankino into television and radio companies,'' Valentin Lazutkin, head of the Federal Television and Radio Broadcasting Service, which oversees the development of broadcasting, told a news conference. </P>
<P> The aim was to break up the monopoly, inherited from the past, which kept numerous radio and television channels under one roof, Lazutkin said. </P>
<P> The radio company would remain a state-owned broadcaster while Ostankino television would mainly produce programs for Public Russian Television. </P>
<P> Under a decree issued by President Boris Yeltsin last November, the state is to retain a 51 percent controlling stake in Public Russian Television. </P>
<P> Ostankino is to have nine percent and eight private shareholders, including banks and an industrial company, are to have the balance. </P>
<P> Lazutkin said the state could not afford to fund broadcasting on its own. </P>
<P> ``It is simply not possible to develop television further based only on the budget and without involving Russian capital in this huge state and social affair,'' Lazutkin said. </P>
<P> The planned shake-up was thrown into crisis March 1 when Listyev, the new-look network's executive director, was gunned down in an apparent contract killing outside his home. </P>
<P> Many linked the killing of Listyev, who was also a hugely popular talk-show host, to the new-look network's decision to ban advertising for an unspecified period. </P>
<P> Media and advertising executives have said the company's aim appeared to be to bring advertising under the network's direct control, cutting out middlemen who made huge sums by reselling airtime to advertisers. </P>
<P> Russia faces parliamentary elections in December and a presidential poll next year and several political and commercial groupings have been seeking stakes in the media. </P>
<P> In a country the size of Russia, television is by far the most effective means of mass communication. </P>
<P> Lazutkin said both Ostankino and Public Russian Television were committed to working together to develop broadcasting. </P>
<P> ``We all have one aim, one task, one concern -- to preserve all that is best in central television, in Ostankino and in what the viewers like,'' said Lazutkin. </P>
<P> The transformation of Ostankino has also sparked fears among staff about their future and that of national television. </P>
<P> Ostankino Deputy General Director Grigory Shevelyov said preliminary agreement had been reached under which a guaranteed proportion of the company's production would be used by the new network. </P>
