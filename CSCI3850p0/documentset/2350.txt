<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Clinton administration has decided to increase U.S. financial aid to Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic by $10 million a year in a bid to encourage the peace process, the Washington Post reported Wednesday. </P>
<P> The newspaper, quoting a senior White House official, said President Clinton would also host an Irish trade and development conference in Philadelphia in April. </P>
<P> The official said the economic incentive package was intended to be Washington's response to the cease-fires declared by both sides, which have brought a fragile calm to the region. </P>
<P> The administration's aim is to ``get in on the ground and show both sides the benefits of peace as soon as possible. These guys need jobs,'' the official said. </P>
<P> The White House plans to increase the U.S. contribution to the International Development Fund for Ireland by $10 million a year to $30 million, beginning in fiscal year 1996. </P>
<P> The April conference will include representatives of the Irish and British governments, political leaders from both countries and the U.S. business community. </P>
<P> It will follow on the heels of a December economic development conference in Belfast, to which U.S. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown is leading a U.S. delegation. </P>
