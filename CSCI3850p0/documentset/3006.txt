<P>  Nigeria's military government should be penalized with broad sanctions such as those that helped end apartheid in South Africa, Nobel Prize-winning author Wole Soyinka said Monday. </P>
<P> Soyinka, who fled Nigeria last month because his arrest was imminent, said he will meet with world leaders in the next two months to call for ``serious sanctions'' against Gen. Sani Abacha, who seized power a year ago. </P>
<P> Soyinka, who won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1986, was at the Carter Center in Atlanta for a meeting of a new Human Rights Council convened by former President Jimmy Carter. </P>
<P> ``We'll be asking for the total isolation of the Abacha regime,'' Soyinka said. ``We'll be asking for a boycott wherever possible of trading relations. We shall be moving eventually to even demanding, especially from sister African nations, cultural and even sporting boycotts.'' </P>
<P> Soyinka said Nigeria's economy is so weak that the average person already believes the country is the target of an economic boycott. </P>
<P> ``Abacha plans to stay in power until the end of this century,'' Soyinka said, calling the military ruler ``a really incompetent and very ungifted individual whose only understanding of a nation is power, control, domination.'' </P>
<P> Soyinka said ``storms are gathering'' around Abacha's military rule in Nigeria. ``Nigerians are not fools, and they will sooner or later resist in the only way and terminate the existence of his regime,'' he said. </P>
