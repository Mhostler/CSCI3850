<P>  U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright Tuesday will take over the rotating presidency of the U.N. Security Council for the month of November. </P>
<P> One of the first orders of business will be a U.S.-drafted resolution to lift an arms embargo against Bosnia in six months. The measure is expected to be brought to a vote next week. </P>
<P> Unless the resolution is changed considerably, the draft is virtually certain to be defeated because it does not have the nine votes needed for passage in the 15-member council, diplomats say. Even if it did, Russia could veto its adoption. </P>
<P> Albright takes over from Ambassador Sir David Hannay of the United Kingdom. The presidency rotates monthly according to the English alphabet. </P>
