<P>  Massachusetts Gov. William Weld, a rare Republican in this largely Democratic state, swept to a landslide election victory Tuesday despite facing a member of the famous Roosevelt family, local radio and television stations said. </P>
<P> Weld, a moderate Republican riding on the strength of the economic recovery in the state, easily swept aside Mark Roosevelt, whose biggest asset is his name, WBZ Radio and WCVB- TV said. </P>
<P> A social moderate who supports gay rights and abortion, Weld has also lobbied for reintroduction of the death penalty in Massachusetts. He is also a fiscal conservative who has cut many of the state's lavish programs. </P>
<P> Weld's strong win will fuel speculation on his chances as a presidential candidate in 1996. </P>
<P> But he played down those speculations Tuesday night. ''I'm wrapped up with Massachusetts issues now,'' he said shortly after early returns projected him as the winner. ``My plan is to work in Massachusetts.'' </P>
<P> In a sense, the gubernatorial race was a blood fued. Roosevelt, a state legislator, is the great-grandson of former President Theodore Roosevelt and distant cousin of President Franklin Roosevelt. </P>
<P> The red-haired, 6-foot 4-inch Weld can also claim a relationship to the illustrious Roosevelt family: his wife Susan is a great granddaughter of Theodore Roosevelt. </P>
<P> ``If we do win this election with anything like a good margin, I think it's just going to give more 'oompf' to that drive for tougher anti-crime measures, work requirement for welfare,'' Weld told reporters at his Boston campaign headquarters. </P>
<P> Polls consistently showed Weld with a strong lead over the young challenger. </P>
<P> Weld television advertisements attacked Roosevelt for missing key votes in the state legislature and for running up a heavy expense account. </P>
