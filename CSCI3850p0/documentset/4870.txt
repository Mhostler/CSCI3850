<P>  Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Sunday he would take no further part in administration discussions on a controversial oil deal between a U.S. oil firm and Iran because of possible conflict of interest. </P>
<P> Christopher told reporters accompanying him to Saudi Arabia that he had made the decision after learning that the company, Conoco Inc., had hired a Los Angeles law firm of which he was formerly chairman. </P>
<P> The decision will remove from the debate one of the sharpest critics of a deal disclosed last week whereby Conoco Iran NV, a Dutch affiliate of the Houston-based Conoco, will develop Iranian offshore oil and gas fields in the Gulf. </P>
<P> Only last Thursday Christopher attacked the deal, said to be worth up to $1 billion, as inconsistent with Washington's policy of countering what he called the ``evil hand of Iran.'' </P>
<P> Christopher said he subsequently learned that Conoco had retained the law firm O'Melveny and Myers, of which he was chairman before being appointed secretary of state in 1993, to represent it in the affair. </P>
<P> ``When I learned that, I asked that I no longer be briefed on the subject and I have asked the legal adviser (to the State Department) to draw up an appropriate recusal so that I do not participate in that,'' Christopher said. </P>
<P> ``Recusal'' is a legal term meaning withdrawal from a given issue. Christopher said he would continue to discuss Iran policy in general but not the Conoco deal or other such deals. </P>
<P> ``I take a very conservative position on conflict matters,'' said Christopher, who noted that he still had what he called a ``retirement interest'' in the law firm. </P>
<P> The Conoco deal is the first of its kind between Iran and a U.S. firm since the U.S.-backed Shah of Iran was ousted in 1979 by an Islamic regime strongly hostile to Washington. </P>
<P> The administration has said the deal is not illegal but it is studying how to handle what has turned out to be a serious embarrassment for its policy of ``containing'' Iran. </P>
<P> Present U.S. law allows American companies to buy Iranian oil, though not to sell it in the United States. </P>
<P> Iran is near the top of the U.S. list of ``rogue nations,'' accused by Washington of sponsoring terrorism, trying to sabotage the Middle East peace process and seeking to acquire nuclear weapons. </P>
<P> ``Wherever you look, you find the evil hand of Iran in this region,'' Christopher said in Tel Aviv last Thursday. </P>
<P> State Department officials played down the impact of Christopher's decision, and one said both President Clinton and National Security Adviser Tony Lake shared Christopher's strong views on Iran. </P>
<P> ``We're not too worried that by recusing himself, this is going to weaken the administration's line on Iran,'' said one official who asked not to be identified. </P>
<P> Christopher's Chief of Staff Thomas Donilon, who also once worked for O'Melveny and Myers but has now severed all connection with the firm, said he would also be signing recusal papers. </P>
