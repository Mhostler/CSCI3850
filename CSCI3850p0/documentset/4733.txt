<P>  Colombia, which has called for a hemispheric summit on narcotics trafficking, will insist drug-consuming countries act to cut local drug demand, the country's justice minister said in a published interview. </P>
<P> ``This fight can't be won by only controlling supply,'' said Nestor Humberto Martinez in an interview published Sunday by the Bogota daily El Espectador. ``We are going to have a more aggressive policy in demanding international cooperation.'' </P>
<P> The minister's comments come a day after Colombia and two other countries -- that together produce most of the world's coca leaves and cocaine -- rejected U.S. criticism that they weren't doing enough to fight drug trafficking. </P>
<P> The joint statement issued by Colombia, Bolivia and Peru Saturday rejected the partial certification the countries received from the U.S. government as cooperating countries in the drug war and demanded an hemispheric summit on the problem later this year. </P>
<P> ``Some of the criticism formulated are inexact and unjust and shows us that it is necessary to overcome unknowing and uncomprehending attitudes regarding the fight in which we are involved,'' said the statement, signed by the presidents of the three countries and Paraguay. </P>
<P> Last Wednesday, the U.S. government said it was dissatisfied with efforts made by the four countries to eradicate drug plantations, destroy laboratories and capture traffickers. It said it would certify them for economic aid in their war on the illegal trade, but only because it was of ''national interest'' to do so. </P>
<P> The U.S. Congress has 30 days to approve the government's recommendations on certification, which include more than 20 other countries. </P>
<P> But Colombia, Bolivia and Peru insisted in the statement that although they were doing all they could to fight drug trafficking they would not be able to defeat the problem alone. </P>
<P> ``The fight against drug trafficking is a shared responsibility,'' it said. ``We have to keep working together in this task that involves all of humanity.'' </P>
<P> Colombia has often criticized consumer countries like the United States for fighting the drug war in other countries and not on their own streets where the demand -- considered the real problem -- lies. </P>
<P> The U.S. government scolded Colombia last Wednesday for failing to capture any major drug traffickers since last year's well-publicized shooting death of Pablo Escobar, head of the defunct Medellin cartel. </P>
<P> But one day later, Colombian announced the arrest of one of the leaders of the Cali cartel, which has come to control more than 70 percent of cocaine smuggled to the United States following the demise of the rival Medellin cartel. </P>
<P> The last summit on drug trafficking was held in San Antonio, Texas, in the U.S. in 1992. </P>
<P> The issue was briefly discussed at the Summit of the Americas in Miami last December. </P>
