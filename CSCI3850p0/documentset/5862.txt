<P>  A former Guatemalan defense minister who faces a $47.5 million fine in the United States for alleged army atrocities committed under his command said Wednesday the U.S. government had canceled an invitation for him to attend a military conference in Miami. </P>
<P> Retired Gen. Hector Gramajo said U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry ``withdrew'' an invitation to attend a conference organized by the U.S. Southern Command next Monday. </P>
<P> He blamed the decision on pressure groups ``with ideological orientation'' in the United States who had protested his participation at the conference. </P>
<P> Gramajo had been invited by the U.S. Southern Command to attend a seminar on continental military strategy. </P>
<P> A U.S. federal court last week ordered him to pay damages for his alleged responsibility in the killing of thousands of Guatemalans between 1986 and 1990 and the rape and torture of a U.S. nun. </P>
<P> Gramajo has rejected the charges and Wednesday called on the U.S. Embassy to make public the results of its investigation into the 1989 abduction of Sister Dianna Ortiz. </P>
<P> He described himself as the victim of an ``international trap'' to damage the Guatemalan army. </P>
<P> Gramajo studied at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government and is a candidate in presidential elections to be held in October or November this year. </P>
<P> Guatemala's powerful army has already taken a battering recently following allegations in the United States of secret links with the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. </P>
