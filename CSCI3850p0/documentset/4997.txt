<P>  The first working session of the United Nations International Seabed Authority ended Friday with delegates from 160 countries failing to resolve differences over the group's ruling council. </P>
<P> The meeting, which began here Feb. 27, was expected to result in decisions on the rules and makeup of the 36-member council, appointment of a finance committee and naming of the ISA's first secretary-general. </P>
<P> But disagreement over how to divide up the membership of the council stymied all the conference's deliberations. </P>
<P> The international body was created to oversee use of the world's seabed resources and settle disputes over territorial waters. </P>
<P> A proposal from Sudan, in which council seats would be allocated proportionally according to each region's membership in the U.N. General Assembly, was accepted in principle but bogged down in the mechanics of implementation. </P>
<P> The plan would have given Africa and Asia the most seats, and Western Europe and North America the fewest. </P>
<P> Developing countries had argued for a larger presence based on the effort they put into making the ISA a reality. Industrialized nations said they needed a larger presence due to their economic importance and funding obligations. </P>
<P> Because of the failure to reach consensus on membership, the conference had little time to approve the council's rules and name a leader. The rules were presented for a vote Thursday, but some delegations said they needed more time. </P>
<P> The issues of the council membership and rules and the naming of a secretary-general will be put off until the ISA's next meeting this August in Kingston. </P>
<P> Three candidates are vying for secretary-general: former Tanzanian Prime Minister Joseph Warioba, Satya Nandan of Fiji, and an undeclared candidate, Kenneth Rattray of Jamaica. </P>
