<P>  Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr is investigating the White House's role in securing a job last month for the wife of former Associate Attorney General Webster Hubbell, a cooperating witness in the overall investigation, The Washington Post reported Wednesday. </P>
<P> The paper said Starr was looking into the circumstances surrounding Suzanna Hubbell's rehiring to a $59,000 job at the Interior Department after an 11-month leave of absence. </P>
<P> Her husband pleaded guilty in December to felony fraud and tax charges and agreed to cooperate with Starr's investigation. </P>
<P> The probe centers on whether the failed Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association improperly funneled money into President Clinton's 1984 re-election campaign when he was governor or into Whitewater Development Corp., a money-losing real estate venture partly owned by the Clintons. </P>
<P> White House and Interior Department officials have said that the White House was consulted by senior Interior staffers to see if they had any objections to Suzanna Hubbell's returning to to work there. </P>
<P> Sen. Lauch Faircloth, R-N.C., has raised questions about the involvement of senior presidential aide Bruce Lindsey, himself a subject of Starr's investigation. </P>
<P> Hubbell left her position on the staff of Interior Secretary Bruce Babbbitt in March 1994 after her husband resigned his post at the Justice Department to deal with his legal problems. </P>
