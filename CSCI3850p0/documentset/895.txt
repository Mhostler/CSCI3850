<P>  United Nations officials Friday were at odds over the fate of rebel Muslim leader Fikret Abdic who reportedly had surrendered and agreed to give up his weapons. </P>
<P> ``Fikret Abdic has surrendered,'' said Major Dacre Holloway in Sarajevo. </P>
<P> But in Zagreb, U.N. spokesman Paul Risley said: ``Abdic did not surrender. It is premature to say it happened. It may happen, it may happen soon, but he did not surrender yet.'' </P>
<P> Abdic himself, speaking by telephone from his stronghold in Velika Kladusa, denied he had given up and said the United Nations report was ``incorrect and malicious.'' </P>
<P> ``I did not surrender. We are going to have talks tomorrow,'' said Abdic. ``We gave our concrete suggestions for tomorrow's talks, and the UN must have misinterpreted a part of them that is designed to bring us to a peaceful solution,'' the embattled leader said. </P>
<P> Forces loyal to Sarajevo who have been fighting Abdic since the breakaway leader split over his willingness to deal with the Serbs, Wednesday demanded that Abdic's troops surrender. </P>
<P> Abdic defiantly rejected the ultimatum Thursday evening. </P>
<P> Risley said that Fifth Corps troops of the Bosnian government army were now within one mile of Abdic's headquarters in Velika Kladusa after a swift advance Friday into what little remains of rebel-controlled territory. </P>
<P> Talks were due to be held Saturday, which a high Bosnian government official will attend, said Risley. </P>
<P> ``It is hoped that they will be able to negotiate a peaceful resolution of this conflict,'' he said. </P>
