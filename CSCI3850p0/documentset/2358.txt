<P>  Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Wednesday he would make another Mideast trip at the end of November but declined to predict when he thought a peace agreement between Syria and Israel might be reached. </P>
<P> Christopher, while continuing to claim movement in Israel-Syrian negotiations as a result of President Clinton's recently concluded trip to the region, said nevertheless that wide gaps remain between Damascus and Jerusalem. </P>
<P> He spoke to reporters and editors at the Washington bureau of the Los Angeles Times during a session that was televised live on C-Span. </P>
<P> Christopher, who just returned from the Middle East Tuesday and leaves next Monday on an 11-day trip to Asia, said he planned to return to the Middle East ``shortly after Thanksgiving,'' which is Nov. 24. </P>
<P> ``Negotiations between Syria and Israel are very difficult negotiations ... in part because of the strong leadership qualities of leaders of both countries,'' Israeli Prime Minister Yithzak Rabin and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, he said. </P>
<P> ``You have two of the thoughest negotiators in the world facing each other ... I think both would like to achieve a peace agreement but they won't give anything away.'' </P>
<P> At one time officials indicated an Israel-Syrian agreement -- which hinges on Israel's willingness to give back the strategic Golan Heights seized from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war -- might be possible by year's end. </P>
<P> But Christopher, who has been mediating between Rabin and Assad, said when asked to fix a timeline that he could not do so and added: ``There is some distance to go.'' </P>
<P> He insisted, however, that while he was not at liberty to discuss specifics, ``I think the president (Clinton) did move some things along'' when he visited the Middle East last week, including a stop with Assad in Damasacus. </P>
