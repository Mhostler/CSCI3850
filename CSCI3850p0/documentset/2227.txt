<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Between 100,000 and 2 million barrels of heavy crude oil are seeping through a Russian Arctic river in a spill that could be up to eight times as big as the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska, an Energy Department official said Tuesday. </P>
<P> Deputy Energy Secretary Bill White said officials of Russia's Komi province near the Barents Sea put the spill at some 100,000 barrels. </P>
<P> But a U.S. oil service company at the site gauged the spill at 2 million barrels, which would be eight times the amount spilled from the Exxon Valdez in Alaska, he said. </P>
<P> ``The size of the spill we can't get ascertained,'' White said at a news briefing. But he said the company, which he did not identify, felt the 2 million barrel estimate ``was plausible.'' </P>
<P> Oil from the spill will damage the fragile Arctic environment, he said, citing estimates that the oil spill could reach the Arctic Ocean by spring. </P>
<P> ``Life within the river is endangered by an oil slick of this size,'' White said, showing a film the department had just received of burning oil on a tributary of the Pechora River near the remote city of Usinsk. ``It takes a long time for the Arctic environment to recuperate.'' </P>
<P> The United States has offered to send a team of experts to help in the clean-up but has not yet received a response from Russia, he said. </P>
<P> White later told PBS' MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour that a few U.S. officials would head to Russia on the first plane from London Wednesday ``to assess the damage and come up with a plan.'' </P>
<P> ``There is not much precedent in dealing with a large amount of oil in an Arctic river,'' White said, adding that the river is expected to freeze in about two weeks. </P>
<P> White showed footage from what he called a ``bootlegged video-tape'' brought from Russia within the last 48 hours. </P>
<P> Footage that White said apparently was taken in February showed a lake of oil behind an earthen dam, which failed in heavy rains earlier this month. </P>
<P> ``We understand that the leaks have been occurring since February of this year,'' he said. ``We received reports that the pipeline had numerous leaks. Some had been patched. Some had not been patched, and that where there was leaking oil, that oil was held behind a dam that was built of earth.'' </P>
<P> The film also showed oil burning in the river, which apparently had been set afire intentionally in ``attempts to slow the spill once it has migrated into the river.'' </P>
<P> He said the pipeline in the province is operated by a state company, Komineft. </P>
<P> A Western oil company gauged the size of the slick at 3 feet deep, six to seven miles long and 39 feet wide, White said. </P>
<P> The Russian Embassy late Tuesday issued a statement that a team of specialists from its Ministry for Emergency Situations was to go to the region immediately to help local authorities clean up the spill. </P>
<P> The statement said clean-up work was suspended Oct. 18 because of cold and snow. It said a dike around the pipeline collapsed after heavy rains on Oct. 1 and that oil accumulated in the creeks of the Kolva River, but the larger Pechora River which runs to the sea was not polluted and has been banked for protection. </P>
<P> The embassy said the dike was restored on Oct. 4, and that 1,134 cubic meters of oil-polluted ground and 10,018 cubic meters of contaminated liquid had been removed from the area during the past 2 3/8 weeks. </P>
<P> White said the United States and Russia in a conference next month planned to discuss oil drilling standards and environmental protections. </P>
<P> ``It would not be an American practice to continue to pump through a pipeline that has leaks,'' White said. </P>
<P> White said he did not want to express disappointment that Russia failed to disclose the pipeline leaks earlier and said the Russian government is vastly more open about environmental disasters than it was in the past. </P>
<P> ``So I don't like to chide or express disappointment because of the progress that we've seen,'' White said. ``But obviously whether the oil spill occurred in the United States or in Canada or in Russia, whenever you're dealing with the Arctic environment, it's an international issue.'' </P>
