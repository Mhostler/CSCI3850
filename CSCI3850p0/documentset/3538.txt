<P> Officer Carmen Vega, 23, and Officer Marcus Payne, 24, who had been living in a common law marriage, were suspended after police were called to the couple's apartment late Sunday and discovered the injuries on Vega's 23-month-old daughter, according to police spokesman Detective Joseph McConville. </P>
