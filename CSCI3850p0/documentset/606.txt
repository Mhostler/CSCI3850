<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Clinton's home state is not through with multiple executions. </P>
<P> On May 11, Arkansas became the first U.S. state since capital punishment resumed in the country in 1977 to execute two prison inmates on the same day. On Wednesday, it became the first state to execute three since 1962. </P>
<P> And even as the state was administering lethal injections to the three killers, a federal judge seemed to certify that another double execution may occur within a year. </P>
<P> The judge, G. Thomas Eisele, refused to overturn the death sentences of Paul Ruiz, 45, and Earl Van Denton, 44, convicted of killing two Arkansas law enforcement officers and critically wounding a third in 1977. </P>
<P> Eisele's action allows Arkansas Governor Jim Guy Tucker to set execution dates for Ruiz and Denton, and although the condemned men are considered certain to undertake further appeals, their time is running short. </P>
<P> ``Ruiz and Denton have been tried twice and sentenced to death three times, and we think they have very little remaining on which to base an appeal,'' said Oren Reeves, an assistant Arkansas attorney general. </P>
<P> The first conviction and death sentence of Ruiz and Denton was overturned and a new trial ordered, and the sentencing phase of the second trial, which also resulted in a death sentence, was undertaken twice by court order, each with the same outcome. </P>
<P> Reeves said petitions by Ruiz and Denton to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals and, possibly, the U.S. Supreme Court could take a year to resolve. </P>
<P> Another Arkansas death penalty controversy involves the case of Barry Lee Fairchild, condemned to die for the murder of a nurse. Fairchild's sentence was reduced to life imprisonment -- by the same judge who Wednesday rejected Ruiz's and Denton's case -- on grounds that Fairchild did not actively participate in the killing. </P>
<P> Death penalty opponents across the United States, including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, argued that Fairchild was retarded and therefore could not understand the charge against him and should not be subject to exection. </P>
<P> The state, unpersuaded, is appealing Eisele's ruling in an effort to put Fairchild to death. </P>
