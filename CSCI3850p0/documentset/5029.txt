<DATELINE>BERLIN (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Berlin Monday unveiled a stark memorial commemorating the 1933 Nazi bonfire that burned 20,000 books by Jewish, leftist and foreign authors condemned by Adolf Hitler's followers as decadent or ``un-German.'' </P>
<P> The memorial, visible through a glass plate on the square where the book-burning took place, is an eerie underground library room with empty white bookshelves. </P>
<P> A plaque on the square in central Berlin carries a quote from the 19th century German-Jewish poet Heinrich Heine: ``Where they burn books, in the end they will also burn people.'' </P>
<P> Nazis, nationalist students and professors in black robes gathered on the square on May 10, 1933 to burn works by Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, Bertolt Brecht, Albert Einstein, Ernest Hemingway, Jack London, Heine and other banned authors. </P>
<P> Ulrich Roloff-Momin, Berlin's senator for culture, said the book burning amounted to the Nazi murder of German culture and warned against current-day oppression of thinkers. </P>
<P> ``The systematic persecution of critical intellectuals during the terrible Nazi dictatorship in Germany was unique and cannot be compared to anything else,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``But one cannot play down the persecution of critical intellectuals today in Algeria or former Yugoslavia.'' </P>
<P> The burned books came from the Humboldt University across the street, from Berlin bookshops and even private collections after the Nazis urged citizens to purge all libraries and shops of ``un-German'' literature. </P>
<P> ``At the end of the evening there was nothing,'' said Micha Ullman, the Israeli artist who designed the memorial. ``Later on, this happened to people. Nothing left.'' </P>
<P> Nazi propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels told the crowd at the book burning it would help to purify Germany. Professors railed against decadence before throwing books on the bonfire, and students and Nazi groups waved flags and cheered. </P>
<P> The book burning was part of the Nazis' plan to intimidate all possible opponents after the Reichstag gave Hitler full dictatorial powers in March 1933. </P>
<P> Now seen as a key step in consolidating the Nazi regime, it was laughed off as a student prank at the time, both by average Germans and many commentators abroad. </P>
<P> One of the few protests then came from the exiled Bavarian writer Oskar Maria Graf, a leftist who wrote to the Nazis to complain that he was not on the list of banned authors. </P>
<P> Ten years later, during World War II, libraries in the United States flew flags at half-mast in memory of the bonfire. </P>
<P> Wolfgang Nagel, Berlin's senator for housing and construction, said the guilt of the book burning still weighed on Germans over 60 years after it happened. </P>
<P> ``No memorial, no matter how well it succeeds, can relieve us of this. But it can warn us and keep us vigilant.'' </P>
