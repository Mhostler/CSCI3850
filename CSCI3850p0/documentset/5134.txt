<P>  British peacekeepers of the Royal Welsh Fusiliers in Bosnia are speaking Welsh for sensitive radio transmissions to frustrate eavesdroppers who have been jamming their conversations, the United Nations reported Thursday. </P>
<P> ``The Gorazde force continues to experience jamming and other localized interference on its radio net and has started using the Welsh language as a means of confusing the perpetrators,'' said U.N. spokesman Gary Coward. </P>
<P> Lt. Col. Jonathon Riley, commanding officer of the Fusiliers, said his battalion had not resorted to codes because of the transparent nature of their peacekeeping work. </P>
<P> Welsh, he said, is ``very useful as a way to pass sensitive information and personal information. We're not the only bilingual battalion in Bosnia.'' </P>
<P> During World War II, Navajo Indians serving in the U.S. armed forces used their own language in the same way to foil enemy eavesdropping. </P>
