<P>  Prince Charles babbled on Tuesday to back a campaign for more plain English and less bureaucratic nonsense. </P>
<P> The heir to the British throne, an eager fan of more basic teaching in schools, wrote a foreword to ``A Decade of Jargon and Gobbledygook,'' a book by the Plain English campaign highlighting the worst examples of officialese over the past decade. </P>
<P> Charles entered into the spirit with a verbose contribution that took forever to say he backed the campaign. </P>
<P> ``Due to a frequent regrettable inability to prevent my presence in other locations, I find that I must convey to you my goodwill in a correspondence format,'' he wrote. </P>
<P> ``It was when I was still a juvenile future constitutional figurehead substitute that I first became sensitized by my mother-tongue abuse awareness. </P>
<P> ``How many of us, I wonder, when faced with pretentious gobbledygook and empty jargon, experience a kick start into despair mode? My feelings toward all of you are, attitudinally, those of enormous encouragement.'' </P>
