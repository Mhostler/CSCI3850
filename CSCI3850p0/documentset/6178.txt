<DATELINE>BLANTYRE, Malawi (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees will repatriate 65,000 Mozambican refugees from Malawi and hand over refugee facilities to the Malawian government, UNHCR announced Monday. </P>
<P> The UNHCR said in a statement the advent of peace and security in Mozambique had provided a durable humanitarian solution to the Mozambican refugee problem. </P>
<P> It is handing over refugee facilities and equipment, including schools, clinics and vehicles, worth $36 million to the impoverished Malawian government. </P>
<P> Malawi was once home to more than a million Mozambican refugees. Only 65,000 remain. The rest returned to their homeland which is at peace after 16 years of civil war in which up to another million people were killed. </P>
<P> Malawi's First Vice President Justin Malewezi said large areas of Malawi had been deforested by the refugees, who cut down tens of thousands of trees to build shelters and for firewood. </P>
<P> The Malawi government has asked the UNHCR for $78 million to reforest the devastated areas, he said. </P>
<P> The UNHCR hopes to repatriate the last Mozambicans by September, winding up an operation it says cost $203 million. </P>
