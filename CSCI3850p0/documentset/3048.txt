<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  House Republicans Wednesday approved a plan to require a three-fifths majority of the House to approve increases in personal and corporate income tax rates. </P>
<P> The plan was part of a package of reform proposals adopted by the Republican caucus as it completed its plan of action for the Republican takeover of the House next year after 40 years of Democratic rule. </P>
<P> The package is to be voted on when the new Congress convenes Jan. 4 and Republicans seek to put into effect their 10-point ''Contract With America.'' </P>
<P> ``This has been a remarkable three days,'' incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia told reporters after the caucus ended. </P>
<P> Under the new rules no piece of legislation carrying an income tax rate increase could be passed ``unless so determined by a vote of at least three-fifths of the House'' instead of by a simple majority. </P>
<P> The provision also barred consideration of any measure or amendment with a retroactive income tax rate increase. </P>
<P> Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., incoming chairman of the House Rules Committee, told reporters the provisions would apply both to personal and corporate income tax rates. </P>
<P> The original version of the Contract called for a three-fifths majority to pass any tax increase. Republicans refined the rule on tax increases to make sure it would not affect any proposal that raises revenue. </P>
<P> There was concern that earlier wording affecting all revenues might make it tougher for Republicans to achieve their goal of a capital gains tax cut. </P>
<P> But Solomon indicated Republicans were still looking at the scope of the tax vote provision. </P>
<P> ``In my opinion any kind of fee is a tax,'' he said. </P>
<P> The three-fifths vote on tax increases is part of the Contract with America -- 10 bills and reforms to go before the House in its first 100 days. </P>
<P> Meanwhile, as talk of a middle-class tax cut continued within Congress and the Clinton administration, Senate Republican leader Bob Dole told reporters after speaking to House Republicans that such a cut was very important. </P>
<P> But he said: ``I do think we've got to pay for it, obviously. It's got to be substantive enough so that people know they've got a tax cut.'' </P>
<P> The incoming chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., said the panel would consider a bill cancelling previously appropriated funds, that ``could be in the billions of dollars.'' </P>
<P> Gingrich said that Republicans wanted ``zero-based'' budgeting under which funding for each program is considered as if that program were just being started rather than being taken for granted. </P>
<P> The rules package adopted Wednesday contains 27 reforms designed to transform the way the House does business following the end of Democratic rule. </P>
<P> Other reforms include eliminating three House committees and 20 subcommittees, putting a three-term limit on committee chairmen and applying the same laws to Congress that apply to the private sector. </P>
<P> Other reforms include requiring that the Congressional Record, the daily account of House floor debates, report speeches verbatim, subject only to technical, grammatical and typographical corrections by the member speaking. </P>
<P> This rule would apparently put an end to members revising and polishing up their speeches before they are printed. </P>
