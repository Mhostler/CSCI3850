<P>  Rebel Muslims and their Croatian Serb allies prevented a U.N. aid convoy from reaching the beleaguered government-held town of Bihac for a second day Tuesday, U.N. officials said. </P>
<P> The convoy, trying to get food to thousands of civilians in the enclave, stopped for the night in the rebel stronghold of Velika Kladusa a few miles inside Bosnia from the border with Croatia. It had been delayed for several hours. </P>
<P> In Knin, capital of the Croatian Serbs' breakaway region of Krajina, U.N. special envoy Yasushi Akashi pushed their leaders to lift the blockades on the aid convoys and to end the ``systematic harassment'' of U.N. peacekeepers. </P>
<P> He also discussed the Serbs' conflict with the Croatian government and said afterward they appeared ready to consider talks with Zagreb to head off a new Serb-Croat war. </P>
<P> U.N. observers reported that Bihac was quieter Tuesday after several days of heavy fighting. </P>
<P> Krajina Serbs are fighting in Bihac in support of Muslim rebels loyal to businessman-politician Fikret Abdic, who has broken from the Muslim-led Bosnian government. </P>
<P> Another war looms over the Serbs' attempt to carve a separate state out of Croatia as Zagreb has demanded that U.N. peacekeepers leave when their mandate expires March 31. </P>
<P> The harassment of the aid convoy to Bihac drew condemnation from U.N. refugee officials. </P>
<P> ``The bottom line is both the Abdic forces and the Krajina Serbs are using food as a weapon of war, trying to deny food to the people of Bihac,'' said Kris Janowksi, a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. </P>
<P> About 160,000 civilians in the enclave have been cut off from regular relief deliveries since May 1994 and aid workers say the food shortage is critical, with some people facing starvation. </P>
<P> Muslim rebels held the convoy up for several hours Tuesday at the Croatia-Bosnia border. When it reached Velika Kladua it was too dark to push on to Bihac, 20 miles to the south. </P>
<P> Janowski said the rebels had assured the U.N. relief agency the convoy could proceed Wednesday but he said such promises had been broken in the past. </P>
<P> Belgrade's official Tanjug news agency said Akashi had reached agreement on the aid convoys in his talks in Knin with Krajina Serb leader Milan Martic, but it gave no details. </P>
<P> Aides suggested Akashi would reserve the right to threaten to use military force to push aid into Bihac, though the U.N. has consistently shied away from using its muscle in the past. </P>
