<DATELINE>KINGSTON, Jamaica (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Jamaican government confirmed Monday that troops from Jamaica and at least five other Caribbean countries would participate in a multinational invasion force in Haiti, in a non-combat role. </P>
<P> Prime Minister P.J. Patterson, addressing journalists Monday evening following a regular Cabinet meeting, said the decision to participate followed the July Caribbean Community (CARICOM) summit in Barbados, and talks in Jamaica and Puerto Rico between the region's military chiefs. </P>
<P> ``Jamaica is prepared to support the efforts of a multinational force'' in Haiti, Patterson said. ``The chief of staff (of the Jamaica defense force) has been instructed to prepare for Jamaican participation.'' </P>
<P> But he added that the troops will only provide support services in a ``non-combat role.'' </P>
<P> Jamaica will supply troops for a two-company battalion of 300 Caribbean troops in a mopping up operation following an actual invasion. Patterson declined to say which other countries had also agreed to participate, but did confirm that five CARICOM countries ``indicated to me they will participate.'' </P>
<P> Previous unconfirmed press reports stated Barbados, Belize, the Bahamas, Guyana and Trinidad have all agreed to supply troops as well. </P>
<P> Patterson said the battalion would have ``responsibility to secure and protect a given geographic area within Haiti,'' but added ``we will not enter until the combat phase has ended.'' </P>
<P> The troops will remain to form part of a post-invasion United Nations peacekeeping force. In addition to security responsibilities, Patterson said the force will ``promote national reconstruction and help to build the civilian institutions.'' </P>
<P> The prime minister added that Jamaica still hopes the Haitian military will agree to the restoration of ousted president Jean Bertrande Aristide ``and so make military intervention unnecessary.'' </P>
