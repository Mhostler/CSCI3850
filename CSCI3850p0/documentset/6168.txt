<P>  Spring outings by several schools saved hundreds of students from last week's deadly gas blast in South Korea's southeast city of Taegu, which killed at least 100 and injured some 200, teachers said on Monday. </P>
<P> At least 48 of the 100 killed in the blast at a subway construction site in Taegu on Friday morning were students. All but six were from nearby Youngnam Secondary School. </P>
<P> ``If our students had not gone for the outing, the number of student casualties could have been hundreds,'' a teacher at Daegun Middle School told Reuters. Daegun, a Catholic mission school, has about 1,600 students, he said. </P>
<P> ``We are very, very sorry many students died in the accident but cannot help saying it was very fortunate that the outing on that day saved our students' lives,'' he said. </P>
<P> Students of Daegun and at least three other middle schools, all located near the explosion site, went on excursions on that day, thus avoiding the tragedy, he said. </P>
<P> He said hundreds of Daegun students lived in the area of the blast and would have been in the vicinity when the devastating blast erupted. </P>
<P> ``The day will be remembered as a gift from God to our boys,'' he said. </P>
<P> A Taegu city official said there were more than 15 schools, including five middle schools and several primary schools, within a 1.5-km (one-mile) radius of the blast site. </P>
<P> The explosion, caused by a leaking gas main, tossed aside vehicles, including school buses, and massive 280-kg (620-lb) steel plates laid as a temporary road surface. </P>
