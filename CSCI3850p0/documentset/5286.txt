<P> CAIRO, March 29 (Egypt) - Suspected Moslem militants shot dead a farmer and wounded six people, including three policemen, when they attacked a village in southern Egypt, the Interior Ministry said on Wednesday. </P>
<P> A ministry statement said gunmen opened fire on Tuesday night as residents and policemen were sitting in front of a house in the village of Mehres, near Minya province, 260 km (200 miles) south of Cairo. The attackers escaped. </P>
<P> The ministry identified the dead farmer as Mohammed Abdullah Hassan. It added that the wounded were taken to hospital for treatment. </P>
<P> Security sources said the gunmen are believed to be memebrs of Egypt's largest militant underground organisation, al-Gama'a al-Islamiya (Islamic Group). The Gama'a has been leading a campaign of violence since 1992 to overthrow President Hosni Mubarak's government and establish a strict Islamic state. </P>
<P> Exchanged attacks between police and militants over the past two weeks have left nearly 30 people killed. More than 700 people have been killed in the three years of violence. </P>
<P> Security sources told Reuters the recent increase in violence reflected the government's determination to eliminate Gama'a militants, now concentrated in southern Egyptian provinces like Minya, Sohag, Qena and Assiut. </P>
