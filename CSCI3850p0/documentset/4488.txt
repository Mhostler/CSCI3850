<P>  President Clinton, defending his decision to help Mexico resolve its currency crisis, Wednesday night urged business leaders to fight a growing isolationist mood in Congress. </P>
<P> In an address to the Business Council, made up of the chief executives of the nation's largest corporations, Clinton defended his $20 billion rescue plan to defuse a crisis over the plunging value of the Mexican peso. </P>
<P> ``We have a stake in seeing that people who are committed to democracy and to free market economics and to open trade have a chance to succeed in a difficult world,'' Clinton told several hundred business leaders. </P>
<P> ``We should not be surprised when there are certain rocks in the road when the path is uneven and uneasy,'' he said. </P>
<P> U.S. and Mexican officials signed the agreement Tuesday after negotiations that led Mexico's central bank to raise short-term interest rates to 59 percent. </P>
<P> Insisting that his plan was ``important to workers of this country in the long-term,'' Clinton said Americans cannot separate U.S. economic interests from foreign affairs. </P>
<P> ``This is not just an economic issue,'' Clinton said. ``The burdens of leadership, if we want to benefit from them, also require us to be involved in foreign policy issues.'' </P>
<P> Faced with a Republican-controlled Congress that has openly challenged the size of U.S. foreign aid around the world, Clinton urged the business leaders to oppose attempts to withdraw U.S. involvement around the globe. </P>
<P> ``In this new Congress there will be many debates designed basically to try to withdraw the United States from a role of world leadership,'' Clinton said. </P>
<P> ``I understand why people who voted for both parties in the last elections are overwhelmingly preoccupied with their own problems at home,'' he told the business group, ``but what you understand is we cannot solve our problems at home unless we remain a leader in the world.'' </P>
<P> ``It is a false choice, and so I urge you to engage the new Congress in a constructive debate from your perspective about our responsibilities to maintain the leadership of the United States in economic affairs, in support of freedom and free markets and in security affairs,'' he said. </P>
<P> Clinton was forced to design his own rescue plan for Mexico after it became clear that members of the new Congress were not willing to act quickly to help America's neighbor. </P>
<P> The president said he did not regret his decision and said he would take actions he felt were ``prudent'' and ''restrained.'' </P>
<P> ``We cannot solve every problem but where we can make a difference ... where it is plainly in the interests of the United States, we must be in a position to do so,'' he said. </P>
