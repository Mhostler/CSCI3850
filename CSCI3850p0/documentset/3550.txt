<P>  Sarajevo airport, a vital aid gateway for the Bosnian capital's 380,000 people, was reopened Tuesday three days after shutting down when an aircraft skidded off the runway, a U.N. spokesman said. </P>
<P> The U.N. expected to bring in a total of 28 humanitarian and military resupply flights Tuesday. </P>
<P> French soldiers had worked since Saturday to clear and repair the runway to allow the quick resumption of relief flights. </P>
<P> None of the 11 passengers and crew aboard a U.N. Ilyushin 76 cargo plane were hurt when it smashed into a mud bank next to the runway after landing in snowy weather Saturday. Work on removing the plane was continuing Tuesday. </P>
<P> Since the warring parties agreed to a new four-month ceasefire which came into effect Jan. 1, life in Sarajevo has shown signs of improvement. </P>
<P> The U.N. said the city's tram service, stopped for weeks by repeated Serb sniper attacks, would resume Tuesday. </P>
