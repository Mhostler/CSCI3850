<DATELINE>TURNBERRY, Scotland (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Veteran Fuzzy Zoeller blazed to a six-under-par 64 and Brad Faxon shot 67 to share the lead ahead of a closely bunched field in the third round of the British Open Saturday. </P>
<P> The two Americans led by a shot over a quartet that included overnight leader Tom Watson, who missed two short putts on the back nine but recovered with birdies on the last two holes. </P>
<P> Watson, battling for a record-equalling sixth British Open title, carded a 69 in a disappointing bid to conquer Turnberry in warm, calm conditions. </P>
<P> Watson, who shot 65 Friday to snatch the halfway lead, missed from four feet at the 14th and from three feet at 16 to take bogeys as his problems with short putts resurfaced. </P>
<P> The leaders were on 201, nine under par. Watson shared third place on 202 with world No. 3 Nick Price of Zimbabwe, Jesper Parnevik of Sweden and Ronan Rafferty, a Briton from Northern Ireland. </P>
<P> Rafferty recorded a 65, Price 67 and Parnevik 68. </P>
<P> Price said: ``If we have weather like this tomorrow, it's going to be a shootout. It could take a 65 to win.'' </P>
<P> Another Northern Ireland player, Dallas-based David Feherty, had seventh place to himself after a 66 for 203. </P>
<P> Zoeller, a 42-year-old former U.S. Masters and Open champion, has not scored a victory since 1986 while battling against a bad back which threatened to end his career. </P>
<P> But the problem is under control thanks to an injection he had three years ago, and he recorded second-place finishes in three successive U.S. events this year. </P>
<P> One of them, Bay Hill in Florida, he could have won until an errant three iron at the 17th hole of the final round cost him a double bogey. But he is ninth on the year's U.S. money list. </P>
<P> He said the key to his 64 was to stay focused. ``I didn't even know what I had shot until I added them up, my mind was so focused on what was happening.'' </P>
<P> He dismissed the notion that he was regarded as a player from the past with little chance of adding to his haul of major titles. </P>
<P> ``I would not be sitting here if I did not think I had another major in me,'' he said. </P>
<P> His charge began with a wedge to one foot at the first for a birdie, a shot he gave back with a bogey at the fifth. </P>
<P> But birdies from 20 feet and another wedge to one foot followed immediately and he made four more on the back nine, three on putts of 25, 20 and 10 feet. </P>
<P> The last, at the long 17th, came when he reached the green in two and two-putted. </P>
<P> Faxon, who has only four U.S. Tour titles in 12 years, is in by far the strongest position of any major he has ever played, and has now completed 41 holes without dropping a shot, since the 13th in the opening round. </P>
<P> He made birdies at the second from 35 feet, the 10th from 30 feet and the easy 17th with two putts. </P>
<P> ``My driving has improved a lot this year and my putting has come around in the last few weeks,'' Faxon, from Rhode Island, said. </P>
<P> Asked what the people at home would think if he won, Faxon replied: ``They think the Rhode Island Open is the biggest event in the world.'' </P>
<P> Watson called his short misses ``a couple of hiccups. But I don't dwell on those things any more.'' </P>
<P> He made his first birdie at the third after missing the green with a seven-iron approach, atoning by chipping in from 40 feet. </P>
<P> He missed the next green as well but this time could not recover and took a bogey. </P>
<P> But he birdied the two par fives on the course, the seventh and 17th, and a six-iron to 10 feet and one putt at the last capped his round. </P>
<P> ``I made two good putts so it evened out. I didn't have a particularly good round from the tee but my recoveries were good. I also played some very great shots today,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``The weather now is like it was in 1977,'' Watson added in reference to the year when he scored his one-shot triumph over Jack Nicklaus for the second of his five victories. </P>
<P> Price bogeyed the last hole when he hit his second over the green. But British bookmakers quickly made him the 11-4 favorite on Saturday to take the title, with Watson the second favorite on 4-1. </P>
<P> ``There is so much experience on the leaderboard there will be no sitting and waiting for pars,'' Price said. </P>
