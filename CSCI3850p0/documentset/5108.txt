<P>  Six passengers were injured Wednesday when a homemade incendiary device was thrown at a downtown bus during a third day of protests against a public transportation fare increase, police said. </P>
<P> But the Dominican capital was calmer than earlier in the week, when at least two people were killed, many injured and at least six vehicles set ablaze after violence erupted in and around the city over a 50 percent fare increase implemented unilaterally by operators of the city's buses. </P>
<P> On Wednesday, police officers and military troops deployed throughout the city restored calm to most areas and public transport seemed to return to normal, police said. </P>
<P> Government officials, who said they had not approved the fare and would arrest any driver caught demanding more money, were to meet with representatives of the drivers' union advocating the increase. </P>
<P> Some drivers had been detained Tuesday. </P>
<P> Drivers had sought the increase to cover the increased cost of fuel, which is not subsidized by the government. </P>
