<P>  Iranian security forces Tuesday discovered and defused a bomb destined for the shrine of Iran's late revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's IRNA news agency said. </P>
<P> ``A bomb was discovered and defused before being carried into the shrine of Imam Khomeini in southern Tehran this afternoon,'' IRNA said in a brief report. </P>
<P> Last month a 10-lb bomb killed 24 people and wounded scores in Iran's holiest Shiite Muslim shrine, the tomb of Imam Reza in the northeastern city of Mashhad. </P>
<P> The government accused the Iraq-based Mujahideen Khalq group of carrying out the attack as part of a campaign to destabilize the government. </P>
<P> The group denied involvement and in turn accused the Tehran government of planting the bomb to discredit the opposition. </P>
