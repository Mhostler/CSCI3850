<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The United States indicated Sunday it had made little progress trying to persuade the Bosnian Serbs to talk rather than fight as pressure grew for U.N. peacekeepers to pull out. </P>
<P> Secretary of State Warren Christopher said his former special envoy on Yugoslavia, Charles Redman, met the Bosnian Serb leadership Saturday. He described the talks in the Bosnian Serb ``capital'' of Pale as ``useful but not decisive.'' </P>
<P> A U.S. official earlier said Redman had made no headway trying to persuade Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic to join talks on a plan from the five-nation ``contact group.'' </P>
<P> ``There was no indication Karadzic had moved, nor did we expect him to,'' said the official. </P>
<P> The Bosnian Serbs have so far rejected a peace plan that would give them roughly half of the former Yugoslav republic. </P>
<P> Contact group ministers relaunched their peace plan in Brussels Friday, hinting they could allow some form of confederation between the Bosnian Serbs and kinsmen in Serbia. </P>
<P> Bosnia is set to dominate the two-day European security summit in Budapest starting Monday. The two-year-old war is a deep embarrassment to the 53-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, whose members talk loftily about conflict prevention but have been unable to deal with a war on the edge of Europe. </P>
<P> British Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd and his French counterpart, Alain Juppe, were to brief Christopher and other leaders on their eleventh-hour dash to Belgrade Sunday to press Serbia to intervene with Karadzic. </P>
<P> Hurd has warned that if progress is not made soon the United Nations will have little option but to withdraw its 23,000 peacekeeping troops and leave the Bosnian Serbs and the Muslim-led Bosnian government forces to fight it out. </P>
<P> U.N. forces have increasingly come under direct attack from Bosnian Serb troops, particularly around the ``safe area'' of Bihac, now besieged by Bosnian Serb forces. </P>
<P> U.N. Bosnia commander Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Rose Sunday echoed Hurd's frustration, saying: ``You cannot go on peacekeeping in a vacuum. We have seen a certain impasse develop over the summer months and we're probably seeing the consequences of that now.'' </P>
<P> Christopher said he believed Hurd's warning was simply restating the British position but that stating such a stark prospect was ``strengthening the peace effort.'' </P>
<P> The Clinton administration is coming under increasing pressure to endorse a U.N. withdrawal and lift the international arms embargo on Bosnia. </P>
<P> Republican incoming Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole has called for withdrawal, lifting the embargo and NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions. </P>
<P> But Christopher accused Dole of saber rattling. </P>
<P> ``Essentially it's a war strategy. I think we should be engaged here in a peace strategy, not a war strategy,'' Christopher said on ABC television from Hungary. </P>
<P> Christopher said he still wanted to give the diplomatic initiatives a chance to end a war that has killed tens of thousands and left millions homeless on the edge of Europe. </P>
<P> ``We're going to be pursuing that, using all the ways we can to try to negotiate a peaceful settlement,'' he said. ``Our first aim here is to prevent the spread of the war.'' </P>
