<DATELINE>TOKYO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A strong earthquake centred deep in the Sea of Japan jolted a wide swathe of eastern Japan early Friday but there were no reports of casualties or damage. </P>
<P> The Meteorological Agency said the epicenter of the earthquake, measuring 7.8 on the open-ended Richter scale, was 348 miles beneath the surface off Vladivostok in Russia's Far East. The quake struck at 3.38 a.m. Friday (2.38 p.m. EDT Thursday). </P>
<P> A National Police Agency spokesman said there were no reports of damage or injury. </P>
<P> NHK national television said the tremor had been felt all along the more heavily populated eastern coast of the main Honshu island and also on northernmost Hokkaido island. </P>
<P> However, the meteorological agency spokesman said the impact on Tokyo and surrounding areas was moderate and was rated three on the Japanese scale of seven. </P>
<P> There was no danger of a tsunami (tidal wave) hitting Japan's coastline, he added. </P>
<P> The Japanese scale measures ground motion in a given area in relation to the epicenter, while the Richter measures the absolute seismic energy of an earthquake at its epicenter. </P>
<P> The U.S. Geological Survey's Earthquake Information Centre in Golden, Colorado, said the quake occurred under the Sea of Japan and had a preliminary magnitude of 6.5 on the Richter Scale. A geophysicist at the center said the quake would have been too deep to spark a tsunami. </P>
<P> The last major earthquake hit Japan on July 11, 1993, when a tremor measuring 7.8 on the Richter scale killed more than 200 people. The epicenter was 50 miles west of Hokkaido. </P>
<P> A major earthquake measuring 6.6 on the Richter struck Los Angeles on January 17, 1994, killing at least 24 people, buckling the region's lifeline of freeways and igniting more than 100 fires in a wave of destructive fury. </P>
<P> The worst earthquake in history was probably the one in Shaanxi, China, on January 24, 1556, which was believed to have killed 830,000 people. </P>
