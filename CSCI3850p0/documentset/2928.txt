<DATELINE>GOMA, Zaire (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  British aid worker Don Reid, who disappeared last week during a gun battle in a region of eastern Zaire teeming with Rwandan refugees, turned up safe and well Thursday. </P>
<P> He was spending the night at a remote aid station run by the British charity Oxfam, relief officials said. </P>
<P> Fellow workers had not yet had a chance to hear his story. There was no immediate word on the fate of four local aid workers who disappeared at the same time. </P>
<P> Reid, whose name was not previously made public, was a truck driver for the British charity Assist in eastern Zaire, where some 600,000 Rwandan Hutus fled this year in fear of reprisals after a massacre of their country's Tutsi minority. </P>
<P> Reid vanished when a convoy ran into factional fighting Friday as it traveled from Katale refugee camp to Rutshuru, both on the Zairean side of the Rwandan border. His truck was found with the engine running, doors open and nobody inside. </P>
