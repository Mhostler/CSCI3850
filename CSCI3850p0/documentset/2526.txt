<DATELINE>PORTO TOLLE, Italy (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Rescue workers stood ready to evacuate 2,000 people from the mouth of the mighty Po River Thursday as devastating floodwaters that killed at least 60 people in northern Italy swept toward the sea. </P>
<P> The river, Italy's longest, was in full flood about 25 miles west of Porto Tolle on the Po delta. </P>
<P> Emergency service officials said the river, swollen by torrential rains that sowed death and destruction in Piedmont in the northwest, had at some points exceeded levels reached in 1951 during the last great floods. </P>
<P> But they said reinforcements to the river's banks and improved flood defenses meant the emergency could probably be contained, despite renewed rain which soaked much of northern and central Italy. </P>
<P> Several road and railway bridges across the Po were closed as a precaution. Strong winds whipping in from the sea raised fears that the flow of the floodwaters into the Adriatic at the delta south of Venice might be hampered. </P>
<P> About 100 people were moved from a hospital in the delta and 90 buses and amphibious vehicles were on stand-by to evacuate 2,000 residents from the area if necessary. </P>
<P> ``We are very much on alert but we are not in a state of alarm. The situation is under control,'' one civil protection service official said. </P>
<P> Thousands of people lost their homes in Piedmont, Liguria and Lombardy in the floods, caused by the worst storms in Piedmont since 1913. </P>
<P> In addition to the known 60 dead, fire service headquarters in Rome said a further 41 people were feared missing, almost all in Piedmont. ``We will find some of them under the mud,'' one fireman said. </P>
<P> Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, accused by critics of reacting too slowly to the disaster, Tuesday declared a state of emergency in the north. He pledged an initial $2 billion in emergency aid to the stricken regions. </P>
