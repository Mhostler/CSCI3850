<DATELINE>ZAGREB, May 4 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A successful Croatian army offensive against rebel Serbs this week may have deepened a rift within their leadership, pitting hardliners against those keener on a political settlement, diplomats and U.N. sources say. </P>
<P> Long-reported divisions among the rebel Krajina Serbs in Croatia appear to have been aggravated after Croatian government troops recaptured the Western Slavonia region this week in a swift assault, they said. </P>
<P> The Serb setback while hardliners were in charge could strengthen the hand of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, who has abandoned ultra-nationalist proteges to consolidate his power and secure the lifting of a crippling U.N. trade embargo against his country. </P>
<P> Milan Martic, president of the self-declared Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) in Croatia, and his army's chief of staff, General Milan Celeketic, are said to have fallen out of favour with Milosevic, who was the original patron of rebel Serbs. </P>
<P> Martic could find himself more isolated after this week's events, diplomats in former Yugoslavia and Serb analysts say. </P>
<P> ``Things have to be coming to a head,'' said one Western diplomat who asked not to be named. </P>
<P> It was Martic who helped provide justification for the Croatian army action after he closed the cross-country E-70 highway in Serb-held territory for one day and threatened to shut it down indefinitely, diplomats said. </P>
<P> Some diplomats and Serb analysts in Belgrade said it was possible the Serb defeat in Western Slavonia could provide a convenient excuse to oust Martic, a former police chief. </P>
<P> Martic, who opposes pursuing peace negotiations with Zagreb, suffered a stinging setback in March when he failed to persuade the Krajina Serb assembly to sack the moderate prime minister and ally of Milosevic, Borislav Mikelic. </P>
<P> Mikelic was the architect of a December accord to restore normal trade and travel between Croatia and the Krajina enclave as a prelude to negotiations on a political settlement. </P>
<P> But analysts said Martic still appears to have the ear of at least some elements of the Krajina Serb army and could order further shelling of Zagreb and other civilian targets, risking a dangerous escalation of the conflict. </P>
<P> Peter Galbraith, U.S. ambassador to Croatia, told Reuters in an interview that Mikelic was on his way to Zagreb for truce talks when the city came under rocket attack, possibly ordered by Martic and his allies. Mikelic later seemed to distance himself from military attacks on Zagreb. </P>
<P> ``I have to say the RSK government has nothing to do with the shelling of Zagreb. I don't know what was happening in terms of military operations in the territory of the RSK,'' Mikelic told independent Belgrade television. </P>
<P> The Croatian army assault across U.N. ceasefire lines in Western Slavonia drew only a muted response from Milosevic and other Yugoslav leaders, who issued an even-handed statement. </P>
<P> ``The bombing of cities by either side and suffering by the civilian population must be most severely condemned,'' said a statement issued by the Belgrade government. </P>
<P> Galbraith said Milosevic, who sponsored the Krajina Serbs' 1991 revolt over Croatia's secession from Yugoslavia, had no interest in risking a wider war in Croatia and opposed Krajina Serb hardliners. </P>
<P> ``Indeed, the Krajina Serb leadership that undertook these (missile) attacks is operating very much on its own and therefore very much at its own peril,'' he said. </P>
<P> After Wednesday's rocketing of Zagreb, U.N. officials said the Krajina Serbs had accepted a ceasefire in which the Croatian government was not required to withdraw from ground recaptured in its blitz launched at dawn on Monday. </P>
