<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Schools in the predominantly Roman Catholic Irish Republic may soon have to teach sex education despite a blanket church ban on contraception, a controversial government report released Friday said. </P>
<P> Catholic schools, which oppose compulsory sex education, would all be included and children as young as four could receive classes. </P>
<P> Education Minister Niamh Bhreathnach, who set up the group which drafted the report, told RTE radio that schools should educate ``the whole child.'' </P>
<P> She said parents were keen for their children to be taught sex education in school, but that they could withdraw their children from some classes if they wanted. </P>
<P> The report stirred a fierce response from callers to a radio talk show. </P>
<P> One father calling RTE said his children had learned about animal births on his farm and that was sufficient. Another cited high British teen-age pregnancy rates as proof that sex education served little purpose. </P>
<P> The report will be considered by the National Council for Curriculum Assessment and Development before the guidelines are forwarded to all schools for implementation. </P>
<P> More than 90 percent of the population of the Republic of Ireland is Catholic. </P>
