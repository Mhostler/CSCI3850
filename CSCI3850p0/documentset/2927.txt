<P>  Anti-abortion militant Paul Hill just smiled as he listened to a state prosecutor Wednesday recommend that he receive the death penalty in connection with the murder of two men outside a health clinic. </P>
<P> Hill, 40, was convicted last month of the shotgun murders of Dr. John Britton, 69, and James Barrett, 74, a volunteer at The Ladies Center in Pensacola, where Britton performed abortions. Barrett's wife, June 68, was also wounded in the July 29 attack. </P>
<P> Escambia County Circuit Judge Frank Bell set sentencing for the former Presbyterian minister for Tuesday. </P>
<P> The jury that found him guilty of murder recommended he be executed, but under Florida's law judges make the final decision as to whether someone is sent to electric chair. </P>
<P> Prosecutor Ray Marky argued Wednesday that the murders were premeditated. </P>
<P> Two days before the murders, he said, Hill bought ``an instrument of destruction. That (12-gauge shotgun) is about as lethal as one can get. It's a riot gun. It's not for killing deer. It's for killing a whole lot of folks, causing mayhem and destruction.'' </P>
<P> Hill, who served as his own lawyer, declined to present a defense after the judge ruled he would not let him use justifiable homicide as a defense. </P>
<P> Hill had maintained earlier that those who perform abortions were guilty of murder and therefore to kill them would be justifiable. </P>
<P> After Marky concluded his remarks, Hill stood and said: ''The issues connected with my life or death should be eclipsed by consideration for our unborn neighbors who are being put to death.'' </P>
<P> Judge Bell said he would consider the evidence, the jury's recommendation and the state's case before deciding Hill's fate. </P>
<P> Hill was found guilty earlier this fall of violating the Federal Access to Clinic Entrances act, which bars the obstruction of abortion clinics. He is due to be sentenced Dec. 9 on those charges, for which he could face life imprisonment. </P>
