<P>  Foreign investment is the only option for Cuba to rebuild its battered economy, but this does not mean the country is up for sale, President Fidel Castro said in an interview published on Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``The opening is fairly wide, the joint ventures that are operating are working well, they have had a lot of success, and in fact, we would not have had another way out without this participation of foreign capital in the development of the country,'' Castro said. </P>
<P> In the interview with Mexican industrialist Mario Vazquez Rana, published in Mexico earlier this month, Castro said opening up to foreign investment was one of the most important of the changes Cuba had made to its economy. </P>
<P> ``Foreign investment is working and we see it as an important source for development, we would not have had another alternative,'' he said in the interview, published in full in the ruling Communist Party newspaper Granma. </P>
<P> But he added: ``We don't want to sell the country ... nor are we prepared to sell the country. We are doing business with factories that are stalled, factories that don't have raw materials, factories that don't have a market,'' he said. </P>
<P> The Caribbean island, plunged into crisis by the collapse of communism in the old East bloc, has embarked on cautious economic liberalization over the last two years, encouraging foreign investment in almost all sectors of the economy. </P>
<P> Mexican firms have been key investors so far, with joint ventures in telecommunications, cement production, tourism and a project to restart an oil refinery in the central port of Cienfuegos. Companies from Spain, France, Britain and Canada and other countries are involved in sectors such as oil exploration and nickel mining. </P>
<P> Castro said that while private investment was open only to foreigners, this was not a deliberate exclusion of Cuban citizens but one that arose from the fact that Cubans simply did not have hard currency to invest in the sort of large projects being set up with Cuban state firms. </P>
<P> ``There is no exclusion of Cuban citizens, it's really their lack of resources for these enterprises that we are creating -- in general they are large businesses with many millions of dollars in investment in the imports that are needed to create them, as you have in Mexico,'' Castro told Vazquez Rana. </P>
<P> ``There is not an exclusion, it's life, it's reality, it's their lack of hard currency that prevents this ... If a Cuban suddenly finds a treasure trove and has five million or 10 million dollars and wants to invest it, we could make a mixed enterprise with this Cuban citizen,'' he added. </P>
<P> On production of cane sugar, which has plunged from averages of around eight million tonnes a year in the late 1980s to just four million tonnes in the 1993-94 harvest, Castro said the island was pushing to recover its key export. </P>
<P> Cuba announced last year it was opening up sugar to foreign investment and has already struck deals with some firms for financing of vital input to the sector. </P>
<P> Castro said the aim was to boost production to around six or seven million tons a year. </P>
<P> On a recent economic reform, the creation last October of farm markets with deregulated prices, Castro said produce taken to those markets rather than sold to the state amounted to around 20 percent of overall farm production. </P>
<P> It was necessary to keep a proportion back for the state so it could be distributed evenly and at low prices among the population, he said. </P>
<P> But the proportion of goods going to the deregulated markets could rise in the future to 30 or 40 percent if production increased enough, he added. </P>
<P> The opening of the new markets was aimed at stimulating agricultural production and has gone some way to easing food shortages among Cuba's population of around 11 million. </P>
