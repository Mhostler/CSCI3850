<DATELINE>TUNIS, Tunisia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Algeria's former sole ruling party, the National Liberation Front (FLN), agreed Saturday to take part in talks arranged by the country's rulers to try to find a way out of two years of political and civil strife. </P>
<P> FLN Secretary-General Abdelhamid Mehri told a news conference the party accepted an invitation from President Liamine Zeroual. </P>
<P> But he said it would pull out if ``this dialogue is destined like those in the past to cover decisions taken in advance.'' </P>
<P> A series of talks arranged since September 1992 by Zeroual's predecessors have all failed. </P>
<P> The FLN was one of eight legal opposition parties invited to the latest talks to try to resolve the crisis into which Algeria plunged in January 1992 when the authorities scrapped a general election Islamic fundamentalists were poised to win. </P>
<P> In a statement read to reporters and faxed to Reuters in Tunis, Mehri said the FLN favored involvement of all political forces, including the banned Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), in seeking to end the turmoil. </P>
<P> Algeria, impoverished by foreign debt, hit by rising unemployment and inflation, and with no parliament, is gripped by growing violence in which more than 4,000 people have been killed. </P>
<P> Four small parties, including two moderate Islamist ones, have also agreed to attend the talks. Two anti-Islamist ones, the Rally for Culture and Democracy led by Said Saadi, and the former communist party, Ettahadi, have refused. </P>
<P> The secular Socialist Forces Front, led by independence war veteran Hocine Ait Ahmed and one of the main opposition parties behind the FIS and FLN, said Saturday its leaders had not yet decided whether to attend. </P>
<P> The FIS, which took a landslide lead in Algeria's first multi-party general election, has not been invited. It was banned shortly after the eruption of violence early in 1992. </P>
<P> Many diplomats in Algiers said in the past that without the FIS no political solution was possible. Many now say they doubt whether the violence would end even if moderate FIS leaders could be enticed into dialogue, arguing that the FIS no longer controlled the more radical armed Muslim militants. </P>
