<DATELINE>LONDON, April 24 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Britain, the third largest provider of humanitarian aid to Rwanda, on Monday took a cautious line over apportioning blame for the killings of thousands of men, women and children at a Rwandan refugee camp. </P>
<P> Baroness Lynda Chalker, head of Britain's Overseas Development Administration, backed the Rwandan government policy of trying to clear the refugee camps. </P>
<P> ``These camps are full of Hutu extremists with weaponry who were breaking out at night, terrorising the villages where people have gone back and settled. </P>
<P> ``It was in trying to empty these camps that some break-outs took place organised by Hutu extremists and that's what started the stampede,'' she said. </P>
<P> ``The government troops panicked, undoubtedly, over the weekend which added to the deaths and the injuries.'' </P>
<P> Chalker's comments contrasted with those of Belgium, which condemned Rwandan troops for brutality, and France which called for those responsible to be punished. </P>
<P> Officials said there was no question of Britain scaling down the 89 million pounds ($142 million) worth of humanitarian aid given to Rwanda since the refugee crisis erupted last year. </P>
<P> ``It must be for the government of Rwanda to restore order in the area and let the non-governmental organisations get through with food and medicine and water, otherwise more will die,'' Chalker said. </P>
<P> ``I'm afraid we have a long way to go and probably some more tragedies on the way but we'll try and prevent them,'' she added. </P>
<P> ODA officials said Britain was wary of rushing into speedy judgements on the circumstances behind the killings. </P>
<P> Troops moved in last Tuesday to close nine camps in the southwest and force the 250,000 Hutus living there to go home. It said Hutu hardliners were using the camps as strongholds. </P>
<P> According to the government version, Saturday's killings began when gunmen among Hutus penned into a small compound at Kibeho refused army orders to leave and started shooting. </P>
<P> Prime Minister Faustin Twagiramungu said what followed was a ``legitimate response'' by troops. Witnesses said they fired directly into the frightened crowd for an hour as the refugees stampeded in panic. </P>
