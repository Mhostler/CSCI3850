<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO, Calif (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The stakes are rising at the America's Cup with each victory worth four points in Round Three beginning Tuesday, and syndicates are beginning to feel the heat. </P>
<P> ``If we don't do well in this round robin,'' said Syd Fischer of Sydney 95, ``we're dead.'' </P>
<P> Fischer's syndicate faces a stiff challenge as Peter Blake's Team New Zealand, undefeated on the water, leads the challenger standings with 16 points, three ahead of One Australia, skippered by John Bertrand, and Chris Dickson's Tag Heuer Challenge. </P>
<P> In the defenders' series, Dennis Conner's Stars & Stripes is knotted with Young America with nine points apiece with America3 (cubed) trailing with just three. </P>
<P> During last week's break between rounds, teams again went back to the drawing boards to work on improving their boats. Changes in keel and rudder set-up are expected and last week's jury ruling opening the way for extensive hull surgery may also have encouraged some overhauls. </P>
<P> One Australia will introduce its new, second boat onto the challenger course for the first time, joining Marc Pajot's France 3, which has been sailing since the second round. </P>
<P> Team New Zealand is still insisting it will continue to sail its second boat, but rumor suggests that Black Magic I, its first boat, will re-emerge. </P>
<P> When racing starts Tuesday, Makota Namba's Nippon will be the only challenging syndicate with a two boat campaign that hasn't unveilled its second boat. </P>
<P> Fischer's Sydney 95 is expected to arrive on the race course with yet another change of helmsman. Neville Wittey, who replaced Chris Law after round one, left San Diego before the end of round two and has yet to be spotted back in town. </P>
<P> Nippon was dealt a blow by a new interpretation by the International Jury, clarifying the 17th man position. Nippon now will be unable to sail with Australian coach Peter Gilmour, a renowned match race sailor, for the entire round. </P>
<P> Some syndicates were outraged that Gilmour, who does not fulfill the required residency qualifications, has been allowed to sit in this non-participatory slot for both round one and round two. </P>
<P> ``I stay very close to John Cutler (the helmsman). I watch as intently as I possible can and that is the extent of it,'' said Gilmour. ``You are allowed to watch.'' </P>
<P> The 17th man position was introduced for the 1992 event to provide a position on board for sponsors and VIPS. The new interpretation restricts any person with expert knowledge to sail as the 17th man for more than three races in a round. </P>
<P> On the defender side all three syndicates, Kevin Mahaney's Young America, Stars & Stripes and the all women's team America3 (cubed) will return with the same boats. </P>
<P> America3 is the only defender which has a second boat and this is yet to arrive in San Diego. The new America3, which will probably race in round four, is rumored to be radically different. </P>
<P> Challenger leader Team New Zealand will face a tough first day of racing against Nippon. Tag Heuer will race Pedro Campos' Rioja de Espana and Sydney 95 will race France 3. </P>
<P> On the defender course, Young America will go against America3. </P>
