<P>  The wife of one of two Americans arrested after straying into Iraq said Sunday she was devastated by a report that they had been sentenced by a Baghdad court to eight years' imprisonment. </P>
<P> ``I'm devastated. I just can't believe it,'' Linda Barloon told Reuters. </P>
<P> She said, however, that she hoped the jailing would turn out to be ``just another step in a process'' that would bring closer the release of her husband William Barloon and fellow U.S. defensce worker David Daliberti. </P>
<P> Barloon added she was comforted by the fact that the men were jailed together and had each other for company. </P>
<P> The U.S. State Department said on Saturday an Iraqi criminal court sentenced Barloon, 39, of New Hampton, Iowa, and David Daliberti, in his 40s, of Jacksonville, Fla., each to eight years' imprisonment. </P>
<P> Iraqi officials have refrained from all comment. </P>
<P> The pair were arrested on March 13 after straying over the border into Iraq. U.S. officials and United Nations military observers said they became lost while trying to visit friends in a demilitarised zone between Kuwait and Iraq. </P>
<P> Westerners previously jailed by Iraqi courts for up to eight years for illegal entry have been freed after several months. </P>
