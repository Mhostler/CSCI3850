<DATELINE>TOKYO, April 17 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Has Japan played its last card in its attempts to halt the yen's dizzying rise? </P>
<P> That was a key question here on Monday, and optimism that Tokyo had anything dramatic up its sleeve was in short supply. </P>
<P> Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura said at the weekend that details of Tokyo's emergency economic package approved on Friday would be implemented in one to two months, by which time he hoped the market would give the measures a warmer welcome. </P>
<P> Takemura was speaking in Indonesia on Sunday after talks there with U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin. </P>
<P> He continued on Monday to allay market fears of a wide gap between Tokyo and Washington over foreign exchange policy. </P>
<P> ``The United States and Japan share a common view that the recent steep dollar falls have been overdone,'' he told Reuters. </P>
<P> Few in Tokyo, however, were convinced Washington was ready to back words with action either to cut its budget deficit or raise interest rates soon to help halt the dollar's decline. </P>
<P> ``There is more possibility that the dollar will fall rather than rallying, as there's little left that Japan can do and the U.S. seems little worried about the fall,'' said a bank trader. </P>
<P> Using the International Monetary Fund's devaluation formula, the dollar has already fallen around 20 percent against the yen this year, and threatens to slide even further, inflicting more damage on both Japanese exporters and firms whose Japan-made goods compete with imports. </P>
<P> ``Policy coordination with America is impossible,'' said one Japanese economist. ``Their economy is fine and they just don't see this as a dollar problem.'' </P>
<P> Japan's Friday steps included promises to try to cut its huge current account surplus, speed up deregulation, boost imports, stimulate the economy and revitalise markets. </P>
<P> To back up the plan, dismissed by many analysts as long on promises but short on specifics, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) cut its discount rate to a historic low of one percent. </P>
<P> So was anything left that Tokyo could do? Most said not. </P>
<P> ``I think that in one sense, Japan has played its last card,'' said Makoto Utsumi, a former vice finance minister, suggesting the ball was now in Washington's court. </P>
<P> ``I wonder what kind of card the United States might have to defend its own currency,'' he said. </P>
<P> But others said Tokyo could yet convince currency markets if -- but only if -- it buckled down to map out serious steps, such as substantial public spending to boost demand and suck in imports and a meaningful plan to deregulate its economy. </P>
