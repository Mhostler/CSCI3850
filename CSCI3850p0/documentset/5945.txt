<P>  Syria's President Hafez al-Assad has condemned the Oklahoma city bombing as ``an ugly terrorist act,'' his spokesman said Saturday. </P>
<P> Joubran Kourieh told Reuters Assad's remarks were contained in a message he sent to President Clinton Friday morning in reply to a cable the U.S. leader sent to mark Syria's national day. </P>
<P> ``I am sorry that my message coincides with the ugly terrorist act caused by the Oklahoma bombing in which innocent people were killed,'' Kourieh quoted Assad as telling Clinton. </P>
<P> ``This act and similar acts deserve condemnation and denunciation. We condemn it strongly,'' Assad said. </P>
<P> Information Minister Mohammed Salman described Wednesday's bombing, in which more than 80 people died, as a criminal act and urged cooperation to prevent similar acts in future. </P>
<P> Kourieh said Assad also thanked Clinton in his message for his congratulatory cable and expressed his appreciation over Clinton's ``support for efforts aimed at achieving a just, permanent and comprehensive peace in the Middle East.'' </P>
<P> He also thanked Clinton for his ``readiness to play a constructive role to achieve this noble objective for which Syria is working.'' </P>
<P> The United States, which is sponsoring the Syrian-Israeli peace talks, was hoping to arrange a meeting of the Syrian and Israeli army chiefs of staff but differences over security arrangements have blocked talks. </P>
<P> Syria wants an agreement in principle that security arrangements, to be implemented if and when both reach a peace agreement, should be equal and balanced. Israel says details should be discussed at the negotiations. </P>
<P> Syria's peace talks with Israel, held sporadically since 1991, have made no tangible progress so far and the talks were stalled over various issues including withdrawal from the Golan Heights, security arrangements and future ties. </P>
