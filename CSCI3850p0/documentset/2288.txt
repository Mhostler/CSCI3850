<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has said he is not an ``Uncle Tom'' and that those who expect him to change his conservative views had better ``get over it,'' a Washington newspaper reported. </P>
<P> ``That is one of the problems we have as black people. We don't allow differing views,'' he was quoted as saying in the Washington Afro-American, which went on sale Thursday. </P>
<P> ``I am not an Uncle Tom.'' </P>
<P> ``It would seem that some black people want to say that when you, as a black, become successful, you cease to be black,'' Thomas was quoted as saying. ``That is ridiculous. If a white person becomes successful, do they cease to be white?'' </P>
<P> The meeting with the newspaper's black reporters was considered highly unusual since Supreme Court justices rarely meet with the press for on-the-record interviews. </P>
<P> Toni House, a Supreme Court spokeswoman, declined to comment on the account of the interview. </P>
<P> Thomas, the only black on the high court, was the center of attention during his Senate confirmation hearings in 1991 after University of Oklahoma law professor Anita Hill accused him of sexual harassment, including making lewd remarks and suggestions when she worked for at the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. </P>
<P> Thomas, 46, remains controversial because of his far-right opinions on civil rights matters before the court and is criticized by some black leaders as being too conservative. </P>
<P> In the interview, Thomas said that ``discrimination or special treatment on the basis of race was wrong.'' </P>
<P> ``I'm trying to uphold that standard and I disagree with the prevailing point of view of some black leaders that special treatment for blacks is acceptable,'' he added. </P>
<P> The newspaper reported that Thomas ``bristled'' when he was asked if he would be changing his views now that he is on the highest court in the land. </P>
<P> ``I'm going to be here for 40 years,'' Thomas replied. ``For those who don't like it, get over it.'' </P>
<P> The remark mimicked Washington's Democratic candidate for mayor, Marion Barry who, after winning a fight for the nomination last month, told whites who dislike him to ``get over it.'' </P>
<P> Barry, a former three-term mayor, was convicted in 1990 of a misdemeanor for cocaine possession and served time in prison. He now seems poised to win a fourth term as mayor on Nov. 8 against Republican Carol Schwartz in this overwhelmingly Democratic city. </P>
