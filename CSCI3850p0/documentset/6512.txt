<P> Team New Zealand, one win away from taking home the America's Cup, has been faster in 41 of its 42 races over the past four months, and the Kiwis say it's because of efficiencies of financing, boat design and team structure. </P>
<P> ``It's the sum of a lot of little things,'' design coordinator Tom Schnackenberg said Friday, on the eve of the day the Kiwis could clinch the best-of-nine series in an economical five races. </P>
<P> The Kiwis involved the whole team in the planning from the start, from fund-raisers to technicians to sailors. </P>
<P> ``We actually drew up a proper budget two years ago,'' said Schnackenberg. The budget -- $30 million New Zealand, or $15 to $18 million U.S. -- was based on what syndicate head Peter Blake felt he could raise after informal talks with sponsors. </P>
<P> His small sailing-mad country was focused on the Cup, so firm funding was available while other campaigns such as Dennis Conner's, in the yachting-apathetic United States, had to scramble to pay their way. </P>
<P> And, Schnackenberg says, in New Zealand you get ``more bang for your buck'' for a variety of reasons. </P>
<P> Then came a design process that looked simultaneously at all aspects from the sails to the hull to the appendages underneath. </P>
<P> ``I don't think other teams had a design process like ours,'' said Doug Peterson, a principal designer along with Laurie Davidson. ``Other people think they're doing it that way but we were constantly thinking about the whole thing.'' </P>
<P> The sailors, headed by three-time world match-racing champion Russell Coutts, advised not just on deck lay-out, but on such design trade-offs as upwind versus downwind speed (they chose upwind) and maneuverability versus straightline speed (the sailors of course wanted both). </P>
<P> A side benefit of this, the Kiwis say, is that it brought better morale, since the sailors had a stake in the design. ''They're the ones who have to extract performance out of the boat,'' said Schnackenberg. </P>
<P> ``Design genius or design intuition is an important part,'' he added. The Kiwis produced the fastest boat, thanks not just intuition, but to two key procedural decisions. </P>
<P> First, they decided not to build until they had done extensive testing, in wind tunnels and water tanks, to choose an optimum design for the range of conditions they expected. </P>
<P> Schnackenberg said the design team chose ``the middle of the road,'' not tailoring for too narrow a range of conditions. </P>
<P> ``The idea was to make the design of the boat simple,'' said Schnackenberg. ``I think that was the secret.'' </P>
<P> Second, the Kiwis decided to build two boats of similar design to allow the most reliable on-the-water testing of the small adjustments that can make the difference on race day. </P>
<P> Conner, the pioneer of multi-boat testing, could not afford it this time. Only Team New Zealand had the confidence in its basic design to make two virtually identical boats, rather than hedge their bets with radically different boats. </P>
<P> Schnackenberg estimates that 70 percent of the improvements in Black Magic I, the boat the Kiwis wound up using, came from testing against Black Magic II. </P>
<P> Then there's the crew. Peterson says the Kiwi crew is sailing its boat at 99 percent efficiency. ``A lot of the speed you see there is the performance of the crew and their knowledge of the boat.'' </P>
<P> By contrast, Peterson said of Conner's crew, still learning their borrowed yacht, Young America: ``I don't think they are sailing up to their potential.'' </P>
<P> Peterson loves this team's way of doing things, and expects to stay with the Kiwis for a defense of the Cup -- assuming they win it. </P>
<P> ``I've had a great time with this team. The atmosphere is so good. I don't see any particular reason to leave. These guys look like winners to me,'' said Peterson. ``I'll probably stick around.'' </P>
