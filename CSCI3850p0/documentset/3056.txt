<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt on Wednesday warned President Clinton to proceed carefully in any new trade talks at the upcoming Summit of the Americas to prevent a split within the Democratic Party. </P>
<P> The Missouri Democrat, who voted against the North American Free Trade Agreement, told Clinton in a nine-page letter to keep environmental, labor and other issues at the forefront when negotiating with Latin American leaders. </P>
<P> Gephardt was House Majority leader until the Democrats lost control of the chamber to Republicans in the November elections for the first time in 40 years. </P>
<P> ``The American people gave the Democratic party a wake-up call on Nov. 8, they told us that we had strayed from recognizing what our priority must be: improving the economic lives of working people,'' Gephardt said. </P>
<P> ``We must do all we can to ensure that we do not have another NAFTA-like debate that divides the Democratic Party,'' he said, calling for the U.S. summit agenda to address a broad array of issues. </P>
<P> U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said Monday that regional leaders plan to endorse a target date for free trade at this weekend's Summit of the Americas in Miami. </P>
<P> The summit, to be held Friday through Sunday with 34 heads of state or government, will focus on bolstering democracy and expanding free trade in the region. </P>
<P> Chile is the front-runner to benefit from closer economic ties with Washington, be it in clinching a one-on-one deal or by joining NAFTA. </P>
<P> Gephardt said he the United States should quickly open negotiations with Chile and said he wanted to work with the White House to pave the way for quick consideration of any trade pact. </P>
<P> But he said his support on so-called fast-track authority -- setting a time limit on consideration any trade agreement and barring floor amendments -- hinged on inclusion of environmental and labor standards. </P>
<P> Republicans, whose support Clinton will need to approve any new agreement, have said they would oppose inclusion of labor standards in any fast-track bill. </P>
<P> Gephardt said the administration should attempt to negotiate separate agreements with Latin American nations rather than allowing them to join NAFTA and told the White House to pay more attention to U.S. labor retraining programs to offset job losses caused by trade agreements. </P>
