<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Turkish prosecutors have demanded the death penalty for 29 people in connection with riots over Salman Rushdie's novel ``The Satanic Verses,'' court officials said Tuesday. Thirty-seven people died in the riots. </P>
<P> The hearing, amid tight security, was closed to the press and public. However, a court official quoted Chief Prosecutor Nusret Demiral as saying 29 defendants faced capital charges. </P>
<P> Demiral said there were moves to include prominent writer Aziz Nesin among the defendants, but not on capital charges. </P>
<P> The presence at a cultural festival of Nesin, a leading satirist and author who translated and published parts of Rushdie's novel in his newspaper, triggered the riots by Islamic fundamentalists on July 2, 1993, in the central town of Sivas. </P>
<P> Rushdie remains in hiding after a fatwa, or Islamic religious decree by Iran's late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, ordered his death for blasphemy. </P>
<P> Most of the victims -- writers, poets, singers and intellectuals -- died when rioters set fire to the hotel where Nesin was staying. The 78-year-old Nesin was unhurt. </P>
<P> In Tuesday's hearing at Ankara's State Security Court, the prosecutors read out an overview of the charges before the hearing was postponed until August 31, when the defense will present its case, officials said. </P>
<P> The case opened on October 21, with 230 people on trial, three on capital charges, and 38 facing at least 20 years jail for mass murder, arson and damaging public and private buildings. </P>
<P> A month later public and press were excluded from hearings following rowdy scenes involving defense lawyers and Islamic activists. </P>
<P> The number of defendants fell to 124 as the case developed. </P>
