<P>  Police Thursday filed murder charges against an Islamic extremist for bombing a Philippine Airlines (PAL) plane in an alleged terror campaign that was also to include blowing up two U.S. commercial jets. </P>
<P> Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, on trial on charges of masterminding the 1993 World Trade Center bombing in New York, was also charged with acts ``inimical to civil aviation'' in connection with the mid-air explosion of the PAL plane last Dec. 11. </P>
<P> A Japanese man was killed and 10 passengers injured in the blast, which forced the aircraft to make an emergency landing in Okinawa. </P>
<P> Philippine investigators have said the bombing was a test for other planned attacks by a group of Islamic militants headed by Yousef. </P>
<P> The attacks were to include killing Pope John Paul II during his visit to Manila in January, the simultaneous bombing of two United Airlines jumbo jets as they approached Hong Kong and crash-diving a plane packed with explosives on the headquarters of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. </P>
<P> The group also was alleged to be planning to blow up the U.S. and Israeli embassies in Manila with bombs dropped from a plane. </P>
<P> Yousef was in Manila just before the pope's visit but escaped when police raided his Manila apartment hideout and seized an assortment of bomb-making materials. </P>
<P> He was later arrested in Pakistan and extradited to the United States where he is facing trial for the World Trade Center bomb attack in which six people died and 1,000 were injured. </P>
<P> Philippine police filed the charges against Yousef with the Department of Justice prosecutors, who will decide if there is enough evidence to take the case to court. </P>
<P> Investigators alleged that Yousef personally planted the bomb on the PAL plane, concealing it in a life vest beneath the seat of the Japanese man who was killed. </P>
<P> They said Yousef, using an Italian pseudonym, boarded the aircraft in Manila and got off at the central city of Cebu, where PAL picked up more passengers. </P>
<P> Airline attendants and some passengers identified Yousef as being on board the Manila-Cebu flight, police said. </P>
<P> Police said Yousef was the head of a 23-man group of Islamic extremists who arrived separately in Manila late last year to launch their attacks. </P>
<P> The other members of the group, who included Pakistanis, Turks, Iraqis, Moroccans and Filipinos, are still being hunted, officials said. </P>
