<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Two Americans jailed for eight years for illegally crossing the Iraqi border from Kuwait are ``seething with anger'' over the U.N.'s reported admission that one of its border guards failed to stop them from going into Iraq, according to Cable News Network. </P>
<P> CNN correspondent Brent Sadler, reporting from Baghdad on Tuesday, said David Daliberti and William Barloon are bitter over the United Nations mistake. </P>
<P> ``Both men are very angry that the U.N. had taken so long to make that important admission,'' Sadler reported. </P>
<P> Later Sadler answered questions via satellite from the two men's wives, Kathy Daliberti and Linda Barloon, and reassured them the men were in better spirits. </P>
<P> ``They feel that if things had been different, the U.N. could have quietly moved them away from the area and not allowed the situation to have spilled over to within earshot of Iraqi guards, who eventually picked them up and detained them.'' Sadler reported. </P>
<P> ``Bill Barloon seems to be in better shape, both physically and mentally; he's certainly more in control of his situation,'' Sadler said. </P>
<P> Barloon, 39, of New Hampton, Iowa, also remains defiant, telling the CNN correspondent: ``I am determined not to kowtow to the Iraqis; I intend to remain strong and to give Dave all my support so we see this thing through together.'' </P>
<P> Daliberti, 41, of Jacksonville, Fla., who has reported health problems, was visited Tuesday by two heart specialists, two eye specialists and a general practitioner, CNN reported. </P>
<P> Daliberti told CNN that he had had three ``heart seizures'' since being arrested March 13 and that he felt that the blindfold he wore following his arrest had damaged his eyes, preventing him from reading. </P>
<P> An Iraqi criminal court sentenced the two on March 25 and an Iraqi lawyer defending them is expected to launch an appeal soon. </P>
<P> Sadler Tuesday interviewed Hamad Yussuf Hummadi, the Iraqi information minister, who denied the case of the two men was linked to the U.S. position opposing the lifting of U.N. sanctions against his country. </P>
<P> ``This is not a political matter to us. It is a purely legal matter,'' he said. He denied that the two men had wandered into Iraq because of a U.N. mistake. ``They went in, they didn't stray. </P>
<P> He said his government would consider the possibility of letting the imprisoned men have visits from their family. </P>
<P> The CNN reporter, who last visited the prisoners 13 days ago, was told they share a cellblock with up to 300 prisoners of various Arab nationalities, none of whom speaks English. </P>
<P> They share a 6-foot by 8-foot cell, open to a common area, and received a refrigerator for that cell Tuesday, CNN reported. </P>
<P> Sadler told Kathy Daliberti her husband was allowed to shave off a thick beard he had grown since captivity and ``looked a lot perkier.'' </P>
<P> He told the wives their husbands have also been able to shower and wash their clothes. But their cellblock has ``only three lavatory holes and they say that conditions are pretty horrid.'' </P>
<P> Earlier, Sadler reported that visits by Polish diplomats, who have been bringing the two prisoners mail from their families with a one-week or two-week delay, have been emotional. The diplomats have also provided them with Iraqi dinars to buy prison comforts. </P>
