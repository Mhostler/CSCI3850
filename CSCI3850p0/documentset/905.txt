<DATELINE>COLOMBO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Post-election violence in Sri lanka has claimed at least two lives and the country's day-old government extended an island-wide curfew on Saturday to prevent further mayhem, police said. </P>
<P> New prime minister Chandrika Kumaratunga, in a nationwide address, warned her supporters not to mar their victory by lawlessness. </P>
<P> Kumaratunga's People's Alliance (PA) won Tuesday's poll, ending 17 years of United National Party (UNP) rule. She was sworn in as Sri Lanka's second woman prime minister on Friday. </P>
<P> One person was killed in the northwestern Chilaw district and another in the central Kegalle district in political violence on Friday, Deputy Inspector General of Police Merril Gunaratne told Reuters. </P>
<P> The curfew, lifted at 5 a.m. on Saturday, will be re-imposed at 6 pm on Saturday evening. </P>
<P> ``The curfew has been re-imposed as a precautionary measure. About 75 incidents of arson, pelting stones and assault have been reported from various parts of the country,'' Gunaratne said. </P>
<P> He said politicians were co-operating with the police by appealing to their supporters to halt violence. </P>
<P> ``The situation is well under control. We don't expect any escalation of violence,'' Gunaratne said. </P>
<P> Police said that on Friday three shops and two houses belonging to UNP supporters were set on fire in the north- central Anuradhapura district and a UNP supporter's house was burned in the neighbouring Polonnaruwa district. </P>
<P> Also on Friday, a UNP office in the eastern Batticaloa district was set on fire and troops prevented a mob from taking a bus in the western Gampaha district. </P>
<P> Sri Lanka has a history of post-election violence. </P>
