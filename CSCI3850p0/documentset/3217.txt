<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Attorneys for reputed Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss asked a judge Wednesday to throw out her conviction on prostitution-related charges and grant her a new trial, alleging juror misconduct. </P>
<P> In a motion filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, Fleiss's lawyers said they had sworn statements from five jurors admitting they had discussed the case before deliberations that led to a verdict Dec. 2, a violation of the judge's orders and state law. </P>
<P> If Judge Judith Champagne agrees, it could result in another chance at acquittal for Fleiss, who faces a mandatory sentence of at least three years in prison after being convicted on three counts of pandering. </P>
<P> Prosecutors had accused Fleiss, 28, the daughter of a prominent Los Angeles pediatrician, of running a high-priced call girl ring catering to Hollywood's rich and famous. She was arrested in June 1993 after providing prostitutes to undercover police detectives posing as Japanese businessmen. </P>
<P> During a weeklong trial, a state judge refused to allow defense attorneys to reveal the contents of Fleiss' ``little black book,'' said to include celebrities and studio executives. But last week Fleiss threatened to begin naming names. </P>
<P> After speculation about juror misconduct circulated widely, Fleiss's lawyers took action Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``We seek a new trial on the counts Heidi Fleiss was convicted of on the basis of juror iregularities during the course of the trial which deprived her of a true verdict,'' defense attorney Anthony Brooklier told reporters. </P>
<P> Confirming reports that five jurors had signed sworn affidavits, co-counsel Donald Marks said ``all of these (acts of misconduct) had the affect of causing some jurors to vote 'guilty' on some counts where they would not have otherwise.'' </P>
<P> After the verdicts were announced, several jurors said they reached a compromise that would clear Fleiss of the drug charge, which they mistakenly believed carried a stiffer sentence. </P>
<P> Many were shocked to learn that pandering convictions carried a mandatory three-year term and that Fleiss could receive a maximum punishment of eight years and eight months when she is due to be sentenced Jan. 20. </P>
<P> District Attorney Gil Garcetti acknowledged earlier this week that if the judge grants a new trial, ``we will be forced to retry the case.'' </P>
<P> The jurors admitted that they had talked about possible sentencing and other details of the case in the parking lot and cafeteria of the downtown courthouse, the newspaper said. Under state law, jurors are allowed to discuss a case only in the jury room during deliberations. </P>
<P> In the Dec. 19 edition of Time magazine, jury forewoman Sheila Mitrowski is quoted as saying that while she initially wanted to acquit Fleiss of all the charges, she eventually agreed to a compromise with three jurors who wanted to convict Fleiss -- a drug charge would be dropped in exchange for accepting three of the five pandering charges. </P>
<P> Now free on bail, Fleiss is due to stand trial along with her father on Jan. 25 on separate federal charges of tax evasion and money laundering. </P>
