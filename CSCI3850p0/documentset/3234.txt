<P> Yeltsin and the Russian government earlier said Chechen ``illegal armed groups,'' which included the forces of separatist President Dzhokhar Dudayev, had to lay down their arms by Thursday. </P>
<P> Dudayev's forces ignored the ultimatum and kept up resistance to the advance of thousands of Russian troops closing in around the capital Grozny. </P>
<P> Yeltsin also said in his appeal that he would send a high-ranking Russian delegation to talks if Dudayev agreed to head Chechnya's negotiating team. Dudayev had indicated he was prepared to talk only to the Russian leader himself. </P>
<P> ``If illegal armed formations cease fire, I will consider it a manifestation of good will and the first step toward restoration of peace and legality in the Chehcen republic,'' Yeltsin said. </P>
