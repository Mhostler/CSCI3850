<P>  The Senate Tuesday condemned Iraq for jailing two Americans who accidentally crossed into that nation from Kuwait and called on the White House to take all appropriate actions to secure their release. </P>
<P> Lawmakers approved the nonbinding resolution offered by Iowa Democratic Senator Tom Harkin by a vote of 99-0. It calls for the immediate release of the Americans, who were sentenced to eight year jail terms, and their safe exit from Iraq. </P>
<P> ``There is absolutely no justification for these sentences ... Allegations of espionage to the contrary, these men were not in Iraq for any nefarious purpose. They did not commit any criminal actions,'' Harkin said. </P>
<P> Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., asked if he thought the White House was acting correctly to secure release of the Americans, said: ``I think diplomacy is certainly what we should start with. I don't think we foreclose any options.'' </P>
<P> The resolution was adopted as an amendment to an unrelated bill that would impose a moratorium on federal regulations. </P>
<P> The two men, described by the United States as civilian aircraft maintenance workers employed in Kuwait, crossed into Iraq on March 13 while trying to visit friends along the demilitarized zone between the two countries. They were reported last Saturday to have been given eight-year sentences for entering Iraq illegally. </P>
