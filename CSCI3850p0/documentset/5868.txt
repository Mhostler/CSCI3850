<P>  China agreed to begin importing apples grown in Oregon and Idaho, marking an expansion of Beijing's current policy to buy only U.S. apples produced in Washington state, U.S. officials said Wednesday. </P>
<P> The agreement was reached Tuesday night in San Francisco at the end of the first day of a three-day meeting between U.S. and Chinese officials on plant safety issues. </P>
<P> Officials have predicted that the so-called ``phytosanitary talks'' could lead to an opening of China's vast markets to U.S.-grown citrus, fruit and tobacco. </P>
<P> ``Agreement was reached on expansion of the U.S. apple export area to include Idaho and Orgeon, in addition to Washington, subject to a site visit to the area by the Chinese,'' said an Agriculture Department official. </P>
<P> ``It's good news that it worked out that way,'' said Ellen Terpstra, president of the International Apple Institute, the national trade association that represents the apple industry. </P>
<P> Terpstra said the move had been expected after the major battle was won for the industry in late 1993 when Beijing agreed to let Washington apples into China. Washington state accounts for 90 percent of all U.S. apple exports. </P>
<P> Apple industry officials said that the next step in opening China's markets has to be a lowering of Chinese import tariffs on apples, which currently amount to more than 60 percent. </P>
<P> ``We're delighted with the efforts of the Agriculture Department to expand the U.S.-China apple agrement,'' said Kraig Naasz of the Northwest Horticulture Council. ``We hope that the U.S. Trade Representative's efforts to reduce tariffs on our products meet with similar success.'' </P>
<P> The talks in San Francisco, led by Glenn Lee, deputy administrator for the Agriculture Department's Plant Protection and Quarantine, and Yau Wenguo, deputy director of China's Animal Plant Quarantine, are focused on health worries China has over U.S. citrus, certain fruits and tobacco. </P>
<P> Discussions on Wednesday centered on Washington-grown cherries and China's insistence that the fruit be fumigated. U.S. officials say this requirement is unnnecessary. No information was available yet on the session's outcome. </P>
