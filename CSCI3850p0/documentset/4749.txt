<P> Michael Santangelo, Ruiz Massieu's U.S. lawyer, said his client was afraid for his life both in Mexico and in the United States charging that the U.S. government and the Mexican government were working ``hand-in-glove.'' </P>
<P> Santangelo called charges that Ruiz Massieu had covered up responsability for the murder of his brother Francisco, Secretary General of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), as ``illogical, unbelievable and stupid.'' </P>
<P> Ruiz Massieu was questioned last week by Mexican police after the government said that Raul Salinas, a brother of former Mexican president Carlos Salinas, was behind the killing of Frncisco Ruiz Massieu. Mexico on Monday called for his extradition. </P>
