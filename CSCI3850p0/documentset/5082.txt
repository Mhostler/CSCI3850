<P>  Louisiana Republicans have trounced tradition by scheduling the nation's first presidential caucus one week ahead of Iowa, and at least one candidate is crying foul. </P>
<P> With little fanfare, the state GOP central committee voted Saturday to split their party's delegates, with 21 selected at caucuses in early February and six committed to the winner of the March 12 Super Tuesday presidential preference primary. </P>
<P> The move drew objections Tuesday from candidate and former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander. In letters to fellow-candidate Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas and Louisiana GOP chairman Mike Francis, Alexander urged them not to tamper with the the existing schedule, in which Iowa holds the first caucus and New Hampshire the first primary. </P>
<P> Gramm won Louisiana's GOP straw poll, the first in the nation, in January with more than 70 percent of the 1,247 votes cast. </P>
<P> At a press conference in Washington, Alexander said he wrote Gramm to use his influence in Louisiana to change the date. Asked if he was putting Gramm in a bind by asking him to intervene, Alexander retorted, ``I hope so.'' </P>
<P> The former governor also said he saw signs of a pattern developing, as states with heavy Gramm support move to hold caucuses ahead of the rest of the country to boost his campaign. </P>
<P> ``We're beginning to develop a pattern. Arizona's on one side of Texas and suddenly it's started trying to scoot ahead of New Hampshire. Louisiana's on the other side and it's scooted ahead of New Hampshire,'' Alexander said. </P>
<P> ``I think people in New Hampshire are smart enough to figure this out for themselves.'' </P>
<P> Gramm already has been heavily criticized in New Hampshire for efforts to change the date of Arizona's primary to precede New Hampshire's. </P>
<P> Gramm campaign spokesman Gary Koops in Washington, D.C., would not say if Gramm would intervene. ``We believe Iowa will be the first caucus in the nation and we are campaigning on the belief,'' Koops said. </P>
<P> When pressed about Gramm's possible intervention, Koops said, ``I don't think it's going to be necessary. The Iowa caucus date has not been carved in stone.'' He indicated it could be bumped up to try to get ahead of Louisiana, and reiterated that ``Iowa will be first.'' </P>
<P> Louisiana GOP executive director Chris Furlow denied that the caucus decision was tied to support for the conservative Gramm among party leaders. </P>
<P> According to Furlow, an early caucus date in Louisiana will draw Republican candidates and some of their campaign dollars to the state. </P>
