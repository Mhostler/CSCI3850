<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Palestinians will not suspend negotiations with Israel but will launch an international campaign for a thorough review of the Middle East peace process, a PLO executive committee member said Wednesday. </P>
<P> Mohamed Zuhdi Nashashibi told reporters in Cairo that the PLO executive would spell out a new Palestinian strategy in a statement later Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``We are not suspending but we want to say something very specific,'' he said. ``We have to identify very clearly what should be the objectives of negotiations. We can no longer go on negotiating whatever the Israelis put on the agenda.'' </P>
<P> ``We will send a person everywhere -- to Europe and the United States, Russia, China and Japan, Korea as well. We don't want them to interfere, we want solidarity. We will put our case, and it is very clear,'' he added. </P>
<P> Nashashibi was speaking after the PLO executive committee had a five-hour meeting in Cairo to reconsider the state of talks with Israel on the next phase of Palestinian self-rule. </P>
<P> PLO leader Yasser Arafat called the meeting in response to growing Palestinian frustration at delay in widening Palestinian self-rule beyond Gaza and Jericho to more of the West Bank. </P>
<P> The executive committee will meet again Wednesday after a call on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, he said. </P>
<P> The next phase -- Israeli withdrawal from West Bank towns and Palestinian elections -- should have taken place eight months ago, but Israel has raised doubts about the Palestinians' ability to meet its security requirements. </P>
<P> On Tuesday evening, the Palestine Liberation Organization's main spokesman, Yasser Abed-Rabbo, said Palestinians should suspend the negotiations with Israel until they find a formula for bringing international powers closer to the talks. </P>
<P> ``There should be a radical and fundamental revision of the process and we should find wider participation. That could be regional or international ... so these negotiations will meet their objective,'' Abed-Rabbo, in charge of information in the fledgling Palestinian Authority, told reporters. </P>
