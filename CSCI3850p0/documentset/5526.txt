<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The House passed and sent to the Senate for final approval Thursday a $3 billion defense bill that will save the military from deep cutbacks starting next week. </P>
<P> It includes a last-minute provision to cut off U.S. loans to Mexico if Congress is not given documents on the loan deal, but Clinton administration officials gave quick assurances the deadline would be met so the loans would not be in jeopardy. </P>
<P> The House passed the bill 343-80. It will replenish Pentagon accounts drained by U.S. military operations in Haiti, Somalia, South Korea, Kuwait, Cuba and over Bosnia. </P>
<P> President Clinton and the Pentagon had warned that severe training and combat readiness cuts would have to begin next week without the money because some accounts are dry. </P>
<P> In a break with past practice, the bill takes $2.7 billion of the $3 billion out of other defense and domestic programs and $360 million from payments from Gulf allies for the U.S. buildup in Kuwait last year. </P>
<P> Republican leaders called that a warning to Clinton and future presidents not to commit U.S. troops to military operations abroad without Congress's approval. </P>
<P> ``Check with Congress first,'' said Rep. Bill Young, R-Fla., chairman of the National Security Appropriations Subcommittee. ``Don't just bring us in at the end to pay the check.'' </P>
<P> A provision attached to the bill late Wednesday would cut off remaining U.S. loans to Mexico under a $20 billion deal if Clinton does not give Congress all documents on the deal and on how Mexico is using the money to revive its economy. The White House and Treasury Department quickly assured Congress the deadline would be met and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin criticized Congress for adding the provision. </P>
<P> ``Now is the wrong time for Congress to be taking actions that could have the effect of disturbing financial markets when confidence (in Mexico) should be strengthening,'' he said. </P>
<P> Clinton and Democrats had wanted $275 million included in the bill to write off Jordan's $480 million U.S. debt as a reward for its peace agreement with Israel last year. But Republican leaders put the Jordan debt relief in a different bill that Congress will not complete for weeks. </P>
