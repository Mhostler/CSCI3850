<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Paratrooper Henry Hugh Shelton, the Army lieutenant general commanding the U.S. peacekeeping mission in Haiti, is a veteran of foreign military operations in Vietnam and the Gulf War. </P>
<P> Tall, hawk-nosed, plain-spoken and with a noticeable southern accent, Shelton landed in Port-au-Prince within minutes of helicopter-borne 10th Mountain Division troops from Fort Drum, New York, one of four divisions he commands. </P>
<P> Shelton, leader of the 18th Airborne Corps in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, will lead soldiers from 24 countries in Haiti. He was meeting Monday with Haitian Lieutenant General Raoul Cedras to discuss deployment of the multinational force. </P>
<P> Shelton's everyday job as commander of the airborne corps and the massive Army base at Fort Bragg entails responsibility for more than 85,000 active-duty military personnel. </P>
<P> Other divisions under Shelton's command are the 24th Mechanized Infantry, based in Fort Stewart, Georgia; the 82nd Airborne, based at Fort Bragg; and the 101st Airborne, based in Fort Campbell, Kentucky. </P>
<P> At 52, Shelton is a career Army man with nearly 30 years experience, including two stints in Vietnam, first as a platoon leader with a special forces group in 1966 and later as an intelligence and operations officer in 1969 and 1970. </P>
<P> In the Gulf War, Shelton was Assistant Division Commander of the 101st Airborne Division, based in Saudi Arabia. </P>
<P> The dominant impression officers at Fort Bragg have of Shelton is of an even-handed commander, cool under pressure, who inspires intense loyalty among ``gung-ho'' paratroopers. </P>
<P> His sense of humor is more chuckle than guffaw and his keen intelligence is sometimes underestimated by those who hear his folksy southern accent, one officer said. </P>
<P> Shelton was born in Tarboro, North Carolina, on January 2, 1942. He has a bachelor's degree in the gentle art of textile engineering from North Carolina State University and a master's degree in political science from Auburn University in Alabama. </P>
<P> His military education was taken at The Infantry School, the Air Command and Staff College and the National War College. </P>
<P> His official biography includes scant personal information, not even whether he is married or has children, and spokesmen at the Defense Department and Fort Bragg were not enlightening on these points. </P>
