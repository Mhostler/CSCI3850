<P>  What is being billed as the ``Nuremberg'' of Italy's political old guard began Tuesday when several leaders of the country's traditional political parties went on trial for graft. </P>
<P> Former prime ministers Bettino Craxi and Arnoldo Forlani are among 32 politicians, state managers and businessmen arraigned on charges ranging from illegal political party financing to fraud in the biggest trial in the two years of scandals that have rocked the country. </P>
<P> None of the principal defendants, who also include former ministers Gianni De Michelis and Paolo Cirino Pomicino, was present as the trial opened in Milan's main court-house. </P>
<P> Forlani and Craxi, ex-leaders of the once mighty Christian Democrat and Socialist parties, are on trial together with the heads of three junior parties which for years helped form ruling coalitions in Rome. </P>
<P> Local newspapers have dubbed the proceedings as another ``Nuremberg'' after the war crimes trial of Nazi leaders after World War Two. </P>
<P> But one of the symbols of the political revolution that has swept away the old guard in a wave of popular disgust at rampant corruption will also be in the dock. </P>
<P> Umberto Bossi, firebrand leader of the federalist Northern League, one of the three parties in Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's coalition which triumphed in elections earlier this year, is accused of accepting illegal financing for his party. </P>
<P> At the center of all the accusations is Italy's Ferruzzi group, the troubled foods-to-chemicals conglomerate. </P>
<P> Magistrates allege the group first sought to bribe its way out of a disastrous chemicals joint venture with state energy group ENI -- the so-called Enimont affair -- and then embarked on a systematic program of influence-buying ahead of the 1992 general election. </P>
