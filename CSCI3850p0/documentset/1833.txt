<P>  The United States is considering a visa request from Russian ultra-nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky who has denounced America, the State Department said Thursday. </P>
<P> Spokesman Mike McCurry said the visa application ``is under conmsideration.'' </P>
<P> ``We do not know whether he is an excludable person,'' McCurry told reporters, suggesting that the department might block his planned 14-day visit starting November 4. </P>
<P> Secretary of State Warren Christopher last January called Zhirinovsky ``beyond the pale'' and limited official U.S. contacts with him. </P>
<P> Zhirinvovsky, who has attacked the United States in numerous public statements, has also expressed an interest in meeting President Clinton. </P>
<P> At present, Zhirinovsky is visiting North Korea, a country he described Thursday as an ``oasis to the world people,'' according to Pyongyang's official news agency. </P>
<P> ``(North) Korea is the only country that has made great achievements in direct confrontation with the United States, an empire of evils, for nearly 50 years,'' he was quoted as saying. </P>
<P> ``The day will surely come when the evil United States ruins and the Korean people win.'' </P>
