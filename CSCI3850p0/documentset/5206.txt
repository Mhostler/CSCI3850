<P>  Israel has asked a Jewish settlement near Hebron in the West Bank to drop a former leader of the outlawed anti-Arab Kach movement from its town council, the settlement's mayor said on Sunday. </P>
<P> Kiryat Arba Mayor Zvi Katzover said he received a letter from an interior ministry official, who wrote that former Kach leader Baruch Merzel was not suited for public office because he was a convicted criminal. </P>
<P> ``Merzel says he was never convicted of a serious crime,'' Katzover told Reuters. </P>
<P> ``I'm waiting to hear from our legal adviser. If he says we must fire him, I will.'' </P>
<P> Israel outlawed the Kach movement, founded and headed by the late Rabbi Meir Kahane until he was shot dead in 1990, after U.S.-born settler Baruch Goldstein massacred 29 Palestinian worshippers at a Hebron mosque in February, 1994. </P>
<P> Merzel replaced Goldstein as the group's sole representative on the settlement's nine-member local council. He has been convicted repeatedly of rioting againt Palestinians. </P>
