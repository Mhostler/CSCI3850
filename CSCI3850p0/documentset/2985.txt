<P>  Eleven Chinese competitors in October's Asian Games, where China captured 137 gold medals, were stripped of their medals Saturday after testing positive for drugs, the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) said. </P>
<P> Two of those named, swimmers Lu Bin and Xiong Guoming, each won four gold medals at the Games. </P>
<P> An OCA statement said urine samples of the 11 competitors all showed traces of Dehydrotestosterone, DHT, a drug banned by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). </P>
<P> ``The OCA president decided that article 73 of the OCA constitution and rules be applied to all the 11 Chinese athletes whereby all honors and medals won by them during the XII Asian Games held in Hiroshima be withdrawn,'' the statement by the Kuwait-based OCA said. </P>
<P> In the first reaction from China, the Xinhua news agency quoted a Chinese Olympic Committee statement as saying a special panel had been formed to launch an investigation and impose ``severe punishment.'' </P>
