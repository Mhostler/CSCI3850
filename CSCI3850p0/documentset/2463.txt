<P>  Anyone trying to chase away the blues would be better off going for a run than settling down in front of a television set, a new study showed Monday. </P>
<P> ``We found that people like to take active mood management,'' said psychologist Robert Newman of California State University at Long Beach, a co-author of the study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. </P>
<P> The study found that exercise, be it an aerobics class or going for a jog, made a big difference in shaking off a bad mood, fighting anxiety and reducing tension, said Newman, who plays tennis when he has a bad day. </P>
<P> Watching television was not a good way to cheer up, the team found. </P>
<P> Listening to music was an effective mood-changing strategy. Hobbies, reading, shopping and even household chores worked for some people. </P>
<P> Men were more likely to turn to alcohol or drugs. Women were more likely to talk to someone, eat or smoke. </P>
<P> The study started by asking 102 college students to list how they fight off a bad mood. Their answers were used to do further research involving 308 people of all ages. </P>
<P> Twenty-six psychotherapists were also asked to rate strategies that they thought helped change moods. </P>
