<P>  The sister and mother of Ron Goldman, who was allegedly slain with Nicole Brown Simpson by O.J. Simpson, clashed on live television Wednesday in an public airing of their private lives. </P>
<P> Sharon Rufo told CNN's ``Larry King Live'' she came to Los Angeles from her home in St. Louis to hear the opening arguments in the murder trial of Simpson, who is accused of murdering his ex-wife and Goldman to correct the media's depiction of her as his estranged mother. </P>
<P> She said her ex-husband Fred Goldman, her daughter Kim Goldman and the Brown family had gotten far more media attention that she had. </P>
<P> ``Ron and I were very close and I resent the fact that I've been called the estranged mother,'' she said. ``I am not the estranged mother, the children lived with me after Fred and I got divorced.'' </P>
<P> Kim Goldman called in on the live program to talk to her mother shortly after that comment, saying, ``part of the reason you have not been included is because you have not included yourself in Ron's or my life from the beginning.'' </P>
<P> She said Ron and her ``biological'' mother were not close, and told Rufo, ``You don't have a right to sit here on national TV to claim your fame to Ron's death. You have only surfaced since Ron's death. You didn't even choose to come to the funeral until the day before.'' </P>
<P> Goldman said her mother ``walked out'' when she was just three-years-old and she and Ron had been raised by their father. She also denied she lived with Rufo after her parents' divorce and said she had ``put up with enough baloney from her.'' Goldman said Rufo had not seen Ron for at least 17 years. </P>
<P> Rufo, shaking her head throughout the telephone call and muttering, ``It's not true,'' lashed out at her daughter after she finished speaking, saying, ``I am sick and tired of hearing all this brainwashing that your father has done.'' </P>
<P> Rufo said her ex-husband had made it ``almost impossible'' for her to see her children and referred to problems in her second marriage that she had not ``dealt with'' yet. </P>
