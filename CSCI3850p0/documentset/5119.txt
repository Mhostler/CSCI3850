<DATELINE>CAIRO, March 23 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  PLO leader Yasser Arafat came to Cairo from Gaza on Thursday and went straight into talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. </P>
<P> Arafat is also expected to meet a delegation of U.S. businessmen and economists from the Council on Foreign Relations, a Washington-based, non-governmental institution. </P>
<P> The delegation, led by Henry Siegman, had a separate meeting with Mubarak before Arafat arrived. </P>
<P> Siegman told reporters after the meeting that his discussions with Arafat will concentrate on means of helping the international community to channel funding to the Palestinian self-rule authority in Gaza. </P>
<P> ``The whole point of our approach is to make sure that the funding is made available directly to the projects rather than being lost through complicated bureaucratic procedures,'' he said. </P>
<P> He said his delegation would will later meet representatives of donor countries to give them details of the meeting with Arafat. </P>
<P> ``We are basically focusing on public works projects that are labour intensive, and that will immediately bring some money into the pockets of the people in the area because they desperately need this kind of assistance,'' he added. </P>
<P> Siegman, who used to head a U.S.-based Jewish lobbying group and met Mubarak last week, said that 18 months after the signing of the PLO-Israeli peace treaty, no infrastructure projects had been carried out in Gaza. He said all parties, donors and the Palestinians, should be blamed for the delay. </P>
<P> Before his departure to Cairo, an adviser to Arafat told reporters that the PLO chief ``will be discussing mainly business ventures and investments.'' </P>
<P> Arafat met Mubarak with a large group of Palestinian officials, including economist Mohamed Zuhdi Nashashibi and negotiator Nabil Shaath. He left without speaking to reporters. </P>
<P> Arafat, eager to attract investment and development funds for the cash-strapped Palestinian self-rule Authority, is to meet U.S. Vice President Al Gore in the Jericho self-rule enclave in the West Bank on Friday. </P>
