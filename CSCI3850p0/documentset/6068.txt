<P>  A hearing for a Pennsylvania man who admits having sex with his daughter and is now charged with killing at least one of her babies was delayed for two weeks, a court official here said Wednesday. </P>
<P> The hearing on homicide charges against Paul Corvin was delayed until May 10 at the request of his attorney, said District Justice J. Bruce King in District Magistrate Court. </P>
<P> Corvin, 61, last week admitted to Scottdale police he had used his oldest daughter since she was nine years old ``for sex,'' as he described it. </P>
<P> His confession came after the daughter, who is now 39, told authorities in Florida of the remains of a newborn buried next to the family's former home there. She secretly gave birth to the infant in 1968 over a toilet when she was 12. </P>
<P> Corvin allegedly cut the newborn's umbilical cord, then failed to clear his air passage or help the baby remain alive, police said. </P>
<P> After Corbin's incest confession, his daughter also told investigators in Scottdale, a suburb near Pittsburgh where Corvin lived until the early 1970s, about the bones of a second infant she delivered in Scottdale in 1970. </P>
<P> Corvin, who now lives in nearby Connellsville, was charged with criminal homicide in the death of the Scottdale infant. </P>
<P> He also may be indicted for murder in the death of the baby buried in Florida. ``To my knowledge, he will be facing criminal charges in Florida, as well,'' King said. </P>
