<P>  Shed a tear for the Kansas City Milkman. H.L. Stevenson is dead. </P>
<P> Don't know the name? Stevenson was an editor-in-chief of United Press International in the 1960s and 1970s, when that agency went toe-to-toe with bigger, richer rivals worldwide on hustle, grit and telephone change. </P>
<P> The UPI credo was to make news copy clear and vivid with plenty of quotes and color -- write it for the ``Kansas City Milkman,'' the quip went -- and, for a couple of generations of reporters and editors, that credo was personified by the man known to everyone down to the copy aide as ``Steve.'' </P>
<P> He died Thursday night in St. Joseph's Medical Center in Stamford, Conn., not far from his home in Rye, N.Y., after a long illness. He was 65. </P>
<P> Athough an accomplished reporter in his own right, he made his mark mainly by motivating others: usually with enthusiasm, sometimes with a figurative kick in the pants, always by refusing to accept excuses from reporters who were outnumbered by those from their bitter rival, the Associated Press. </P>
<P> ``He was a newsman's newsman,'' said Ron Cohen, a former UPI Washington bureau chief and New York editor, and now National/Washigton editor for Gannett News Service. </P>
<P> ``He had a great feel for the news, great nose for what was interesting and important and exciting. He also had a great love for this business, boundless energy, and all of that came through to you if you worked for him.'' </P>
<P> A Stevenson hallmark was the personal compliment, scrawled on a piece of wire copy over his ``HLS'' signature and mailed to whatever obscure, far-flung reporter had written it.'' </P>
<P> ``And he wouldn't just write to you, he'd write to your boss, too,'' recalled David Wiessler, another Stevenson protege and now an editor with Bloomberg Business News in Washington. </P>
<P> Stevenson was born Nov. 23, 1929, in New Orleans but he was raised in Mississippi, where he acquired a southern drawl, a start in journalism with the Picayune Item and a special expertise in the black civil rights movement. </P>
<P> He joined UPI in 1953 and worked in bureaus across the South until the early 1960s. He became managing editor in 1965 and editor-in-chief and vice president in 1972, directing coverage of events from the Vietnam War and Watergate to presidential elections and the Apollo moon shots. </P>
<P> He left UPI in 1984. Until the onset of his fatal illness, he taught journalism at New York Univerity, was president of the Overseas Press Club Foundation and a Pulitzer Prize juror. </P>
<P> He is survived by his wife, LaVerne, and a daughter. </P>
