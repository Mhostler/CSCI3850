<P>  The vast majority of South Koreans believe their government should not underwrite the huge cost needed to reshape North Korea's nuclear programme unless Pyongyang accepts reactors from the South. </P>
<P> A survey published on Friday by the Chosun Ilbo newspaper showed 73.8 percent of respondents said that if the North refused South Korean reactors, Seoul must drop its commitment to finance the bulk of the $4.5 billion Washington promised to Pyongyang. </P>
<P> Under the accord reached last October, Washington promised Pyongyang the sum in new light-water reactors and alternative energy supplies in return for a freeze and an eventual removal of Pyongyang's existing nuclear programme. The West fears the North could use its existing reactors to make nuclear arms. </P>
<P> North Korea, still technically at war with the South since the 1950-53 Korean War ended without a peace treaty, has threatened to walk away from the nuclear deal if it is forced to accept South Korean-provided reactors. </P>
<P> The United States has said South Korea can provide the reactors since only Seoul has agreed to shoulder the huge cost and Washington wants to encourage inter-Korean dialogue. </P>
<P> A total of 56.8 percent of respondents believed the United States was not properly reflecting Seoul's position in its negotiations with the Stalinist country. </P>
<P> The survey, based on a sample of 515 people aged over 20, was carried out after North Korea put forward earlier this week a proposal that Seoul officials said allowed only a limited South Korean role in the reactor project. </P>
<P> Chosun Ilbo said the findings had a 4.3 percent error margin. </P>
<P> Security-related cabinet ministers and top advisers to President Kim Young-sam on Thursday agreed there was no reason why South Korea should be burdened with a large sum if it was not given a central role in the reactor project. </P>
<P> ``In regard to the question of assisting the reactor project for the North, the participants reaffirmed the government's stand that the South Korean standard must be adopted and our central role secured for design, manufacture and installation,'' a Unification Ministry spokesman said. </P>
<P> The policymakers, including Unification Minister Rha Woong-bae and Foreign Minister Gong Ro-myung, pointed out that Seoul wanted to improve relations with the North by helping to finance the reactors, the spokesman told reporters. </P>
<P> The Chosun Ilbo survey found 63.3 percent of South Koreans felt the possibility of a new war on the Korean Peninsula was almost nil. </P>
