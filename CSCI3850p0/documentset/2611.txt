<P>  The leader of Mozambique's former Renamo rebels, Afonso Dhlakama, has accepted the results of recent elections in his country even though he thinks there were irregularities, a U.N. spokesman said Monday. </P>
<P> He said Dhlakama had told Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali in a telephone conversation that he was in favor of peace and national reconciliation. </P>
<P> ``Mr Dhlakama thought there had been irregularities in the conduct of the recent elections, yet he had accepted their results and was prepared to cooperate with the government of Mozambique in the post-election era,'' the U.N. spokesman added. </P>
<P> According to incomplete returns from the Oct. 27-29 elections the Frelimo party, which has ruled since Mozambique's independence from Portugal in 1975, won nearly 46 percent of the votes in the contest for the 250-seat parliament, while Renamo (Mozambican National Resistance) obtained 37 percent. </P>
<P> In the presidential elections, President Joaquim Chissano obtained about 55 percent, while Dhlakama trailed with 33 percent. </P>
<P> Dhlakama, whose Renamo fought the government for 16 years until a 1992 peace accord, had boycotted the first day of voting on the grounds of alleged fraud, but rejoined the electoral process the next day under intense international pressure. </P>
