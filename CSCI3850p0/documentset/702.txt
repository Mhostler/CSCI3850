<DATELINE>TORONTO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A woman whose arm was viciously hacked off and her teeth pried out by the drunken leader of a religious cult was awarded a lump sum of $26,500 Canadian by an Ontario court, her lawyers said Wednesday. </P>
<P> Gabrielle Lavallee, a 44-year-old nurse, suffered prolonged abuse at the hands of Roch Theriault when she was a member of his commune near Burnt River, 59 miles northeast of Toronto, the Ontario Divisional Court heard Tuesday. </P>
<P> In one incident in July 1989, Theriault pinned Lavallee's hand to a kitchen table with a knife and then hacked off her arm with a carpet knife, a report to the court by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board. </P>
<P> ``He was drunk and he was clumsy and the process lasted approximately three hours,'' the report said. ``(Lavallee) was then left on the floor in a pool of blood, the severed arm at her side.'' </P>
<P> The following day, Theriault tried to mend the wound by stitching skin he had sliced from her breast, the report said. The next month he tried to cauterize the wound with a welding torch. </P>
<P> In 1988, Theriault pulled eight teeth from Lavallee's mouth with pliers in a six-hour drunken attempt to cure her toothache, the report said. </P>
<P> Lavallee was unable to tear herself away from Theriault, the report said. ``She believed that her salvation depended on following his every dictate,'' it said. </P>
<P> Lavallee, who was appealing an earlier ruling on the form of compensation, was also awarded an indefinite monthly payment of $1,000 Canadian by the court Tuesday. </P>
<P> Theriault was given a 10-year sentence for the assaults against Lavallee and is also serving a life sentence for the murder of another cult member. </P>
