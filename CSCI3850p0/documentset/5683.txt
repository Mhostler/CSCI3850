<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Investor Kirk Kerkorian shocked Detroit and Wall Street Wednesday, saying his Tracinda Corp., which owns 10 percent of Chrysler Corp., wants to buy the rest of the nation's No. 3 automaker. </P>
<P> Tracinda said former Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca, who is a director of its MGM Grand hotel and its airline company, would join as a substantial investor in the nation's No. 3 auto company but would take no management role. </P>
<P> The group said it was ready to pay $55 a share for the Chrysler stock it does not own, a 40 percent premium over Tuesday's closing price of $39.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock leaped to $49.50 in early trading Wednesday. </P>
<P> Based on Chrysler's 415 million outstanding shares, the offer values the automaker at $22.8 billion. </P>
<P> Chrysler vice president A.C. Liebler told reporters at the New York Auto Show that Chrysler would have an official statement on the offer later in the morning. </P>
<P> He said Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton, who was scheduled to speak at the show, would not appear as he was dealing with the Tracinda proposal. </P>
<P> ``As Chrysler's largest shareholder, our goal over the last five years has been to seek to enhance value for all Chrysler shareholders,'' Tracinda executive Alex Yemenidjian said in a statement announcing the offer. </P>
<P> ``We continue to believe that Chrysler's board of directors and Bob Eaton and his management team have done an excellent job of managing the company's operations. However, despite the efforts of Chrysler's board and management to enhance the market value of the company, the market continues to undervalue Chrysler stock.'' </P>
<P> Yemenidjian said Tracinda foresees no fundamental changes in Chrysler, its business prospects or its management. </P>
<P> He added that a buyout would not be a highly leveraged transaction. </P>
<P> ``This is not a leveraged buyout, where assets need to be sold to help finance the transaction,'' Yemenidjian said. ``The buyers are principals who are investing their own money.'' </P>
<P> On Tuesday, Chrysler cut its 1995 vehicle sales forecast for the third time this year, predicting automakers will sell a total of 15.5 million cars and trucks in the United States instead of its earlier estimate of 15.8 million. </P>
