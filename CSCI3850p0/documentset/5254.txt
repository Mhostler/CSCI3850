<P>  ``Burnt by the Sun,'' a film that examines the painful effects of Stalinism on a Bolshevik colonel, took top honors at the Academy Awards on Monday as the best foreign film. </P>
<P> The film, written and directed by Nikita Mikhalkov, beat out four other films, Cuba's ``Strawberry and Chocolate,'' Macedonia's ``Before the Rain,'' Taiwan's ``Eat Drink Man Woman'' and Belgium's ``Farinelli: Il Castrato.'' </P>
<P> During his acceptance speech, Mikhalkov paraphrased from Fellini's classic ``8 3/8'' and praised his daughter Nadia, who he used in the film and brought on stage with him. </P>
<P> ``I want to say the truth, which I don't know,'' he said. ''And maybe I want to say the truth, cruel truth. But I'm absolutely sure that the cruel truth without love is a lie.'' </P>
<P> Then turning his to his beaming daugther, he said: ``First time in my life I didn't have problem with actress.'' </P>
<P> Afterwards he told reporters he would like to continue to make movies in Russia. </P>
<P> ``That's why im criticizing my own country, not to leave it but to make it better,'' he said. ``I don't have an idea to leave. If somebody is interested in my art and they will subsidize it, I will work anywhere, but it must be my picture, the final cut will be mine.'' </P>
<P> Earlier, the legendary Italian filmmaker Michelangelo Antonioni was honored with a lifetime achievement award for films such as ``La Notte,'' ``Blow Up,'' and ``Red Desert.'' </P>
