<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The nation's Food Stamp Program will face much larger cuts in the House welfare bill than originally anticipated, according to Congressional Budget Office figures obtained by Reuters late Thursday. </P>
<P> If a bill approved last week by the House Agriculture Committee is enacted, Food Stamp outlays could be pared by almost $21.5 billion over the next five years, 30 percent more than the $16.5 billion in cuts earlier estimated. </P>
<P> The higher projected cuts in the nation's largest anti-hunger program brought swift and angry reaction from lawmakers who had voted against the reductions. </P>
<P> Calling the new numbers, ``the dirty secrets of the Republican food stamp cuts,'' Rep. Earl Pomeroy, democrat from North Dakota, said, ``We had a food stamp vote on fake numbers. The cuts went much deeper than what the Republicans told us.'' </P>
<P> Democrats on the House Agriculture Committee tried to delay the vote on the landmark Food Stamp Reform last week because at that time the Congressional Budget Office had not completed its analysis of the bill, nor provided any specific cost estimates. </P>
<P> Republicans over-ruled the objections then and proceeded with the vote in a marathon 14-hour hearing. </P>
<P> ``This is not incredibly higher than the $16.5 billion in cuts we were talking about ... we did our best to get an estimate, we missed by a little bit,'' said a Republican staff member of the committee when asked about the CBO estimates. </P>
<P> While cuts in the program are likely to be higher than the $16.5 billion originally predicted, they probably will not reach $21.5 billion, said Tom Hemmer, agriculture assistant to Rep. Pat Roberts, chairman of the House Agriculture Committee. </P>
<P> Hemmer said that because of proposed cuts in other welfare programs, food stamp benefits would actually go up for some recipients, resulting in cuts of $18.1 billion to $18.2 billion, still markely above the $16.5 billion benchmark. </P>
<P> The 31-year-old Food Stamp Program is the nation's cornerstone food assistance program and helped feed 27.5 million poor Americans last year, including more than 14 million children, at a cost of around $24 billion. </P>
<P> Sweeping reforms and cutbacks were approved by the committee last week as part of the House Republican promise to overhaul the nation's welfare system. The House is expected to vote on the full welfare reform package next week. </P>
<P> The CBO estimated that cuts in the program would increase substantially in further-out years, and that by the year 2000, outlays will be $6.2 billion below what they would be under current law, and that average monthly benefits per person would decrease by $6 relative to current law. </P>
<P> Putting a 2 percent cap on annual increases in food stamp benefits would produce the biggest cuts, said CBO, slashing payments by over $2 billion by the year 2000. </P>
<P> Implementing strict work requirements for food stamp recipients and freezing income and housing deductions at current levels would also result in big savings, according to the CBO. </P>
<P> In a strange twist however, the CBO estimated that reducing cash welfare payments for families, which is being considered by other committees, would actually increase food stamp benefits for some. </P>
<P> ``Under current rules, each dollar lost in cash would increase a participating family's food stamp benefits by an estimated 33 cents,'' said the CBO. </P>
