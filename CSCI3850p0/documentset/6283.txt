<DATELINE>OKLAHOMA CITY (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  With the search for bodies in the rubble of the federal office building nearing an end, rescue workers who have slogged through more than two weeks of often frustrating work are clearly frayed and emotional. </P>
<P> Medical Examiner Ray Blakeney, who has held daily briefings for the press to provide updated body counts, said Thursday the closing days are becoming harder. His eyes appeared to tear as he said, ``This is a very difficult time for me'' when reporters asked how he felt about the possibility that not all the bodies will be recovered. </P>
<P> ``Today is going to be a tough day. These bad, hard decisions have to be made,'' he said. Rescue workers have said it is conceivable that not all the missing will be recovered from the Alfred P. Murrah federal office building, which was blown up April 19 by a massive truck bomb. </P>
<P> By Thursday morning, 146 bodies had been pulled out, with about 25 still missing. Of those recovered, 16 were children. </P>
<P> The grueling ordeal and emotional toll were also evident when Orange County fire Capt. Edward Fleming spoke to reporters Thursday morning before leaving Oklahoma City. His group is the last of the out-of-state teams to leave after arriving some five days ago. </P>
<P> Fourteen of Fleming's group delivered a wreath to relatives of the bombing victims Thursday morning. At times appearing to blink back tears, Fleming said, ``We feel very sad to leave Oklahoma City because we are the last team out.'' </P>
<P> He spoke of typical days that began at 6 a.m. and lasted through the night, until this week, when the search was confined only to daylight hours. ``It was literally non-stop,'' he said, adding that the workers moved concrete, computer parts, books and rubble that ranged ``from the size of a pebble to the size a crane can lift.'' </P>
<P> He said he was troubled by the prospect of leaving some bodies unrecovered. The shakiness of the structure and the sheer force of the explosion have raised the possibility not all the deceased will be found, officials said. </P>
<P> ``It feels like there isn't complete closure,'' Fleming said, when asked how he felt. </P>
<P> Blakeney was asked what he planned to do after the recovery mission is complete. Eyes rimmed with fatigue, he said he would ``probably sleep for a while,'' mow his yard and ``redo the flower beds that have been neglected.'' </P>
<P> He said he also plans to attend any memorial service that is held at the building site. He believes it will help both him and the victims' families. </P>
