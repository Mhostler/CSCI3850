<P>  Polish Prime Minister Jozef Oleksy said Wednesday he would attend ceremonies in Moscow commemorating the end of World War II in a move highlighting a power struggle with President Lech Walesa over foreign policy. </P>
<P> Oleksy said he had informed Walesa he would attend the May 9 ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary of the wartime victory over Nazi Germany. </P>
<P> Walesa earlier turned down a delayed invitation to attend. His spokesman, Leszek Spalinski, was quoted as saying his reasons included Russia's military intervention in the breakaway region of Chechnya. </P>
<P> Poland's constitution gives the president special responsibility for foreign affairs, but Oleksy argues such matters should be decided jointly. </P>
<P> Calling for a resolution of the stalemate, Oleksy said he would meet Walesa and Foreign Minister Wladyslaw Bartoszewski Thursday to discuss better coordination of foreign policy. </P>
<P> ``We have to change a lot ... so there will be the necessary appearance of unity in Polish foreign policy,'' Oleksy told reporters. </P>
<P> Oleksy said he would go to Moscow not just to mark the wartime victory but as a positive signal to Russia. </P>
<P> ``The future of Polish-Russian relations is of great importance to me as premier,'' he said. </P>
<P> Oleksy has rejected suggestions by spokesman Spalinski that, as a former communist, he was attracted to Moscow because of the two countries' Soviet-era allegiances. </P>
<P> Walesa, former Solidarity labor union chief, has repeatedly called on Western countries to admit Poland to NATO rapidly, urging them not to heed Moscow's objections to an eastward expansion of the Atlantic alliance. </P>
<P> Russia has threatened to slow down conventional disarmament if NATO quickly admits East European countries, prompting concern in Poland that Western powers could delay its entry for fear of angering Moscow. </P>
