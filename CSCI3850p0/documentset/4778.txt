<P>  Sale of tiger products is widespread in Australia even though imports of tiger parts are illegal, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) said Wednesday. </P>
<P> A WWF undercover operation in the cities of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane revealed that 14 percent of 100 Oriental medical practitioners, grocers and herbalists sold products containing tiger bones or parts. </P>
<P> ``The demand for these products is alive and well in Australia,'' WWF chief executive officer David Butcher said. </P>
<P> While importing tiger products is illegal in Australia, the sale of products containing tiger parts is not. </P>
<P> WWF said the Australian government should introduce laws banning the possession and sale of tiger bone products. </P>
<P> ``Toughening up of laws should be accompanied by culturally appropriate and sensitive education schemes aimed at halting the demand for tiger medicines in Australia,'' Butcher said in a statement. </P>
<P> Demand for tiger bones in Oriental, particularly Chinese, medicine to treat rheumatism and other ailments has pushed the tiger to the brink of extinction. </P>
<P> Wildlife experts say as few as 5,000 tigers remain in the wild and some species are likely to die out by the end of the century. </P>
