<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Fifty Burmese students staged a brief protest demonstration at their embassy in Bangkok Sunday to mark to the sixth anniversary of a military coup that ended a nationwide uprising for democracy. </P>
<P> They called on the international community to put pressure on the junta that seized power then to hold direct talks with democracy campaigner Aung San Suu Kyi, who remains under house arrest in Rangoon. </P>
<P> They also demanded that the world community boycott the Burmese military and declare it illegal for junta leaders to deposit their money abroad. </P>
<P> The students, who carried pictures of their Nobel Peace Prize-winning heroine, dispersed peacefully after 20 minutes. </P>
<P> Thousands of Burmese students fled the military's harsh rule after the coup and many of them live in exile in Thailand. </P>
<P> September 18, 1988, hundreds of democracy campaigners were gunned down by soldiers in Rangoon streets and the military rulers, who have run Burma for decades under one guise or another, reconstituted themselves as the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), which continues to control all aspects of life in the country. </P>
<P> ``There is a strong rumor that the junta will hold discussions with her early next month,'' A Rangoon-based diplomat told Reuters in the telephone interview Sunday. </P>
<P> He said said that despite the anniversary, there were no celebrations, parades or protests in Rangoon. </P>
