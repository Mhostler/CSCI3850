<DATELINE>DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  An off-duty Russian soldier has been shot dead in Tajikistan in the latest attack on Russian forces stationed in the former Soviet republic, newspapers reported Monday. </P>
<P> Russia has 25,000 troops in Tajikistan and guards its border with Afghanistan under a bilateral agreement with the ex-Communist government in Dushanbe which came to power after a bloody civil war in 1992. </P>
<P> Islamic and liberal opposition groupings waged a sporadic guerrilla campaign from bases in Afghanistan after their defeat in the civil war. But a cease-fire agreed in October has held. </P>
<P> Sgt. Yuri Novikov, 30, of Russia's 201st Division, was found shot in the head 15 miles south of Dushanbe Sunday, the newspapers quoted military sources as saying. </P>
<P> He was the fourth soldier of the 201st Division, which is based in Dushanbe, to be killed in 10 days. </P>
<P> The military sources said several Russian soldiers had been killed in the Tajik capital, but the perpetrators had not been found and it was impossible to say whether the killings were politically or criminally motivated. </P>
<P> Tajikistan is holding a general election Sunday against the backdrop of a stalled peace process. </P>
<P> President Imomali Rakhmonov has shrugged off calls from international organizations to postpone the election and give the opposition a chance to organize and register. </P>
<P> His government said the opposition was not interested in the election. The opposition boycotted presidential elections last November. </P>
