<P>  Khun Sa, the notorious ``Golden Triangle'' opium warlord, has offered to end opium growing in Burma's Shan state and surrender in exchange for a Burmese military pullout from the northern part of the country. </P>
<P> ``In response to the reports in the New York Times, I would like to offer to give myself up to the international community in exchange for the independence of Shan state,'' Khun Sa said in a statement dated Saturday and faxed to Reuters Sunday by a spokesman, Khuensai Chayane. </P>
<P> The New York Times Friday reported that Burma's military leaders were offering the United States a deal that they would topple Khun Sa if the United States would lift its arms embargo on Rangoon. </P>
<P> Khun Sa's statement said there was ``no need to support the universally-hated Burmese military in order to catch me. I'm, as I always have been, fighting for independence. If the right of self-determination of our people is recognized and guaranteed, and the Burmese shall withdraw from our homeland, I will sacrifice myself....'' </P>
<P> The statement, signed by Khun Sa in his capacity of self-declared president of the Shan State Restoration Council, also said the Shan people would voluntarily stop growing opium once they won freedom. </P>
<P> But he warned that opium cultivation would continue if the Burmese junta did not grant the Shan state freedom. </P>
<P> ``With the victory of the Burmese military, the people shall only be more oppressed and suppressed, which will force them to rely more and more on poppy cultivation in order to survive,'' he added. Opium is the source of heroin. </P>
<P> The 60-year-old Khun Sa, alias Chang Si-fu, is half Chinese half Shan and commands the 20,000-strong Mong Tai Army (MTA), which has been engaged in fighting with thousands of Burma's troops since late last year. </P>
<P> Khun Sa's statement offering to surrender is viewed here as likely to get a cool response from the U.SS government, which previously turned down an offer by him to eradicate opium from Shan state in exchange for $390 million. That demand was seen as an attempt at extortion by a narcotics trafficker. </P>
<P> In early 1990 Khun Sa was indicted by a U.S. court on charges of heroin trafficking in the United States. </P>
<P> He denies the charge and maintains he only taxes opium traders who travel through areas his forces control in the Golden Triangle, one of the world's richest opium producing areas where the borders of Burma, Laos and Thailand meet. </P>
