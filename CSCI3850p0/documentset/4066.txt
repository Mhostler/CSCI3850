<P>  Former Colorado senator and presidential hopeful Gary Hart will host his own talk-radio program, according to the director of a Colorado radio station. </P>
<P> KOA-AM, which can be heard in parts of 38 states, will air Hart's interview show starting Sunday, said program director Kris Olinger. </P>
<P> ``There is a great deal of criticism of talk radio, that it's too conservative,'' Olinger said. KOA broadcasts conservative pundit Rush Limbaugh's daily show. </P>
<P> Hart, a 1988 Democratic presidential contender, who withdrew following reports of an alleged romance with model Donna Rice, now practices law in Denver. </P>
<P> Hart's program, which will kick off with a one-hour interview with actor, environmentalist and Colorado resident Dennis Weaver, will follow Ross Perot's weekly radio show. </P>
