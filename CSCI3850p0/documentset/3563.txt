<P>  A New Jersey company has been ordered to pay a criminal fine of $1.5 million for improperly disposing of a toxic chemical that caused the deaths of two 9-year-old boys trapped in a dumpster, the U.S. Attorney's Office announced Tuesday. </P>
<P> The William Recht Company Inc., doing business as Durex Industries, also was sentenced to five years probation, during which time it must implement an environmental compliance program, a statement from the federal prosecutor's office said. </P>
<P> Two former company employees are scheduled to begin serving 27-month prison terms Wednesday in connection with the case. A jury convicted them last year of illegally treating, storing and disposing of waste toluene. </P>
<P> The fine was the maximum allowed by law, prosecutors said. </P>
<P> ``We are extremely pleased with the court's sentence. It sends an appropriate message to those businesses which generate, treat, store and dispose of hazardous waste,'' U.S. Attorney Charles Wilson said in the statement. </P>
<P> The company pleaded guilty July 13 to ``knowingly endangering'' other people by improperly treating and storing waste toluene, officials said. </P>
<P> The charges stemmed from the deaths of the two boys, who died of toluene intoxication June 12, 1992, after they were trapped in a Durex dumpster. The company had disposed of waste toluene generated during the manufacture of ink rollers for the printing industry, officials said. </P>
