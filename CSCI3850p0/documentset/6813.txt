<DATELINE>PAKRAC, Croatia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Atrocities were committed during the Croatian army's recapture of a breakaway Serb enclave three weeks ago, a U.N. human rights investigator said Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``There have been atrocities,'' Tadeusz Mazowiecki said during a tour of the region, declining to give further details immediately. Croatia has denied allegations its security forces mistreated Serb civilians and captured rebels. </P>
<P> ``I'm assessing the facts. We are looking into the course of events this month and the fate of the missing,'' Mazowiecki, the U.N. special investigator on human rights, told reporters in the Western Slavonia region's main town of Pakrac. </P>
<P> Veljko Dzakula, the local Serb leader standing alongside Mazowiecki, said the difficulty in obtaining any firm information about missing people was of deep concern. </P>
<P> U.N. officials and Serbs who did not join a refugee exodus during the Croatian offensive have given civilian police credit for generally restrained behavior in the region since. No hard evidence of major human rights abuses has emerged in public. </P>
<P> U.N. officials do have reports of Croatian troops beating Serb men during or after detention and looting Serb homes. </P>
<P> Two-thirds of the enclave's 15,000 Serbs fled the Croatian onslaught over U.N. cease-fire lines. Two thousand more, fearing persecution by reinstated Croatian authorities, have been evacuated to Bosnia by the United Nations at their request since then. </P>
<P> The Croatian government said 300 to 400 Serbs died in the May 1-2 fighting but only as combatants or victims of crossfire. </P>
<P> In a report issued Monday, the government said 188 Serb bodies had been recovered from areas affected by fighting. The bodies were buried in various sites, some of which were to be inspected by Mazowiecki. </P>
<P> The large majority of around 2,000 Serb prisoners of war had been released. About 185 were still being held on suspicion of war crimes, according to the government. </P>
<P> Croatian leaders have repeatedly pledged full civil rights, including citizenship, to Serbs remaining in Western Slavonia. </P>
<P> U.N. peacekeepers privately express doubts about Croatia's human rights commitment, citing continuing curbs on U.N. observers' access to parts of Western Slavonia and the army's seizure of 17 U.N. observation posts there. </P>
<P> Minority Serbs grabbed almost a third of Croatia in a 1991 revolt against its secession from federal Yugoslavia and drove over 200,000 Croat neighbors out of territory taken. </P>
<P> The separatists' loss of Western Slavonia in central Croatia left them holding a little over 20 percent of the country divided between two enclaves in the east and southwest. </P>
