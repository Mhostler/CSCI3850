<P>  Drug gangs in Rio, frustrated by a military-led crackdown on narcotics, have turned their hand to violent bank robberies, a senior police officer said Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``In late November and early December, there was a worsening of the problem, which we think is due to the crackdown on drugs,'' Rafik Louzada Aride, head of an anti-bank robbery unit with Rio's police, told Reuters. </P>
<P> Police figures show that in July, 33 bank raids took place in Rio. In November, when the army began occupying and surrounding shanty-towns to crush the drug trade, that number rose to 46. So far in December there have been at least 15 raids. </P>
<P> Aride said police believe an estimated 16 criminal gangs specialize in bank robbery in the city and they are usually anxious to avoid violence, Aride said. </P>
<P> However, the traffickers and bank robbers, who are younger than the members of the specialized gangs, often enter banks with guns blazing, the police officer said. </P>
<P> A truck driver was killed by a ricocheting bullet Monday as 15 armed men blasted their way through a security door in a bank. Four customers of the bank were also injured. </P>
