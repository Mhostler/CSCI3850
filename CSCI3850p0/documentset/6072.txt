<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A doctor testified Wednesday that a defendant on trial for plotting to bomb U.S. landmarks and for killing Rabbi Meir Kahane had told him during an office visit that he had a duty to shoot the radical rabbi. </P>
<P> Prosecutors allege that the Kahane murder was part of a plan by El Sayyid Nosair and 10 others -- including Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, a radical Egyptican cleric -- to ``wage a war of urban terrorism'' in the United States. </P>
<P> The men are on trial in federal court for planning the fatal 1993 explosion at the World Trade Center that killed six and injured more than 1,000 and for plotting bombings at the United Nations building and other locations. </P>
<P> They are also accused of murdering Kahane and of planning to kill Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak during a visit here. </P>
<P> Nosair was acquitted of state charges of murder in the killing of Kahane, but was convicted of lesser weapons and assault charges. </P>
<P> Dr. Craig Nunn, a surgeon who had treated the imprisoned Nosair in a follow-up visit for a bullet wound he received in a shootout after the Kahane murder, testified that Nosair admitted to having committed the murder. </P>
<P> Nunn, who did not record the statements in his medical record, did not testify at the state trial. </P>
<P> ``He seemed to be very polite and cooperative with me. ... I didn't understand how such an apparently nice man could have killed somebody, so I said I don't understand how you could have killed somebody,'' Nunn said. </P>
<P> The doctor said Nosair responded, ``I had no choice, it was my duty.'' </P>
<P> Another witness, Alan Herdzik, a corrections sergeant at the state prison in Attica, testified that he had spoken with Nosair when he was placed in a segregated area called the ``special housing unit,'' or SHU. </P>
<P> Herdzik said Nosair asked why he was being housed there and the sergeant replied that he was to be interviewed by a higher ranking officer who would explain the situation. </P>
<P> Herdzik quoted Nosair as responding, ``If the devil leaders of New York state think placing me in SHU will end the war, they are wrong. The war will not end until I am released. This is only the beginning.'' </P>
