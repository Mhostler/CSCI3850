<P>  The United States said Tuesday that it wished India had given more warning that a visit by U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin would overlap with one by the president of Iran, which Washington regards as a terrorist state. </P>
<P> ``I think we would like to have been informed of that sooner, yes,'' State Department deputy spokeswoman Christine Shelly told reporters. </P>
<P> Rubin, the first U.S. treasury secretary to visit India in 20 years, told reporters in New Delhi earlier in the day that he would have postponed his trip had he known far enough in advance that Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani would be in town at the same time. </P>
<P> Shelly said the United States was informed of Rafsanjani's visit last week, the eve of Rubin's departure. </P>
<P> ``We're told that his trip is going well, and if we had learned sooner about Rafsanjani's visit, it's possible that the exact timing of Mr. Rubin's trip might have been reconsidered,'' she said. </P>
<P> In New Delhi, Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao ignored U.S. criticism of Iran Tuesday and hailed Rafsanjani's three-day state visit as a landmark event in bilateral ties. </P>
