<P>  France's Mary Pierce beat top seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in straight sets at the Australian Open Saturday to secure her first-ever Grand Slam title and delay the Spaniard's claiming of the world No. 1 ranking. </P>
<P> The Canada-born Pierce, still only 20, won 6-3, 6-2 to avenge her defeat in last year's French Open and give France its first Grand Slam victory since 1967. </P>
<P> The fourth-seeded Pierce, who had not dropped a set on her way to the final, battled her way through a scrappy first set to blitz Sanchez Vicario with a stunning display of power tennis in the second. </P>
<P> ``This is unbelievable for me, I'll never forget this in my whole life,'' Pierce said afterwards. ``All the hard work has really paid off.'' </P>
<P> She also had a special word of thanks for new coach Nick Bollettieri, who returned to the United States earlier in the week and has since been advising her by telephone. </P>
<P> The aggressive Pierce broke Sanchez Vicario to lead 3-2 with a searing cross-court forehand and then produced a string of eight successive points to go into an unassailable 5-2 lead. </P>
<P> She won the match and a pay check of $360,000 on her own serve with an equally authoritative backhand before throwing her arms in the air in delight. </P>
<P> Sanchez Vicario congratulated Pierce on playing ``a great match'' and told the crowd: ``It's my second final here ... maybe the third one will be the lucky one.'' </P>
<P> The world No. 2 was trounced by Steffi Graf 6-0, 6-2 last year but then went on to win the French and U.S. Opens, and with the injured German absent here, Sanchez Vicario would have earned the No. 1 crown had she won. </P>
<P> But as it transpired, the withdrawal of Graf from next week's Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo means that Sanchez Vicario, winner of three Grand Slams, will still overtake her when the following week's rankings are released on Feb. 6. </P>
<P> Sanchez Vicario said it would have been more satisfying to take the top ranking by winning the Australian title. </P>
<P> ``It is something I have dreamed about but it would have been nicer if I had won here,'' she told reporters. ``I have worked hard to be number one.'' </P>
<P> She blamed her poor serving for her defeat and said slight tendinitis in her right arm had caused her some pain when she served. </P>
<P> ``I just didn't serve well enough, she took advantage of that ... she played better than me,'' she said. </P>
<P> In fact both women struggled to impose themselves early in the match with the opening four games all going against serve, an ominous start for Pierce in particular whose service had been so reliable in previous rounds. </P>
<P> A marathon 12-minute fourth game went to deuce five times before the Spaniard put a forehand deep over the baseline to allow Pierce to pull back to 2-2 on her third game point. </P>
<P> The long game appeared to settle the younger player, who was playing her first Australian Open final, and she promptly won her first service game to take a 3-2 lead. </P>
<P> She then had Sanchez Vicario 0-30 down in the next game, but the top seed responded with typical determination to pull even at 3-3 in warm, sunnny conditions on center court. </P>
<P> Many of the early rallies were lengthy baseline affairs but it was Pierce who was forcing her opponent into errors and finally took the initiative, getting a break for 5-3 and quickly clinching the set in 47 minutes. </P>
<P> When Pierce broke Sanchez Vicario again to take the opening game of the second set, things began to look even gloomier for the Spaniard, who had not previously dropped a set in the tournament. </P>
<P> But the French player had reckoned without the Spaniard's hallmark fighting qualities and swiftly found herself 2-1 down as the sun was replaced by grey clouds and the rumbling of thunder. </P>
<P> Pierce was also showing some signs of losing her previous composure and shouted angrily, slapping her leg when she hit an easy forehand into the net to go 15-30 down on her own serve. </P>
<P> But she pulled herself together and won the game with a forehand smash at the net to tie the set at 2-2. </P>
<P> Pierce, whose unpredictable temperament had let her down in big matches before, was clearly upset in the fifth game when a doubtful line call gave game point to Sanchez Vicario. </P>
<P> She remonstrated in front of the umpire's chair to no avail but it was Sanchez Vicario who appeared more rattled when the game resumed, serving two double faults to allow Pierce a vital break. </P>
<P> Pierce then moved on to another level, driving back Sanchez Vicario and forcing a string of errors with some supercharged groundstrokes to take the next eight points and move into a 5-2 lead. </P>
<P> As rain threatened, Pierce brought up two match points on her own serve when Sanchez Vicario put a loose forehand into the net, her 30th unforced error. She sealed the match in one hour, 25 minutes with a scorching backhand. </P>
