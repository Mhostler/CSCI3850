<P>  The Cambodian ministry of interior is investigating reports that Khmer Rouge guerrillas are cooperating with Burmese opium king Khun Sa, a newspaper reported on Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``The Khmer Rouge (seem) to have relations with people who operate in the Golden Triangle who are led by Khun Sa,'' the Cambodia Daily quoted Interior Ministry deputy-general Ngoun Soeur as saying. </P>
<P> Soeur, who is also deputy-director of the National Police, said Khmer Rouge guerrillas could be ``responsible for transferring as much as 600 kg (1,320 lb) of heroin a week'' through Cambodia. </P>
<P> The Golden Triangle opium-growing region covers the tri-border area of northeastern Burma, northern Thailand and northwestern Laos. </P>
<P> Soeur said the rebels were short of money after international pressure forced Thai authorities to clamp down on the guerrillas' illegal gem and timber trade. </P>
<P> A senior government spokesman on Wednesday confirmed the story, saying poor border controls made it easy for dealers to use Cambodia as a springboard for drug trafficking. </P>
<P> ``The drugs are coming from Burma and go through Thailand to Cambodia,'' Ministry of Information spokesman Sieng Lapresse told Reuters, adding once in Cambodia it was easy for traffickers to pass the drugs on to other countries. </P>
<P> Many of the weapons used by Khun Sa's army are believed to come from Cambodia, sold by gun-runners on the Thai-Cambodian border and then smuggled across Thailand to Burma. </P>
