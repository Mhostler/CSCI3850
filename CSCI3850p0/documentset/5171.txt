<P>  Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev called on central and eastern Europe nations Friday to consider other security options apart from membership in NATO and the European Union. </P>
<P> Speaking after a day of talks with Hungarian Foreign Minister Laszlo Kovacs and Prime Minister Gyula Horn, Kozyrev told a news conference he had put forward a plan aimed at considering other models for building a post-Cold War security structure in Europe. </P>
<P> ``We do not want to present something that would be seen as substituting existing institutions like NATO, (the) European Union, especially OSCE itself,'' he said. </P>
<P> Kozyrev came to Hungary, which currently chairs the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), after talks with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Geneva. </P>
<P> ``We want to try to contribute to open-minded discussion, building on existing structures but not limited to existing structures,'' Kozyrev said. </P>
<P> Russia is opposed to the former communist countries of central and eastern Europe joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and would prefer to build a security structure around a body like the OSCE. </P>
<P> Kozyrev told a two-day European security conference in Paris earlier this week that any moves by NATO to take in countries such as Poland and Hungary quickly would be dangerous. </P>
<P> At Friday's news conference, he said Russia was not threatening central and eastern European states, nor was it exercising a veto on any plans they might have to join western institutions. But Russia would prefer to create a security system based on partnership. </P>
<P> The proposed Kozyrev plan assesses the role of NATO in European security and considers the political and military implications of merging the organization into a security structure more acceptable to Russia. </P>
<P> Kozyrev said he hoped as a first step that his proposal would stimulate discussion within the OSCE on alternative European security models. </P>
