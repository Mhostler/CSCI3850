<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Two astronauts doubled as appliance repairmen Friday as they tinkered with a balky Japanese heater needed for science experiments aboard the space shuttle Columbia. </P>
<P> Co-pilot Jim Halsell and payload commander Rick Hieb were alloted about four hours to complete the maintenance job to salvage several biotechnology experiments. The Japanese heater developed a coolant line blockage when crewmembers powered it up for use a few days ago. </P>
<P> Since their launching July 8 the astronauts -- six American men and a Japanese woman -- have been working in two shifts around the clock on 82 different experiments from 13 countries. The research is done in Spacelab, a windowless pressurized module inside the shuttle's cargo bay. </P>
<P> The astronauts have encountered a variety of technical glitches during the first half of their two-week mission, including two video recorders that mangled science data and tapes and had to be turned off. </P>
<P> Several biological processing experiments were postponed when a free-flow electrophoresis unit malfunctioned. </P>
<P> The unit uses an electrical field to separate the genetic components of cells in a solution. The process creates ultrapure biological materials -- such as insulin-producing cells which can be used in pharmaceutical products. </P>
<P> About half the studies on this 63rd shuttle mission involve tests of gravity-free manufacturing processes. The other half are designed to see how fish, salamanders and other living creatures behave in the absence of gravity. </P>
<P> In a week, two Japanese red-bellied newts and at least 16 Medaka minnows have hatched in small shuttle aquariums which astronauts tend at least twice a day. </P>
<P> Scientists are investigating how weightlessness affects adult spawning behavior and the development of gravity receptors in the embryos. </P>
