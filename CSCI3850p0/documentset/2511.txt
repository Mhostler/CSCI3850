<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  What an election. Mario Cuomo loses, Ann Richards crashes, Danny Rostenkowski gets rejected by the people in Chicago that he got all those big government projects for and Sonny Bono gets elected to Congress. </P>
<P> ``I got you, babe!'' as Sonny used to sing when he was still a longhaired hippie performer with ex-wife Cher and not a shorthaired Calforinia Republican politician, worried about family values. </P>
<P> The American political landscape resembled the craters of the moon Wednesday morning. The rich and the famous, the household names of American politics, have largely disappeared overnight from public stage leaving large holes in their wake. </P>
<P> ``Where have all the flowers gone?'' </P>
<P> The eloquence of New York Gov. Cuomo, the stinging wit of his Texas counterpart, Ann Richards, are now items to place on resumes as they hunt for new work. </P>
<P> Jim Sasser, the Tennesee Democratic senator who could have been elected Senate majority leader had the Democrats prevailed, was defeated by a Republican doctor who didn't vote until 1988. </P>
<P> House Speaker Tom Foley fought for his political life through the night. As did California's Sen. Diane Feinstein. </P>
<P> Kathleen Brown failed to become the third member of her family to be governor of California. Jeb Bush, the son of former president George Bush, lost his bid to become governor of Florida without a day's political experience. </P>
<P> But his brother, George W. Bush, won the governorship of Texas, besting Richards who called his dad a man ``born with a silver foot in his mouth.'' </P>
<P> Edward Kennedy, the last of the Kennedy brothers who tried to change the American political landscape, won re-election after a tough fight. He and Cuomo were prime Republican targets. </P>
<P> Cuomo, as graceful a speaker as any on the American scene, went out gracefully. </P>
<P> On the night of his defeat, he found the strength to deliver this gem to a crowd of supporters in his concession speech: ''E.B. White told us, remember, New York is to the nation what the church spire is to the village, the symbol of aspiration and faith. The white plume saying the way is up not down, not backward ... excelsior, let's keep going up.'' </P>
<P> Hillary Rodham Clinton's brother Hugh lost his bid to be a senator from Florida. Larry Echohawk lost his try to be the first American Indian to become a state governor despite bales of publicity. </P>
<P> Even a son-in-law lost. Joel Hyatt lost his bid to succeed his father-in-law Howard Metzenbaum as a senator from Ohio. </P>
<P> Most of the above are Democrats but the biggest loser of the night -- outside of President Clinton -- was a Republican, Oliver North, the key figure in the Iran-Contra scandal. </P>
<P> Convicted of lying to Congress, North came close to getting elected to the Senate from Virginia, the home of George Washington, the man who never told a lie. Or so he said. </P>
