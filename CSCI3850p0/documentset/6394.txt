<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Israel Tuesday shrugged off Jordanian and Moroccan warnings its planned land confiscation in Arab East Jerusalem could hurt fledgling ties with Arab states. </P>
<P> Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said it was a ``mistake'' not to have been more sensitive about how the confiscation plan was announced April 27. But he said the decision had to stand. </P>
<P> ``We also have to be careful not to be seen as retreating. We are in a very complicated situation,'' he told Israel Radio. </P>
<P> ``Israeli doubt (on claims to Jerusalem) would bring enormous world pressure,'' Peres said. </P>
<P> Jordan's Ambassador to Israel, Marwan Muasher, Monday warned Deputy Foreign Minister Yossi Beilin that Amman would take action affecting bilateral ties established only last October if the confiscation went ahead. </P>
<P> Moroccan media said last week that King Hassan sent Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin a message strongly protesting at the confiscation and calling it a ``bombshell'' that could have ``serious repercussions'' for the entire Middle East. </P>
<P> Israeli Environment Minister Yossi Sarid, a senior peace negotiator with the PLO and a leading dove, said the seizure of 131 acres should be ``frozen'' but not cancelled. </P>
<P> Peres has said 62 percent of the open land to be confiscated is actually Jewish-owned but Palestinians dispute that. Israel plans Jewish housing and a police station on the majority of the plots but has said 400 housing units will be built for Arabs. </P>
<P> At one planned confiscation site, dozens of Israeli and Palestinian peace activists demonstrated against the land grab. Some held signs reading ``Yes to Peace, No to Settlements.'' </P>
<P> Beilin said the Jordanian and Moroccan warnings were a function of newly-established diplomatic relations. </P>
<P> ``It's clear, when an issue such as this comes up, like land confiscation, they will exploit their ties with us in order to achieve their position,'' Beilin told army radio. </P>
<P></P>
<P> ``I don't believe we are talking about a threat like that. Certainly such a threat was not given me... We agreed to disagree.'' </P>
<P> Muasher took up his post as Jordan's first envoy to Israel in April. The two states signed a peace treaty on Oct. 26. </P>
<P> An Arab League meeting agreed Saturday to seek an urgent U.N. Security Council meeting to try to stop Israel. </P>
<P> Israel captured and annexed Arab East Jerusalem in 1967 and vows never to cede any of it. Palestinians want it as capital of a future state. </P>
