<P>  Conservative Texas Sen. Phil Gramm was the overwhelming choice for the White House of Louisiana Republicans Saturday in the first straw vote of the 1996 presidential campaign. </P>
<P> Gramm, who has campaigned heavily in Louisiana in recent months, got more than 70 percent of the vote, winning 902 of the 1,247 votes cast. </P>
<P> Senate majority leader Bob Dole, considered a national front-runner with high name recognition, finished fifth with 28 votes. </P>
<P> Visibly elated, Gramm said after the vote he had hoped to win but did not anticipate the margin of victory would be so substantial. </P>
<P> ``We won the first battle in this long war,'' he said. ''There will be ups and downs, and we won't win every battle, but we won the first one.'' </P>
<P> ``Am I starting to measure the draperies at the White House? No,'' Gramm quipped. ``But I believe this is very significant.'' </P>
<P> Louisiana's three Republican congressmen -- Bob Livingston, Jim McCrery and Richard Baker -- have endorsed Gramm. </P>
<P> Arizona Sen. John McCain, who campaigned with Gramm, said, ''I can't help but believe this will give the campaign significant momentum.'' </P>
<P> Gramm said his supporters will start gearing up for the Super Tuesday presidential preference primary, while he campaigns all-out in other states for straw poll and primary victories. </P>
<P> There is some question as to how broad-based Gramm's Louisiana support actually is. </P>
<P> The primary purpose of the convention was to annoint the party's official candidate for governor in 1995. But moderate Republicans, including two former governors, shunned the delegate selection process, claiming the caucuses were weighted toward the party's far right. </P>
<P> About 8,000 of the state's 416,000 registered Republicans participated in the caucuses last month. </P>
<P> Television commentator and former presidential candidate Pat Buchanan ran a distant second with 150 votes, while former U.S. Education Secretary and Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander was third with 58 votes. </P>
<P> Nationally syndicated radio talk-show host Alan Keyes tied for fourth place with former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp at 36 votes each. </P>
<P> Only Gramm, Alexander, Keyes and Buchanan campaigned in person at the convention. </P>
<P> Former Vice President Dan Quayle won 17 votes, with Massachusets Gov. William Weld, California Gov. Pete Wilson, U.S. Rep. Bob Dornan and and former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, who pulled out of the race last week, sharing 20 votes. </P>
<P> No one voted for Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter. </P>
