<P>  NATO warplanes flew over Serb forces after a British peacekeeping unit came under ``heavy and sustained'' fire in eastern Bosnia Wednesday, but the patrol escaped without injury, a U.N. spokesman said. </P>
<P> ``A patrol of 12 men came under anti-aircraft fire from Serb forces this afternoon outside Gorazde town and three of the British soldiers were pinned down for about four hours,'' Lt. Col. Gary Coward told Reuters. </P>
<P> ``The fire was heavy and sustained, and NATO air presence was requested. A rapid reaction team was also sent from Gorazde town. The three soldiers finally made their escape after dark and all patrol members are reported safe.'' </P>
<P> Coward said jets from NATO, which serves as the United Nations' enforcement arm in Bosnia, maintained a presence in the area but did not fire at the British patrol's Serb attackers. </P>
<P> Gorazde is a government-held enclave in eastern Bosnia surrounded by separatist Serbs. </P>
