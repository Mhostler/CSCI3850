<P>  Flood waters receded from all areas of Georgia Friday, leaving behind short-range difficulties in finding clean water and long-term environmental problems involving spilled gas and chemicals. </P>
<P> Residents in small Georgia towns along the rain-swollen Flint River prepared to return to their homes Friday after the weather service said the river had crested at Bainbridge, the last town before the river empties into Lake Seminole on the border of Georgia and Florida. </P>
<P> At its peak, the flood drove more than 30,000 people from their homes. About 3,800 residents of Bainbridge still waited for the flood waters to recede from residential portions of the town of 14,000 people in the southwest corner of the state. </P>
<P> But in addition to the concerns for flooded homes and businesses, there continued to be major problems throughout the state. In Macon, officials said their plans to restore municipal water supplies by Monday had been delayed by worse-than-expected flood damage. </P>
<P> Gene Holcomb, executive director of the Macon Water Authority, said the city hopes to have water restored by the end of next week, but it could be mid-August before the water is clean enough to drink. </P>
<P> The state also faces a huge problem with the congressional and gubernatorial primary scheduled Tuesday. Flood waters are still expected to cover some polling places in Georgia. </P>
<P> Elections officials said Friday that temporary polling places will be set up in tents to replace locations wrecked by the flood. </P>
<P> Federal and state officials expressed concern for the potential environmental problems caused by the flood. </P>
<P> In the flooded area, there are more than 1,300 locations where 10,000 pounds or more of hazardous materials were stored, said Bert Langley, emergency response coordinator for the state's Environmental Protection Division. ``We're talking about 7,000 different chemicals,'' Langley said. </P>
<P> About half those sites are service stations storing gasoline. Langley said many of the gasoline storage tanks have broken loose from their moorings and are now floating downstream, spilling their contents. </P>
<P> Much of the toxic material has been highly diluted by the flood waters, Langley said. ``A lot of the stuff that has spilled last week already is in the Gulf of Mexico,'' he said. </P>
<P> Even the water itself poses an environmental risk. Officials of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection said Friday the huge glut of flood water flowing through the Panhandle of that state could threaten shellfish beds in Apalachicola Bay. </P>
<P> Biologists said the huge amount of fresh water could dilute the salt water necessary for the survival of oysters, crabs and other marine creatures. </P>
