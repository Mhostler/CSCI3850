<P>  An autopsy showed an ``external traumatic event'' killed a Palestinian prisoner in Israeli secret police custody, Israel Radio and police sources said on Friday. </P>
<P> Abd a-Samed Harizat, a 30-year-old Palestinian from Hebron who died on Tuesday, was the first Arab to die in detention since Israel relaxed interrogation rules for the Shin Bet secret police last year. Palestinians in Hebron said he was known to support the Moslem militant Hamas movement. </P>
<P> ``The Palestinian prisoner who died after an interrogation by security forces did not die of illness but what is described as an external traumatic event,'' the radio said on Friday. </P>
<P> Police sources confirmed an autopsy showed the cause was external. </P>
<P> Police have declined to comment on a charge by a human rights group that Harizat suffered blows to the head while in Shin Bet custody. </P>
<P> A lawyer for the family, Andre Rosenthal, told Reuters that all he could say was that three pathologists had agreed on the cause of death. </P>
<P> Two pathologists were from Israel and the third, a Scot, was brought in by the family. </P>
<P> Rosenthal said a criminal investigation was under way in the Israeli justice ministry. He said that by agreement he was barred from saying any more until Sunday. </P>
<P> An Israeli security source said Harizat was a senior member of Hamas's military wing and connected to three Hamas guerrillas killed last week by Israeli forces in Hebron in the West Bank. </P>
