<P>  North Korea will make an ``important announcement'' Tuesday night, but state-run Radio Pyongyang did not give any indication of the nature of the message. </P>
<P> The radio, monitored in Tokyo by the Radiopress agency, twice repeated the alert that an important announcement was imminent. </P>
<P> Korea watchers have long waited for an announcement of when Kim Jong-il, son and designated heir of the late North Korean President Kim Il-sung, would formally take over his father's titles of head of state and chief of the country's ruling communist party. </P>
<P> The positions have been vacant since Kim Il-sung's death July 8. </P>
<P> Past ``important announcements'' on the official radio came in 1992 when Kim Il-sung was awarded the military title of ``Grand Marshal'' and his son got a similar title of ``Marshal'' putting him in charge of North Korea's military. </P>
<P> Radio Pyongyang also used ``important announcement'' to declare a state of military emergency in March 1993 at the height of the crisis over North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons program. </P>
<P> Last month, North Korea and the United States signed an agreement ending a crisis over Pyongyang's nuclear program. </P>
<P> When announcing the death of Kim Il-sung, Radio Pyongyang used the words ``special announcement.'' </P>
