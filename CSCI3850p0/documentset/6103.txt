<P>  A judge ruled Thursday that an alleged confession may be used in the murder-for-hire trial of Malcolm X's daughter, but a key videotape made by the FBI may not. </P>
<P> Shabazz, 34, is charged in a federal indictment handed up Jan. 12 with trying to hire Michael Fitzpatrick, who turned out to be a government informant, to kill Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. Shabazz's family has blamed Farrakhan for Malcolm's assassination 30 years ago. </P>
<P> Judge James Rosenbaum of the U.S. District Court said a statement Quibilah Shabazz gave to the FBI Dec. 20 may be used in her trial, which is scheduled to start Monday. </P>
<P> In the statement, according to published reports, Shabazz told agents the alleged plot was her idea and that she believed the hit man she had hired could get away with it. </P>
<P> But Rosenbaum said federal prosecutors could not use a tape the FBI made Sept. 7, 1994, when Shabazz met Fitzpatrick in a St. Paul hotel room. Published reports have said the tape shows Shabazz handing Fitzpatrick $250 in cash to go to Chicago and kill Farrakhan at his headquarters mosque. </P>
<P> Rosembaum ruled that the taping violated Shabazz's constitutional rights. </P>
<P> His ruling on the alleged confession reversed an April 11 finding by U.S. Magistrate Franklin Noel, who had ruled the supposed confession could not be used because the FBI agents who obtained it did not identify themselves as agents until after she had let them into her apartment. </P>
<P> The video and audiotape which were ruled inadmissable Thursday were the only ones made directly under FBI supervision. </P>
<P> Fitzpatrick, who has known Shabazz since high school, is in the government witness protection program. Lawyers for Shabazz have depicted him as a drug-using opportunist who lured and entrapped her. </P>
<P> Fitzpatrick, also 34, is believed to have taped more than 40 conversations with Shabazz, second-eldest daughter of the assassinated firebrand black activist. As a toddler she was in the Harlem ballroom when her father was gunned down. </P>
