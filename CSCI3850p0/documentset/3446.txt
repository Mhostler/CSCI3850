<DATELINE>MARSEILLE, France (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Some hostages freed from a hijacked French airliner said as they left Marseille airport Monday that they feared reprisals from Muslim fundamentalists when they returned to Algeria. </P>
<P> ``I have to go back in a week,'' one passenger, covering his face, shouted angrily at a television crew trying to photograph him as he left the airport. </P>
<P> Several others also covered their faces as they passed photographers and television crews, and few approached by journalists were willing to give their names. </P>
<P> Their desire for anonymity reflected the civil strife that has shaken Algeria as the fundamentalists struggle to transform their country into an Islamic republic and the Algerian authorities battle against them. </P>
<P> At least 20,000 people have been killed in the violence since Algerian authorities canceled a 1992 general election that the now-banned Islamic Salvation Front was poised to win. </P>
<P> One passenger, who would not give his name, said he had tried to reason with the fundamentalist guerrillas who seized the Air France Airbus Saturday on the runway at Algiers airport. </P>
<P> ``I told him, 'That's not a very pretty line of work that you have chosen.' He answered, 'Nothing is more beautiful than to die for Islam','' the passenger said. </P>
<P> ``We were afraid, we were very afraid,'' said an elderly passenger, who also declined to be identified. ``You know in Algeria, one can get killed for almost anything.'' </P>
<P> Other freed passengers said the hijackers, identified as members of the militant Islamic Armed Group, had passed through the aircraft shortly after seizing it to order the women on board, including the stewardesses, to cover their heads as required by strict Muslim practice. </P>
<P> The hijackers, who spoke to each other in Arabic and took turns sleeping to remain in control, were ``very calm but very vain,'' one passenger told Reuters. </P>
<P> He said they had taunted some of the younger passengers by handing them their weapons -- which included machineguns and automatic pistols -- and had teasingly urged them to fire them. </P>
<P> ``I believe they had another scenario in mind -- perhaps to blow up the plane over Paris or to crash it,'' said a businessman who had been on board the aircraft. ``From the time they killed three men, they knew there was no way out of it for them.'' </P>
<P> Several passengers said they had begun to pray after the hijackers went to the cockpit, just before the plane was assaulted by elite French commandos and the hostages were freed. </P>
<P> After the hostage drama ended, passengers were taken to hotels, some to be questioned by French investigators and others to prepare to travel on to their final destinations. </P>
<P> Specially trained psychologists were due to meet passengers suffering from shock. </P>
