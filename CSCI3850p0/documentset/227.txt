<P>  Norway's National Gallery decided Thursday to find a new firm of guards after a string of security lapses headed by the theft earlier this year of the 1893 Edvard Munch masterpiece ``The Scream.'' </P>
<P> ``We will not renew the contract (with Norwegian firm Verdisikring) when it expires on the December 31st,'' Knut Berg, director of the gallery, said in a radio interview. He said the gallery had not decided who would take over. </P>
<P> Thieves stole ``The Scream'' by the Norwegian artist in the space of a minute on February 12 by climbing a ladder, smashing a ground floor window and cutting the painting from the wall. </P>
<P> They left a note saying: ``Thanks for the poor security.'' </P>
<P> Police recovered the painting, showing a waif-like figure wide-mouthed in terror beneath a blood-red sky, in early May after an international sting operation. </P>
<P> Yet despite vows of tighter security since the embarrassing theft, the gallery came under fire when a Norwegian newspaper recently published a photograph of a large roof window at the gallery accidentally left wide open one night. </P>
<P> And guards recently let in a group of men in a stag party to pose in fancy dress and be filmed by a video camera -- again showing how easily thieves could get details of the gallery to plan a robbery. </P>
