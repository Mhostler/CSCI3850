<P>  O.J. Simpson asserts his innocence and discusses what he thinks of spousal abuse in his new book, which is designed to flood the market just after his double murder trial starts, Publishers Weekly said Friday. </P>
<P> ``I Want To Tell You,'' published by Little, Brown, will have a 500,000 copy first printing plus an audiotape that will include Simpson's voice reading two ``strongly personal'' excerpts, according to the Hot Deals column in the magazine known as the book industry bible. </P>
<P> The article by Maureen O'Brien, to appear in next Tuesday's edition, gives new details on the super-secret contents and marketing plans for the book scheduled to come out in early February. Publishers Weekly made a copy available Friday. </P>
<P> Little, Brown, a division of Time Warner, paid a reported $1 million advance for the book and most of the money is expected to go towards Simpson's staggering legal bills in his trial on charges of killing his ex-wife Nicole and her friend, Ronald Goldman. </P>
<P> O'Brien reports that Simpson has been given permission to sign 300 copies of the book but he is prohibited by court order from making any money on his signature so the signed copies will be given away. </P>
<P> The 224-page book with 32 pages of color snapshots of the Simpson family in happier days is a collection of 100 letters written to Simpson since he was arrested. The letters are grouped in categories and include his assertion of his innocence and his thoughts on spousal abuse. </P>
<P> A pre-trial hearing is underway to determine if accusations that he frequently beat Nicole can be admitted as evidence. The trial is expected to start late next week. </P>
<P> Book packager and producer Larry Shiller, who collaborated with Simpson on the book, told O'Brien the audio portion was recorded by Simpson in the Los Angeles County jail. It was the first time that any one connected with the book has confirmed rumors that there was an audio version of the book. </P>
<P> Simpson's voice will generally be done by an actor on the tape except in two sections described to Publishers Weekly as ''deeply personal,'' which he will do himself. One of the excerpts includes his comment that he is innocent and the other explains why he wrote the book. </P>
<P> Shiller said Simpson demanded that the audio book be available at the unusually low price of $9.95 ``because he felt that there were a lot of disenfrancised people out there who could not afford the book.'' The audio book will be reduced in size so it can fit into paperback racks at check-out counters at drugstores and supermarkets. </P>
