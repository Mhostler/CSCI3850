<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, The Netherlands (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Tens of thousand Turks took to the streets of The Hague Sunday in protest against the Netherlands' decision to allow the formation of a Kurdish parliament-in-exile, the Dutch news agency ANP said. </P>
<P> Police said two Turks were shot and wounded late Saturday when a group of 14 Kurdish extremists entered a Turkish coffee house and warned customers not to attend Sunday's demonstration. </P>
<P> ``The two wounded men are not badly hurt and four of the attackers have been arrested,'' police spokesman Ruben Petow said. He added that a pistol was found near the scene. </P>
<P> A police spokeswoman said it was too early to say how many were taking part in the protest and more were still arriving at noon, but ANP estimated the number at ``several tens of thousands.'' </P>
<P> The spokeswoman said no threats against the demonstration had been received from anti-Turkish groups and there was no sign of a counter-demonstration. ``It's all very peaceful,'' she said. </P>
<P> Turkey withdrew its ambassador after the formation of the assembly was announced earlier this month. </P>
<P> Ankara says it is a propaganda tool of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) which is fighting a 10-year separatist war in southeast Turkey that has cost 15,000 lives. </P>
