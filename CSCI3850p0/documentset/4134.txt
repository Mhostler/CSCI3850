<DATELINE>LONDON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Police arrested more than 50 people Friday protesting the export of veal calves to Europe and said once-peaceful demonstrations were becoming violent. </P>
<P> The extremist Animal Liberation Front (ALF) said it would increase its activities since the death of Jill Phipps, a 31-year-old protester who was crushed under the wheels of a truck carrying calves at Coventry airport Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``It's not a game of cricket we're dealing with, it's a holocaust ... the rivers of blood are flowing stronger than ever and we need to stop it,'' ALF spokesman John Curtin told BBC television. </P>
<P> ``I'm not talking about willy-nilly (violence) -- I'm talking about actions that are planned to stop suffering.'' </P>
<P> People of all ages who say they have never been part of the animal rights movement have joined weeks of protests aimed at stopping the exports. Veal calves in Europe are often kept virtually motionless in tiny crates to tenderize their flesh, a practice outlawed in Britain. </P>
<P> But police say demonstrators have started throwing stones and bottles at cattle trucks and police, and windows have been smashed in some of the protests. </P>
<P> Assistant Chief Constable of Devon and Cornwall, John Albon, said the demonstrators were being infiltrated by troublemakers, including soccer ``rowdies'' and militant animal rights activists. </P>
<P> But he said most demonstrators were breaking the law. ``Middle-class, innocent, elderly ladies, people carrying children, were sitting or lying down in the road. That is illegal ... they are as much party as the people throwing the bricks and bottles as anyone else,'' he said. </P>
<P> Demonstrators accuse the police of heavy-handed tactics and say they are instigating some of the violence. </P>
<P> Some politicians sympathized with the protesters. One opposition Labor Party member of Parliament offered a bill that would have banned exports where animals were likely to be housed or fed in a way that was illegal in Britain. </P>
