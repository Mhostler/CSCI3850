<P>  The Justice Department said Thursday it has reached a settlement with a national vision care insurer accused of using a contract provision that had reduced discounting by optometrists. </P>
<P> It said Vision Service Plan, the nation's largest eye care insurance plan with more than $500 million in annual sales and 15 million customers, agreed to stop using the provision that had inhibited optometrists from cutting prices. </P>
<P> Assistant Attorney General Anne Bingaman was unable to estimate how much money would be saved nationwide as a result of the settlement, but said billions of dollars are spent each year on eye care. </P>
<P> The contract provision stated that if an optometrist offered a lower price to another insurer, then the same lower price must be given to Vision Service. Bingaman said the clause had the effect of stopping all discounting. </P>
<P> She told a news conference that discounts typically of 20 percent to 40 percent had ended when the the contract provision had been used. </P>
<P> Bingaman said an optometrist charges an insurer on average $70 to $80 per visit on the East Coast, where the provision has not been used, compared with $100 to $110 on the West Coast, where it has been prevalent. </P>
<P> Vision Service, a non-profit corporation based in Rancho Cordova, Calif., started in California and has most of its customers in the West, department officials said. </P>
