<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A Guatemalan intelligence officer on the CIA's payroll ordered the killings of a U.S. citizen and a guerrilla leader married to an American lawyer, and the CIA hid its knowledge of the deaths until this year, a member of the House Intelligence Committee said Thursday. </P>
<P> Rep. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said he told lawyer Jennifer Harbury on Wednesday there was reason to believe her husband, guerrilla leader Efrain Bamaca Velasquez, died by order of Guatemalan Col. Julio Roberto Alpirez. </P>
<P> Harbury has fasted outside the White House since March 12 to demand action. She ended that fast Thursday, saying, ``This is the first time I have been told the truth in two years.'' </P>
<P> The Harvard-trained lawyer from Austin, Texas, has lobbied since March 1992 to unravel the mysterious disappearance of her husband, criticizing the United States for not doing more to end human rights abuses in Guatemala, where over 100,000 have died in Central America's last civil war. </P>
<P> Torricelli said Harbury's husband was tortured and executed after his capture in 1992, and Alpirez also ordered the murder of U.S. hotel entrepreneur Michael Devine in 1990. In its Friday editions, The Washington Post quoted unnamed intelligence sources as saying the CIA learned in October 1991 that Alpirez was linked to Devine's death and dropped him from its payroll shortly thereafter. </P>
<P> But the agency continued to use him as a clandestine CIA contact through July 1992, when he allegedly ordered the death of Bamaca, the sources told the paper. </P>
<P> Torricelli said sources told him State Department and White House officials learned of the facts of the Guatemala killings between October and late January. </P>
<P> Harbury ended a previous 32-day fast in Guatemala in November after the White House agreed to meet with her on the matter, but she accused U.S. officials Thursday of hiding Alpirez' link to the CIA to avoid embarrassment. </P>
<P> In a letter to President Clinton, Torricelli said Alpirez was under contract with the CIA and remained on its payroll at the time of the killings. He said the officer was ``separated'' from the CIA but there was conflicting information on when. </P>
<P> Neither the CIA nor the White House commented on Alpirez' link to the agency, but a U.S. Army spokesman confirmed the officer had studied at the Army's School of the Americas -- often criticized for its ties to Latin American military. </P>
<P> Alpirez graduated from a 47-week command and general staff course at Fort Benning, Ga., in 1989, the spokesman said. </P>
<P> Acting CIA Director William Studeman denied his agency concealed information and called the charge ``false and utterly irresponsible.'' He said the CIA received ``credible information'' long after the deaths and shared it with U.S. authorities. </P>
<P> But Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and his Democratic Vice Chairman, Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, criticized the CIA in a statement late Thursday, saying the agency failed to keep them abreast of new intelligence. </P>
<P> They said the CIA briefed the panel on the killings in February and CIA officials acknowledged at the time they erred in not informing officials on Devine's death. </P>
<P> White House spokesman Mike McCurry said the CIA relayed new data on the cases to the White House Jan. 25, but the reports contradicted earlier data, prompting a full review. </P>
<P> He said Washington was now pressing the Guatemalan government to reinterrogate several Guatemalan military officers, including Alpirez, who he said was believed in the vicinity of the firefight during which Bamaca was captured. </P>
<P> Asked if he could deny Bamaca's killer worked for the CIA, McCurry said, ``We don't know who killed Efrain Bamaca.'' </P>
<P> Harbury told reporters her priority now was locating her husband's remains. ``His bones belong to me. They are not to be left on some trash heap as if he was never a human being.'' </P>
