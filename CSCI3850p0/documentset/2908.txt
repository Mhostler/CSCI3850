<DATELINE>MIAMI, Nov 30 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Sacramento Kings aren't really used to this. </P>
<P> The Kings edged the Miami Heat 94-89 Tuesday for their best start in 12 years and their first win in Miami in seven games. </P>
<P> ``I didn't shoot well at all, but the team came through,'' said Mitch Richmond, a native of nearby Fort Lauderdale who was just 4-of-14 from the field. ``I love this gym. This is home, and this is the first time I've ever won here.'' </P>
<P> A 3-pointer by Brad Lohaus cut the deficit to 92-89 with 21 seconds to play, but rookie Michael Smith scored on a breakaway to seal the win. </P>
<P> ``My heart went to my knees when they got that three,'' Kings coach Garry St. Jean said. ``We're heading for the plane before the refs change it (the win).'' </P>
<P> Walt Williams scored 20 points and rookie Brian Grant added 16 for the Kings, who won at Miami for the first time since December 7, 1988. </P>
<P> The Kings (6-5) have beaten last-season playoff teams in all of their wins this season and stand above .500 this late in the season for the first time since they began the 1982-83 campaign at 8-3. </P>
<P> Bimbo Coles scored 19 points and Kevin Willis added 17 for the Heat (3-8). </P>
<P> At Golden State, the Los Angeles Clippers lost their 13th consecutive game as Ricky Pierce's 3-point play with 42 seconds left in overtime gave the Warriors a 127-124 victory. </P>
<P> The Clippers' Pooh Richardson, who forced overtime with a 15-footer with 4.3 seconds left in regulation, missed a 3-pointer at the OT buzzer. </P>
<P> The Clippers are approaching an NBA record for season-opening futility. Three teams began by losing their first 15 games and the expansion Miami Heat lost their first 17 in 1988 before beating the Clippers. </P>
<P> Latrell Sprewell scored 31 points to lead the Warriors, who blew a 21-point first-quarter lead. </P>
<P> In Dallas, Jim Jackson scored 26 points as the Mavericks took a sloppy 84-83 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. </P>
<P> With 7.6 seconds left and Dallas up by a point, Jackson missed two free throws. Minnesota rookie Donyell Marshall grabbed the rebound, dribbled to the front court and missed badly on a 40-footer to end the game. </P>
<P> ``I could see the confusion in Donyell's face and I was glad that he had it more than anything else,'' said Jackson. ``He danced with it a little bit, wasted some time and threw up a long shot.'' </P>
<P> The teams combined for 16 turnovers and just 11 field goals in the fourth quarter. </P>
<P> At New Jersey, Cedric Ceballos scored 34 points and Sedale Threatt had seven points during a 13-1 run to open the second overtime as the Los Angles Lakers beat the Nets 129-120. </P>
<P> Derrick Coleman had 24 points and 20 rebounds and Kenny Anderson had 24 points and dished out 16 assists for the Nets. </P>
<P> In Milwaukee, rookie Trevor Ruffin sank three 3-pointers during a 26-10 second-quarter run as the Phoenix Suns raced past the Bucks 123-106 for their fourth straight triumph. </P>
<P> Dan Majerle scored 23 points, Ruffin had 20 and rookie Wesley Person added 19 for the Suns, who opened a seven-game road trip with their eighth victory in their last nine games. </P>
<P> Vin Baker scored 23 points and Todd Day added 20 for Milwaukee, which has lost four straight games. </P>
<P> Suns All-Star Charles Barkley scored five points after a one-game absence, sitting out the entire fourth quarter. </P>
<P> In Atlanta, Hersey Hawkins scored 22 points as the Charlotte Hornets held off the Hawks for a 90-85 victory. </P>
<P> Alonzo Mourning added 18 points and Dell Curry had 17. </P>
<P> Charlotte led by as many as 16 points in the second period but had to hang on as the Heat got as close as 86-85 with 15 seconds remaining. </P>
<P> At Washington, Patrick Ewing's jump shot with two minutes remaining sparked a 6-0 run, breaking open a three-point game as the New York Knicks defeated the Bullets 99-91. </P>
<P> Ewing finished with 20 points and a season-high 15 rebounds. </P>
<P> Washington was led by Chris Webber's 21 points, his most as a member of the Bullets. Webber also grabbed a team-high 11 rebounds. </P>
<P> In Houston, Hakeem Olajuwon had 27 points, 12 rebounds and five blocked shots as the Rockets cruised to a 96-81 win over the Denver Nuggets to stop a three-game losing streak. </P>
<P> In Portland, Karl Malone had 30 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists and the Utah Jazz used a 15-4 run to open the fourth quarter to take control of the game and beat the Trail Blazers 105-94. The Jazz have won five straight. </P>
