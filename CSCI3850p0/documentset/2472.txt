<P>  Malnutrition and violence are increasing in Rwandan camps in eastern Zaire and many more refugees, especially women and children, will die unless steps are taken to impose security, aid officials said Tuesday. </P>
<P> In particular, they said, control over food distribution and organization in the camps by thugs believed to be members of Hutu militias largely responsible for genocide in Rwanda had to be broken. </P>
<P> U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali chaired a crisis meeting in Geneva Tuesday to discuss deploying peacekeeping troops in the camps in the Goma area, where the U.N. refugee agency estimates there are 850,000 refugees. </P>
<P> Lyndall Sachs, spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Goma, characterized the situation in the vast camps as fragile. </P>
<P> ``We have been pushing for a force to come and help police the camps for a couple of months to ensure security and an equitable distribution of assistance,'' she said in an interview. </P>
<P> ``If no decisions are taken soon, we will only see a further deterioration of conditions in the camps with needless loss of life from violence and diversion of food from the vulnerable population.'' </P>
<P> The Geneva talks followed a threat last week by 16 relief agencies to pull out of the camps unless international action is taken to break a rule of terror by Hutu leaders and militiamen, who fled with civilians escaping the civil war in July. </P>
<P> Aid officials said threats against aid workers in the camps were increasing and at least 20 people, mainly refugees, had been killed in clashes in the camps in the past two weeks. </P>
<P> They say they now realize it was a mistake to organize the camps through Rwandan local government officials, who like the troops and militiamen are blamed for the massacre of up to one million Rwandans during three months of slaughter this summer. </P>
<P> ``The main problem is we are seeing young men taking over the food distribution points, directing traffic and determining who gets what in the camps,'' said Sachs. ``Malnutrition is definitely on the rise.'' </P>
<P> In the sprawling Mugunga camp southwest of Goma hoardes of sullen and uniformed troops from Rwanda's defeated Hutu army roamed through makeshift roadside markets Tuesday selling food, blankets and plastic sheets donated by foreign aid agencies. </P>
<P> Aid officials said the number of attacks in the camps around Goma had steadily increased in recent weeks. </P>
