<P>  Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani on Saturday derided the award of the shared 1994 Nobel Peace Prize to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin as a joke. </P>
<P> ``I do believe giving the Nobel Peace Prize to Rabin should just remind us of a joke -- for a person that has made more than four million refugees around the world is being presented with the Nobel prize,'' Rafsanjani told a news conference. </P>
<P> ``We should ask this question from the Palestinian refugees. (To) the prisoners held in Israel and the other Palestinian refugees and the Lebonese people, this question should also be forwarded,'' he added, through an interpreter. </P>
<P> Rafsanjani was speaking on the final day of a three-day visit to Indonesia. </P>
<P> Rabin, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat jointly won the prize Friday for their role in forging the September 1993 Israel-PLO peace pact. </P>
