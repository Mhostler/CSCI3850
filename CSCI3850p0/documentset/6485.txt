<P>  A panel of scientists Thursday boosted prospects for a low-level nuclear waste dump to be built in the Mojave desert, saying it was ``highly unlikely'' radioactivity would contaminate the area's water. </P>
<P> Although the National Research Council panel said it focused only on whether waste would come into contact with water, it all but endorsed Ward Valley as a storage site. </P>
<P> ``The committee concluded that the potential transfer of contaminants ... to the water table is highly unlikely,'' said George Thompson, a geophysicist from Stanford University who chaired the panel looking at the California location. </P>
<P> Even if there was a threat to groundwater, people in the area would probably not be affected. ``Currently, there are no communities using water from the aquifer in Ward Valley,'' said Jack Robertson, another member of the committee. </P>
<P> He added that if groundwater did leave Ward Valley, it would take hundreds of thousands of years for it to reach the Colorado River or Danby Dry Lake. By then, any radioactivity would be far below levels allowed by public health standards. </P>
<P> Low-level nuclear wastes have short half-lives, and can be in things like test tubes, needles, rags, rubber gloves and tools from hospitals, labs and nuclear power plants. </P>
<P> Two of the 17 scientists on the panel questioned the conclusion that contaminants could not be absorbed by the groundwater, but the panel said their concerns could easily be addressed by constant monitoring of the site while the storage was being built and operated. </P>
<P> The desert site, which is now federal land, was approved by California's Department of Health Services in 1988 to take waste from California, Arizona, North Dakota and South Dakota. </P>
<P> However, plans for building a dump have been held up by environmentalists, who challenged the state in court over the licensing, and the Clinton administration, which said more study was needed before it could decide whether to transfer the land to the state. </P>
<P> Interior Secretay Bruce Babbitt said Thursday he would review the committee's findings before deciding whether to give up the land. The decision is likely to be made in a matter of weeks, an Interior Department spokeswoman said. </P>
