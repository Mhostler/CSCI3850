<P>  Prosecutors announced Wednesday that they would not bring criminal charges against Michael Jackson despite a 14-year-old boy's claims that the pop superstar sexually molested him. </P>
<P> But the district attorneys of Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties did not publicly exonerate Jackson and said the case would remain open until the six-year statute of limitations expires in the event new evidence emerges. </P>
<P> Santa Barbara County District Attorney Thomas Sneddon told a joint news conference that the 13-month investigation had uncovered allegations of sexual misconduct between Jackson and three children, including the boy who made the initial claims. </P>
<P> Prosecutors said their decision not to file charges stemmed largely from the 14-year-old boy's refusal to testify against Jackson. </P>
<P> ``If there is new information that comes to us that is credible, we'll look at it,'' said Los Angeles County District Attorney Gil Garcetti. ``But at this point the investigation is complete.'' </P>
<P> Sneddon said one of the other alleged victims had been undergoing psychological therapy since November 1993, when the child first came forward. The third child lives outside the United States and is ``unavailable to be interviewed,'' he said. </P>
<P> Jackson has denied any wrongdoing, saying he was the victim of a failed extortion plot engineered by the boy's father, a wealthy Beverly Hills dentist. </P>
