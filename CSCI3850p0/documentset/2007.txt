<P>  U.S. Navy officers are still on board a tanker intercepted in the Gulf with a cargo of suspected Iraqi oil, a U.S. military spokesman in the region said Friday. </P>
<P> The spokesman, who asked not to be identified, said a U.S. warship was with the 29,687-ton Katerina P, found carrying 19,000 metric tons of oil believed to have been shipped from Khor al-Zubayr in Iraq. </P>
<P> U.S. Navy and Coast Guard forces from the frigate Reid boarded the Liberian-flagged tanker Thursday off the Iranian coast in international waters. </P>
<P> It was the first known interception of an oil cargo Iraq is suspected of exporting illegally in defiance of United Nations sanctions. </P>
<P> The spokesman did not say where the tanker was being taken. </P>
<P> Shipping sources said they expected it to be escorted to a Gulf Arab port where the oil could be analyzed to confirm its origin. One said it was most likely to be taken to Dubai. </P>
<P> A U.S. Navy spokesman said Thursday the boarding was in line with an operation that inspects ships to enforce U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. </P>
<P> Iran has consistently denied market rumors that it is helping Iraq beat the sanctions. </P>
