<P>  Incoming Senate Armed Services Committee chairman Strom Thurmond is seeking backing from fellow Republicans to block Clinton administration defense spending cuts in 1996, the Washington Post reported Wednesday. </P>
<P> The South Carolina Republican told incoming Budget Committee chairman Pete Domenici in a letter that the money was needed to pay for troop training and new weapons. </P>
<P> The paper quoted the letter as saying Thurmond wanted to freeze defense spending at the 1995 level of $254 billion instead of allowing a cut to $246 billion, the level proposed by the administration. </P>
<P> When inflation is factored in, to hold the military's spending constant would require an increase of about $12 billion next year, the paper said. </P>
<P> ``I am aware that setting the defense budget at this level will create a burden on the remaining discretionary accounts, but the recent announcements of decreased Army readiness and efforts to sharply curtail critical modernization programs make this a necessity,'' it quoted the letter as saying. </P>
<P> President Clinton earlier this month said he wanted to pump $25 billion more into defense over the next six years to boost readiness. The administration's latest plan is to spend $254 billion in fiscal 1995 and $246 billion in fiscal 1996. </P>
