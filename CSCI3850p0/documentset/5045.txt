<P>  Staff at Britain's embassy in Yemen may have made huge profits in a currency scam, a senior British diplomat said Monday. </P>
<P> The permanent under-secretary at the Foreign Office, Sir John Coles, was speaking about the case of Gerald Ryan, a former second secretary at the embassy who committed suicide in December while suspected of false accounting and theft. </P>
<P> Coles told Parliament's Public Accounts Committee that Ryan, or a local accountant he engaged, were thought to have operated the scam. </P>
<P> They exploited the fact that Yemen had two exchange rates. They illicitly changed sterling for local currency at the generous parallel rate to pay embassy bills instead of using the official rate. </P>
<P> Coles estimated Ryan's potential for profiteering from 1988 to 1993 at between $1 million and $1.07 million, although he said the actual profits were probably less. </P>
<P> Britain is also thought to have lost $64,990 in public money because of Ryan's irregular transactions, Coles said. </P>
