<P>  Horacio Massaccesi, who just five months ago was the bright new hope of Argentina's century-old Radical Party, is now desperately fighting to prevent a humiliating third place showing in Sunday's polls. </P>
<P> Last December, the 47-year-old lawyer and tennis coach from Patagonia became the Radical Party candidate after beating Federico Storani, a seasoned lawmaker with close links to former Argentine President and party chairman Raul Alfonsin. </P>
<P> But his initial popularity quickly dwindled due to party infighting and a financial crisis in the Rio Negro province he governs that forced him to suspend state employee wages for several weeks. </P>
<P> The crisis was used as ammunition by President Carlos Menem, who is seeking re-election and is topping the polls with about 45 percent of the vote, against 33 percent for runner-up Jose Bordon of the center-left Frepaso coalition. Massaccesi trails with only 17 percent. </P>
<P> The Menem propaganda machine has succeeded in portraying Massaccesi as ``a lousy administrator'' and a bad governor. </P>
<P> His campaign tactics have also come under fire by political analysts. </P>
<P> In particular, they criticize his attacks on Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo's Convertibility Plan, which has tamed Argentina's runaway inflation and is one of the main reasons many voters want to re-elect Menem. </P>
<P> ``His campaign is completely off the mark. He is targetting Cavallo -- the person everyone loves to hate but is afraid to see go,'' said political analyst Felipe Noguera. </P>
<P> As a result, many Radical votes have fled to Frepaso and for the first time there is talk of a possible disappearance of the party founded in the late 19th century. </P>
<P> Massaccesi made an early political start but, like millions of others in Argentina, he was forced to stay away from politics after the 1976 military coup that toppled Maria Estela Martinez de Peron, widow of the legendary leader Juan Peron. </P>
<P> After the return of democracy in 1983, Massaccesi became state legislator. In 1985, he was elected to the national congress. Two years later, he won the Rio Negro governorship and is now well into his second term. </P>
<P> Massaccesi is married to Patricia Querejeta and has six children, some from an earlier marriage. </P>
