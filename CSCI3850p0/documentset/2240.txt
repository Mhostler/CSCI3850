<DATELINE>KINGSTON, Jamaica (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Police were questioning a suspect Wednesday about the disappearance and suspected murder of an American screenwriter. </P>
<P> Police sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there were ``strong indications'' that the suspect would be charged. </P>
<P> Terrence Runte, 34, a scriptwriter from Chicago, arrived in Jamaica Oct. 16 and disappeared after spending the evening with two women at a night club in Port Antonio. </P>
<P> Police said they were questioning a local man who joined Runte and the two women at the club and asked for a ride home. </P>
<P> Runte never returned to his villa, and the charred remains of his rental car were found Thursday just a few miles from where he was last seen. </P>
<P> Runte, whose film credits include major Hollywood movies such as ``The Killing Fields,'' was in Jamaica to research a script for a romantic mystery. </P>
<P> His fiance, Jan Pessin, arrived in the island Tuesday and offered a $2,000 reward for information about his disappearance. </P>
<P> Jamaican tourism officials expressed concern about the incident, the latest in a series of violent attacks on tourists. The Caribbean nation depends on tourism for much of its foreign earnings, and the number of tourists visiting the island has slumped in recent months. </P>
