<P>  A pair of teenaged British students were sentenced to life in prison Tuesday for cutting the throat of a complete stranger as the ``ultimate dare.'' </P>
<P> Jamie Petrolini and Richard Elsey, both 19, were convicted of murdering 44-year-old Mohamed el-Sayed in January. </P>
<P> ``You created a world in which you both played out your fantasies. It led to the brutal and senseless slaughter of a complete stranger,'' Judge Neil Denison told them. </P>
<P> ``These two defendants were obsessed with killing and set out together to kill a complete stranger as some sort of bizarre initiation test.'' </P>
<P> Petrolini, a former student at the elite Gordonstoun school known for its tough regime, met co-defendant Richard Elsey while they were preparing for university exams at a private college. </P>
<P> Prosecutors said the two, who denied murder, were obsessed with the army, particularly the crack Special Air Service (SAS) Regiment. They said they searched London for a victim and leapt into Sayed's car when it stopped at traffic lights. </P>
<P> Petrolini, who had unsuccessfully tried to win an army scholarship, told police the killing was an SAS initiation test and that he was acting under Elsey's orders. Elsey blamed Petrolini for the murder. </P>
