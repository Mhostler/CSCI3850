<P>  The United States must continue to cooperate with Russia in dismantling its nuclear warheads despite Moscow's proposed sale of nuclear technology to Iran, Vice President Al Gore said Sunday. </P>
<P> ``We certainly have a national interest in having Russia dismantle its nuclear warheads,'' Gore said on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' program. ``Why do we want to cut off our nose to spite our face? We don't want to eliminate cooperation of that kind and we are not going to.'' </P>
<P> The New York Times reported Sunday that the United States has warned Russia that it would end nuclear cooperation if it did not cancel plans to build four nuclear reactors for Iran in a contract valued at between $800 million and $1 billion. </P>
<P> Gore said the United States is ``deeply concerned about the potential sharing of a reactor with Iran and we are in the midst of intensive negotiations on that point right now.'' </P>
<P> But he said ``making threats at this stage in a negotiating process is not the right way to go.'' </P>
