<P> The measure also cuts civil service retirement by $11 billion and Medicare by $10.5 billion and includes other miscellaneous cuts. All of the cuts are necessary to pay the five-year cost of a proposed $189 billion tax-cutting bill. </P>
<P> Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, presented $100 billion in illustrative cuts he said the Appropriations Committee could use to meet the new spending limits imposed by his committee's bill. But Democrats said many of those cuts had already been made in a bill being considered on the House floor and that those cuts were to be used to reduce the debt by up to $40 billion, not to offset lower taxes. </P>
<P> Kasich appeared flabbergasted and said he was unaware a provision Republicans had agreed to had that effect. If it did, he said, that was a violation of a gentleman's agreement that no more than $9 billion in cuts would be made for debt reduction. Kasich said the measure would be changed later when it was combined with a similar Senate bill. </P>
