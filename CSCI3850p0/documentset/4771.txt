<P>  Defending champion Elvis Stojko survived a new injury scare Tuesday, when he returned to the ice a few hours after being forced to abandon a practice session with a sore foot. </P>
<P> On the eve of his defense of the men's world figure skating title, a relieved Stojko was able work through his long program in evening training after being forced to leave the ice in the middle of a morning workout. </P>
<P> Stokjo, who injured his right foot during practice for the Canadian championships eight weeks ago, hurt it again Tuesday landing the triple axel jump. </P>
<P> ``He hit the one spot on the foot you don't want to hit,'' his coach, Doug Leigh, said. </P>
<P> But Leigh was a happier man after the later session. </P>
<P> ``This was a great practice. He pushed right through the long program and did another triple axel right at the end,'' Leigh said. </P>
<P> ``There was no discomfort. There is no change to the program. Everything is in there.'' </P>
<P> Stojko said Monday that he was pleased to be able to compete despite the injury and that winning would be a big bonus. </P>
