<P>  Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby jumped from the Democratic Party Wednesday, boosting the Republican majority to 53-47 in the Senate that takes office in January. </P>
<P> ``Officially -- right now -- I am changing parties to a party of hope for America, not a party of dependency, to the Republican Party,'' he told a news conference as dozens of young Senate staffers cheered. </P>
<P> Flanked by Kansas Sen. Robert Dole, who will become the majority leader, and Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, who switched parties in 1983 while he was still in the House, Shelby said he had mistakenly believed there was room for a conservative southerner in the Democratic party. </P>
<P> ``But I can tell you there's not, there's not room,'' the 60-year-old senator said. He held out hope others might follow his example but in fact such party changes are quite rare. </P>
<P> The last senator to change parties was Harry Byrd of Virginia, who left the Democrats to become an independent in 1971. Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, now in line to chair the Armed Services Committee, switched from the Democratic to the Republican parties in 1965. </P>
<P> Sen. Bob Graham of Florida, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said historically those who switch parties are regarded with suspicion by those in their new party and anger by those in their old party. </P>
<P> ``That was his decision and he will have to live with the consequences,'' Graham told a news conference. </P>
<P> But Gramm of Texas has risen to the chairmanship of the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, the equivalent of Graham's job with the Democrats. </P>
<P> Dole said Shelby would retain his seniority but gain no leadership positions. Shelby had been on his way out of the Democratic party for some time and for more than a year had rarely voted with most Democrats. </P>
<P> Even though his switch was widely expected, it was an added setback for the Democrats and extra insurance for Republicans, who won an overwhelming victory in the congressional elections. </P>
<P> ``There are lots of measures in the Senate that pass by just one vote,'' Dole said. </P>
<P> Would Shelby, who served served eight years in the House as a Democrat before his Senate service, have switched if the Republicans had failed to win control of the Senate? </P>
<P> ``I may have, I don't know,'' he said. ``That's a moot question.'' </P>
