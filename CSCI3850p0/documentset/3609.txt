<P>  A Syrian human rights group said Friday that Damascus had released two former ministers imprisoned since the early 1970s and urged Syrian President Hafez al-Assad to free other political prisoners. </P>
<P> The Committee for the Defense of Democratic Liberties and Human Rights in Syria said in a statement in Paris that former Interior Minister Muhammed Id Ishshwawi, jailed at the al-Mezze prison near Damascus since 1970, and Abdel Hamid Muqdadhad, a former Cabinet minister jailed since 1971, had been released. </P>
<P> The group said that both men had been imprisoned without trial but did not say when they were freed. </P>
<P> It also called for the release of five other political prisoners who have been detained for 25 years, naming them as Mahmud Fayyad, Mustafa Falah, Jalal ed-Din Mirhej, Khalil Brayez and Fawzi Rida. </P>
<P> Rida and Fayyad were in very bad health, it said. </P>
<P> ``We ask the Syrian president to put an end to this tragedy and release the five others for humanitarian reasons,'' the statement said. </P>
<P> It said that 10 of its members were serving five to 10-year jail terms and its spokesman, lawyer Aktham Nouassieh who is among those in prison, was in critical condition. </P>
