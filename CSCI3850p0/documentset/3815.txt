<P>  South Africa sold anti-tank rockets and anti-personnel mines to Lebanon's Christian militia in the aftermath of the civil war there, a judicial commission of inquiry was told Tuesday. </P>
<P> Arms agency Armscor provided a list to commission chairman Judge Edwin Cameron detailing the sale of 200 anti-personnel mines for $24,248 to the militia in February 1991 through its Middle East agent Eli Wazen. </P>
<P> In June 1992, Armscor and Wazen sold the militia nine Milan anti-tank rocket launchers for $414,900 and 75 Milan rocket missiles for $673,875. </P>
<P> The total value of arms sold to the militia from 1991 to 1993 was more than $3.4 million, Armscor said in the list. </P>
<P> Armscor witnesses earlier testified that Wazen introduced the agency to the Christian Militia in the late 1980s -- when the militia was involved in civil war with Muslim groups. Arms were sold to the movement until September 1993. </P>
<P> Early in 1994, months before South Africa's first democratic elections, it was decided to bar the militia from receiving any weapons. </P>
<P> The United Nations arms embargo against South Africa was only lifted in May last year after democracy elections and Nelson Mandela's inauguration as the country's first black president. </P>
