<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  More Americans are supporting President Clinton's handling of foreign policy but fewer are supporting his management of the economy, according to a CBS News poll released Tuesday. </P>
<P> Clinton, however, won a boost to his overall job rating since U.S. troops were deployed in Haiti last month. The poll reported as many Americans now approve of Clinton's overall performance as disapprove -- 44 percent each, with 12 percent undecided. </P>
<P> The poll taken Oct. 16 and Oct. 17 also found 47 percent approved of Clinton's handling of foreign policy while 40 percent disapproved. The remainder were undecided. </P>
<P> Before a U.S.-mediated agreement Sept. 19 that allowed for the return of Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, 32 percent approved Clinton's foreign policy and 44 percent were opposed, according to a CBS poll in September. </P>
<P> The president also got high ratings for deploying U.S. forces in response to recent Iraqi troop movements toward the Kuwaiti border, the poll reported. </P>
<P> But Clinton did not fare as well on domestic economic issues. </P>
<P> Of the 975 adults surveyed, 39 percent approved of Clinton's economic policies and 51 percent disapproved, the poll reported. </P>
<P> In the September poll, Clinton scored a 46 percent approval rating on economic issues, with 44 percent opposed. </P>
<P> While Americans say the economy overall is in good shape, 52 percent reported their own family's finances have not changed since Clinton took office in January 1993. Twenty-four percent said their family's finances have improved and 23 percent said they declined. </P>
<P> The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus three percent. </P>
