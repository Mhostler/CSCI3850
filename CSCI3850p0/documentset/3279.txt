<P>  The owners of a huge, privately owned Christmas display must make it smaller or eliminate it altogether, the Arkansas Supreme Court said Friday, refusing to stay its earlier order. </P>
<P> Jennings Osborne, a wealthy businessman who wraps his suburban Little Rock estate in millions of red lights each Christmas, had asked the state court to delay enforcing its ruling until he appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. </P>
<P> The Arkansas Supreme Court agreed with Osborne's neighbors that the light display, which attracts tens of thousands of people to the affluent subdivision each night during the holiday season, was ``a nuisance.'' </P>
<P> The Court rejected Osborne's arguments that his light show was a Constitutionally-protected expression of his religious beliefs. </P>
<P> ``We were delighted the Court acted as quickly as it did,'' said Gary Corum of Little Rock, attorney for the angry neighbors. Corum filed a petition opposing a delay in the Court's order Thursday. </P>
<P> ``We wanted to stave off a potential disaster,'' Corum said, referring to the escalating tension between his clients and Osborne. </P>
<P> ``I hope today's ruling by the Court will allow everyone to breathe a little easier,'' Corum said. </P>
<P> Neither Osborne nor his attorney could be reached for comment late Friday. </P>
