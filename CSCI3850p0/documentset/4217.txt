<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A sophisticated bomb was defused in the border town of Newry late Tuesday at a critical phase in the Northern Ireland peace process. </P>
<P> No group immediately claimed responsibility for planting the device, which was left at the entrance to a shopping center and contained 1.1 pounds of the powerful semtex explosive. </P>
<P> But Protestant Unionist politicians immediately blamed the Irish Republican Army, which fought for 25 years to end British rule of Northern Ireland until a cease-fire last year. </P>
<P> Peter Robinson of the Ulster Unionist Party, which wants the province to stay British, claimed it was an IRA attempt to warn Britain that it would end its cease-fire unless it wrung concessions in talks with Britain on a political settlement. </P>
<P> ``It is part of the threat that the IRA want to remind the government that unless they continue with their surrender they are willing to go back to violence,'' he alleged. </P>
<P> It was the second device found and made harmless since the IRA ended its war last September to allow its political arm, Sinn Fein, to enter talks with the British government. </P>
<P> A similar bomb using the plastic explosive semtex was found in the western town of Enniskillen, in December and the IRA denied any involvement. </P>
<P> Robinson said he expected the IRA to deny any link to the Newry device but dismissed speculation that it might be the work of a breakaway IRA faction. </P>
<P> ``You will have all sorts of denials and arguments that this was the work of some disgruntled group within the Provisionals. But I am not convinced of that argument.'' </P>
<P> Police said an anonymous caller rang at 4:30 p.m. EST Tuesday saying the bomb would go off in 30 minutes but army experts made it safe with a series of small, contained explosions. </P>
<P> Security forces rushed to the scene and evacuated scores of people from Newry, scene of frequent IRA attacks over the past two decades. It is 40 miles south of Belfast. </P>
<P> The bomb contained batteries and detonators and was relatively sophisticated, police said. </P>
<P> Protestant Loyalist guerrillas are also known to have small quantities of the Czech-made explosive and used it in two attempted bombings in Dublin last year before ending their campaign to maintain British rule of Northern Ireland. </P>
<P> The discovery was made the day after Irish police said they had found 12,000 rounds of IRA ammunition hidden in boggy ground in the Irish Republic 50 miles west of Dublin. </P>
<P> Britain says it wants the IRA and its Loyalist foes to surrender or decommission their arms before either group can be invited to take part in new all-party talks on a political settlement for Northern Ireland. </P>
<P> But both the IRA and the Loyalists say they will only discuss the surrender of arms when progress has been made on a settlement and when there are signs that Britain will set free hundreds of prisoners jailed for security offenses. </P>
<P> British officials have hinted that they might soften their stand on arms if the guerrillas hand over their stocks of semtex, which is a difficult explosive to store. </P>
<P> Semtex bombs were used to devastate London's financial City district in the 1990s and were also used in an attack on British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Cabinet in 1984. </P>
<P> The Northern Ireland peace process is currently marking time awaiting Britain and Ireland to agree on the next constitutional steps they might take toward a settlement. </P>
<P> But Northern Ireland's Protestant politicians are threatening to bring down Prime Minister John Major's government if it agrees to set up powerful cross-border bodies to manage trade, tourism and other matters. </P>
<P> They fear that this will hasten the end of the province's British status and give Dublin power over the province, which was partitioned from the rest of Ireland seven decades ago. </P>
