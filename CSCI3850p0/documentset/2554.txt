<P>  The streets of Guatemala City were quiet Friday after 12 hours of riots in which one person was killed and 32 were injured by gunfire, police said. </P>
<P> Thousands of Guatemalans, angry over a 50 percent hike in bus fares, took to the streets Thursday night and fought with riot police who responded in some areas by shooting into crowds and using tear gas to disperse protesters. </P>
<P> A police spokesman said a young man died from gunshot wounds but had no details on the circumstances surrounding his death. Ten riot police were also injured during the disturbances, he said. </P>
<P> President Ramiro de Leon delivered an ultimatum to the municipal council and transport companies Friday to sort out the bus dispute which has caused chaos for the past 10 days. He did not say what measures he was considering if talks fail. </P>
<P> ``There are mechanisms that can be adopted to defend the honest and hard working population and depending on circumstances, the government will act,'' he told reporters. </P>
<P> At the request of Attorney General Acisclo Valladares, judges ordered the police and army to seize buses belonging to transport companies that illegally raised fares a week ago. The government will take over the bus service and provide drivers, Valladares said. </P>
<P> Anxious Guatemalans flooded local radio stations with reports that convoys of buses were leaving the city to avoid being seized. The army set up a special hotline for the city's inhabitants to report the location of buses. </P>
<P> There was no bus service for the 10th straight day and the city's inhabitants took to bicycles or crammed into trucks to reach work. </P>
<P> In the city center, which was the scene of looting and violence by street gangs, life returned to normal although many shops remained shut and others had wooden boards nailed to their windows in case of further attacks. </P>
<P> Transport companies announced a fare hike last week complaining that fares were so low it was impossible to make a profit. </P>
