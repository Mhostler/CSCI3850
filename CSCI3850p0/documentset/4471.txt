<DATELINE>LEADER, Saskatchewan (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  An American stockbroker landed safely in Canada Tuesday after setting a world distance record and becoming the first person to cross the Pacific Ocean alone in a balloon, project spokesmen said. </P>
<P> Steve Fossett, 50, put his balloon down near Leader, Saskatchewan, Tuesday afternoon, spokesman David Slavsky said from Chicago. </P>
<P> ``He's down and he's safe,'' he said. </P>
<P> Witnesses said Fossett, a stockbroker from Chicago, landed softly in a field near Leader, about 250 miles east of Calgary. </P>
<P> ``That's a once-in-a-lifetime thing,'' said hotel employee Duane Dickie, who watched the large white balloon come down to earth. </P>
<P> Fossett, who took off from South Korea on Feb. 18, achieved his goal of becoming the first person to fly a balloon solo across the Pacific. </P>
<P> He traveled more than 6,000 miles, breaking the official ballooning distance record of 5,200 miles set by Ben Abruzzo and other balloonists in 1981, project manager Bo Kemper said from Chicago. </P>
<P> It was unclear if Fossett had gone further than the unofficial world record distance of 6,800 miles set by Virgin Atlantic Airways founder Richard Branson in 1991, he said. </P>
<P> Kemper said he believed Fossett had also set a world record altitude for this type of balloon of 26,600 feet. </P>
<P> Project spokesmen had said earlier that winds were too strong for Fossett to land in Canada and he would probably put down in Montana or South Dakota Wednesday. </P>
<P> But Slavsky said there were ``good meteorological reasons to go for a landing now'' and also that Fossett was tired. </P>
<P> ``It's a rough trip,'' he said. ``He wants to come home.'' </P>
<P> Slavsky, dean of natural sciences at Loyola University in Chicago, was in charge of scientific experiments aboard the balloon to study El Nino, a Pacific Ocean current which influences weather patterns in many areas of the world. </P>
<P> Fossett reached Canadian shores Tuesday morning after traveling at speeds of up to 90 mph. </P>
<P> ``As soon as he hit Vancouver Island ... he indicated he was real happy,'' said Kemper, who was in contact with Fossett from Chicago throughout the flight via computer. </P>
<P> Fossett had to endure extreme cold during the trip because heaters in his cabin did not work, said Kemper, an assistant vice president of Loyola University in Chicago and an old friend of the balloonist. </P>
<P> Kemper said the balloon's generator, which powers Fossett's radio, had stopped working and he was using a backup battery. </P>
<P> Fossett, who took off from Seoul's Olympic Stadium, financed the trip himself and had no sponsors. Kemper would not say how much it cost. </P>
<P> The specially designed balloon, 52 feet in diameter and 98 feet high, weighs more than two metric tons -- including the pilot's gondola with fuel and supplies. Fossett has an oxygen mask for use at high altitudes. </P>
