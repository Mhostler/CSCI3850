<P>  Egyptian police have killed a suspected Muslim militant who was being groomed to lead the largest militant group fighting to overthrow the government, the interior ministry said in a statement Thursday. </P>
<P> Police also killed three other Gama'a members and arrested another three, one of whom was on the run from a death sentence, it said. </P>
<P> Ahmed Hassan Abdel-Jaleel, who used the codename al-Ustaz (professor), was killed when police went to arrest him in a hideout in Wadi Shaheet, near the Nubian desert in Egypt's southernmost province of Aswan, the statement said. </P>
<P> The ministry did not say when he was killed but security sources said it was some time after Nov. 10. </P>
<P> Abdel-Jaleel, who was given over $130,000 by militants in exile to carry out violent acts, was wanted for a series of explosions outside banks earlier this year, the statement said. </P>
<P> Security sources said Abdel-Jaleel had replaced Talaat Yassin Hammam, the head of the military wing of Gama'a, who was killed by police earlier this year. </P>
<P> Egyptian authorities are locked in battle with militants who want to overthrow the government and set up a strict Islamic state. </P>
<P> Abdel-Jaleel spent six years in Afghanistan training Arab Muslim militants who fought alongside the mujahideen against government forces during the Soviet invasion, the ministry said. </P>
<P> He helped many militants return to Egypt via Sudan, it said. Security sources said he returned to Egypt less than a year ago. </P>
<P> About 500 people have been killed and more than 800 wounded in political violence in Egypt since 1992. </P>
