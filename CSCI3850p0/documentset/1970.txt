<P> (Eds: updates with suspected hitman being identified among cult dead.) </P>
<P>  A Swiss man suspected of being responsible for at least three of last week's 53 cult deaths in Switzerland and Canada was formally identified Wednesday among the dead. </P>
<P> Police from the canton of Valais said the corpse of 35-year-old Joel Egger was among the 25 bodies found in three charred Alpine chalets in Granges-sur-Salvan. </P>
<P> According to earlier Swiss and Canadian media reports, police suspect that Egger and female sect member Dominique Bellaton travelled to Canada and killed a family of three in Quebec four days before the deaths in Switzerland. </P>
<P> Antonio and Nicky Dutoit and their three-month-old son were found in the gutted remains of a house in Morin Heights, 50 miles north of Montreal. The baby had been stabbed in the heart. </P>
<P> Speculation also mounted that Egger, a former mechanic who lived with his wife in the farmhouse at Cheiry where 23 other cultists died, could also have helped finish off the victims there before his fatal last journey to Granges. </P>
<P> Confirmation of Egger's death appeared to fill in another piece of the jigsaw puzzle for investigators. But police said there was no sign yet of the man who could help them complete it -- cult guru Luc Jouret. </P>
<P> With the deaths confirmed of two other leaders of the Order of the Solar Temple, Joseph Di Mambro and Camille Pilet, 46-year-old Jouret is seen as holding the key to the mystery. An international arrest warrant for murder and arson was issued in his name last week. </P>
<P> Investigators say Jouret could well have perished in either Cheiry or Granges. Until his body is identified, however, the arrest warrant still stands and police spokesman Carlo Kuonen said he was still being ``actively'' sought. </P>
<P> ``We've had nothing concrete yet,'' Kuonen told Reuters. </P>
<P> The deaths, initially seen as a collective suicide but now being treated for the most part as murder, have sparked off a police inquiry spanning at least three continents. </P>
<P> Canadian police have worked closely with their Swiss counterparts, sending a team of liaison officers to Switzerland, and police in Belgium and France have also been kept busy. </P>
<P> Kuonen said a Swiss police expert and an investigator from the canton of Valais Wednesday visited the Carpentras area of southern France, where cult members had property. </P>
<P> The trail is also leading increasingly to Australia, which Jouret and Di Mambro visited frequently from 1986 to 1994. Di Mambro had recently rented several luxury properties on Australia's Gold Coast. </P>
