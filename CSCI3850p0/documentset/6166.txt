<DATELINE>CHICAGO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A boy adopted shortly after his birth four years ago was tearfully taken away from the only parents he has ever known Sunday and handed over to his biological parents. </P>
<P> The boy, identified in court records only as ``Baby Richard,'' was placed by his weeping adoptive mother inside a van outside her Chicago home as a crowd of horrified neighbors and the boy's adoptive father looked on. </P>
<P> ``He was terrified,'' said Chicago Tribune columnist Bob Greene, who had written extensively about the case. He said the boy begged his adoptive mother and father not to let him be taken away. </P>
<P> The blonde boy, dressed in a red jumpsuit, was carried crying by his adoptive mother to the arms of his natural father who, witnesses said, had promised to maintain contact with the family. Earlier the family had brought a box of the boy's toys out of their home to be taken with him. </P>
<P> The adoptive mother ran back to the house weeping after handing over the boy. Her husband watched painfully as family members restrained him. </P>
<P> The adoptive family has an older child who was reportedly devastated at losing the boy he had known only as a younger brother. </P>
<P> Hours later television reports showed the boy arriving at his new home, smiling and apparenty in good spirits. The natural parents' lawyer said the transition had gone smoothly. </P>
<P> The turnover ended a custody fight that began shortly after the boy was born and went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which consistently refused to intervene. The Illinois Supreme Court had ordered the boy returned to his natural parents. </P>
<P> The boy was told two weeks ago that he was adopted. </P>
<P> The boy's mother, Daniela Janikova, gave him up for adoption four days after he was born. At the time she was not married to the father, Czech-born Otakar Kikrchner, who was was out of the country. </P>
<P> When Kirchner returned to the country she told him the baby had died, but about two months later Kirchner found out the baby was alive and began a legal battle to recover the boy. The couple later wed. </P>
<P> The case was played out much like the 1993 ``Baby Jessica'' case in which a three-year-old girl, weeping and strapped inside a car seat, was forcibly removed from the home of her adoptive parents in Michigan and returned to her natural parents in Iowa after a court battle. </P>
