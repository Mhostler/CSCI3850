<P>  British army experts defused a lethal bomb in a Northern Irish town Sunday, triggering new security concerns in the province after four months of uneasy peace. </P>
<P> Police said the bomb, found in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, near the border with the Irish republic after an anonymous telephone warning, contained the explosive Semtex. </P>
<P> Rival Catholic and Protestant guerrillas have operated cease-fires over recent months, creating unprecedented optimism about prospects for long-term stability after 25 years of conflict which claimed more than 3,000 lives. </P>
<P> An RUC spokesman said that no codeword was used -- unlike the normal pattern of bomb blast tip-offs by known guerrillas -- and that no organization had accepted responsibility. </P>
<P> Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) which frequently used Semtex in bombing campaigns, adopted a cautious approach to the incident early Monday. </P>
<P> A Sinn Fein spokesman commented, ``Sinn Fein is not making any statement until we get more details about the incident.'' </P>
<P> Although the new-found peace is fragile, both sets of opposing guerrillas have held to their cease-fires so far except for a robbery by IRA members in which a postal worker was killed. The IRA said later the robbery had not been officially sanctioned by its leadership. </P>
<P> In mid-October, police in the Irish republic made a series of swoops and detained suspected renegade republicans in the mainly Catholic state. All were later released without charge. </P>
<P> British security sources said early Monday that the components of the powerful incendiary bomb, which had been placed outside a furniture store, were being examined for any indications of who had made it. </P>
<P> The device contained a plastic box containing 3/8 gallon of gasoline, two commercial detonators, batteries and two pounds of Semtex, which is 10 times more powerful than the homemade explosives guerrillas often use. </P>
<P> One security source said that there was no particular significance in the target. </P>
<P> The bomb was placed outside a store near a road interchange not far from Enniskillen town center, the scene in 1987 of the worst IRA atrocities when an IRA bomb exploded without warning killing 13 people at an Armistice Day ceremony. </P>
<P> The IRA is known to have large stocks of Semtex. Protestant Loyalists, who wish to maintain the province's links with Britain, also have a sophisticated bomb making capacity but the commercial brand of Semtex is largely associated with their republican rivals. </P>
<P> A security insider said that as well as causing a huge fire, the bomb was intended ``to cause one hell of a bang.'' </P>
