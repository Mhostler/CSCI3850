<P> Russell said investigators may want to talk again to the man, a U.S. citizen initially described by the Justice Department as a ``possible witness'' to the blast. But they had no reason to believe there was a danger he would flee the country. </P>
<P> Russell was unable to say if the man -- identified by the Jordanian government as Ibrahim Abdullah Hassan Ahmad -- had any knowledge about the car bombing. It was not clear if U.S. authorities made a mistake in believing he might have some connection to the blast. </P>
<P> FBI officials said the man, believed to be an Oklahoma resident, initially was interrogated by federal officials at Chicago airport, before being released. </P>
<P> He then flew to London, where British officials detained him at the request of the United States and sent him back for more questioning. </P>
