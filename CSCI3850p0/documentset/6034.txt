<P>  Pakistani carpet makers said Tuesday they might take legal action against those accusing them of involvement in the murder of a 12-year-old Christian campaigner opposing child labor. </P>
<P> Iqbal Masih, president of the children's wing of the Bonded Labor Liberation Front of Pakistan (BLLFP), was shot and killed in a village in the central Punjab province on Easter allegedly by an employee of a local landlord. </P>
<P> The BLLFP accused a local landlord for plotting to kill Masih at the behest of some of the carpet makers BLLFP accuses of using children as bonded weavers. </P>
<P> But Abdul Latif Malik, Chairman of the private Pakistan Carpet Manufacturers and Exporters Association, talking to Reuters by telephone from Lahore, denied the charges. </P>
<P> ``The media have falsely implicated carpet makers in the incident, resulting into a sharp reaction from activists and importers of Pakistani carpets around the world,'' he said. </P>
<P> Police said Masih's killing did not appear to be a plot and that the boy was shot near the Punjab capital of Lahore by a man he and two relatives had scolded for having sex with a donkey. </P>
<P> ``Private importers from Belgium, the Netherlands, Australia, Sweden and France have indicated their inability to honor their contracts if anti-child labor activists in their country ask people not to buy Pakistani carpets,'' Malik said. </P>
<P> ``Our first priority is to let the world have the true picture and if the need arises we will take legal action against the news agencies and papers who reported an incorrect story.'' </P>
<P> Malik said no bonded labor was employed in Pakistan's carpet industry and there was no element of exploitation. </P>
<P> ``Children employed in carpet weaving are not bonded labor, they are employed with the consent of their parents and family members and in no way are being exploited as is being projected,'' he said. </P>
<P> But a BLLFP spokesman, talking to Reuters by telephone from Lahore, alleged that Masih's family was forced to sign a concocted report about the murder. </P>
<P> ``It is usual in the rural areas for landlords to get poor people like Masih killed by their men and get away with it by manipulating police records and by terrorizing the family of the victim to say what they want them to say,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``We are happy if they (carpet makers) take legal action as it would only clear the ambiguities surrounding the murder of Masih,'' he said. </P>
<P> In Lahore, a sister of Masih was among about 1,000 demonstrators who marched on the streets to protest the murder. </P>
