<P>  Life in a sect of Buddhist ascetics need not be all hardship. It can also include luxury hotels, an endless supply of melons and meals specially prepared using your own bathwater. </P>
<P> Police have found a manual issued to members of the doomsday cult Aum Shinri Kyo (Supreme Truth) on how to treat their mysterious leader, Shoko Asahara, the Yomiuri newspaper said in its Tuesday evening edition. It appears to illustrate his absolute supremacy over 10,000 followers. </P>
<P> Asahara, a long-haired bearded guru who says he is able to levitate, has been in hiding since sarin nerve-gas attacks on March 20 that killed 12 people and injured 5,000 on the Tokyo subway system. </P>
<P> After the cult became a strong suspect in the attacks, the grim lifestyle of its members has become popular fodder for the Japanese media. </P>
<P> They live in harsh communal living conditions, when not forced to meditate in solitary confinement, and two meals of Aum-recipe vegetable soup a day has left most of them pale and skinny. </P>
<P> The most recent photographs and videos of Asahara, on the other hand, show a portly man, his trademark purple pyjamas hanging over a large belly. </P>
<P> The manual described by the Yomiuri newspaper says he should be put up in twin or double rooms in deluxe hotels, preferably bright and with a refrigerator. </P>
<P> His food must not be frozen or pre-prepared, and soup should be made with stock freshly prepared from seaweed and mushrooms. </P>
<P> He likes curried rice but not potatoes or spinach, and gets most of his protein from soya-based foods like tofu. Melons are essential, and 15 apples, sweet ones, should be laid on. The apples should be made into juice just before the master drinks it. </P>
<P> As usual, in a cult that calls itself Buddhist, meat or fish are out in normal circumstances. But ``if he wants them they should be provided quickly,'' Yomiuri quoted the manual as saying. </P>
<P> Water used for cooking must be taken from the ``Miracle Pond,'' the cult's euphemism for Asahara's bathwater. This is regarded as holy, and followers buy it in bottles to drink and as an aid along the road to enlightenment. </P>
