<DATELINE>COWES, Isle of Wight (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  British police Sunday recaptured three convicts serving life sentences, whose escape from Parkhurst island prison -- known as Britain's Alcatraz -- triggered a political storm. </P>
<P> Keith Rose, 45, and Andrew Rodger 44, were cornered by police less than a mile from the Cowes ferry terminal to the Continent, a police spokesman said. A third man, Matthew Williams, 25, leaped into the sea but was swiftly captured. </P>
<P> A spotter plane and dogs were being used by police to hunt the fugitives in a wooded area of the island where the maximum-security prison is located. The three used a skeleton key and a ladder to escape Tuesday night. </P>
<P> ``The three prisoners have now been recaptured,'' the police spokesman said of the 150-officer operation. </P>
<P> The alarm was raised by an off-duty prison officer who recognized the men and who alerted police. The men were said to be exhausted after camping out in bad weather. </P>
<P> Two were arrested without a struggle, while Williams evaded capture in darkness and drizzle and made it to the sea, where he was eventually picked up by a police launch. </P>
<P> The recapture vindicated police and Prison Service assertions that the three fugitives, described as ``extremely dangerous,'' were still on the island off southern England despite the fact they had a two-hour start before their escape was discovered. </P>
<P> Rose was jailed for life for shooting dead a supermarket tycoon's wife during a bungled kidnap attempt, while Rodger murdered a nightwatchman during a robbery. </P>
<P> Williams once plotted to invent a killer ``superfly'' to destroy mankind and was serving five life sentences for offenses that included bomb-making and arson. </P>
<P> The escape sparked heated political debate in Britain about security in prisons and highlighted low morale among prison staff as well as corruption in the system. </P>
