<DATELINE>PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Haitian police fired shots at pro-democracy activists Tuesday, just hours after the country's military leader met a U.S. congressman in three hours of tense talks aimed at breaking the stalemate between the two sides. </P>
<P> An unidentified number of pro-democracy activists were injured and at least one person arrested when police and plain-clothes auxiliaries attacked the headquarters of a pro-democracy group, the Haitian National Party for Democracy and Progress (PNDPH), its leader said. </P>
<P> Senator Turneb Delpe said the police attacked the building where a meeting was about to take place and shot at participants. He said that at least one person was arrested and others were injured in the incident. </P>
<P> No other details were immediately avaialble. Delpe said he and Port-au-Prince Mayor Evans Paul had arrived after the shooting. </P>
<P> The incident occurred a day after an unexpected meeting between Haiti's military leader Raoul Cedras and Representative Bill Richardson, a New Mexico Democrat. </P>
<P> The three hour meeting over dinner did not appear to signal a break in the stalemate between the two sides, a U.S. official said Tuesday. </P>
<P> According to one report, the two men did not discuss the crucial issue of Cedras's departure as head of the country's powerful armed forces. </P>
<P> ``It is important to emphasize these were not negotiations,'' said U.S. embassy spokesman Stanley Schrager. ''The negotiation process is over. All that we're discussing, if we're discussing anything at all, are the modalities of the general's departure.'' </P>
<P> When asked if Cedras and Richardson had talked about Cedras leaving as commander in chief, Schrager replied, ``Not that I know of.'' </P>
<P> He hinted that the general did not give any quarter in the discussions, saying, ``It was not unexpected what he heard from General Cedras.'' </P>
<P> Observers gave Richardson's visit some significance because the 46-year-old congressman is known to be a close friend of President Clinton's. But his office said he did not carry any messages from the president. </P>
<P> In a statement issued after the meeting, Richardson said he had heard Cedras's views and reiterated the U.S. commitment to the restoration of democracy in Haiti. ``The discussions were extremely frank and informative,'' the statement said. </P>
<P> As they try to resolve Haiti's lingering political crisis and return ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the United States and the United Nations have insisted on the resignation of Cedras and two other top members of the military -- Brigadier General Philippe Biamby and Lieutenant Colonel Michel Francois, Port-au-Prince police chief. </P>
<P> Although the United States and the U.N. have imposed harsh economic sanctions on the Caribbean country, the three men have given no indication that they are about to step down and allow the restoration of Aristide, the popular Roman Catholic priest they toppled in a September 1991 coup. </P>
<P> Monday's meeting, initiated by Cedras, was the first time the general has met with a senior U.S. official since he spoke with Connecticut Senator Christopher Dodd in late March. Since then, Cedras has refused to meet several visiting U.S. politicians. Cedras would not meet with Richardson when he visited six weeks ago. </P>
<P> Officials said they did not know why Cedras had a change of heart and asked to meet with Richardson. </P>
<P> Schrager called Monday night's rendezvous ``extremely frank and informative'' and said Richardson stressed to Cedras and the military top brass who also attended that the United States would not back down on its pledge to return Aristide. </P>
<P> ``He (Richardson) did what he had to do, which was ... make very clear where the United States' government stood,'' Schrager told reporters at a regular news briefing. </P>
<P> Richardson left Haiti early Tuesday morning to return to the neighboring Dominican Republic where he will speak with Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer. </P>
<P> Richardson is a member of the House Intelligence Committee and has been involved in international negotiations before, including talks on a political crisis in Burma. </P>
