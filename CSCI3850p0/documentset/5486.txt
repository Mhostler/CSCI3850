<P>  French Socialist President Francois Mitterrand Wednesday ridiculed attempts by right-wing would-be successors to attract left-wing votes with promises of wage rises and social benefits. </P>
<P> In one of his few interventions in the campaign for the April 23-May 7 presidential elections, Mitterrand said he was overwhelmed by the flow of electoral promises when he switched on his radio each morning. </P>
<P> ``I hear with rapture the most unexpected candidates outlining with sudden boldness the most expensive and costly programmes,'' he told a news conference. </P>
<P> ``Anything that has not been done will be,'' he joked, The jibe was clearly aimed at Mitterrand's old foe Jacques Chirac, who served as his prime minister in an uneasy 1986-88 ``cohabitation,'' and at Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, Chirac's former ally turned bitter rival. </P>
<P> The pair are engaged in a bitter duel for the presidency, with Socialist Lionel Jospin challenging Balladur for second place in the April 23 first-round ballot. </P>
<P> Balladur, accusing Chirac of piling up demagogic promises of wage hikes and income tax cuts to seduce disgruntled Socialist voters, has been forced to reverse his stand against wage rises as Chirac surged to a lead in the presidential race. </P>
