<P>  Following are excerpts from testimony Monday by Denise Brown, Nicole Brown Simpson's older sister, at the O.J. Simpson murder trial: </P>
<P> Under questioning by prosecutor Christopher Darden, Brown breaks down in tears as she tells of a violent attack against her younger sister that she said she witnessed in the early 1980s. </P>
<P> BROWN: He wanted her out of his house ... He grabbed the clothes out of her closet and started throwing them down into the foyer where we were down on the bottom. And he came back down and grbbed Nicole. He threw her up against the wall and then he grabbed her and the only thing I remember is that it was -- he looked so -- his who facial structure changed ... </P>
<P> DARDEN: What if anything unusual did you notice about his face at that time? </P>
<P> BROWN: At that time he got very upset and he started screaming ... It wasn't as if it was O.J. anymore. He looked like a different person and that is what Nicole had always said when he gets angry. </P>
<P> Darden questions Brown about how during Nicole's pregnancies, Simpson humiliated her in front of friends and family. </P>
<P> DARDEN: What did the defendant say about your sister's weight while she was pregnant? </P>
<P> BROWN: He used to call her a fat pig. He use to comment like this all the time .... He hated fat women ... </P>
<P> DARDEN: Did your sister react in any way on those occasions when the defendant would call her a fat pig or say that he hated fat women? </P>
<P> BROWN: At one point, she didn't care how much weight she gained. She just wanted him to leave her. </P>
<P> Under questioning by Darden, Brown describes how Simpson appeared during his daughter's dance recital on the night of the murders of Nicole and her friend Ron Goldman. </P>
<P> BROWN: He had a very bizarre look in his eyes. It was a very far away look ... It was actually really kind of spooky. It was a frightening look. </P>
<P> Brown testified that Simpson placed a chair in the corner of the auditorium and sat by himself. </P>
<P> DARDEN: What was he doing as he sat there in the chair? </P>
<P> BROWN: Every time I turned around ... he was staring at Nicole. </P>
<P> Brown told how the family, excluding Simpson, went to dinner at the Mezzaluna Restaurant after the recital. </P>
<P> DARDEN: What did you do after dinner was over? </P>
<P> BROWN: We got up and we walked out and Nicole was going to get some ice cream with the kids and we kissed each other goodbye. The last thing I told her was that I loved her. I'm sorry (she breaks into sobs). </P>
<P> JUDGE ITO: Do you want us to just take a few moments now? </P>
<P> BROWN: I'm sorry. I'll be alright. </P>
<P> DARDEN: Miss Brown, when you last saw your sister, what was her demeanor? </P>
<P> BROWN: She was happy because we had made so many plans to go do stuff ... We were going to go to Yosemite. We were going to go to Club Med. </P>
<P> In cross-examining Brown -- who admitted having a drinking problem but said she had been sober for a year -- defense attorney Robert Shapiro asks her about an incident at a bar where she testified Simpson grabbed Nicole's crotch and bragged ``This belongs to me.'' </P>
<P> SHAPIRO: At that time you were still drinking? </P>
<P> BROWN: Oh, I was drinking at that time, yes. </P>
<P> SHAPIRO: And how would you describe you consumption of alcohol? </P>
<P> BROWN: I said I had a problem ... On that night, we were doing shots of tequila. </P>
<P> SHAPIRO: How would you describe your state of sobriety? </P>
<P> BROWN: I would not have driven home. </P>
