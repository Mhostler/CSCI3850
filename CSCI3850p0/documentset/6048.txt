<P> The freighter had spent the night anchored 40 km (25 miles) out at sea. It had originally been scheduled to dock on Tuesday morning, but Aomori governor Hiroshi Kimura refused it entry just one hour before it arrived. </P>
<P> By early on Tuesday evening, however, the governor had lifted his order blocking the ship after receiving a written statement from the government in Tokyo promising not to bury the toxic waste in his prefecture permanently. </P>
<P> Watched by hundreds of riot police, a score of anti-nuclear activists stayed near the port on Wednesday. Most of the some 1,000 who had been protesting the shipment returned to work. </P>
