<P>  President-elect Ernesto Zedillo Thursday criticized California's new anti-immigration initiative and vowed to protest any human rights abuses of Mexican immigrants, Mexican news agency Notimex reported. </P>
<P> Speaking on the issue for the first time since Californians voted to slash social services to illegal immigrants Tuesday, Zedillo said he would ``defend all our compatriots with firm resolve,'' Notimex reported. </P>
<P> He promised to set up more foreign ministry outposts on the U.S. border and to protest any human rights abuses of Mexicans in the United States to international organizations after he takes office Dec 1, the news agency said. </P>
<P> Zedillo's comments to the country's National Education Congress came the day after he was officially declared president-elect. His is the latest in a string of horrified reactions from Mexicans to the so-called Proposal 187. </P>
<P> The government of outgoing President Carlos Salinas reacted bitterly to the measure, saying Wednesday it rejected ``all open and undercover forms of discrimination and any xenophobic practices.'' </P>
<P> Mexican citizens make up most of the estimated 1.7 million illegal immigrants in California. </P>
<P> The measure is expected to cast an unwelcome shadow over U.S.-Mexican relations less than a year after the two countries joined with Canada to form the North American Free Trade Agreement. </P>
<P> Zedillo is due to meet Clinton in the United States later this month before he takes office. </P>
