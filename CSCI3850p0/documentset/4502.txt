<P>  U.S. police chiefs believe the death penalty does little to deter crime, according to a new poll published Thursday. </P>
<P> The poll in January by Peter D. Hart Research Associates found that only 1 percent of the 386 randomly selected police chiefs cited the death penalty as a primary focus for stopping violent crime. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus six percentage points. </P>
<P> The non-profit Death Penalty Information Center, whose studies question capital punishment, commissioned the survey. Hart is a Democratic party pollster. </P>
<P> The pollsters said they found that the death penalty is a symbolic way for politicians to demonstrate they are tough on crime and that it distracts them from focusing on other solutions to the crime problem. </P>
<P> In order, they ranked in importance reducing drug abuse (31 percent), improving the economy and creating jobs (17 percent), simplifying court rules (16 percent), longer prison sentences (15 percent) and putting more officers on the streets (10 percent). </P>
<P> Of those surveyed, over 80 percent believe murderers do not think about the range of possible punishments before they kill and two-thirds disagreed with the proposition that the death penalty significantly reduces homicides. </P>
