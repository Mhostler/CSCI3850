<P>  CNN said Monday it will broadcast an admission of wrongdoing for airing taped jailhouse conversations of ousted Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega, thus avoiding a fine of up to $100,000. </P>
<P> Federal Court Judge William Hoeveler made the offer during sentencing of the network for criminal contempt of court for broadcasting the tape 43 times in 1990 even though it was told by the court not to do so. </P>
<P> During a sentencing hearing, Hoeveler said the cable television network would be liable only for court costs, ``If CNN is willing to make a statement to the effect that CNN realizes it was in error in defying the court's order.'' </P>
<P> The company, owned by Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System Inc., accepted the offer. </P>
<P> ``I do regret that we came into conflict with the court and that we did it in such a public way,'' said CNN President Tom Johnson during the hearing. </P>
<P> In late 1990, CNN said it intended to broadcast taped conversation between Noriega and Frank Rubino, his lawyer, which the network had obtained from a confidential source. </P>
<P> Noriega was under indictment at the time, accused of helping Colombian cartels ship cocaine to the United States. </P>
<P> Hoeveler, concerned that the tape's broadcast might infringe Noriega's right to a fair trial, ordered the network to keep the tape off the air until he could determine the effect of its broadcast. </P>
<P> But CNN aired the tape repeatedly, saying it felt the judge's order was unconstitutional. The network halted the broadcasts only after the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of appeals upheld Hoeveler and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the case. </P>
<P> Hoeveler noted Monday that CNN had broadcast the tape 43 times on its CNN and Headline News stations, a frequency he likened to ``rubbing the judge's nose in the court order.'' </P>
<P> Noriega, now imprisoned at the Metropolitan Correctional Center outside Miami, was convicted in April 1992 and sentenced to 40 years in prison. </P>
<P> It was determined that the tape's broadcast did not diminish the ousted dictator's rights. </P>
