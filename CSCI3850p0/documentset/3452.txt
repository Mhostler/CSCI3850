<DATELINE>MARSEILLE, France (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Crack French anti-terrorist police blasted their way onto a hijacked Air France airliner, killing the four Algerian Muslim gunmen and rescuing all 170 passengers and crew on board. </P>
<P> Millions in France held their breath as live television showed the hooded, black-clad commandos of the elite National Gendarmerie Intervention Group (GIGN) storming the Airbus 300 at Marseille airport Monday. </P>
<P> With guns blazing, the gendarmes attacked the cockpit where the hijackers were holed up. Others opened the side and rear doors to allow terrified passengers to slide down escape chutes and run to safety. </P>
<P> The commander of the GIGN unit, Maj. Denis Favier, said hundreds of rounds were fired. </P>
<P> The hijackers, members of Algeria's violent Armed Islamic Group (GIA), fired through the bulkhead into the passenger compartment, but failed to kill any passengers as they crawled to the doors. </P>
<P> During the dramatic Christmas hijacking of the airliner, which began in Algiers Saturday and lasted 54 hours, the gunmen killed three passengers. </P>
<P> A passenger on the hijacked aircraft said Tuesday he was told by police the gunmen had planned to crash the plane on Paris. </P>
<P> Algerian singer Cesar Ferhat told reporters police found out about the plan from released passengers who had overheard the hijackers whispering about it among themselves. </P>
<P> ``From the time they killed three men, they knew there was no way out for them,'' said a businessman who had been on board. Another passenger said the hijackers had recited death prayers. </P>
<P> The French Interior Ministry said three crew members, including chief pilot Bernard Dhellemme, and 13 passengers were injured in the police rescue operation. Nine gendarmes were wounded. </P>
<P> Interior Minister Charles Pasqua said the casualty toll was relatively light for the risky operation. Prime Minister Edouard Balladur said the gendarmes acted with ``exemplary courage and efficiency,'' and Defense Minister Francois Leotard bought them dinner. </P>
<P> In Tel Aviv, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, said France had set an example for the world by storming the plane. </P>
<P> ``I want to congratulate the French government, the French security forces who carried out a forceful action against a phenomenon which has nearly been forgotten in the world, the hijacking of planes and the taking of their passengers as hostages,'' Rabin told reporters. </P>
<P> Passengers were questioned by a state prosecutor before flying to Paris's Orly airport, the original destination of flight AF 8969, where government ministers, emotional relatives, doctors and an emergency psychiatric counselling team were waiting. </P>
<P> Most of the hostages were Algerians. Many, fearing retaliation in Algeria, covered their heads from cameras as they were led out of the Marseille terminal. </P>
<P> There were some 40 French passengers aboard besides the Air France crew. </P>
<P> Paris had insisted that Algeria let the plane fly to France after a third hostage -- a cook at the French embassy in Algiers -- was shot dead Sunday. </P>
<P> Passengers on the plane said the hijackers had announced they would kill two other hostages and were preparing blankets for the bodies. </P>
<P> The gunmen, who were said to be little more than teen-agers, had made various demands. They dropped an early demand for the release of jailed Algerian Muslim fundamentalist leaders, but later demanded to hold a news conference and fly to Paris. </P>
<P> Authorities in Marseille refused to refuel the plane. </P>
<P> The GIA claimed responsibility for the hijacking in a statement to a French news agency, saying it was meant as a response to France's military and financial aid to the Algerian government. </P>
<P> Both Prime Minister Balladur and Foreign Minister Alain Juppe denied Paris was taking sides in the three-year conflict between the Algerian authorities and Muslim fundamentalists that has claimed up to 20,000 lives. </P>
<P> Juppe denied France was providing military help and said financial help was intended to avoid Algeria sinking into chaos. </P>
<P> Balladur said Paris would never yield to blackmailers and early Tuesday met senior officials to consider new security measures and Paris's future ties with Algeria, where prior to the hijacking 22 French nationals had been killed in just over a year. </P>
<P> Balladur, accompanied by Pasqua, later headed for Marseille to visit the wounded. </P>
<P> President Francois Mitterrand was to welcome the Gign gendarmes at the presidential palace later Tuesday morning, to thank them for their courage during the raid, presidential aides said. </P>
<P> Tension between France and Algeria rose during the hijacking. The GIGN unit flew to Majorca off Spain, halfway to Algiers, in the early stages of the drama but the Algerian government refused to let the gendarmes in. </P>
<P> Paris demanded its diplomats in Algiers be allowed to monitor negotiations with the hijackers and Balladur, fearing a bloodbath in Algiers, insisted personally with Algerian President Liamine Zeroual that the plane be allowed to fly to France early Monday. </P>
