<P>  The National Park Service will resume tours of the birth home of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. on Saturday, almost 2 3/8 months after the King family ordered the federal agency off the property. </P>
<P> The Park Service will still not be allowed to take visitors to King's tomb during the half-hour tour it conducts 15 times a day, but tourists will again be able to enter the two-story wood frame house where King was born. </P>
<P> In late December the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change ordered the Park Service off its property. It objects to an $11.8 million dollar visitors center the federal agency is building on historic Auburn Avenue for completion before the 1996 Olympics. </P>
<P> The King Center wants construction halted so that it can seek financing for its own proposed multi-media King museum. Efforts to reach a compromise on the dispute have progressed slowly, but reached the point where the family agreed to allow the tours to resume. </P>
