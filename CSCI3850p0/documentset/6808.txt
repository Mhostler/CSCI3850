<P> Washington, which has threatened sanctions against imports of Japanese luxury cars if Tokyo does not open up its market, is pushing for a voluntary agreement to increase exports to Japan of foreign cars and car parts. </P>
<P> ``In practice it would be the Americans who benefit at the expense of European manufacturers of cars and car parts,'' Brittan said. ``We would give very serious attention to the possibility of taking any new voluntary plan to the WTO ourselves,'' he said. </P>
<P> Brittan, speaking to reporters after meeting Japanese Trade Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, said Hashimoto had assured him that Japan had no intention whatsoever of accepting a voluntary agreement on car and car part imports. </P>
<P> Japan has asked the WTO to rule on the trade dispute and the United States has said it will abide by any WTO decision. </P>
