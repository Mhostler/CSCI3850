<P>  A south China court sentenced four defendants to death for peddling thousands of fake tax receipts to tax evaders, the Legal Daily said Saturday. </P>
<P> The four facing execution were among 18 people convicted on Feb. 11 by the Intermediate People's Court in Shenzhen in southeastern Guangdong Province, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> It was not known if they had been put to death. </P>
<P> The faking of tax invoices and other receipts has become one of China's most serious forms of corruption, enabling holders to evade taxes or embezzle funds. </P>
<P> Businesses present fake receipts to tax collectors as evidence that they have already paid their taxes. Individuals use them to obtain ``reimbursement'' from employers, submitting them as evidence of expenses incurred for the company. </P>
<P> In a similar but unrelated case reported Saturday from Jinzhou in the northeastern province of Liaoning, a factory manager was sentenced to seven years in prison for using fake invoices to evade $258,000 in taxes. </P>
<P> Guo Dewei was found guilty of traveling to Guangdong to collude with a Shenzhen businessman to obtain tax invoices worth more than $1.5 million from several local firms, the official People's Daily said. </P>
<P> The alleged Shenzhen conspirator, Zhan Yanqing, evaded arrest and was being sought by police, it said. </P>
<P> Because Guo did not pocket the tax windfall, instead plowing it back into his state-owned firm, Linghe District Waterproof Silk Garments Factory, and because he confessed and showed a ``good attitude,'' he was spared more serious punishment. </P>
<P> Such was not the case for the four Shenzhen defendants sentenced to death, identified by the Legal Daily as Lin Huixiong, Lin Youkuan, Lin Yi and Qiu Guibiao. </P>
<P> The report did not say they were put to death promptly after sentencing, a common practice in China, indicating that they may have been allowed to appeal. </P>
<P> Fourteen co-defendants were sentenced to prison terms ranging from two years to life. </P>
