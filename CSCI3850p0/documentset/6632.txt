<P>  A team of U.S. scientists said Thursday they had applied advanced mathematical theory to crop pests, and found out why it is so difficult to eradicate them. </P>
<P> Their findings, reported in the science journal Nature, could help explain, for instance, why populations of some species of animals rise and fall so dramatically. </P>
<P> Robert Constantino, a zoologist at the University of Rhode Island, and a team of mathematicians and biologists tested chaos theory on flour beetles. </P>
<P> Chaos theory, which involves advanced mathematical formulas, is explained by the butterfly effect -- that in a chaotic system like world weather patterns, a butterfly in the Pacific can flutter its wings and cause a hurricane in the Atlantic. </P>
<P> Constantino and colleagues found that killing off adult flour beetles did not result in a simple linear decrease in population. </P>
<P> Instead, the number of beetles fluctuated wildly. The more adults they killed off, the bigger the fluctuations were. This extended to the number of larvae produced -- one week the rate would shoot up, the next week it would plunge. </P>
<P> Peter Kareiva, a zoologist at the University of Washington, said the findings were important for ecologists. </P>
<P> ``We might think that an increase in mortality of adult beetles caused by a pesticide application would simply reduce the populations affected,'' he wrote in Nature. </P>
<P> ``But an apt non-linear model indicates that the increased mortality could actually cause beetle populations to shift from a stable equilibrium to aperiodic functions.'' </P>
<P> Ecologists should use and understand chaos theory -- otherwise they will never be able to predict population changes, Kareiva said. </P>
