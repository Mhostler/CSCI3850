<DATELINE>PARIS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Jacques Verges, the French lawyer defending ``Carlos the Jackal,'' Saturday dismissed a newspaper report linking him to an attack on a nuclear plant in 1982. </P>
<P> French media reports focussing on Verges' past have switched the limelight from Carlos since the left-wing guerrilla mastermind was seized in Sudan and flown to a Paris jail. </P>
<P> The newspaper Le Parisien, quoting what it said were documents of the Stasi secret services of the former communist East Germany, said Verges had been ``directly implicated'' in preparations for the January 1982 firing of five rockets on the Phenix plant near Nantes in western France. </P>
<P> Le Parisien said Stasi films and photographs showed Verges and Carlos meeting in airports and hotels. </P>
<P> The attack, which French investigators believe was the work of Carlos, caused little damage. </P>
<P> Asked to comment, Verges denied the report, saying in a sarcastic tone: ``I was one of the authors of the attack on the plant, and of several other murders and bombings.'' </P>
<P> In an interview on TF1 television, he said the allegations were part of a plot by ``those who were in power from 1982 to 1985 or their friends who want to conceal the way they handled terrorism.'' </P>
<P> ``They held negotiations,'' Verges said referring to the Socialist administration of the time. Verges has said that he was asked to act as a mediator with Carlos in the 1980s by French authorities to try to put an end to attacks. </P>
<P> Verges made a reputation representing controversial figures, including the late Lyon Gestapo chief Klaus Barbie in the 1980s. </P>
<P> Wednesday he dismissed as a Stasi disinformation campaign a report by the daily Le Monde quoting Stasi files as saying he had been an ``operational member'' of Carlos's group in the 1980s. </P>
<P> Verges defended Carlos's girlfriend Magdalena Kopp, of Germany's Red Army Faction (RAF), and his associate Bruno Breguet against arms and explosives possession charges in 1982. </P>
<P> ``Why is it that these documents, which apparently people have known about for a long time, come out on the day that I am appointed (to defend Carlos)? If you read them closely, you will see they are invented,'' Verges told reporters this week. </P>
<P> Venezuelan-born Carlos faces legal action in France over three attacks authorities allege he carried out during his left-wing guerrilla campaigns of the 1970s and 1980s. </P>
<P> These are a 1982 car bombing in Paris in which a pregnant woman died, an attack on a Paris-Toulon train the same year which killed five people and a bombing of a Marseilles railway station a year later, which also killed five people. </P>
<P> The popular daily France-Soir reported that Stasi files named leading French figures, including politicians and intellectuals, who had been in touch with Carlos or his network. </P>
<P> As the allegations multiply, Carlos's lawyers are preparing their case that the guerrilla mastermind was seized illegally and are vowing to take the case to the European Court of Human Rights if necessary to get him released. </P>
<P> While Carlos sits in a Paris jail, Verges said his first move would be to file suit next week claiming the guerrilla was kidnapped in Sudan and illegally brought to France. </P>
<P> France and Sudan have repeatedly denied any deal in the capture of Carlos. </P>
