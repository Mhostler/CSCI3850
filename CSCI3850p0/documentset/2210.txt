<P>  The Solomon Islands had two men claiming to be prime minister Tuesday after the governor-general of the South Pacific nation swore in the opposition leader as caretaker premier in a brief, unannounced ceremony. </P>
<P> The move has left the country in confusion with existing Prime Minister Francis Billy Hilly refusing to resign. </P>
<P> Billy Hilly was dismissed by Governor General Moses Pitakaka Oct. 13, after mass defections across the floor of parliament gave the opposition the numbers to take power. </P>
<P> Billy Hilly, who came to power in June 1993, has taken the matter to the courts. The High Court is to make a final ruling on the legality of the governor-general's action Wednesday. </P>
<P> The Solomon Islands Broadcasting Corp. (SIBC) reported that opposition leader and former Prime Minister Solomon Mamaloni was sworn in at a Monday night ceremony attended by two other members of parliament. </P>
<P> But an SIBC journalist told Reuters from the capital, Honiara, that there was mass confusion over the situation. </P>
<P> ``No one knows what is happening,'' he said. </P>
<P> SIBC said the governor general has called for nominations for prime minister to be handed in Thursday to decide the fate of the 47-member parliament. </P>
<P> Mamaloni was prime minister in the early 1980s and again from 1989 to 1993 before he was defeated by Billy Hilly. </P>
