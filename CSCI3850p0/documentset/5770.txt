<P>  The mayor of a Colombian town accused Venezuelan soldiers Saturday of entering Colombian territory to arrest and torture farmers they accused of aiding guerrilla border attacks. </P>
<P> Mayor Luis Edgar Osorio of the small town of Cubara near the border with Venezuela told the Caracol radio network the Venezuelan soldiers had crossed the border two weeks ago and seized six farmers, accusing them of being guerrilla sympathizers. He said two of the farmers had since been released and had came home with allegations of torture. </P>
<P> ``They made them get on their knees on broken glass, they beat them with sticks, they put their heads in plastic bags, they choked them, they blinded them, they took their papers, they didn't give them any food,'' he said in the telephone interview. ``This is really savage and inhumane treatment.'' </P>
<P> Osorio said the farmers were forced to sign declarations absolving the soldiers of any wrongdoing. </P>
<P> Relations between the two countries have worsened since a column of the National Liberation Army (ELN), the second largest Marxist guerrilla group in Colombia, crossed the border and attacked a nearby Venezuelan naval outpost last February, torturing and killing eight people. Venezuela accused Colombia of neglecting its border and allowing an internal guerrilla problem to spread into its territory. </P>
<P> Venezuela has since forced hundreds of illegal Colombian immigrants to abandon their settlements on its side of the border and return to Colombia with no belongings. </P>
