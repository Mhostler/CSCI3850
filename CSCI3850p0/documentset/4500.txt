<DATELINE>PARIS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Algerian Muslim fundamentalist rebels said Thursday security forces massacred up to 200 prisoners in what authorities called a thwarted escape bid from an Algiers prison. </P>
<P> The exiled leadership of the outlawed Islamic Salvation Front, or FIS, said in a statement received by Reuters that more than 100 prisoners were killed at the Sekadji prison Wednesday. </P>
<P> Anwar Haddam, head of the Washington-based FIS Parliamentary Delegation said in a separate statement which gave conflicting figures that security forces killed 200 in a ``deliberate massacre of political prisoners'' at the central Algiers top security jail. </P>
<P> The toll cited by Haddam far exceeded reports by diplomats and Algerian newspapers who said nearly 100 prisoners were killed. The FIS leadership and Haddam have diverged in past statements on the war between Islamists and the government. </P>
<P> There was no official confirmation of the death toll. Algerian authorities have said security forces killed mutineers after they slit the throats of four guards. </P>
<P> ``The massacre cost the lives of more than 100 prisoners killed by the forces of repression,'' the FIS leadership said. </P>
<P> It said the killings followed recent, unspecified ``revenge operations'' in which security forces used heavy weapons and combat planes against civilians. </P>
<P> Haddam said: ``The massacre, which has left around 200 victims, follows other massacres in similar circumstances beginning with Berouaghia prison in November which left more than 500 prisoners dead.'' </P>
<P> The Justice Ministry has described the Sekadji mutineers as terrorists, the term used for Islamic militants fighting the military-backed government since it canceled a general election the FIS was poised to win three years ago. </P>
<P> It said the mutineers had broken down cell doors and slit the throats of four of seven guards taken hostage when their escape bid was thwarted. </P>
<P> It said a security forces assault became unavoidable when attempts to negotiate an end to the rebellion proved fruitless. </P>
