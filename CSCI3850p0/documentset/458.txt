<P>  U.S. prosecutors said Thursday they will proceed quickly against two British women accused of conspiring to kill a U.S. attorney who deported Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, an Indian guru who preached free love. </P>
<P> ``We finally prevailed and won extradition,'' said Barron Sheldahl, chief criminal prosecutor for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Portland. ``It's been more than three years.'' </P>
<P> Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal Ben Mahoney said Sally Croft, 44, and Susan Hagen, 47, would be arraigned Friday before U.S. Magistrate Donald Ashmanskas. </P>
<P> The two are accused of plotting with others to assassinate former U.S. Attorney Charles Turner in 1985 when Turner was conducting an investigation of illegal activities at a religious commune established in central Oregon by Rajneesh. </P>
<P> The guru, who had a collection of 90 Rolls Royces, moved from India to Oregon in 1980. He and his orange-clad followers purchased a ranch where they built the town of Rajneeshpuram. </P>
<P> The commune fell apart in 1985 after Rajneesh was convicted of fraud by arranging sham marriages so his followers could enter the United States. </P>
<P> He paid a $400,000 fine and agreed to leave the country. He died in India in 1990. </P>
<P> Three other former followers of Rajneesh have already pleaded guilty and two more remain at large, including Ma Anand Sheela, the former personal secretary to the guru who ran the day-to-day operations of the commune. </P>
<P> Croft, an accountant, was the chief financial officer of the commune, according to the indictment. She went by the name Ma Prem Savita, while Hagan was known as Ma Anand Su. </P>
<P> The indictment alleges the two participated in a plot to assassinate Turner and other people on a commune ``enemies list.'' </P>
<P> Turner was targeted because he was heading up an investigation of immigration fraud ``that threatened the existence of the commune,'' the indictment said. </P>
<P> The conspirators sent members of the commune to other states to buy pistols and silencers. But they never carried out the attack. </P>
<P> Part of the plot involved the attempted murder of Swami Devaraj, the personal physician to Rajneesh who could have provided information about illegal activities at the commune, the indictment said. He was injected with poison but survived. </P>
