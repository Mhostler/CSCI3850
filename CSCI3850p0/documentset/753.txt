<P>  President Boris Yeltsin, normally stingy with his political endorsements, tipped a reformist regional leader Saturday as a future president of Russia. </P>
<P> The lucky man was Boris Nemtsov, 34-year-old administration chief of Nizhny Novgorod on the Volga, seen by many Western economists as the ``Golden Boy'' of market reform. </P>
<P> Yeltsin, in lighthearted mood on a shirt-sleeve trip down the Volga, was asked by a television reporter about his opinion two years ago that Nemtsov was young but worthy of trust. </P>
<P> ``He has grown so much that you can already tip him for president,'' Yeltsin replied with a grin. </P>
<P> Since falling out with his former vice-president, Alexander Rutskoi, during 1993, Yeltsin has been careful to avoid publicly favouring any of his lieutenants as a potential successor. </P>
<P> Nizhny Novgorod region, 250 miles east of Moscow, has pioneered privatization and other free market reforms and is seen by many Russian and foreign experts as something of a model for the rest of the country. </P>
<P> ``In many things it was setting, and still is setting, an example of how to carry out reforms, methods that had never been used before in Russia,'' Yeltsin said. </P>
<P> Nemtsov was elected to the Federation Council, the upper house of the Russian parliament, last December. He has collaborated closely with prominent Russian economist Grigory Yavlinsky, himself a potential presidential candidate. </P>
<P> He has quarrelled publicly, however, with Vladimir Zhirinovsky, accusing the extreme nationalist politician of barging into Nemtsov's office with a group of aides and going through his papers in the governor's absence. </P>
