<DATELINE>LONDON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Princess Diana refuses to make the first move to divorce her estranged husband Prince Charles but does hope to remarry one day and have more children, according to extracts published Sunday from a new book about her life. </P>
<P> She also dreams that Charles will never be king. </P>
<P> The Sunday Times newspaper, serializing ``Diana - Her New Life'' by Andrew Morton, said Queen Elizabeth II had approved a new high-profile role for Diana who, ending self-imposed public retirement, will announce this month an enhanced charity role. </P>
<P> ``I'm coming back with a vengeance, you ain't seen nothing yet!'' the newspaper quoted Diana as saying. </P>
<P> However, Diana, 33, is still suffering from the eating disorder bulimia nervosa, which she is trying to treat with the new anti-depressant drug Prozac, the book says. </P>
<P> Morton says that for a time after the couple's separation two years ago, Diana was convinced Charles' old flame, Camilla Parker Bowles, would be divorced by her own husband, opening the way for Charles, heir to the British throne, to marry the only woman he has really loved. </P>
<P> Intensely jealous, the princess was said in the report to have bought large-scale maps to mark his secret meetings with Bowles in country hideouts. </P>
<P> But Diana, will not sue for divorce for fear of being blamed for a constitutional crisis, the book says. </P>
<P> ``Sit tight -- they will come to us,'' her lawyer Lord Mishcon is reported to have told her. </P>
<P> ``The subject of divorce has been discussed in general terms by the couple on at least two occasions and one senior divorce lawyer predicts she may be entitled to about 15 million pounds ($25 million) as a one-off payment,'' Morton reveals. </P>
<P> The book says Charles, who will be 46 on November 14, is reluctant to move first because of disapproval by his 94-year-old grandmother, the Queen Mother. </P>
<P> But it says he came under pressure from both the women in his life -- Diana and Bowles -- to chose between them. </P>
<P> ``You never do anything you say. When are you going to make your mind up?'' Bowles angrily asked him. </P>
<P> Unlike the recently published Jonathan Dimbleby biography of Charles, which told of the heir to the throne's adultery with Bowles while branding Diana a hysterical and conniving woman, Morton's book has no official backing. </P>
<P> But Diana is known to have aided him with his first book, ``Diana -- Her True Story,'' which shocked Britain with its revelations of the miserable state of the ``fairytale'' marriage. </P>
<P> That book won Diana public support and strengthened her hand in wrangling over the split-up. Some royal watchers suspect the follow-up is intended to do the same ahead of eventual divorce -- which it significantly talks about as if it were inevitable. </P>
<P> ``This is not authorized but it is authoritative because Morton has excellent contacts. To my knowledge the princess has no objection to this book,'' said John Witherow, acting editor of the Sunday Times. </P>
<P> The extracts suggest a battle raging between the Prince and Princess of Wales over the future of their sons, William and Harry, and the throne. At one point, Diana even threatened to flee with the boys from the royal family she dubs the ``leper colony'' to Australia. </P>
<P> Some of Charles' allies apparently warned him that Diana -- who made the last of several halfhearted suicide bids just before the separation, cutting her arms and smearing blood all over a royal jet -- was unstable. Exile, without her sons, would be the best solution for the monarchy. </P>
<P> Diana is said to have spoken of her dream that Charles would stand aside for elder son William, now 12, to become king. </P>
<P> ``If I was able to write my own script, I would hope that my husband would go off with his lady (Bowles) and leave me and the children to carry the Wales name until William ascends the throne,'' she told friends. </P>
<P> But Charles, with his family's backing, is determined she should never succeed in her ambition to become ``kingmaker'' or to have sole control of William and Harry, who is 10. </P>
<P> The book says the princess, who is hooked on astrology and believes she was a nun in a previous life, sees herself marrying a man of foreign blood when she is free from her husband. </P>
<P> ``She is absolutely hellbent on finding another man at some stage. There is nobody in mind,'' it quotes a friend as saying. </P>
<P> But the first published extracts skim over her past liaisons, if any. </P>
<P> Little mention is made of former cavalryman James Hewitt, who alleged last month in the first of a crop of royal books that he enjoyed a steamy five-year affair with the princess. </P>
<P> The Sunday Times promised more on that angle next week. </P>
