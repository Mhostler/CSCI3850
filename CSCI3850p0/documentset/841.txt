<P>  The environmental organization Greenpeace sent participants in a U.N. fishing conference Wednesday pieces of what it said was an illegal driftnet taken from an Italian vessel in the Mediterranean. </P>
<P> The scraps of mesh were sent with a letter saying that, while delegates were discussing sustainable fishing reforms, ``nations within the European Union continue to allow, encourage and, in one case, even protect illegal fishing practices and the EU seems completely unwilling or unable to take action to rectify this persistent problem.'' </P>
<P> Greenpeace said the mesh was from a 7.5 mile driftnet, which far exceeded the 1.6-mile limit allowed under EU regulations and a U.N. General Assembly resolution aimed at preventing the denuding of large stretches of ocean. </P>
<P> The delegates are attending the fourth session of the U.N. Conference on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks. These are species found both inside the 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ) within which coastal states exercise control and also on the high seas, where there is little or no effective control, resulting in serious depletion of some stocks. </P>
<P> Drawing attention to broader conservation issues, the Greenpeace letter said: ``Operating with no respect for regulations, fleets from Ireland, the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Italy continue to wreak environmental damage. In at least one instance, military forces have been deployed to protect these illegal activities.'' </P>
<P> A Greenpeace spokesman said this referred to a recent clash involving one of its boats and a French naval vessel in the Bay of Biscay. </P>
