<P>  Eight German skinheads went on trial Wednesday, accused of rampaging in the former Buchenwald death camp, where they chanted Nazi slogans, threw rocks and threatened to burn a supervisor to death. </P>
<P> The eight are charged with being part of a 22-strong neo-Nazi mob that rioted in the concentration camp memorial site July 23. Five others have also been charged and are expected to face trial next month, prosecutors have said. </P>
<P> The neo-Nazis face charges of breach of the peace, threatening life, causing bodily harm and using banned Nazi symbols and slogans. </P>
<P> More than 50,000 people were murdered during World War II at Buchenwald, which is situated just outside Weimar in the east German state of Thuringia. </P>
<P> The rampage in the camp aroused widespread outrage in Israel and the United States. </P>
<P> The police also came under fire for failing to prevent it, and for at first arresting only one of the suspects. Police had shadowed the rightwingers for several hours before breaking off shortly before they reached Buchenwald. </P>
