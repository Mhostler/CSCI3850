<P>  The Food and Drug Administration warned Thursday that some bogus cans of Similac baby formula have been distributed to retailers in several states and said consumers should return the cans to the store. </P>
<P> The FDA said the cans of formula have counterfeit labels with a fictitious code number and expiration date. The phoney labels are on cans of Similac with iron ``Ready to Feed'' liquid formula in eight ounce plastic cans. </P>
<P> The cans carry a ficticious code number OCT96 L5 SI 89635. The manufacturer's labels have been removed and replaced by the phoney labels, an FDA spokesman said. </P>
<P> FDA spokesman Don McLearn said the manufacturer, Ross Products, a division of Abbott Laboratories in Abbott Park, Ill, is working with federal authorities to try to determine who put the counterfeit labels on the cans. </P>
<P> Abbott said the formula is not believed to be dangerous to infants. </P>
<P> ``Unfortunately, we can't be'' sure of that, said Traci Lumberg, spokeswoman for the Abbott Park, Ill.-based firm. </P>
<P> The FDA said no children have been hurt by the phoney-labeled product, but that there was no way to guarntee the quality of the formula. </P>
<P> Abbott has no idea how many cans with counterfeit labels and fictitious lot numbers are out there, Lumberg said. </P>
<P> Some falsely labeled cans were found to contain Isomil, a soy-based formula made by the same manufacturer. </P>
<P> The bogus cans have been found stores in Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode island, Texas and Washington. </P>
<P> The FDA said the cans may be found in other parts of the country as well. </P>
