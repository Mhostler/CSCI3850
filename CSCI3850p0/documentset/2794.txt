<P>  Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi Wednesday backed the country's new peace deal and agreed to meet his rival, President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, to cement the accord, UNITA radio said. </P>
<P> At the same time, the radio, monitored in the island state of Sao Tome and Principe, broadcast a communique by UNITA Chief of Staff Arlindo Chenda Pena ``Ben Ben'' ordering all rebel forces to respect a cease-fire which came into effect Tuesday. </P>
<P> Savimbi, who failed to attend the signing of the accord in the Zambian capital Lusaka Sunday, announced his endorsement of it and his willingness to meet dos Santos in a letter to Madeleine Albright, U.S. ambassador at the United Nations, the radio said. </P>
<P> Albright is this month's president of the Security Council. </P>
<P> ``The agreement will allow a meeting at the highest level with Jose Eduardo dos Santos,'' the radio said, without saying where or when this might take place. </P>
<P> This was Savimbi's first public comment on the U.N.-brokered peace accord since it was signed. </P>
<P> After the cease-fire was declared to end Angola's 19-year civil war, ordinary Angolans and government officials called on Savimbi to meet dos Santos to cement the accord. </P>
<P> Both the government and UNITA have accused each other of cease-fire violations, with attacks on the northern city of Uige and the western town of Catengue. </P>
<P> The Wednesday afternoon UNITA radio broadcast made no mention of cease-fire violations by either side. </P>
<P> A UNITA spokesman in Lisbon earlier had denied government charges that the movement was violating the crease-fire. </P>
<P> UNITA radio reiterated the rebel movement's misgivings about the inclusion of South African troops in a U.N. peacekeeping force of up to 8,000 that is due to oversee implementation of the peace agreement. </P>
<P> ``They should not participate in the peacekeeping force until all their mercenaries have been withdrawn from Angola,'' it said. </P>
<P> Former South African soldiers, many of whom once fought alongside UNITA, are openly training and advising government troops. </P>
<P> South African Defense Minister Joe Modise told a defense exhibition in Johannesburg Wednesday that it would be difficult for Pretoria to refuse a U.N. request for troops. </P>
<P> ``From the looks of things, it does appear as if it's going to be very difficult for us to avoid participation in the keeping of peace in that area,'' he told a news conference. </P>
