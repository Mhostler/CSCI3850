<P>  President Haydar Aliyev issued a warning that Azerbaijan was ``on the brink of civil war'' and called on mutinous elite interior ministry forces to lay down their arms. </P>
<P> Aliyev, speaking on television Wednesday night after three days of unrest, said Deputy Interior Minister Rovshan Javadov, who was heading the rebel OPON forces, was trying to stage a coup d'etat. </P>
<P> ``He and his brother have turned the Azeri crack police forces into their own field camp. If the Javadovs do not lay down their arms, the full severity of the law will be used against them,'' he said. </P>
<P> About 700 rebel OPON (special-designation police unit) forces were in Javadov's headquarters five miles outside Baku. The base was encircled by several thousand government troops. </P>
<P> Interior Minister Ramil Usubov ordered the OPON disbanded on Monday after some of its members seized administrative buildings in two towns in northern Azerbaijan. </P>
<P> The local Turan news agency said dozens of people had been killed in fighting between OPON and government forces in the north of the republic Wednesday. There was no independent confirmation of this casualty toll. </P>
