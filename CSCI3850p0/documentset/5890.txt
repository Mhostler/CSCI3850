<P>  One of Algeria's main opposition leaders urged the army-backed government Thursday to join all-party negotiations to end three years of civil conflict. </P>
<P> Hocine Ait Ahmed, head of the Socialist Forces Front (FSS), told a news conference at the influential peace-brokering Sant' Egidio Community in Rome that all-party talks were the only way the North African country could move toward democracy in peace. </P>
<P> ``We've had three years of violence and horror. Algeria is caught in a vicious circle of repression and terrorism. But this barbary must end. What Algeria needs now is peace,'' Ait Ahmed said. </P>
<P> Some 40,000 people are estimated to have died in violence since the army scrapped multi-party elections in 1992 that Islamists were poised to win. </P>
<P> ``The government has to realize that meeting violence with violence will not resolve the crisis,'' Ait Ahmen said. ``The political field has to be opened so that democratic forces in the country can come together to work for a peaceful move toward democracy.'' </P>
<P> Algeria's opposition parties, at peace talks hosted by the Sant'Egidio Community last January, called on the government to soften its security activities and its stance toward the outlawed Islamic Salvation Front (FIS). </P>
<P> Ait Ahmed denied Algerian media reports that opposition parties had agreed to presidential elections following a series of consultations with President Liamine Zeroual. </P>
<P> Ait Ahmed has lived in exile in Switzerland since 1992. </P>
<P> The main opposition groups, including Islamic militants, released a statement Wednesday condemning Zeroual's plan to hold presidential elections this year. </P>
<P> ``He can hold elections but it won't change a thing,'' Ait Ahmed said. ``By holding presidential elections, Zeroual is simply re-affirming his place at the peak of Algeria's hierarchy of power.'' </P>
<P> Algeria's main opposition parties have called for the creation of a broad-based transitional government containing opposition and government forces to lead the country to democratic elections. </P>
