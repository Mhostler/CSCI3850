<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A senior U.S. State Department official said in published remarks Saturday that Washington will try its utmost to push Congress to provide economic aid to Jordan in 1995. </P>
<P> The official state news agency Petra quoted visiting U.SS Assistant Secretary of State for Middle Eastern Affairs Robert Pelletreau as saying the U.S. administration ``will do its utmost and in coordination with Congress in its new composition to provide economic assistance to Jordan.'' </P>
<P> Congress approved last year reducing a first installment of $220 million of a total of $702 million of official debt that Washington agreed to write off over three years to encourage Jordan's peace moves with Israel. </P>
<P> Jordan also secured at the end of 1994 rescheduling of $311.2 million of U.S. commercial debt over a 20 year period. </P>
<P> The U.SS official was quoted as saying Washington would work to find the best means to help improve Amman's chronic balance of payments deficit and encourage American investment in the country. </P>
<P> Pelletreau earlier met King Hussein who told him Jordan ``continues to support any effort that would lead to a comprehensive and permanent peace in the region.'' </P>
<P> ``Yes, the U.S. is committed to helping Jordan economically and that is part of our discussions,'' Pelletreau told the agency. </P>
<P> He said talks tackled ``how to strenthen our cooperation in ways that Jordan's people can and see and appreciate.'' </P>
<P> Many Jordanians express disappointment at the lack of immediate economic benefits from full peace with Israel. </P>
<P> Jordan hopes it will be rewarded for its peace treaty with Israel signed Oct. 26 with substantially higher U.S. aid, part of which it plans to use to modernize its aging army. </P>
<P> Diplomats expect that with a new U.S. Congress skeptical of foreign aid, Washington's supplementary military aid package to Jordan will not exceed about $200 million in 1995. </P>
<P> The senior U.S. official is on a regional tour that has so far covered Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. </P>
