<P>  Lawyers for a Filipina maid, due to hang Friday for a double murder, drafted a last-ditch plea Wednesday for a stay of execution. </P>
<P> The appeal follows one made last weekend by Philippines President Fidel Ramos, which was rejected by Singapore earlier Wednesday. </P>
<P> Singapore rejected Ramos' appeal for clemency on the grounds that new evidence was untrue, but the lawyers said they had new evidence from witnesses that will form the basis of a final appeal for Flor Contemplacion, a mother of four children. </P>
<P> The lawyers, who must lodge the appeal with Singapore president Ong Teng Cheong on Thursday, said two more Filipina maids had filed affidavits supporting their case. </P>
<P> Contemplacion, 42, was sentenced to death by hanging in January 1993 for strangling another maid and drowning the three-year-old son of the victim's employers in 1991. </P>
<P> Her scheduled hanging has triggered protests in Manila and threats of retaliation against Singapore by communist rebels in the Philippines. </P>
<P> Singapore's Foreign Affairs Ministry said their embassy in Manila ``has received a number of threatening messages'' that ``appear to be motivated by the Flor Contemplacion case.'' </P>
<P> President Ramos, speaking to reporters in Britain where he is visiting, had distanced himself from the protests. </P>
<P> ``We have done as much as we can. But we also recognize the sovereignty and system of laws in the host country,'' he said. </P>
<P> His rejected appeal was based on claims by Filipina Emilia Frenilla that she overheard a conversation between two men indicating the boy had drowned accidentally and the maid was killed by one of the men in a fit of anger. He then fabricated a story implicating Contemplacion, Frenilla said. </P>
<P> The Singapore statement said Contemplacion had confessed to both murders. </P>
