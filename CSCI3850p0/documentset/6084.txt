<P>  China has opened its airspace to South Korea's flag carrier, allowing the airline to cut flight time in routes to Europe, an airline spokesman said on Thursday. </P>
<P> Korean Air Lines (KAL) aircraft will fly to Moscow and Rome through Chinese and Mongolian airspace from next month, he said. </P>
<P> ``KAL will use Mongolian airspace for our Seoul-Moscow and Seoul-Rome routes,'' he said. The new arrangement would shorten the flight time by up to two hours and seven minutes. </P>
<P> South Korea and China last year launched regular direct air services between them after they established diplomatic ties in 1992 following decades of Cold War enmity. </P>
<P> In recent years, China has been balancing its relations with capitalist South Korea, which has poured billions of dollars of investment across a wide swathe of coastal and northeast China, and North Korea, a close communist ally. </P>
