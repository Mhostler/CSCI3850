<P>  A South African newspaper was besieged by contest players Wednesday, a day after its editor was hustled away in a police armored car after telling people their ``winning'' number in a newspaper was a print error. </P>
<P> The Star's editor Peter Sullivan told hundreds of readers lining up outside the Johannesburg city center building on Tuesday the newspaper was not legally obliged to pay out any winnings after an incorrect number was printed in two editions. </P>
<P> Sullivan asked for police protection when enraged entrants refused to accept the explanation and demanded payouts. </P>
<P> Star marketing editor Graham Rees said Wednesday the paper had paid $97,000 in consolation prizes of up to $27 before the fracas, but had set a noon Tuesday deadline for claims. </P>
<P> Top prize winners would have won $270. </P>
<P> ``Clearly there are a lot of unhappy people,'' Argus group regional managing director Deon du Plessis told Reuters after dozens of people besieged the newspaper offices again on Wednesday. </P>
