<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said Wednesday the United States must deliver contracted F-16 jet fighters to Pakistan or return the $658 million already paid for them. </P>
<P> But she told reporters the issue should be treated as a commercial deal and not intermingled with politics because Pakistan wanted to strengthen ties with Washington in the interests of global and regional peace. </P>
<P> A foreign ministry spokesman said earlier the United States must return the money if it could not supply F-16s and Pakistan would make other arrangements for its air defense. </P>
<P> A U.S. State Department spokesman said Tuesday that Washington, which cut off all military aid to Islamabad in 1990 in a row over its nuclear program, had no plans to allow the delivery of the 38 F-16s soon. </P>
<P> Bhutto, quoted the local PPI news agency, told reporters ``We have paid money for the planes. The United States should either provide the aircraft or return the money.'' </P>
<P> The foreign ministry spokesman said: ``Pakistan believes that if the United States is convinced that it cannot deliver the aircraft ... because of its own legislative impediments, it should take forthwith action to return the money which Pakistan -- a poor developing country -- has paid for these aircraft.'' </P>
<P> Pakistan ordered 71 F-16s costing $1.4 billion in the late 1980s. Some of the planes were built but were not delivered because of Washington's suspicions that Pakistan was trying to produce nuclear weapons, a charge which Islamabad denies. </P>
<P> But, referring to the so-called Pressler Amendment law under which Washington stopped military aid to Pakistan, he added: ``Pakistan will not accept further discriminatory restraint in order to obtain these aircraft.'' </P>
<P> The 1985 amendment bans military aid to Pakistan unless the U.S. president can certify to Congress that Islamabad has no nuclear weapons and is not trying to develop them. </P>
<P> Pakistan says its nuclear programme is peaceful but it will not sign the international Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty unless India does the same. </P>
<P> India exploded a nuclear bomb in 1974 but says it has no nuclear weapon. Pakistan says it is capable of making nuclear weapons but has decided not to do so. </P>
