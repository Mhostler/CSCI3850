<DATELINE>BOSTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  An in-depth study of nearly 112,000 Americans has confirmed that colorectal cancer runs in families. </P>
<P> It unearthed evidence that the risk is especially high among young people with a parent or sibling who has developed a colon or rectal tumor. </P>
<P> In the study, to be published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine, researchers led by Dr. Charles Fuchs of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston discovered that the risk is 72 percent higher than normal when a member of the immediate family has been found to have colorectal cancer. </P>
<P> The risk is greatest among people under 45. For this group of adults, having a mother, father, brother or sister with colon cancer makes the likelihood of having colon cancer more than five times greater than normal. </P>
<P> Previous studies have suggested that having a family history of colon or rectal cancer raises a person's lifetime risk of developing the tumor to two-to-eight times greater than the risk for the general population. </P>
<P> According to the American Cancer Society, about 156,000 new cases of colon and rectum cancer are diagnosed each year, and about 58,000 American die annually from the disease. </P>
<P> The Fuchs research team gathered data from a Nurses' Health Study of 121,700 female nurses and a Health Professionals Follow-up Study of 51,269 male dentists, optometrists, osteopaths, pharmacists, podiatrists and veterinarians. </P>
