<P>  A smiling South African President Nelson Mandela left a Johannesburg medical clinic Thursday after a cataract operation on his left eye. </P>
<P> Mandela walked out of the Morningside Clinic smiling and greeting nurses who lined his path. </P>
<P> The 75-year-old president had a patch over his left eye following a two-hour operation Wednesday by surgeon Percy Amoils, during which he removed a cataract from the left eye. </P>
<P> Amoils also redirected tear ducts which had virtually been destroyed by wind-blown grit when Mandela was breaking rocks in a limestone quarry at the Robben Island penal colony off Cape Town. </P>
<P> As a result, the president's glands did not produce tears and the moisture that remained in the eyes had to be prevented from running into his nose. </P>
<P> Mandela spent 17 of his 27 years in prison on Robben Island during the anti-apartheid struggle before his release in 1990. </P>
<P> The president, wearing casual khaki trousers and a cream-coloured fisherman's jersey, would not answer questions as he left the Morningside Clinic but thanked the cheering staff lining the exit. </P>
<P> He was not expected to resume his duties for a week or so. </P>
