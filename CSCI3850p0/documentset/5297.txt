<P>  The Senate Wednesday approved a bill giving Congress new power to review and veto government rules before they are put into effect. </P>
<P> The bill gives Congress 45 days to review new federal regulations as well as any ``significant'' rule proposed since Nov. 9, 1994. It was worked out as an alternative to a House-passed bill that would freeze all new regulations. </P>
