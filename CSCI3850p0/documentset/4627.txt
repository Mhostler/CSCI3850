<P>  A United Nations human rights investigator urged Indonesia Tuesday to reopen inquiries into the slaughter by its troops of up to 230 East Timorese at a demonstration in Dili in November 1991. </P>
<P> Presenting his report on the territory to the U.N. Human Rights Commission, Bacre Waly Ndiaye said that ``one of the most distressing aspects'' of his inquiry was the fact that nobody had yet been charged for the killings. </P>
<P> Yet he said some of the demonstrators in the Santa Cruz cemetery on Nov. 12, 1991 were now serving life sentences for ``inciting violence'' even though they had not carried arms. </P>
<P> Ndiaye, the Commission's special rapporteur on extrajudicial or summary executions, said he had to recommend a fresh enquiry by an independent commission. </P>
<P> Such a commission would have to enjoy the confidence of all sides, be technically well-equipped and have a strong mandate to investigate the killings. ``Its transparency could be reinforced by international participation, perhaps provided by the United Nations,'' he added. </P>
<P> Ndiaye visited East Timor and Jakarta last July, meeting high-level Indonesian officials and Timorese independence advocates. Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975 and annexed it the following year in a move that the United Nations has never accepted. </P>
<P> In his written report to the Commission, completed last year, Ndiaye concluded that the Santa Cruz slaughter was not just the result of troops overreacting to a demonstration that got out of control. </P>
<P> He said that, after considering numerous eye-witness testimonies, he believed official claims that the troops had fired in self-defense to be unsubstantiated. </P>
<P> Ndiaye said he also received reports indicating that security forces had prepared for the demonstration and had even dug trenches, allegedly to be used as mass graves. </P>
