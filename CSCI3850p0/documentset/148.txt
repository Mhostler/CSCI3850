<P>  An Australian church Sunday apologized to Aborigines for its treatment of them since white settlement. </P>
<P> ``I speak as a gubba (white person)...'' said the Rev Denis Towner after the Uniting Church national assembly debated at length over a statement of apology. ``Why do we gubbas take so long to work out the words we use to say sorry?'' </P>
<P> The statement signed on Sunday apologized for wrongs done to aboriginal people, such as poor treatment at church-run missions, and asked for their forgiveness. </P>
<P> The Australian government last year made a landmark attempt at reconciliation with Aborigines, which make up two percent of the population of 17.5 million. </P>
<P> A policy backed their claims to some traditional lands and set up a fund to compensate those who could not claim territory. </P>
