<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Wolfgang Schuessel, the new leader of Austria's conservative party, said Friday he will replace Alois Mock as foreign minister in a reshuffle of the coalition party's government line-up. </P>
<P> A career politician with a strong background in economic affairs Schuessel, 49, will bring added economic expertise to the ministry. He was named Sunday as leader of the struggling People's Party (OeVP), junior partner in the coalition government with Chancellor Franz Vranitzky's Social Democrats. </P>
<P> The OeVP's share of the vote has dwindled to a post-war low of around 22 percent this year. </P>
<P> Mock, foreign minister for the past eight years and a former OeVP leader, tried last week to stave off party pressure to resign before changing his mind and backing Schuessel as his replacement. He recently acknowledged he was suffering from Parkinson's Disease but wants to retain a seat in parliament. </P>
<P> Schuessel, economics minister since 1989 and a key figure in Austria's integration into the European economy, told a news conference Johannes Ditz, OeVP state secretary in the Finance Ministry, would become economics minister. Martin Bartenstein takes over environmental affairs and Elisabeth Gehrer will be education minister. </P>
