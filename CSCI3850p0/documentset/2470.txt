<P>  Two U.S. warships began a week-long visit to South Africa Tuesday, the first U.S. navy vessels to call in 27 years. </P>
<P> ``We are delighted to be here to show U.S. support for the new, democratically-elected government and to promote goodwill,'' Capt. Peter Smith of the guided-missile cruiser Gettysburg told a ship-board news conference at Simonstown naval harbor. </P>
<P> Smith said the visit was also intended to express Washington's interest in renewing close links with the South African navy, which were severed in the late 1960s because of Pretoria's apartheid policies then. </P>
<P> ``This visit provides a vehicle to deepen ties among our countries and to develop practical military cooperation with South Africa,'' Smith said. </P>
<P> Washington is keen to strengthen military links with black-ruled South Africa, which it views as a likely leader of regional peacekeeping efforts. </P>
<P> The Gettysburg and its accompanying vessel, the guided- missile frigate Halyburton, are due to leave Cape Town Nov. 14 for the Indian Ocean. </P>
<P> The last visit by a U.S. warship, the aircraft carrier Franklin Delano Roosevelt, was in 1967. </P>
