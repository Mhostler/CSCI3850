<DATELINE>HANOI, Vietnam (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Vietnam's deputy foreign minister said Sunday Secretary of State Warren Christopher might visit Vietnam, paving the way for full diplomatic relations with the United States. </P>
<P> U.S. officials visiting Vietnam to try to resolve the fate of American servicemen who went missing in action (MIA) during the Vietnam War also mentioned a possible visit by Christopher to Hanoi, Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai told Reuters. </P>
<P> ``The American side mentioned that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher might come to Vietnam at an appropriate time but the time has yet to be fixed,'' Mai told Reuters. </P>
<P> Christopher would be the most senior official to visit Vietnam since the end of the war in 1975. </P>
<P> President Clinton lifted a U.S. trade embargo against Vietnam in February and the two sides have agreed to open diplomatic liaison offices in each others' capitals soon. Full diplomatic relations are expected to follow shortly afterwards. </P>
<P> U.S. magazine Newsweek reports in its latest issue, due out Monday, that Christopher might visit Hanoi later this month and use the opportunity to open Washington's liaison office. Christopher is to meet Asian leaders in Bangkok at the end of July. </P>
<P> Newsweek quoted U.S. State Department sources as saying Christopher's visit to Hanoi hinged on positive findings from Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord's current tour of Vietnam to check progress on the MIA issue, the main stumbling block to normalization of relations. </P>
<P> Lord told a news conference in Hanoi Sunday that progress had been made but more needed to be done to resolve the issue. He said there were no plans for Christopher to visit Hanoi. </P>
<P> Asked about the liaison offices, Lord said: ``I imagine these offices opening quite soon but we do not have a specific date.'' </P>
<P> U.S. sources in Hanoi said any announcement about a visit by the secretary of state would be made in Washington. </P>
<P> Mai, who has had two meetings with the U.S. delegation since their arrival Friday afternoon, told Reuters the talks had been constructive and both sides were pleased with the results. </P>
<P> ``The U.S. side highly appreciated the Vietnamese cooperation on the MIA issue,'' he said. </P>
<P> Mystery surrounding the fate of 2,231 U.S. servicemen whose remains have never been found is still a hot political topic in the United States almost two decades since the end of the Vietnam War. </P>
<P> Travelling with Lord's delegation are representatives of the families of the missing servicemen, some of whom believe their loved ones may still be held captive. </P>
<P> U.S. sources said many of those unaccounted for were airmen who crashed over enemy territory and it is unlikely that their remains will ever be discovered, let alone identified. </P>
<P> ``We realize that we will never be able to account for every American that was lost in the war,'' Hershel Gober, U.S. Deputy Secretary at the Department of Veterans Affairs, told the news conference. The Vietnamese have more than 300,000 MIA cases, he added. </P>
<P> Gober and Lord later flew to an excavation site at Kham Duc, 46 miles southwest of Danang, where investigators believe they have found the remains of six Americans who died in a plane crash in 1968. </P>
<P> Fifteen U.S. servicemen and 60 Vietnamese sifting soil had found some human teeth and bone as well as a pistol grip, watch strap and part of a life jacket. </P>
<P> ``We've had nothing but cooperation (from the Vietnamese),'' said Bruce Clark, a 25-year-old U.S. Army investigator. ``They have gone out of their way to help.'' </P>
<P> On Monday, the U.S. delegation will fly to neighbouring Laos, where it is believed some of the servicemen may have died. </P>
