<P>  Jacques Verges, who has agreed to defend ``Carlos the Jackal,'' is recognized as one of France's most brilliant and provocative lawyers, with the late Lyon Gestapo chief Klaus Barbie among former clients. </P>
<P> Verges will defend Carlos, captured by France after two decades on the run, on expected charges in connection with a 1982 bombing in Paris. </P>
<P> A man whose fame rests largely on a willingness to plead seemingly indefensible cases spurned by others, Verges is a left-wing radical with a taste for publicity. </P>
<P> Jumping in to plead the case of one of the world's most wanted guerrillas is typical of Verges, 69. </P>
<P> In 1982, Verges defended Carlos' girlfriend, Magdalena Kopp, a member of Germany's notorious Red Army Faction (RAF). She was jailed in France for carrying arms and explosives and was released in 1985 after completing her sentence. </P>
<P> In 1987, Verges baffled his countrymen by defending Barbie, a Nazi twice condemned to death in his absence for war crimes. When Barbie fled France in 1944, Verges was marching to liberate Paris with General de Gaulle's Free French forces. </P>
<P> ``If he (Barbie) had been at the end of the barrel of my gun, I would have shot him,'' said Verges. ``Now I am simply doing my job as a lawyer.'' </P>
<P> Barbie was sentenced in 1987 to life in jail for crimes against humanity. He died in prison in 1991. </P>
<P> It is what some see as Verges' chameleon-like ability that has captivated and confused colleagues and public alike. Equally puzzling is a nine-year period in Verges' history in which he apparently disappeared from view and about which he refuses to talk. </P>
<P> This period from 1970 to 1978 still arouses speculation. </P>
<P> Verges, who clearly enjoys cultivating the mystery, fends off questions on his past or his motives with disarming charm and a trace of mockery. ``They say so many things about me, so many incorrect things,'' he laughed. </P>
<P> The calm and polished son of a French father and Vietnamese mother, Verges was successively a Stalinist, Maoist and anti-colonialist militant before taking up anti-Zionist causes. </P>
<P> He defended Middle East guerrilla Georges Ibrahim Abdallah in February 1987. Abdallah was given a life sentence for complicity in the murders of an American and an Israeli diplomat in Paris. </P>
<P> Verges has been twice married and twice divorced, and has three children. His spare-time interests include chess. </P>
