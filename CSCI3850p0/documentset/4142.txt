<P>  Senior officials from the shaky federation of Muslims and Croats in Bosnia agreed Sunday to appoint an international arbitrator to resolve disputed issues, an American official said. </P>
<P> ``Federation officials and Croatian officials have agreed at the initiative of the United States and the contact group to appoint an international arbitrator to decide any issues that are put to him,'' Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke told reporters after a contact group meeting. </P>
<P> Holbrooke said the arbitrator, whose decisions will be binding on all parties, would be selected by mutual agreement but added that no names had yet been proposed. </P>
<P> Both Muslim and Croat officials hailed the agreement as a major step toward shoring up their strained federation. </P>
