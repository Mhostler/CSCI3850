<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Washington has informed Lebanon that U.S. Ambassador Mark Hambley, who left Beirut two weeks ago, will not return because of ill-health, Lebanese foreign ministry sources said Monday. </P>
<P> The sources said the U.S. administration categorically denied, in an official notification to Lebanon's ambassador in Washington, Beirut newspaper reports that a political rift was behind Hambley's absence. </P>
<P> There were no details of the illness of the ambassador, who took up his post less than a year ago. </P>
<P> Hambley's sudden departure from Beirut raised extensive speculation in the press, including reports that it was a reflection of a diplomatic dispute between the two countries. </P>
<P> The reports said relations between the two countries were strained when President Elias Hrawi turned down an invitation for a brief meeting with President Clinton. </P>
