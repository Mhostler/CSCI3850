<P>  With military precision, second seed Conchita Martinez of Spain demolished fifth seed Magdalena Maleeva of Bulgaria 6-1, 6-1 to successfully defend her $806,250 Family Circle Magazine Cup title Sunday. </P>
<P> There were only two kinds of shot-making on display in the brief 58-minute match. </P>
<P> There were a variety of winners by the fourth-ranked Martinez, a take-charge player and brilliant topspin artisan. And there were innumerable errors -- both forced and unforced -- by the 10th-ranked Maleeva. </P>
<P> ``I was expecting a little bit tougher match,'' said Martinez, who recently signed well-known Brazilian coach Carlos Kirmayr to hone her game. ``The result, 6-1, 6-1 in a final, is really difficult to get. I'm very glad I played great tennis today.'' </P>
<P> Martinez, the reigning Wimbledon champion, has now captured 21 career titles. Her victory here earned her $148,500. </P>
<P> The Spaniard has been in three finals here and her results keep improving. In 1992, she lost to Gabriela Sabatini. In last year's final, she lost only four games en route to victory over Natasha Zvereava. And now she lost only two games in Sunday's match. </P>
<P> Martinez was nearly sent packing by Iva Majoli of Croatia in Friday's quarterfinals. Majoli led Martinez 6-2, 3-0 before the match slipped away for a three-set Martinez victory. Since trailing Majoli 3-0 in the second set, Martinez has won 36 of her 41 games. </P>
<P> Maleeva, who takes home $59,500 and moves up to ninth in Monday's rankings, never held serve in seven service games. </P>
<P> ``The thing I did wrong today was I didn't go for enough of my shots because I was afraid I'd miss too much,'' Maleeva said. ``This was wrong since she was playing so well, that would be my only chance.'' </P>
<P> The two games Maleeva won were by breaking serve in the third game of the first set and the second game of the second set. In both games, Martinez made uncharacteristic mistakes. </P>
