<DATELINE>CONAKRY, Guinea (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Sixteen prisoners were killed in a fight at Conakry's central prison over the weekend, State Prosecutor Andre Leno said Tuesday. </P>
<P> Leno told reporters the detainees had been arrested recently in a crackdown on armed robbers. </P>
<P> ``It all started when certain detainees accused others of having denounced them to the police,'' Leno said. ``The outcome was a collective assassination.'' </P>
<P> Police sources said 28 bandits were arrested between Christmas and New Year, including a group blamed for at least 11 murders in the west African country. </P>
<P> Speaking on Guinean television after their arrest, some of the detainees threatened to name senior figures they said were involved in crime. </P>
