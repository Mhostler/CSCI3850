<P>  The World Bank plans to step up its lending for environmental projects in Latin America and the Caribbean over the next three years, according to a new report. </P>
<P> The World Bank report, due for release Tuesday and titled ''A Partnership for Environmental Progress,'' outlines the lending agency's work throughout Latin America -- which boasts the world's most diverse flora and fauna as well as some of its fastest growing and most polluted cities. </P>
<P> The Bank, criticized by environmental activists for the ecological blight caused by some past projects it funded, has adopted stricter guidelines this decade. </P>
<P> During the Bank's fiscal 1994 it lent a total $4.3 billion to Latin America and the Caribbean. </P>
<P> The Bank's technical department director for the region, Sri-ram Aiyer, said the multilateral agency expected to provide about $5 billion in financing annually to Latin America and the Caribbean over the next few years. </P>
<P> But it will put a premium on environmental projects. </P>
<P> ``Environmental projects now represent about one-quarter of all (World) Bank loans and credits in the region. Over the next three years these operations are expected to increase to more than one-third,'' wrote Shahid Javed Burki, Bank vice president for Latin America and the Caribbean. </P>
<P> At a news conference held Friday ahead of the report's release, Aiyer said Latin American nations were showing more interest in the environment than they did during last decade. </P>
<P> ``During the 1980s their main concerns were the pursuit of macroeconomic stability and debt-reduction. Now social issues like alleviating poverty and protecting the environment are coming to the fore,'' he said. </P>
<P> The World Bank, long a principal source of financing for developing countries, now has a ``brown'' agenda for the control of urban and industrial pollution and a ``green'' agenda for the improvement of natural resources management. </P>
<P> The report stresses that is working with governments to bring environmental considerations into sectoral policy planning and specific investment projects. </P>
