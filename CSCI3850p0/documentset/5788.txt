<P>  Singapore will reopen the case of a Filipina maid hanged for double murder if a neutral panel of experts from a third country endorses Manila's view she was innocent, the government said Sunday. </P>
<P> A joint autopsy by Singaporean and Filipino pathologists is due in Manila this week to re-examine the remains of Filipina murder victim Delia Maga, another maid who was killed in Singapore in 1991 with a three-year-old Singaporean boy. </P>
<P> Singapore and the Philippines have been embroiled in a bitter row since March when Flor Contemplacion was hanged for the killings. The execution provoked intense anger in Manila. </P>
<P> ``The Singapore government reiterates its position that if such a panel concludes that the reports of the Singapore pathologists are incorrect and it supports the findings of the Philippine NBI (National Bureau of Investigation) experts, the Singapore government will re-open the case of Flor Contemplacion,'' the government statement said. </P>
<P> ``Should they be unable to reconcile their different findings, the Philippine and Singapore governments will consult again on...implementation of the agreement on a neutral third party panel of forensic experts as originally proposed by the Philippines,'' it said. </P>
<P> U.S. forensive consultants will also take part in the autopsy. A neutral third party of experts would only be consulted if the joint examination remains unable to reconcile earlier differences. </P>
<P> Contemplacion, 42, was convicted of killing Maga and a Singaporean toddler in 1991. But many outraged Filipinos believe the mother of four was framed and tortured into confessing. </P>
<P> Matters came to a head when a commission formed by Philippine President Fidel Ramos dug up Maga's remains. </P>
<P> Commission members said Maga had been severely beaten before she was strangled, that she might have been killed by a man and that Contemplacion could be innocent. </P>
<P> The autopsy performed on Maga in Singapore did not find signs that she was beaten. </P>
<P> The statement also said Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong had sent an April 12 letter to Ramos, saying Singaport would rather have the joint examination in a neutral country, away from ``the emotionally-charged atmosphere in Manila.'' </P>
