<P>  The president of the Haitian Bar Association said Thursday a single gunshot was fired at his home shortly after he had criticized U.S. lawyers who represent President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. </P>
<P> Rigaud Duplan had led a protest against the opening of a Port-au-Prince office by American lawyers Michael Barnes and Ira Kurzban, who represented Aristide during his three-year exile in Washington D.C. </P>
<P> Duplan, who served as finance minister in the de facto regime that ruled Haiti after Aristide's ouster in a bloody 1991 coup, said his home was ``the target of a criminal operation.'' </P>
<P> ``I don't want to make a direct liaison with the affair of the Barnes office and this incident, yet it happened within 24 hours of my making statements to the press,'' he said. </P>
<P> Duplan said no members of his household were injured in the attack and he did not hear the gunshot. </P>
<P> He said he opposes the opening of the office because he fears it violates Haitian sovereignty. </P>
<P> ``As you know, the practice of law is restricted by certain laws,'' Duplan said. ``You cannot just come here and set up an office and practice law.'' </P>
<P> He cited a law dating to the dictatorship of Jean Claude Duvalier that requires Haitian citizenship, a law degree and membership in a bar association to practice law in Haiti. </P>
<P> The American lawyers plan to advise Haitian and U.S. businesses on corporate and investment matters in Haiti, said Kurzban, who refuted Duplan's allegations. </P>
