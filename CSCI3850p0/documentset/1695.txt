<P>  Chile Thursday demanded an end to a hunger strike by 52 members of a secretive German colony in the southern Chile who are protesting a decree revoking its legal status. </P>
<P> The protesters, mostly teen-agers and young adults, have been on hunger strike for 11 days at Colonia Dignidad (Dignity Colony), where 200 German immigrants and their descendants live behind barbed wire. </P>
<P> ``The government refuses to be pressured,'' said governmnet spokesman Jose Joaquin Brunner in Santiago Thursday. </P>
<P> The young strikers, who are only drinking water, say they are prepared to fast to death. </P>
<P> The hunger strike is the first open challenge to the government by the colony which since its foundation 30 years ago has been the subject to charges by human rights groups of child abuse, fraud and human rights violations. </P>
<P> The strikers are protesting a government decree revoking the colony's legal status as a charity and efforts to close its school and hospital, one of the few in the area. </P>
<P> ``They have asked for some formula to keep the hospital open. But before the government considers this, the strike must end,'' regional governor Arturo Castro told Reuters. </P>
<P> The decree, upheld last month by Chile's Supreme Court, cleared the way for investigations into charges of torture and other attrocities at the colony, tucked in the Andean foothills 250 miles south of Santiago. </P>
<P> The colony was set up by Paul Schaefer, who fled Germany in 1961 after being charged with sexually assaulting children. Its 200 or so residents are all but cut off from the world. </P>
