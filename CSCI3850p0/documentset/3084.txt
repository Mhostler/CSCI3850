<P>  Canada should chop its foreign aid by 10 percent a year to help reduce the government's budget deficit, an influential committee of Parliament urged Thursday. </P>
<P> Canada has been gradually reducing its spending on international assistance over the past few years and the finance committee of the House of Commons, the lower house of Parliament, recommended a further 10 percent cut. </P>
<P> The committee said the cuts would bring Canada's spending on international aid more into line with those of other donor countries. </P>
<P> Canada now spends about $2.6 billion ($1.8 billion U.S.) a year on international aid. A 10 percent cut would reduce this by $260 million Canadian ($188 million U.S.). </P>
