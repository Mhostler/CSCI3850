<P>  The IRA will keep its weapons until the British government admits Sinn Fein to talks on Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said Sunday. </P>
<P> Adams heads the political wing of the guerrilla group which declared a truce last September in a violent campaign to end British ruler of Northern Ireland. </P>
<P> Britain wants full peace talks to hinge on IRA guerrillas first surrendering their weapons. </P>
<P> Adams told an interviewer on London Weekend Television that Britain was dragging its feet in the wake of the Irish Republican Army cease-fire, since matched by Protestant ``Loyalist'' gunmen fighting to keep the province British. </P>
<P> ``The intention of Sinn Fein is to remove the guns permanently, irreversibly, and for good from Irish politics,'' Adams said. </P>
<P> ``The threat to this peace process isn't from any Republican element, or even at this time from any Loyalist element but is actually from the way the British government has approached this whole peace process, the faltering, hesitant way that (Prime Minister) John Major has been forced to recognize that there even is a peace process.'' </P>
<P> The British and Irish governments promised last December that Sinn Fein could join talks on the future of Northern Ireland once the IRA declared a permanent cease-fire. </P>
<P> Major eventually said he accepted the cease-fire was permanent but gave no timetable for talks. </P>
<P> Adams's number two in Sinn Fein, Martin McGuinness, told GMTV earlier Sunday he thought talks could start in two to three weeks. </P>
<P> ``I think that is now inevitable,'' he said. </P>
<P> But the Observer newspaper said the IRA was maintaining a high state of readiness. </P>
<P> Quoting authoritative police sources in Northern Ireland and anti-terrorist squad souces, the paper said IRA teams were gathering information on potential targets and then mounting dummy attacks. </P>
<P> ``Intelligence and surveillance reports confirmed that the IRA's active service units remained in a 'high state of readiness','' it said. </P>
<P> The British government says it would not turn the province over to Irish rule unless its population voted for this. Protestants are the majority and they -- with some Catholics -- have indicated in polls they would vote to stay British. </P>
<P> But Adams held out for an all-Irish vote on the future of the province, one including the population of the Irish Republic. </P>
<P> ``Sinn Fein is prepared to accept the democratic decision of the Irish people as a whole, free from British interference,'' he said. </P>
