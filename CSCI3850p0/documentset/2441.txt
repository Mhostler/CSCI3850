<P>  UNITA rebels said Sunday that Angolan government artillery had battered the rebel stronghold of Huambo all day, inflicting heavy casualties, spreading panic and preventing the evacuation of 50 foreign nationals. </P>
<P> UNITA's New York representative Marcos Samondo, who telephoned Reuters in Johannesburg, said government troops were only ``several'' miles from the rebel bastion in Angola's central highlands. </P>
<P> ``Our people are reporting tremendous panic by civilians, who are trying to flee the city or take cover in the basements of buildings. Casualties are heavy but we have no numbers yet,'' he said. </P>
<P> But Angola's ruling MPLA party denied Sunday its offensive violated a peace accord initialed Oct. 31 and designed to end nearly two decades of civil war in the former Portuguese colony. </P>
<P> MPLA Information Secretary Joao Lourenco said in remarks carried by state-run media the government could continue fighting 17 days after the initialing, which took place in the Zambian capital Lusaka. </P>
<P> UNITA's Samondo confirmed Portuguese radio reports that UNITA had shot down a government MiG aircraft Sunday. He said the pilot had stripped off his uniform and fled naked. </P>
<P> ``We found the pilot's clothes but he apparently fled,'' he said. ``If we see a nude man hiding in the bush we know it's him.'' </P>
<P> About 50 foreign aid workers were reported trapped in Huambo Saturday after government forces captured the nearby town of Caala. </P>
<P> Samondo said UNITA's General Paulo Gato had telephoned the U.N. special envoy, Alioune Blondin Beye, from Huambo to discuss evacuating the foreigners, who were holed up in bunkers in a Red Cross compound. </P>
<P> But air and ground bombardments made it too dangerous for them to leave Sunday, he said. </P>
<P> A full signature of the peace accord is due to take place in Lusaka Nov. 15 followed by a cease-fire two days later. </P>
