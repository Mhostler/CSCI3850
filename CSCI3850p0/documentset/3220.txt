<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A New York judge said Wednesday he wants to send Tupac Shakur to jail for his sex abuse conviction, but gave the wounded rap music star another week for his health to stabilize before he is put in custody to await sentencing. </P>
<P> For the second week in a row since his Dec. 1 conviction, the ``gangsta'' rap star, who was staying in an undisclosed location, failed to show up in court because blood was oozing from a gunshot wound to his leg. </P>
<P> Shakur, 22, was shot five times and wounded in the head, groin, thigh and hand during a robbery Nov. 30 in the Times Square area. He was robbed of $40,000 in jewels, including a diamond ring and several gold necklaces. </P>
<P> The rap star and his road manager, Charles Fuller, 23, were found guilty of sexually abusing a 21-year-old woman in Shakur's posh Manhattan hotel suite in November 1993, but they were acquitted on more serious charges of sodomy and criminal weapons possession. </P>
<P> ``Some jail time will be appropriate for both defendants,'' state Judge Daniel Fitzgerald said after turning down arguments by defense lawyers that Shakur and Fuller be released to await sentencing. </P>
<P> Fuller was handcuffed and sent to New York's Rikers Island jail. Both men will be sentenced Jan. 17, 1995. </P>
<P> The judge said he would have sent both men to jail on the day they were convicted had it not been for Shakur's medical condition. Both men face up to seven years in prison. </P>
<P> In unsworn testimony, Barbara Justice, who identified herself as a surgeon, told the judge she has been caring for Shakur since Dec. 9. </P>
<P> She described Shakur's condition as life threatening and said that if he were moved now, ``it would put him in great danger'' and possibly cause him to undergo further surgery ``to a major vessel.'' </P>
<P> ``He must lie absolutely still. I don't want to go and sew him up again,'' she said. Justice also said Shakur has damage to his muscles, stiffness to his leg and suffers from post-traumatic stress syndrome. </P>
<P> Last week, a Los Angeles judge ordered Shakur arrested and revoked his $20,000 bail when he failed to show up for a hearing on weapons charges. </P>
