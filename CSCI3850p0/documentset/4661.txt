<P> The dismissed panel member was juror number 620, a 46-year-old male black courier. He was replaced by a 38-year-old white female telephone company worker. </P>
<P> Although Judge Lance Ito gave no reason for the juror's dismissal, other than to say he had found ``good cause'' to remove the him from the panel, the man reportedly failed to disclose an incident of domestic violence when filling out his jury questionnaire. </P>
<P> He also reportedly offered to bet a colleague a week's wages that Simpson would be found not guilty before he was chosen as a juror, and was seen wearing a San Francisco 49ers cap while on a jury field trip to the murder scene and Simpson's estate. </P>
<P> The 49er were the last team for which the football legend played. Simpson has pleaded not guilty to murdering his ex-wife and her friend. </P>
