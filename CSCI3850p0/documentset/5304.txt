<DATELINE>GAZA (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A Palestinian truck driver and two Israeli policemen in a jeep were killed in a crash and shooting incident in the Palestinian-ruled Gaza Strip Wednesday, Israeli and Palestinian officials said. </P>
<P> They gave differing versions of the incident, with the Israeli army saying the Palestinian driver brandished what turned out to be a plastic gun after their vehicles crashed. </P>
<P></P>
<P> ``A Gazan local truck hit a border police jeep and two policeman ... were killed. The truck driver came out with a gun. An army officer on the scene in a car ahead of the jeep shot him dead. There are two wounded policemen in a hospital.'' </P>
<P> Shahal did not say how the two policemen were wounded. </P>
<P> An Israeli army spokeswoman said initial reports showed the Palestinian driver purposely rammed the Israeli jeep and the gun he brandished afterward was plastic. </P>
<P> ``The Palestinian driver jumped from the vehicle with a pistol that later was shown to be of plastic,'' she said. </P>
<P> PLO chief Yasser Arafat's spokesman, Marwan Kanafani, told Reuters the collision was accidental and that Israelis planted a weapon next to the dead driver. </P>
<P> ``Two Israelis were killed as a result of the accident. The Israelis opened fire on the Palestinian truck driver who was killed and according to Palestinian witnesses the Israelis put the weapon next to his body,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``The Palestinian Authority has strongly protested these Israeli practices which only increase tension,'' Kanafani added. </P>
