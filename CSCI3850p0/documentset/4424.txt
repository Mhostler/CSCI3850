<DATELINE>LIMA (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Alberto Fujimori traveled Saturday to a disputed border zone where Ecuadoran and Peruvian troops clashed for 20 days as some prominent Peruvians questioned a peace accord signed with Ecuador. </P>
<P> Fujimori has made no comment since the signing of the accord between Peru and Ecuador early on Friday. An official said the president would visit one of three border posts involved in the fighting, which broke out Jan. 26. </P>
<P> The official said Fujimori was accompanied by local media on the trip to the jungle area. </P>
<P> The fighting, which left dozens of dead on both sides, at the headwaters of the Cenepa River along a 48-mile stretch of the Cordillera del Condor where the border was never clearly marked as called for in a 1942 treaty. </P>
<P> In Ecuador, President Sixto Duran Ballen said Friday the peace accord did not signify the loss of any of the three posts, adding that they were in all inside Ecuadoran territory. </P>
<P> ``I have not taken a step backwards, nor will I,'' he said. His statements reflected the questions which began to arise on Peruvian side of the border about the accord. </P>
<P> The agreement signed after two weeks of peace talks in Brazil confirmed a cease-fire that took effect Tuesday, calls for a separation of forces, their subsequent withdrawl to posts in each country and a gradual demilitarization supervised by an observer mission of guarantor countries of a 1942 treaty. </P>
<P> Meanwhile, Javier Perez de Cuellar, the former U.N. chief who is running for president of Peru, said he had ``serious reservations'' about the accord. </P>
<P> Perez de Cuellar said Peru had signed the so-called Declaration of Paz of Itamaraty in Brasilia despite Fujimori's acknowledgement that Ecuadoran troops still remain in Peruvian territory. </P>
<P> ``This declaration contains an undue concession, which places in doubt Peru's sovereignty over a part of our national territory,'' Perez de Cuellar said in a statement. </P>
<P> ``Our armed forces are obliged to withdraw from the zones which Ecuador occupied by force, while Ecuadoran troops remain at the edge of its own border, thus rewarding and encouraging the agression (by Ecuador),'' the diplomat said. </P>
<P> Perez de Cuellar said the accord failed to state the three posts where the clashes occurred were ``in Peruvian territory'' and instead are referred to as the ``zone of conflict.'' </P>
<P> He added the document does not make a specific reference to what he described ``the essence of the dispute, between Peru and Ecuador, the demarcation of the border remaining'' as called for in the Rio de Janeiro Protocol. </P>
