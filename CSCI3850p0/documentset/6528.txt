<P>  Gaullist Jacques Chirac was officially proclaimed France's new president Saturday and he will take over from Francois Mitterrand on May 17. </P>
<P> Roland Dumas, president of the Constitutional Council, made the announcement in a brief statement to journalists at the council's offices in Paris. </P>
<P> Confirming the results of the May 7 election, Dumas said Chirac received 15,763,027 votes, or 52.64 percent, and his Socialist opponent Lionel Jospin 14,180,644 votes, or 47.36 percent. </P>
<P> France Info radio said the handover would take place at 11 a.m. Wednesday and Chirac would appoint a new prime minister almost immediately. </P>
<P> Outgoing Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, who met Chirac for three hours Saturday, is widely expected to become premier. </P>
<P> Jospin told a Socialist Party convention in Paris on Saturday: ``Jacques Chirac and his friends will be unable to find the right answers concerning unemployment, exclusion from society, protection of welfare programs ... nor will they be able to live up to the expectations of the young, especially concerning education.'' </P>
<P> A compilation of opinion polls showed Mitterrand was the least popular of France's four presidents since Charles de Gaulle overhauled the constitution in 1958. </P>
<P> The compilation of polls taken by the IFOP group since the start of Mitterrand's second term in 1988 showed an average of 40 percent of those questioned were satisfied with his performance compared with 46 percent who were not satisfied. </P>
<P> The most popular was de Gaulle himself who scored a 59 percent satisfaction rating for his first term from 1958 to 1965, the poll showed. </P>
