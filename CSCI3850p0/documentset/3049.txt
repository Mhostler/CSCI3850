<P>  President Eduardo Frei left Chile Wednesday for a hemispheric summit in Miami hoping to return home with a firm commitment from President Clinton to sign a free trade agreement with Chile. </P>
<P> Representing a nation with Latin America's most sophisticated economy, Frei will in many ways have the most to gain from the Summit of the Americas, where 34 leaders are due to talk about issues ranging from trade to corruption to drugs. </P>
<P> Chilean officials, waiting two years for Washington to fulfill its stated goal of bringing Chile into NAFTA, have signalled they will no longer be satisfied with bland statements on the virtues of free trade. </P>
<P> ``We hope that, if there is some progress, it's not a pure goodwill statement,'' Insulza told reporters Tuesday night. ``We hope that if there is talk of a hemispheric trade zone, at least fundamental criteria will be set on launching it.'' </P>
<P> U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said Monday the United States would have an important announcement involving Chile Sunday, after the close of the summit. </P>
<P> Kantor's announcement led to speculation in Santiago that the United States was finally ready to invite Chile into NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, which is phasing out trade barriers between the United States, Canada and Mexico. </P>
<P> Asked if NAFTA was in the cards, Frei said only that he was optimistic, adding: ``I think we've advanced a long way, and logically we're going to work hard for agreements that are positive for Chile.'' </P>
<P> For Chile, free access to the North American market under NAFTA would bring immediate trade benefits. Its economy once almost entirely dominated by copper, Chile is now a world player in markets ranging from timber to fish to pharmaceuticals. </P>
<P> One of its wine companies, Concha y Toro, expects to be the biggest selling imported wine label in the United States by next year -- with or without NAFTA. </P>
<P> In only the first two weeks of November, Chile's exports posted a phenomenal $305 million trade surplus compared to a $970 billion deficit in all of last year. </P>
<P> The alternative to NAFTA would be some kind of one-on-one bilateral free trade deal between Chile and the United States -- something U.S. officials have not ruled out. </P>
<P> But a bilateral deal would likely send a signal to the rest of the Americas that NAFTA is a three-member exclusive club. </P>
<P> Said a Western diplomat in Santiago this week, ``If Chile can't get into NAFTA, then you have to ask who can.'' </P>
