<P>  President Clinton, in Haiti to oversee a handover by U.S. troops to U.N. forces, pledged Friday that the United States would continue to back the Caribbean nation's struggle for democracy. </P>
<P> ``For centuries the Haitian people have known little more than blood and terror,'' Clinton told a sea of Haitians thronging the gates outside the presidential palace. </P>
<P> ``Now you have the chance to make real the dreams of those who liberated your nation nearly 200 years ago,'' he said in a reference to Haiti's history as the only nation born of a successful slave revolt. </P>
<P> Clinton, in an apparent effort to allay fears that the scaled-down U.S. presence would leave a vacum in the volatile nation, told the crowd that the Haitian government, the United Nations and the United States would do all they could to guarantee free, fair and secure elections in the impoverished country this year. </P>
<P> Nation-wide parliamentary and municipal elections are scheduled to be held in June, following the restoration last year of deposed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. </P>
<P> Aristide, a populist priest and champion of the poor, was democratically elected but served only seven months in office before being overthrown in a 1991 military coup. He was restored in a U.S.-brokered deal with the country's military rulers. </P>
<P> Echoing a favorite message of Aristide's, Clinton also asked Haitians to reject violence and join in a spirit of unity. </P>
<P> ``Say no to vengeance, no to revenge, yes to reconciliation,'' Clinton said in a speech which made frequent reference to the shared histories of the two countries, the oldest nations in the Western Hemisphere. </P>
<P> The celebration surrounding Clinton's visit, the first by a U.S. president in 60 years, was marred by allegations that a Haitian cabinet minister was involved in the murder on Tuesday of a prominent opponent of Aristide. </P>
<P> Clinton and U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali were scheduled to attend a ceremony later on Friday marking the official handover of peacekeeping duties to a U.N. force from the U.S.-led troops that arrived in Haiti six months ago to restore order. </P>
