<P>  President Clinton said Sunday he believes it is possible for O.J. Simpson to receive a fair trial but he thinks television coverage of the pretrial hearings has complicated jury selection. </P>
<P> ``I think there can be a fair trial,'' Clinton said on the ''Larry King Live'' program broadcast by CNN. </P>
<P> He voiced concern, however, that pretrial publicity, particularly live television coverage, has made the task of selecting a jury more difficult. </P>
<P> ``What bothers me is all this pretrial publicity,'' Clinton said, adding: ``All of us, we can't help but be affected by the things we know.'' </P>
<P> ``This wrenching pretrial publicity, I think, is more damaging'' than the possibility of broadcast coverage of the trial itself, he said. </P>
<P> Superior Court Judge Lance Ito is set to decide Monday whether or not he will permit television cameras in the courtroom. </P>
<P> Simpson, a football Hall of Famer turned sportscaster, actor and television pitchman, has pleaded innocent to the June 12 stabbing deaths of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman outside her luxury Brentwood townhouse. </P>
