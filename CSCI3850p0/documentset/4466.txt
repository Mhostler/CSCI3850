<DATELINE>LONG BEACH, Calif (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A woman threw her two young sons off a bridge 30 feet into a channel near Long Beach harbor Tuesday, killing her 2-year-old son and critically injuring his 3-year-old brother, before jumping herself, police said. </P>
<P> The woman was treated at a Long Beach hospital then released and was being held by police for questioning. No decision regarding possible charges against the woman was immediately made, said Officer Margarita DeWitt, a Long Beach Police Department spokeswoman. </P>
<P> The 23-year-old woman threw the 2-year-old into the water while he was still in his stroller, then picked up the older child and threw him over the bridge as well, the spokeswoman said. The woman then jumped in after the children. </P>
<P> The 3-year-old was unconscious and in critical condition at St. Mary Medical Center's pediatric intensive care unit Tuesday afternoon, hospital spokeswoman Carolyn Carter said. </P>
<P> The woman was treated in St. Mary's emergency room before being released into police custody. </P>
<P> ``She was fine,'' Carter said. </P>
<P> The identities of the three were not disclosed. </P>
<P> The woman threw the children from a bridge 30 feet above a flood control channel that leads to Long Beach harbor. </P>
<P> A witness who saw the woman throw the children off the bridge flagged down a police officer, who jumped into the water to rescue the three. They were pulled from the water at 9:40 a.m. (12:40 p.m. EST). </P>
<P> A witness, Francine McCloskey, said she had seen the woman and children on the overpass while driving by, ``And I was thinking, you know, how stupid.'' McCloskey said she returned a few minutes later and the three were gone, according to news reports. </P>
<P> ``And then this one Oriental man was waving me to stop, so I stopped and he was pointing. And I looked over and the babies were just floating. And the mom was there,'' McCloskey said. ''I'm just praying to God that those babies are OK, because when they picked them up in the (rescue) boat ... they were so blue.'' </P>
