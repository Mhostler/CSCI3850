<P>  The Mississippi River below New Orleans was reopened to all marine traffic shortly after 4 p.m. Friday, almost 36 hours after it was closed by a 38,000 gallon crude oil spill, the Coast Guard reported. </P>
<P> Lt. Cmdr. Matt Williams of the Coast Guard Marine Safety Office said Reuters that northbound vessels were allowed through the lower portion of the river at 1:30 p.m. It was later extended to southbound traffic. </P>
<P> But the Coast Guard set up an 11-mile safety zone where traffic will be restricted to one direction at a time, the Coast Guard said. </P>
<P> Capt. Mark Delesdernier, president of the Crescent River Port Pilots Association, told Reuters that 50 seagoing vessels were backed up above and below the spill site Friday afternoon. The number does not include barges. </P>
<P> ``We're running out of anchorage, and even if full traffic is restored, it will take at least 24 hours to get back to normal,'' he said. </P>
<P> According to the Coast Guard, more than 5,000 gallons had been recovered and another 12,000 gallons had evaporated by noon Friday. </P>
<P> Five vacuum trucks and several containment booms are cleaning up the spill, which occurred at the Mobil Chalmette Refinery when a four-foot-long gash was torn below the waterline in a moored barge carrying Alabama sweet crude about 5:30 a.m. Thursday. The cause of the damage is not known. </P>
<P> ``What we're trying to do is protect two wildlife refuges at the mouth of the river, and we just may make it,'' Williams said. Strong northerly winds have pooled much of the oil in a bend in the river, he said. The impact on wildlife so far has been minimal. </P>
