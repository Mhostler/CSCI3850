<P>  Germany shook off self-imposed military fetters adopted after World War Two when the supreme court ruled Tuesday that Bonn could join international armed missions. </P>
<P> The judges quelled a dispute in Bonn over united Germany's new world role by saying the 1949 constitution did not stop its troops joining United Nations peacekeeping or combat missions. </P>
<P> ``Peace forces and their task of securing peace are part of the United Nations' system of collective security as it has developed through the practical application of the U.N. charter which the Federal Republic of Germany joined in 1973,'' the eight-judge panel of the Constitutional Court ruled. </P>
<P> At the same time, the court said Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government had infringed the rights of parliament by not consulting it before sending troops to monitor U.N. sanctions and a no-fly zone in former Yugoslavia, and to Somalia. </P>
<P> It made clear that in the future parliament would have to approve such missions, albeit by a simple majority. </P>
<P> Kohl welcomed the decision, which gave the green light for his drive since unity in 1990 for a wider German global role after four decades of a purely defensive position in NATO. </P>
<P> ``What I have always wanted has become clear in this ruling. We are members of the U.N. and if we make use of our U.N. rights, we must also carry out our duties,'' he said. </P>
<P> Kohl has gradually increased Bonn's stake in international peace forces since 1990, but the ruling removed all obstacles to a full military participation that could help Bonn's bid for a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council. </P>
<P> Kohl's policy had been challenged by the opposition Social Democrats (SPD), who argued that military deployments violated limits written into the constitution to prevent any revival of Nazi-style militarism. </P>
<P> But SPD leader Rudolf Scharping, hoping to unseat Kohl in October 16 general elections, welcomed the fact that the constitutional fog had been blown away and that the court had demanded parliamentary approval for any deployment. </P>
<P> ``That is a great victory for democracy in our country,'' he said, adding the SPD's goals had been fulfilled. </P>
<P> The environmentalist Greens party warned that the ruling paved the way for a ``militarization of German foreign policy.'' </P>
<P> ``It has given a boost to the government's efforts to increasingly conduct foreign policy with military means,'' the party said in statement. </P>
<P> Government leaders, who have always stressed Germany would never seek to send troops abroad unilaterally but only in concert with its allies, said after the ruling Germany was not interested in playing ``world policeman.'' </P>
<P> ``Germany will never pursue an interventionist policy. Our foreign and security policy will not be militarized, you can be sure of that,'' Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel told reporters. </P>
