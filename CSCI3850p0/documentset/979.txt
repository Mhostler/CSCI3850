<P>  A limited set of football cards signed by football legend O.J. Simpson in his jail cell earlier this month have become the hottest trading cards in the United States, valued at up to $4,000 each. </P>
<P> Trading card dealer Darren Adams said Simpson, who is jailed awaiting trial for the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, signed and dated the 300 cards August 4 and August 18. </P>
<P> They were then delivered to Adams' store, West Coast Sports Cards, by Simpson's agent, Mike Gilbert, in this town 15 miles south of Seattle. They went on sale Monday, Adams said in an interview with Reuters Wednesday. </P>
<P> Adams said he negotiated an exclusive deal with Simpson and his agent to sell the cards. The dealer would not say how much he had paid for each card but said it was ``several times the normal amount of about $30 to $40 per card a celebrity would get for a limited edition.'' </P>
<P> Simpson has pleaded innocent to the murders. His trial is set for September 19. </P>
<P> The cards are in two sets of 150 each -- one set depicting Simpson as a University of Southern California running back and another as the star of the Buffalo Bills. </P>
<P> The cards are each numbered ``O.J. 1 of 150,'' ``O.J. 2 of 150'' and so on. </P>
<P> Simpson wore the number 32 on his jersey while playing for both teams, and Adams said he had been offered $4,000 each for the two cards numbered ``O.J. 32 of 150.'' </P>
<P> An equal amount had been offered for each of the two ``O.J. 1 of 150'' cards because ``people like the first of any limited series,'' Adams said. </P>
<P> Most of the cards were selling for $850 each, although collectors were offering more for other special numbers such as 68, which was the year Simpson won the Heisman Trophy as the outstanding college football player that year, 61 for the number of touchdowns he scored in his professional career and 72 for the year he broke the all-time rushing record. </P>
<P> Adams said it was mostly Simpson fans who were buying the cards rather than investors, but the fans could be getting a great deal if they ever want to part with the cards. </P>
<P> ``I suspect that once we sell the cards, the secondary market will go over $2,000 per card for those that we are selling at $850,'' he said. </P>
<P> But only 296 will be sold by Adams. He is keeping those numbered 1 and 32. ``Hey, I'm a collector too,'' he explained. </P>
