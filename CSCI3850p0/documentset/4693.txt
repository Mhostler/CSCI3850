<P>  Canada's government said Thursday it would reduce the number of generals by 25 percent in three years, the latest blow to a military already reeling from scandals, base closures and low morale. </P>
<P> Defense Minister David Collenette said the number of generals would be cut to 70 from 93 and colonels, the rank below general, to 245 from 295 over two years. </P>
<P> ``We will put in place a new, leaner command and control structure by mid-1997, which will remove one layer of headquarters,'' Collenette said. </P>
<P> The announcement came the same week the Liberal government said it would close several military bases and cut $2.8 billion Canadian ($2.0 billion U.S.) from military spending over four years from almost $12 billion Canadian ($8.6 billion U.S.) this year. </P>
<P> The Liberals plan to close six bases or detachments outright. They will reduce fighter operations and cut the size of military headquarters by one-third. </P>
<P> In January this year there were 70,600 regular military personnel, down from about 87,000 in late 1989. </P>
<P> The government says it wants to reduce the size of the armed forces to about 60,000 in another three years. </P>
<P> The cutbacks come amid public outrage over pay inequity in the military. </P>
<P> The navy recently admitted it was sending some of its sailors to welfare offices to help them make ends meet. </P>
<P> At the same time stories leaked out that a few senior officers were living in lavish government-subsidized mansions. </P>
<P> Other stories about large groups of Canadian air force generals flying to Florida to take part in golf and fishing weekends, called Operation Palm Tree, also damaged the image of the military. </P>
<P> In mid-February a high-ranking general was stripped of his command for misleading the government about a video that showed soldiers of an elite paratrooper regiment giving electrical shocks to themselves as part of an initiation ritual. </P>
