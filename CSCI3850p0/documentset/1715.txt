<P>  Legislation overhauling the way congressional campaigns are financed died in the Senate Friday after supporters were unable to break a Republican-led filibuster. </P>
<P> ``There is no prospect for this legislation now and no further effort will be made on it,'' Senate Democratic Leader George Mitchell told reporters. </P>
<P> He said he believed that reform would ultimately take place, but not this year. </P>
<P> The bill was one of President Clinton's top priorities. </P>
<P> Mitchell spoke after the Senate voted 52-46 to cut off debate on the bill. </P>
<P> The bill was one of two designed to meet public criticism of the way Congress does business and a wide belief that it is in the grip of special interests. </P>
<P> A bill passed by the House of Representatives Thursday barring members from accepting free meals and trips from lobbyists awaits final action by the Senate and Mitchell predicted it would win approval. </P>
<P> In a hard-hitting speech to the Senate, Mitchell said the current campaign financing system demeaned members and contibutors. </P>
<P> Referring to a provision in the bill for public financing, Mitchell said: ``Our (Republican) colleagues can rail all they want against against taxpayer finance ... everyone knows this system stinks. </P>
<P> ``Every senator who participates in it knows this system stinks and the American people are right when they mistrust this system,'' he said. </P>
<P> Mitchell said that ``money dominates the system, money infuses the system, money is the system.'' </P>
<P> Republicans had filibustered against allowing a Senate-House conference committee to meet to put the final stamp of approval on a compromise of separate versions of the bill passed last year by the two chambers. </P>
<P> The bills had languished throughout this year because of the difficulties of reconciling them. </P>
<P> Republican complained they had been shut out of the bill drafting process, argued that spending limits in the measure were an infringement of free speech attacking public financing. </P>
<P> They said it did little to tackle the real problem -- money-raising by political action committees. </P>
