<P>  Nearly one-third of New York City's murder victims had cocaine in their systems when they died, according to a study released Tuesday. </P>
<P> Of the 4,298 New York City residents who were homicide victims in 1990 and 1991, 31 percent tested positive for cocaine, the study said. Black victims 25 to 44 years old were more likely than not to have evidence of cocaine in their systems. </P>
<P> ``Homicide victims may have provoked violence through irritability, paranoid thinking, or verbal or physical aggression, which are known to be pharmacologic effects of cocaine,'' study author Kenneth Tardiff of Cornell University Medical College wrote in the Journal of the American Medical Association. </P>
<P> ``In addition, homicide may have been part of the business of dealing cocaine,'' the author wrote. </P>
