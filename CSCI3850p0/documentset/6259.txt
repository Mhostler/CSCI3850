<DATELINE>JAKARTA, May 4 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Indonesian Investment Minister Sanyoto Sastrowardoyo said on Thursday that he would visit Canada and the United States next week to promote foreign investment. </P>
<P> He said 30 business executives would travel with him but gave no other details of the trip. </P>
<P> Foreign investment approvals rose sharply to $15.6 billion between January 1 and April 29, compared with $3.3 billion for the same period of 1994, Sanyoto said. </P>
<P> Approvals were $23.7 billion in calendar 1994, compared with $8.1 billion for 1993. </P>
<P> The United States had approved 1994 investments of $977 million. The Canadian figure was $39 million. </P>
<P> ``These figures prove that Indonesia is not a high risk country for foreign investment,'' Sanyoto said. </P>
<P> ``We are still attractive to foreign investment because we have adopted a free foreign-exchange system and our investment climate is conducive.'' </P>
<P> Foreign investment has mushroomed since the government introduced a deregulation package in June, 1994, that scrapped rules prohibiting 100 percent foreign ownership across a wide range of industries and cut tariffs on more than 700 goods. </P>
<P> Official figures show the 1994 foreign investment list was topped by Hong Kong, with $6.04 billion; Britain, $2.95 billion, and Taiwan, $2.48 billion. </P>
