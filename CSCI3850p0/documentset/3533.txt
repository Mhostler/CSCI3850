<P>  The Clinton administration plans to go ahead with an oil shipment to North Korea as part of a deal aimed at halting the north's suspected nuclear weapons program, a senior U.S. official said Sunday. </P>
<P> Anthony Lake, President Clinton's national security adviser, said in an interview Sunday that he saw no reason to delay the shipment, which some members of Congress had suggested should be used as leverage with Pyongyang before it released a captured U.S. pilot held for nearly two weeks. </P>
<P> The United States is to provide 50,000 tons of heavy fuel oil, valued at about $4.7 million, by Jan. 21 to help offset energy supplies lost as the North begins converting its nuclear program to one with less potential for building bombs. </P>
<P> Lake said international inspectors had been able to verify that Pyongyang had frozen the old program, as required under the bilateral agreement reached in October. </P>
<P> ``The North Koreans are abiding by everything that they said that they would do, which is to put ... a freeze on their nuclear program, and I think perhaps to the surprise of some of their critics, to verify it,'' he said on the NBC program ``Meet the Press.'' </P>
<P> Lake made his remarks on Friday, shortly after the North released Chief Warrant Officer Bobby Hall, an Army pilot who survived the Dec. 17 downing of his scout helicopter in the North. His co-pilot, David Hilemon, died in the incident. </P>
<P> Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican who is a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, criticized the Clinton administration for its handling of the incident and blasted North Korea. </P>
<P> ``I think one of the things we learned is that this nation is not ready to become a part of the community of nations,'' he said on the ABC televison program ``This Week with David Brinkley.'' He faulted the North for accusing the United States of espionage when, he said, the incident clearly involved no such thing. </P>
<P> McCain, himself an Air Force pilot held prisoner of war in North Vietnam, said the administration should not have expressed its official regret over the incident. </P>
