<P>  Russian participation in the U.S. space station will add nearly $2 billion to its cost instead of saving money, a report from the U.S. Congress' General Accounting Office said Tuesday. </P>
<P> The National Aeronautics and Space Administration had estimated participation by the Russians would save $2 billion. </P>
<P> ``These new figures from the GAO underscore the fact that the space station is a financial black hole,'' Republican Senator Bill Cohen of Maine, who released the report, said in a statement. </P>
<P> ``The project is too costly and I will urge my colleagues to kill it when it comes to a vote this week,'' he said. </P>
<P> But Cohen said in a brief interview, ``I'm not sure we'll get enough votes to win.'' </P>
<P> He said most Republicans opposed him on the matter and supported the space station. </P>
<P> NASA told the General Accounting Office, the non-partisan investigating arm of Congress, that under the agreement with the Russians the crew size for the project would be increased from four to six, the first shuttle assembly flight would be accelerated to December 1997 with completion in 2002 and the cost would drop from $19.4 billion to $17.4 billion. </P>
<P> NASA told GAO that $1.6 billion of the savings would be achieved by finishing the assembly 15 months earlier than originally planned. </P>
<P> The accelerated schedule, NASA said, would be possible because Russian contributions of hardware would permit savings. The extra money would be used to speed construction. </P>
<P> But GAO said none of that would actually happen. </P>
<P> ``Our analysis shows there are no net savings from Russian participation that could be used to fund other areas of the program and accelerate the schedule,'' the GAO report said. </P>
<P> Instead there will be fewer contributions of Russian hardware than NASA anticipated, adding $400 million to the cost of the station, the report said. </P>
<P> In addition, GAO said Russian participation would add another $1.4 billion in costs. </P>
<P> Those costs include money to pay for improvements in the shuttle's ability to support space station assembly, and additional shuttle flights to assemble the station. </P>
<P> A spokeswoman for NASA said the agency was withholding comment until it had a chance to review the final report. </P>
