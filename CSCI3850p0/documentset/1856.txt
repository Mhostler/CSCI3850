<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Letter bombs intercepted in Austria this week contained detonator parts found only in tank or heavy artillery shells, the Vienna Neue Kronen newspaper said Friday. </P>
<P> It said the presence of military parts was the first real clue to the origin of the bombs, which the interior ministry believes were sent by neo-Nazis. </P>
<P> The newspaper, in its evening edition, said the latest letter bombs were far more dangerous than a wave of 10 similar devices mailed last December. Four of those exploded, injuring five people. </P>
<P> Neue Kronen said the latest bombs, none of which have exploded, contained ``a detonator-booster used in tank shells or artillery rounds'' and part of them ``came from military production.'' </P>
<P> The paper, which has close connections to the police, gave a detailed breakdown of the explosive used, but did not speculate on the precise origin of the military part. </P>
