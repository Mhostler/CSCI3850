<P>  A delegation of U.S. business executives has arrived in Pyongyang, North Korea's official media said Wednesday, eve of the 53rd birthday of the communist country's leader Kim Jong-il. </P>
<P> The North's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), monitored in Tokyo, said the delegation was jointly led by T.S. Mcdaniel, head of General Motors' Asian and Pacific operation and an executive of consulting firm Admiral Zumwalt and Consultants. </P>
<P> The delegation arrived in Pyongyang Tuesday. </P>
<P> It is the first time a major U.S. business delegation has visited North Korea since the United States announced the easing of its 45-year-old trade curbs on the Stalinist regime. </P>
<P> Admiral Zumwalt and Consultants Inc said earlier this month the delegation, which also includes MCI, Pepsi Cola and the U.S. Bank of Washington, would discuss opportunities and visit the isolated communist state's free trade zone. </P>
<P> KCNA said one of two delegation leaders was James Zumwalt, a former State Department adviser working for the suburban Washington consulting company headed by his father, Adm. Elmo Zumwalt, a former chief of U.S. naval operations. </P>
<P> James Zumwalt said before leaving Washington that the U.S. executives would explore the feasibility of doing business now that there had been some easing of restrictions. </P>
<P> Relations have warmed between the United States and North Korea since the two sides agreed to restructure Pyongyang's suspected nuclear arms program last October. </P>
<P> Complying with the landmark nuclear deal, Washington last month agreed to permit direct telephone links with North Korea, the last country Americans had been barred from dialing direct. </P>
<P> The United States also allowed American businesses to import North Korean magnesite, a rare metal used to coat the insides of steel industry blast furnaces. </P>
<P> A U.S. official said a number of U.S. companies were expected to compete for the North Korean telephone business. </P>
<P> The U.S. businessmen's visit coincides with celebrations for Kim's birthday, which has been recently designated by North Korea as ``the greatest holiday of the nation.'' </P>
<P> Kim has long been groomed as the successor of North Korea's ``Great Leader'' Kim Il-sung who died of a heart attack last July, and analysts in Seoul said the junior Kim's birthday would be used to demonstrate that he is in firm control of the country. </P>
