<P>  The surviving members of Nirvana, the seminal grunge trio silenced by the suicide of vocalist Kurt Cobain four months ago, plan to issue a posthumous double album of the band's live recordings in early November, the band's label said. </P>
<P> ``Verse Chorus Verse'' will feature previously unreleased performances from 1989 to 1994 as well as the band's complete ''Unplugged'' acoustic special taped for MTV late last year. This includes two songs, ``Something In The Way'' and ``Oh Me'', that were not broadcast on the cable network's program. </P>
<P> Geffen Records spokesman Jim Merlis said Wednesday that the album, compiled by drummer Dave Grohl and bass player Krist Novoselic, will feature about 30 tracks. The title comes from an unlisted Nirvana song of the same name that appeared on the ``No Alternative'' charity album last year. It was also a potential name for ``In Utero,'' the band's last album. </P>
<P> Cobain, whose high-octane songs of rage and despair such as ``Smells Like Teen Spirit'' and ``Lithium'' struck a chord with disaffected kids around the world and transformed Nirvana into unlikely superstars, shot himself in the head in early April. </P>
<P> The 27-year-old, who had battled chronic health and drug problems, said in a note he had lost his passion for music. </P>
<P> Merlis said career plans for Grohl and Novoselic were still up in air, although Grohl has been talking about forming a new band. </P>
