<P>  Algerian security forces are starting to chalk up successes over Muslim fundamentalist guerrillas but the economy is sinking under the weight of civil strife, a senior French military source said Monday. </P>
<P> ``The situation in the field is still very bad but the security forces have in the past month or two regained control of some areas of the ``bled' (countryside) and of cities where the fundamentalists had held the upper hand,'' he said. </P>
<P> The source said the government -- with helicopter gunships and other new tactics -- has forced armed bands in Algeria to break up into groups that are smaller than the company-sized units they moved in before. </P>
<P> He added losses among security forces are down. </P>
<P> ``But the successes are mostly tactical. Terrorism still continues, especially at night, and the real problem is that the economy is suffering and will not be able to resist if the war goes on,'' the source said. </P>
<P> France, the former colonial power, closely monitors the situation in Algeria, intercepting military communications. </P>
<P> The Algerian army has faced a growing fundamentalist revolt since it intervened in January 1992 to scrap an election the outlawed Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was poised to win. </P>
<P> Western experts say up to 30,000 people have died in worsening civil strife. The French source said several hundred people were now being killed every week. </P>
<P> ``The economy cannot resist, especially if foreign firms pull out and international organizations were to withhold aid,'' he said. </P>
<P> Paris has urged the government to negotiate with opposition parties including the FIS which agreed on a joint platform this month. France is concerned at the rise of Islamic fundamentalism and effectively backs the government side with economic aid. </P>
