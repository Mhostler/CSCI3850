<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Acting as his own attorney Tuesday, the man accused of killing six people on a New York commuter train more than a year ago began interviewing potential jurors who will decide his fate. </P>
<P> Colin Ferguson, 36, is charged in a 93-count indictment and alleged to have opened fire Dec. 7, 1993 with a 9-mm pistol on board a crowded rush-hour Long Island Rail Road train as it approached a station in suburban Garden City, N.Y. Six people were killed and 19 others wounded. </P>
<P> Some 600 people are expected to be questioned by Ferguson before 12 jurors are selected for the trial, a spokesman for the prosecution said. He said the trial could last two months. </P>
<P> Ferguson, who is black, has said the shooting was carried out by a white man and Tuesday he contended that blacks were under-represented on Nassau County (Long Island) juries. </P>
<P> He has fired his lawyers, famed civil rights attorney William Kunstler and Ronald Kuby after they sought to have him declared incompetent. They contend Ferguson is ``stark raving mad'' and that the trial will be ``a circus of abysmal proportions.'' </P>
<P> In December, a judge ruled Ferguson was mentally competent to stand trial and could represent himself. The two lawyers were appointed by Judge Donald Belfi to act as his advisers. </P>
<P> Last month, during pre-trial hearings to determine the admissability of statements he made to police and other evidence, Ferguson showed off his courtroom style which appears to parody ``Perry Mason'' reruns. </P>
<P> At times, the Jamaican-born Ferguson seemed to ask relevant, logical questions but more often they were aimless and irrelevant. Coming face to face with a detective who arrested him the night of the bloody rampage, Ferguson, who refers to himself as ``the suspect,'' questioned the officer on what he observed. </P>
<P> ``I saw you being held down by three commuters... I was told by the commuters that you were the gunman,'' the detective said. </P>
