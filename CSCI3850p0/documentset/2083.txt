<P>  U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry said Tuesday he will visit Japan this week after going to South Korea and will brief both countries on an agreement between the United States and North Korea on Pyongyang's nuclear program. </P>
<P> Perry will visit with government leaders in Seoul Friday and hold talks Saturday in Tokyo before flying home at the end of an around-the-world trip, senior U.S. defense officials added. </P>
<P> At a news conference in Beijing, Perry declined to reveal details of the agreement reached by U.S. and North Korean negotiators in Geneva for Pyongyang to halt its nuclear arms program. </P>
<P> ``I welcome the agreement,'' he said. ``I want to caution you that this is an agreement between negotiators. It has not yet been approved in capitals.'' </P>
<P> ``And this is an agreement that before the president signs will be reviewed with our allies that have primary concern with this agreement,'' Perry told reporters. </P>
<P> ``In particular, I plan to stop in Korea and Japan on the way home and meet with officials in the Korean and Japanese governments and brief them on the details of this agreement. </P>
<P> ``I am not free at this time to discuss the details of the agreement,'' he added. </P>
<P> Perry will make a brief stop in the Philippines Wednesday night and Thursday before flying to Seoul. </P>
