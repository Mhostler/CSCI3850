<P>  Police have launched an investigation into a television videotape that shows a white police officer kicking and punching an 18-year-old black man, officials said Friday. </P>
<P> Police say the tape shows events taken out of context and does not tell the whole story, but some black leaders say the police response may have been excessive. </P>
<P> ``None of the information we have at this time suggests that the beating we saw on that tape was appropriate,'' said Milton Hinton, president of the Cincinnati branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). </P>
<P> Police Capt. Walter McAlpin said the tape gives an image it should not give. ``If all you saw was the blurb on TV ... you don't know about the crowd of 50 to 75; you didn't see what occurred before nor what occurred after, nor was any of the conversation recorded,'' he said. </P>
<P> The tape begins with a young black man in custody on a busy downtown street Tuesday. A police officer sprays mace on the suspect as several other police cars arrive. The suspect is then wrestled to the ground by a group of four or five officers who direct punches and kicks at him. </P>
<P> A white police officer, who threw most of the punches, moves toward the crowd on the sidewalk and shoves one bystander who had been yelling at him over a planter, the videotape shows. The suspect is then handcuffed and thrown into the back of a police car. </P>
<P> A three-page statement from the city's safety director described a police officer attempting to arrest the young man for disorderly conduct being taunted by a crowd and calling on his radio for help. </P>
<P> ``Several police cars arrived,'' the statement said. ``The (next) officer on the scene was police officer Steven Pickens. As is shown in the video, he is the officer who kicked (the suspect and) struck (him) several times with his fist.'' </P>
<P> Pickens has been transferred to a desk job while police investigate, a police spokeswoman said. The 18-year-old, described as a high school senior, was charged with disorderly conduct, felonious assault and resisting arrest, McAlpin said. </P>
<P> The incident was taped by a television news crew who happened to pass by, a spokesman for station WLWT-TV5 said. </P>
<P> Two separate investigations -- one by police and one by a city agency -- are under way, officials said. Although the investigation is proceeding slowly, Hinton said, ``everything I see indicates the city administration is taking our concerns seriously. We want them to be careful and diligent.'' </P>
