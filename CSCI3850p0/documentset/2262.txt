<P>  China and the United States held their first round of regular talks on disarmament and arms control in six years Thursday in Beijing, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy said. </P>
<P> ``This marks the resumption of regular arms control consultations with China,'' the spokesman said. ``These regular consultations were last held in 1988.'' </P>
<P> He gave no details of the discussions between Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu and the visiting Director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency John Holum. </P>
<P> According to the Chinese news agency Xinhua, the talks were the sixth round of Sino-U.S. consultations on disarmament since 1984. It also gave no details. </P>
<P> Many aspects of Sino-U.S. contact on military-related issues stopped after the June 4, 1989, crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square by the People's Liberation Army. </P>
<P> Contacts are now back to normal, symbolized by this month's visit to Beijing by Defense Secretary William Perry. </P>
<P> China, which this month set off its second nuclear test blast in four months, says it is firmly opposed to the arms race and supports the eventual complete prohibition and destruction of nuclear, space, chemical and biological weapons. </P>
<P> While Washington has been critical of Beijing's arms sales, China maintains its trade in weapons is tiny compared to that of the United States and other Western powers. </P>
