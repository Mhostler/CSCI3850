<P>  The parliament in Ukraine's Crimean peninsula Monday debated President Leonid Kuchma's virtual elimination of the region's autonomy but appeared keen to avoid a new crackdown by central authorities. </P>
<P> Deputies denounced Kuchma's weekend decree making all appointments to Crimea's government subject to his consent -- the latest in a series of measures to stamp out pro-Russian separatism. </P>
<P> Parliament Chairman Sergei Tsekov accused Kuchma of ``grossly violating Ukraine's constitution and laws. </P>
<P> ``Political groups have come to the fore in Ukraine with the intention of ... dealing from a position of force, not only with us but with other regions and perhaps with the Ukrainian parliament itself,'' Tsekov told the chamber. </P>
<P> Some parliamentarians barely concealed their anger after a three-week drive by Ukraine to chip away at the autonomy extended in 1992 to Crimea, where two-thirds of 2.7 million residents are ethnic Russians. </P>
<P> ``Ukraine is afraid that we majority Russians will not abandon our hope of rejoining Russia,'' said Natalya Grudina. ``We will move toward Russia. We have been turned not into a colony but a reservation.'' </P>
<P> Outside the glass and concrete parliament building, about 80 mainly elderly demonstrators chanted anti-Ukrainian slogans. But Simferopol and other Crimean towns have been calm throughout the dispute. Most Crimean residents have appeared to accept Ukraine's punitive measures without complaint. </P>
<P> Several deputies expressed hope parliamentary and presidential elections in Russia this year and next would return politicians more sympathetic to the Crimean cause. </P>
<P> But Kremlin leaders have made it clear they want no involvement in the dispute. Russia's preoccupation with its own separatist rebellion in Chechnya has prompted senior ministers to say that Crimea is an internal matter for Ukraine. </P>
