<P>  A surprising poll commissioned by Republicans shows embattled Democratic Congressman Dan Rostenkowski trailing his virtually unknown challenger going into Tuesday's election, the Republican's campaign said Friday. </P>
<P> The Republican National Committee's poll, which was not released publicly, showed Republican lawyer Michael Flanagan leading Rostenkowski by a 21-point margin, the Washington Times reported Friday. </P>
<P> The newspaper, which quoted sources familiar with the survey's results, also said the Washington pollster who conducted the survey would not confirm its results or cite a margin of error. </P>
<P> The unexpected results precipitated a cash infusion of around $60,000 from Republican Party coffers into Flanagan's campaign to pay for airtime on local television. </P>
<P> ``Obviously the poll showed us doing pretty well or they wouldn't have put money into our campaign,'' Flanagan campaign spokesman Larry Horist said. </P>
<P> Flanagan, 31, has campaigned for weeks in the North Side district, which stretches from expensive lakefront condominiums to suburban bungalows, accenting trust and condemning government spending. But he has avoided direct attacks on the incumbent. </P>
<P> Rostenkowski, known as a wheeler-dealer during his 36 years in Congress, is facing a 17-count federal indictment in Washington for misusing public funds, hiring ghost payrollers and other charges. </P>
<P> Rostenkowski, who has insisted he will be cleared on the charges, is seeking a 19th two-year term but has had to forfeit his powerful post as chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee because of the indictment. </P>
<P> Rostenkowski's campaign mailed voters a flyer this week criticizing Flanagan as a ``radical right-winger,'' while acknowledging the ``cloud'' hanging over the incumbent's head. </P>
<P> In a rare appearance Thursday promising to pursue federal monies for lakefront repairs here, Rostenkowski expressed optimism about Tuesday's vote. </P>
<P> ``If I win (with) 51 percent, that's fine with me,'' he told reporters. </P>
