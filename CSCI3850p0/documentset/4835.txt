<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, Germany (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  British bank trader Nick Leeson and his German jailers played a futile cat-and-mouse game with press photographers hoping to catch a glimpse of him exercising at a Frankfurt prison Friday. </P>
<P> Guards directed Leeson, the trader at the center of the Barings Bank collapse, to walk alone in a part of a prison yard cut off from the view of paparazzi photographers. </P>
<P> When one warder spotted two lenses poking out of a nearby apartment building rushed to the roof of the red-brick jail and pulled out a mirror to reflect the bright sunshine right into their viewfinders. </P>
<P> Another warder, in a gesture that only alerted the cameramen that their prey would soon appear, waved her arm in the air trying to shoo them away before Leeson emerged. </P>
<P> But it was all in vain. </P>
<P> Sporting the jeans and blue jacket all prisoners wear, Leeson emerged from the jail where he has been held since last Friday and walked straight to a corner of the yard where the barbed-wire-topped wall would hide him from prying eyes. </P>
<P> Warned where the cameras would be, Leeson glanced quickly towards the photographers and then looked down to the ground. </P>
<P> The 28-year-old Briton marked his first week Friday at the prison, where he is fighting a request by Singapore to have him extradited. </P>
<P> Leeson will appear before a local judge next week in a brief closed hearing. The judge will represent the Hesse state high court which will rule on the final Singapore extradition request due within two months. </P>
<P> Leeson is being held on an international arrest warrant issued by Singapore, where his trading on Japanese stock futures ran up losses reportedly as high as $1.51 billion and led to the collapse of the 233-year-old Barings merchant bank. </P>
<P> Leeson's lawyers say the trader will fight any Singapore request and seek extradition to London, which could lead to a prolonged court battle that may eventually have to be decided by the German government. </P>
