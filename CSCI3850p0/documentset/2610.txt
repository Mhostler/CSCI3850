<P>  The Republicans plan to replace the head of the Congressional Budget Office and his staff, a party official said Monday, a move that may affect the future of economic forecasts used by Congress. </P>
<P> ``It's our intention to largely replace CBO with more moderate economists,'' said Tony Blankley, the press secretary to Newt Gingrich, the Georgia Republican who will become Speaker of the House in January. </P>
<P> Blankley said CBO director Robert Reischauer and most of his staff would be replaced. </P>
<P> It would mark the first time professional staff has been changed at the agency, the non-partisan economic forecasting arm of Congress. When Reischauer took office in 1989 he made no staff changes, nor did his predecessor, Rudolph Penner. </P>
<P> Penner had worked in Republican administrations while his predecessor, Alice Rivlin, the first CBO director, had worked in Democratic administrations. Rivlin is now President Clinton's budget director. </P>
<P> Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, who will be majority leader starting in January, did not go so far as Blankley when he was asked during a photo opportunity if CBO and the Joint Tax Committee -- which computes how much proposed changes in taxes will raise or cost -- need to be restructured. </P>
<P> ``I don't know of anything that doesn't need restructuring around here as I look around, so we're looking at everything -- not with any prejudice but just looking at everything,'' he said. </P>
<P> Some conservative Republicans who want to see a cut in the tax on capital gains have strongly criticized CBO for its finding that such a cut would lose income for the government. </P>
<P> Republicans such as Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, who will be the new House majority leader in January, and Bill Archer of Texas, who will be the chief tax writer for the House, say CBO should use a more ``dynamic model.'' </P>
