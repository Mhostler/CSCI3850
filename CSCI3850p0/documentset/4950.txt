<P>  Newspaper investigations of potentially fraudulent businesses should be given wide latitude in libel cases, the state Supreme Court ruled Wednesday. </P>
<P> Ruling that a reporter for The Record of Bergen County had uncovered practices that, if true, would have violated the Consumer Fraud Act, the majority dismissed a libel suit filed by a Teaneck, N.J., lawnmower repair firm. </P>
<P> A 1988 article focused on such deceptive practices by Turf Lawnmower Repair Inc. as charging for new parts but installing used ones and charging for work that was not done and recommending unneeded repairs. </P>
<P> Two justices went beyond the majority, arguing that no advance restraints should be put on investigative reporting. The majority opinion, written by Justice Marie Garibaldi, sought to balance protecting consumers and the privacy of small businesses. </P>
<P> It concluded that ordinarily such a business person merely had to demonstrate negligence and falsity in the newspaper's reporting. Garibaldi wrote that defamation law creates more protection for private people than for public figures, and most small businesses fit the former category. </P>
<P> But once a newspaper reports about conduct that would violate the Consumer Fraud Act, the plaintiff must meet the ''actual malice'' standard usually applied to public figures. To be libelous, the news article must be prepared with knowing falsity or reckless disregard for its truthfulness. </P>
<P> The two concurring justices said that the majority reached the right conclusion about the reporting by the Bergen Record reporter but should not try to establish a rigid standard for when the public interest warrants applying the ``actual malice'' standard. </P>
<P> ``I would temper the majority's concern for the vulnerability of repair people with some concern for the vulnerability of consumers,'' wrote Justice Stewart Pollock, who has since retired. </P>
<P> ``Anyone who needs a repair person, unlike someone buying a newspaper or leaving a suit at the dry cleaners, is generally vulnerable. The motorist whose car breaks down on the highway is vulnerable to the demands of the tow truck operator and service station.'' </P>
<P> While most repair people are honest, Pollock wrote, ''rooting out exploitive and incompetent repair shops is in the interests of both honest repair people and the public.'' </P>
