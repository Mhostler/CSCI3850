<P>  One week after a carjacker allegedly drove off with a woman's car and her two young sons in the backseat, Union County Sheriff Howard Wells said he wants to talk to a family friend for possible clues. </P>
<P> The friend, Mitch Sinclair, said in a television interview Tuesday that ``the truth will come out'' about the carjacking. </P>
<P> Susan Smith has said she was going to see Sinclair the night of Oct. 25, when a man forced her at gunpoint to drive to the outskirts of town, forced her out of the car and drove off with the children still in the backseat. </P>
<P> Wells said Tuesday that Sinclair's statement on the national television program makes him curious. </P>
<P> ``I don't know but I'd like to talk to him,'' Wells said in the Union Daily Times.'' I think we have more to talk about. </P>
<P> Investigators have interviewed Sinclair, Smith and her husband, David, about the alleged kidnapping. Rumors have flourished about the truthfulness of Susan Smith's story including weekend reports that she failed a polygraph test. </P>
<P> Wells has not confirmed that report but admits he has not ruled out any possibility, including a hoax. </P>
<P> Meanwhile, officials in Union continue to field calls from around the country with leads, but one have panned out. </P>
<P> A spokesman for the family quoted the Smiths as saying: ``no one here can begin to imagine how upside down our lives have been turned since last Tuesday night. Our children have been ripped out of our lives and it is so unfair that Michael and Alex have been torn from us.'' </P>
