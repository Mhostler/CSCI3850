<P>  Bosnian government and separatist Serbs fought pitched battles Thursday for hilly ground in northeastern Bosnia, ignoring the gathering pace of international peace efforts. </P>
<P> United Nations officials reported fierce artillery exchanges in the Majevica hills, east of the government-held city of Tuzla, where Muslim soldiers may have taken strategic ground and a key communications tower in a four-day offensive. </P>
<P> ``Intense fighting and shelling continues,'' said U.N. spokesman Alexander Ivanko Thursday. ``The situation is assessed as full combat, not as a cease-fire violation.'' </P>
<P> U.N. officials had suggested earlier in the week the assaults were not fatal to a four-month truce that had largely brought calm to Bosnia since it began in January. Now they say Bosnia is on the point of slipping back into full-scale war. </P>
<P> The United Nations said it had evidence the Bosnian army assault, which shows no signs of halting, had taken some ground and perhaps won control of the vital Stolice radio post. </P>
<P> The Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA denied Muslim forces had captured the Stolice facility but said fighting had damaged equipment, knocking out local television transmissions. </P>
<P> Bosnian army commander Rasim Delic gave no indication he would heed international pleas to respect the current truce, telling government-run Sarajevo television his soldiers had been forced to attack to stop Serb artillery killing civilians. </P>
<P> The outbreak of fighting has led France and the United States to call for more energetic diplomacy to halt the combat. </P>
<P> Thursday Russia laid out a new approach for ending the conflict in former Yugoslavia that diplomats said centered on the lifting of sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro in exchange for Belgrade recognizing Croatia and Bosnia's independence. </P>
<P> Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev said in Geneva that in an effort to preserve a united approach Moscow would consult its partners in the Contact Group, Britain, France, Germany and the United States, before pressing on with its plans. </P>
<P> The Contact Group, the international forum struggling to forge peace in the Balkans, would consider the Russian plan next week, diplomats said, with the sticking points likely to be when to lift sanctions and whether it would be a permanent step. </P>
<P> Western states, fearful of losing what little leverage they have through Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic over Serbs in Bosnia and Croatia, say sanctions should just be suspended, and only after rump Yugoslavia recognizes its neighbors. </P>
<P> Moscow, traditionally friendly to Serbs, wants to end the embargo on Belgrade permanently and seek a solution to the independence demands of Serbs in Croatia and Bosnia before mutual recognition would occur. </P>
<P> But the relevance of either approach to stopping the war and changing the balance of power on the ground is unclear. </P>
<P> Diplomats say Yugoslavia's recognition of Bosnia is unlikely to alter the Bosnian Serbs refusal to swap any of the 70 percent of the country they hold for an end to the war. </P>
