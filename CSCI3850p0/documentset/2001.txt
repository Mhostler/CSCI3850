<P>  The U.S. troop buildup in the Gulf will reach only 30,000 and they could begin returning to the United States within weeks after Iraq withdraws its forces from the Kuwait border, U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry said Thursday. </P>
<P> But Iraq is still a long-term threat to the region, Perry said, and a more powerful force of U.S. warplanes will remain for the forseeable future to make sure that President Saddam Hussein does not again threaten moderate Gulf states. </P>
<P> ``I see Iraq as a long-term threat to be contained,'' he told reporters who traveled with him from Washington for meetings with U.S. troops massing in and near Kuwait and talks with regional leaders. </P>
<P> Perry later met with Saudi Arabia's King Fahd for nearly two hours and with Defense Minister Prince Sultan to discuss issues ranging from broader U.S. access to Saudi air bases to obtaining Saudi aid in paying the cost of the American buildup, which Perry said could reach up to $1 billion. </P>
<P> ``We're going to (have) approximately 30,000 ground combat troops in Kuwait within a week regardless of what the Iraqis do,'' Perry said. ``That's the level from which we will be drawing down as the crisis gets resolved.'' </P>
<P> ``And I would like that drawdown to occur in a matter of weeks, not a matter of months,'' he said, adding that the Iraqi withdrawal was moving well and could be completed in a week or two. </P>
<P> But a senior U.S. defense official confirmed to reporters late Thursday night that northward movement of one or two brigades of Iraqi Republican Guards had stopped in southern Iraq and that ``this looks as if it is another test of our resolve.'' </P>
<P> ``This is one of the reasons why it is premature to talk about a (U.S.) pullout immediately,'' said the official, who asked not to be identified. </P>
<P> The currently planned peak of 30,000 U.S. troops would thus fall far short of the nearly 200,000 combat troops that Washington was prepared to send unless Iraq backed down. </P>
<P> But Perry said that many of the hundreds of U.S. attack jets now being moved into Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in the region will remain to help prevent future crises from arising and to police what is expected to be a new U.N. resolution warning Saddam to stop bullying his Gulf neighbors. </P>
<P> Perry said that resolution would not specifically provide a military back-up, but ``will provide the basis for an international coalition that would set up the conditions and the necessary military force to provide that containment.'' </P>
<P> The U.S. defense official said that Fahd himself raised the issue of containing future Iraqi buildups ``and said he thoght it was a good idea.'' </P>
<P> Perry said that in addition to getting help with costs and gaining more air basing access, Washington wanted to base more heavy tanks and other equipment in the region in case U.S. troops had to return in a hurry. </P>
<P> Perry will go to Kuwait Friday for similar talks with Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, the emir of Kuait, and meetings with U.S. troops now stationed near the Iraqi border and on U.S. warships in the Gulf. </P>
<P> He stressed to reporters that even if the U.S. buildup ends soon, the operation will cost between $500 million and $1 billion and he will discuss with the Saudis and Kuwaitis the touchy question of ``buden sharing'' -- how the oil rich states in the region will shoulder much of that cost. </P>
<P> In addition to troops and more than 20 warships sent to the region, the United States is deploying nearly 700 aircraft -- including giant B-52 bombers, F-117A ``Stealth'' fighter jets and hundreds of strike jets -- to bases in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and elsewhere in the region. </P>
<P> Perry said some of those planes will remain in the area for the forseeable future in an air force larger than that maintained by the United States and its allies since the 1991 Gulf War to police ``no fly'' zones over northern and southern Iraq. </P>
<P> He suggested that air fleet could be used to police any new resolution by the United Nations warning Saddam to stop threatening other Gulf states. The United States is expected to take that a step further and order Iraq to strictly limit its armor and forces south of the 32nd parallel in the future. </P>
