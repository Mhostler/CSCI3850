<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Clinton said Saturday he was trying to break through ``partisan barriers and political rhetoric'' to gain passage in Congress soon of health care reform and anti-crime measures. </P>
<P> In his national weekly radio address, Clinton promoted the two biggest domestic initiatives of his presidency, and he used human examples to press his case ``for why we have to fix what's wrong with our health care system and make our country safer again for all Americans.'' </P>
<P> He described the issues as two ``historic decisions that call on us to break through partisan barriers and political rhetoric.'' </P>
<P> On health care, Clinton cited the case of Amanda Stewart, of Keyes, Oklahoma. The 19-year-old has been paralyzed from the chest down since 1990 as a result of a car accident and has devoted herself to educating other young people not to drink and drive. </P>
<P> Her family has been paying $3,400 a year for a limited health insurance policy but recently were told that this month their insurance premiums were going to be raised to $9,600 a year. </P>
<P> Clinton said Amanda's father, Johnnie Stewart, has a family to raise ``and he has no idea how he's going to keep paying for their health insurance. </P>
<P> ``People like Amanda and her family are the reason we have to guarantee private, not government, health insurance for every American,'' Clinton said. </P>
<P> The House of Representatives and the Senate are hoping to debate and vote on their different versions of health reform later this month. </P>
<P> Senator Conrad Burns of Montana, in the Republican response to Clinton's radio address, said the president ``must come off the campaign trail'' and pass a less sweeping bill that contains health care reforms that both Republicans and Democrats agree are needed. </P>
<P> Burns said a majority of both parties agree insurance industry reforms are needed to deal with pre-existing medical conditions and treatment of medical malpractice. </P>
<P> Burns added that product liability should be reformed in the courts and the government should offer more incentives for doctors to practice in rural areas and to help low income families get insurance. </P>
<P> On crime, Clinton cited the case of James Darby, a nine-year-old boy from New Orleans who wrote him last April to do something about the crime rate. The child was shot dead nine days later walking home from a Mother's Day picnic. </P>
<P> Clinton said that since then the anti-crime legislation is being held up by parliamentary maneuvering by opponents of some provisions of the measure. </P>
<P> The bill authorizes more than $30 billion to hire up to 100,000 additional police, build prisons and fund crime prevention programs. </P>
<P> Clinton said the National Rifle Association, which is opposed to a provision to ban 19 types of assault weapons, and others are trying to keep the crime bill from passing by blocking a vote on rules for debate about the measure. </P>
<P> ``If they really want a shootout, we really ought to have it at broad daylight and high noon, not in the shadows of parliamentary maneuvering. No one should play any more political games with our nation's safety,'' Clinton said. </P>
