<DATELINE>ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Talks aimed at settling a bitter fish war between Canada and the European Union ended without agreement Saturday as Ottawa threatened renewed action against Spanish trawlers fishing in disputed waters off the coast of Newfoundland. </P>
<P> Negotiators from Ottawa and the EU ended three days of talks in Vancouver as planned without reaching any immediate resolution on the dispute over overfishing of turbot in the north Atlantic. </P>
<P> Canada's foreign affairs spokeswoman Jennifer Sloan said the two sides were ``undertaking to have ongoing discussions.'' </P>
<P> Discussions will continue Sunday in Brussels by expert groups looking at better enforcement measures for overfishing, Sloan said. </P>
<P> The senior representatives will continue to have telephone contacts, she said. </P>
<P> Canada's Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin earlier said that failure of the talks could result in further action against Spanish trawlers fishing on the Grand Banks just outside Canada's 200 nautical mile limit in defiance of a 60-day moratorium imposed by Ottawa. </P>
<P> ``It is with a deep sense of regret that we consider again the possibility of having to take any direct measures,'' Tobin told reporters. </P>
<P> ``We are looking at the strong possibility that at least this round of discussions have left us without a negotiated solution. If that is the case then we will have to look at our operational options that are open to us including the use of the warp cutters.'' </P>
<P> Two Canadian patrol boats equipped with warp cutters -- used to cut cables that connect fishing nets to the trawlers -- headed out Saturday from St. John's to the Grand Banks where Spanish vessels have resumed fishing. </P>
<P> The dispute was sparked March 9 when Canada seized a Spanish factory trawler, the Estai, in international waters and charged its captain with illegal fishing for turbot, or Greenland halibut. </P>
<P> The boat was later released after payment of a $500,000 Canadian ($340,000 U.S.) bond last week, returning Thursday to a hero's welcome in the Spanish port of Vigo. </P>
<P> Canada has so far resisted taking further action while talks were continuing even though 12 Spanish trawlers are again fishing in the disputed area off the nose of the Grand Banks. </P>
<P> ``We are considering all options. The options range from arrest to use of warp cutter to use of techniques to prevent these vessels from having a successful day of fishing,'' Tobin said. </P>
<P> ``We shall see in the next few days which ones are employed and where and how they are employed,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``It is equally clear that Canada has not been able to reach an agreement at this stage ... on effective rules and that Canada will now have to examine other options.'' </P>
<P> Canada has accused European fleets, mainly Spanish vessels, of overfishing for turbot and is pushing for tougher conservation measures. The EU, in turn, has accused Ottawa of piracy over its arrest of the Estai and wants a greater share of the international 27,000-ton turbot quota. </P>
