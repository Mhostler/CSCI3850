<P>  A Paris appeals court Wednesday upheld the release by a judge of 18 foreigners from a jail denounced by human rights activists as inhumane. </P>
<P> Judge Francois Sottet freed the detainees last week after police refused to let him and a lawyer inspect cells under Paris' Palais de Justice to investigate the serious beating of an inmate by fellow prisoners. </P>
<P> The police appealed against the detainees' release from the jail where several dozen foreigners are held at any given time in difficult conditions, most of them awaiting expulsion from France. Human rights groups have called for the jail's closure. </P>
<P> The court ruled that the inmates' detention period had expired and said ``the judiciary has a constitutional responsibility to safeguard individual liberties.'' </P>
<P> Sottet acted after he was asked to extend detention of a presumed Moroccan citizen, Minou Rama, who appeared in court last week with a broken arm and a badly bruised face. He was unable to stand and asked to lie down in court. </P>
<P> Among past controversies at the jail, a guard faces charges for raping an Algerian transvestite inmate, a Moroccan recently hanged himself in a cell and eight policemen were suspended this month for beating another detainee. </P>
<P> Danielle Mitterrand, a human rights campaigner and the wife of outgoing President Francois Mitterrand, has criticised conditions there. </P>
