<P>  Latin America should take a step toward becoming a nuclear-free zone when Cuba signs the Tlatelolco Treaty, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) general director Hans Blix said Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``At the present time, it is really only Cuba that is missing. ... It may well be that its signature is imminent. We hope so, and the entry into force of the Tlatelolco Treaty will be a big boost for the efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons to other countries in the world,'' he said. </P>
<P> Blix was speaking at a news conference towards the end of a three-day visit to Argentina, where he met with President Carlos Menem and was due to meet with Foreign Minister Guido di Tella later Wednesday. </P>
<P> On the agenda were Argentina's intention to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Tlatelolco Treaty, which Argentina ratified this year, and the role of nuclear energy, Blix said. </P>
<P> Progress on the Tlatelolco Treaty, to make Latin America nuclear weapons-free, was made possible by newly close relations between old rivals Argentina and Brazil and continues several years' rapid progress on world nuclear disarmament, he said. </P>
<P> Talks are also likely toward negotiating a START III agreement to follow up START II, cutting U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals by around 90 percent, Blix said. </P>
<P> ``There is also a very good chance that in this coming year there will be a complete test ban agreement,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``If, as we expect, Algeria also joins the non-proliferation treaty, the road should be open for an African treaty on a nuclear weapons-free zone,'' he said. </P>
<P> Blix also spoke with Argentine politicians and atomic energy officials about the country's nuclear power industry, one of the first put into operation in the developing world and due to be privatized by next year, he said. </P>
<P> ``I have explained that in my view nuclear power will be indispensable to the world in the next century,'' he said. </P>
<P> Nuclear power offers substantial environmental advantages over fossil fuels, currently the source of about 90 percent of the world's power and linked to global warming, he said. </P>
<P> Asked about safety standards at Argentina's reactors, Blix said ``My impression is that Argentina's results are quite good.'' </P>
