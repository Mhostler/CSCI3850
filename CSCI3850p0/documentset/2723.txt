<P>  Muslim militants who stormed into a village west of Algiers launched a battle in which 24 people were killed, the official Algerian news agency APS reported Saturday. </P>
<P> It said the militants killed 10 men, including two members of the security forces, in the raid on Sidi Abdellah village 40 miles from the capital. </P>
<P> The defenders killed six of the attackers and reinforcements summoned by the villagers killed eight more, the agency said. </P>
<P> The battle at Sidi Abdellah raised to 63 the officially reported death toll for the week in conflict between the state and Islamic militants. </P>
<P> APS also carried a Foreign Ministry statement confirming official media reports that the government would not attend peace talks with opposition groups, including the banned Islamic Salvation Front, which a Catholic group has tried to arrange in Rome. </P>
<P> ``Algeria's internal problems should only be resolved in Algeria and between Algerians. Talks about these problems must not be transfered abroad,'' the statement said. </P>
<P> At least 10,000 people have been killed in Algeria since the army-backed authorities cancelled elections in January 1992 in which the Islamists had taken a commanding lead. Western experts put the death toll at up to 30,000. </P>
