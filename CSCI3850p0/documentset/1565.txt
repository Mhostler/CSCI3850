<DATELINE>BONN, Germany (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The German parliament Friday passed a crime bill that will become law on December 1 that threatens five year jail terms for denying the Holocaust. </P>
<P> Apart from jail sentences for the so-called ``Auschwitz lie'' -- denying that the Holocaust happened -- the bill extends an existing ban on the use of Nazi symbols in Germany to slogans and signs that simply resemble Nazi symbols. </P>
<P> The anti-crime package, intended partly to stop voters drifting to right-wing parties in October's general election, gives police and prosecutors more powers to crack down on small-time criminals, organized crime and street violence. </P>
<P> The opposition Social Demcrats (SPD) had originally blocked the bill mainly on the grounds that it undermined Germany's traditionally strict barrier between intelligence services and police work. </P>
<P> As a compromise the bill, passed by parliament's lower house Wednesday before winning final approval by the upper chamber, allows police and prosecutors to use information gathered by the German espionage agency BND but limits how the agency gathers covert intelligence. </P>
<P> It also confines the BND's role to suspected severe cases of terrorism, drugs and arms trading, money laundering and nuclear smuggling. </P>
<P> Both Kohl's coalition of Christian Democrats (CDU) and the liberal Free Democrats as well as the SPD have made anti-crime measures a key plank in their election campaigns. </P>
