<P>  Northern Ireland politican John Hume brought proposals for economic aid to the region Tuesday as he began talks with U.S. officials that are to include Vice President Al Gore. </P>
<P> At the start of a meeting with Senator Edward Kennedy, Hume told reporters he would be putting proposals to Kennedy and his colleagues ``for specific ways in which we can economically regenerate our region.'' </P>
<P> Hume, chairman of the Social and Democratic Labor Party, viewed by most as a moderate, predominantly Catholic party, was visiting Washington in the wake of an announced cease-fire by the outlawed Irish Republican Army and amid reports that Gerry Adams, head of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, would shortly visit the United States. </P>
<P> Kennedy said he expected Adams to receive a U.S. visa and his visit would take place shortly. Washington's approval of a visa for an earlier visit by Adams caused anger in London. </P>
<P> The Massachusetts Democrat praised Hume as ``one of my real heros,'' saying no one had done more for the cause of peace in Northern Ireland. </P>
<P> Hume said his talks in Washington would concentrate on the next stage in the peace process ``and as part of that next stage I'll be concentrating largely as well on the economic situation.'' </P>
<P> Hume was to meet later with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and other members of Congress with an interest in Ireland. </P>
<P> President Clinton was expected to make an appearance at Hume's scheduled meeting with Vice President Gore. </P>
<P> Hume arrived in Washington Sunday and was to return home Thursday. </P>
