<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A senior U.S. envoy has met Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa to try to ease a crisis between Cairo and Israel over the signing of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, official Egyptian sources said. </P>
<P> ``The United States sees great importance for the signing of the treaty. The U.S. believes all countries must sign it, back it and be committed to it to achieve security and stability in the world,'' U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Pelletreau said after meeting Moussa Saturday night. </P>
<P> Pelletreau arrived in Cairo Saturday to take part in the steering committee of the multilateral Middle East peace talks which Sunday start assessing work of its groups on arms control, water, refugees, environment and economic affairs. </P>
<P> Cairo insists it will not sign the nuclear treaty when it comes up in April in Geneva unless Israel, widely believed to possess nuclear warheads, does so. Israel said it would not sign as long as it faces potential danger from Syria, Iraq and Iran. </P>
<P> Official sources said Pelletreau, who enjoys good relations with Cairo having served as ambassador for three years until last year, would try to persuade Egypt to soften its stand. </P>
<P> But Moussa said the United States should convince Israel too. </P>
<P> ``Egypt's stand is clear and will not change unless there is a change in the Israeli position,'' said Moussa, adding that he and Pelletreau agreed to continue consultation on the matter. </P>
<P> Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has repeatedly said that signing the treaty without Israel, as Cairo did before, would be ``an unacceptable matter on the popular level.'' </P>
<P> Pelletreau was also expected to meet Mubarak to discuss obstacles facing the Middle East peace process which was launched in Madrid by the United States and Russia in 1991. </P>
<P> He also discussed with Moussa Mubarak's forthcoming visit to Washington in the spring during which he would try to rally support from the congress to maintain the annual $2 billion U.S. aid offered to Cairo since it signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979. </P>
