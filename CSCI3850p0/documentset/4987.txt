<P>  Bomb threats disrupted celebrations of the Jewish festival of Purim in Odessa Friday, police said. </P>
<P> Police evacuated about 1,000 people, mostly children in constumes, from the Black Sea port's Ukrainian Theater after a caller said a bomb had been planted there. Nothing was found and the festivities resumed. </P>
<P> A second caller later said a bomb had been placed in the offices of the Jewish Agency, which promotes emigration to Israel, but a search also turned up nothing. </P>
<P> Police had no comment on the threats, but Felix Milshtein, a leader of Odessa's 40,000-member Jewish community, said: ``This was clearly an attempt to ruin the holiday. We have seen increases in anti-Semitic incidents.'' </P>
<P> Purim, one of the happiest events in the Jewish religious calendar, features costume displays and a big feast to honor the saving of the Jews in ancient Iraq by Queen Esther. </P>
