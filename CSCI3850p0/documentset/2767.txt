<P> Reich's speech to the council, a moderate-to-conservative partisan group with close ties to President Clinton, was his third and final policy address dealing with what he calls a new ``anxious class'' of workers. </P>
<P> This class of workers, Reich said, has seen its compact that hard work will be rewarded broken by corporate America amid a second industrial revolution of automation, global competition and a decline in union representation. </P>
<P> Because the federal budget is already strained, Reich suggested ending special tax benefits for certain industries to pay for training and re-employment programs for displaced workers. </P>
<P> Calling for a renewed debate on the issue, Reich cited a report by the council's Progressive Policy Institute that identified $114 billion in spending subsidies and $111 billion in tax breaks that could be saved over a five-year period for this purpose. </P>
