<DATELINE>ZAGREB, Croatia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Rebel Serb warplanes bombed the Muslim-controlled Bihac enclave in northwestern Bosnia Saturday, openly defying the United Nations in the second such attack in as many days. </P>
<P> United Nations spokesman Paul Risley told Reuters in the Croatian capital Zagreb that one of the jets crashed and the pilot was killed. </P>
<P> The attack from the Serb-occupied Krajina enclave of Croatia was in direct defiance of the U.N. Security Council, which strongly condemned Serb air-raids over the same area Friday and said it would consider action by NATO to stop them. </P>
<P> One of the Serb Orao (Eagle) jets crashed into apartment buildings in the town of Cazin, and the pilot was killed. </P>
<P> Cazin is about 10 miles to the north of Bihac town, which is a U.N.-declared safe area. </P>
<P> Risley said the initial reports from U.N. military observers (UNMOs) put the casualty total at nine. Bomb fragments were found in three craters and three unexploded bombs were found. </P>
<P> ``Bombs hit at least one group of flats and casualties are expected,'' Risley said. </P>
<P> Risley quoted witnesses as saying one of the aircraft lost control after hitting a chimney and then crashed into the apartment building. </P>
<P> ``Within 400 metres (yards) of the burning apartment building UNMOs found three large craters 20 metres (70 feet) across, and bomb fragments were found found in craters. </P>
<P> ``There is a factory located near the appartments and we believe it was the intended target,'' he said. </P>
<P> Bosnian ambassador Muhamed Sacirbey said on CNN television that Bosnian forces had shot down one of the jets and there were 15 serious casualties, including a number of possible deaths. </P>
<P> Large crowds gathered at the scene, with many people expressing anger at the U.N. </P>
<P> ``This is a clear violation of (U.N.-ordered operation) Deny Flight over Bosnia and resulted in casualties on the ground in an area very near to the (U.N.-protected) safe area,'' Risley said. </P>
<P> The Security Council was meeting Saturday in New York to consider extending NATO air cover to Krajina. </P>
<P> Krajina Serb forces are attacking Bihac in support of Bosnian Serbs advancing on the enclave after rolling up Bosnian government army advances last week. </P>
<P> In Zagreb, the Croatian government immediately called on NATO to use its airpower to stop the attacks from Krajina. </P>
<P> ``Croatia has allowed NATO intervention ... this went into effect the moment (NATO Secretary-General) Willy Claes got President Franjo Tudjman's letter,'' the Croatian head of state's spokesman said. </P>
<P> Tudjman wrote to the Security Council and Claes late Friday urging the United Nations to put a stop to the attacks and informing NATO his government would permit NATO aircraft to operate in Croatia for one week to launch air strikes against the Serbs. </P>
<P> Milan Martic, leader of the rebel Krajina Serbs, vowed to retaliate if air strikes were launched against his territory. </P>
<P> Risley said the two jets took off from Udbina in Serb-held Krajina at 3:48 p.m. (9;48 a.m. EST). The surviving aircraft left the area after 10 minutes and returned to its base. </P>
<P> In Naples, a NATO spokesman said Serb air activity had been detected in the Krajina area. ``We observed aircraft activity out of Udbina but we didn't see anyone flying over Bosnia, though that doesn't mean it didn't happen,'' he added. </P>
<P> NATO failed completely to spot Friday's raid. </P>
<P> Udbina was the airfield used by rebel Serb pilots who attacked Bihac Friday with napalm and cluster bombs, provoking an angry response from the U.N. Security Council. </P>
