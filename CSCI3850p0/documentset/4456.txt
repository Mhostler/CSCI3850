<P>  Former Argentine dictator Juan Carlos Ongania has been placed under house arrest for 20 days for calling the government corrupt and saying it could be toppled by a popular revolt. </P>
<P> Ongania, 80, who toppled Arturo Illia's elected government in 1966 but is now considering running for a tiny right-wing party in May's elections, said President Carlos Menem's government is ``the most corrupt Argentina has ever had.'' </P>
<P> He was taken Monday to military headquarters -- ironically, in a Ford Falcon, the car used by later military regimes to kidnap ``subversives'' -- where army bosses gave him 20 days' house arrest, the state news agency Telam said. </P>
<P> Ongania made the comments in a rambling interview with a weekly newsmagazine in which he warned Menem's rule could end prematurely ``with some sort of event of a social type.'' </P>
<P> ``Although that could be difficult because the people are so jelly-like,'' he added. </P>
<P> Ongania, describing his regime as ``soft'' compared to the military juntas of 1976-83, was cynical about the chances of a former dictator like himself being elected, saying it would be ``difficult.'' </P>
<P> But he added: ``Some poor fool will vote for me.'' </P>
<P> He also blasted homosexuals, public displays of affection by courting couples and Argentine television, against which he said violence was justified. </P>
