<P>  Nobel Literature Prize winner Kenzaburo Oe said Wednesday that any removal of the principle of ``eternal peace'' in Japan's post-war constitution would betray Asians and victims of the atomic bomb. </P>
<P> In the traditional Nobel lecture, Oe spoke of what he called the confused and disorientated people of modern Japan, who lived through their country's defeat in World War II, the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the post-war American occupation. </P>
<P> The title ``Japan, the Ambiguous, and Myself'' contrasted with a lecture entitled ``Japan, the Beautiful, and Myself'' given by Yasunari Kawabata when he became the first Japanese to win the Nobel literature award 26 years ago. </P>
<P> Kawabata wrote of the values and beauty of old Japan, while Oe's works have portrayed the split of modern Japan -- modernization has been oriented toward learning from and imitating the West, while remaining a part of Asia. </P>
<P> ``The ambiguous orientation of Japan drove the country into the position of an invader of Asia,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``As someone living in the present world such as this one and sharing bitter memories of the past imprinted on my mind, I cannot utter in unison with Kawabata the phrase ``Japan, the Beautiful, and Myself,''' Oe, 59, said. </P>
<P> ``The contemporary state of Japan and its people in their post-modern phase cannot but be ambivalent,'' said Oe, who will receive his Nobel award and $930,000 at a ceremony in Stockholm Saturday. </P>
<P> Oe said that in the midst of Japan's modernization came World War II, and the ``moral props'' for Japanese apsiring to a rebirth after the nation's defeat were the idea of democracy and their determination never to wage war again. </P>
<P> Recently, however, Japan has been criticized for not playing a more active role in the world in keeping and restoring peace. </P>
<P> ``Our heart sinks whenever we hear these criticisms. After the end of the Second World War it was a categorical imperative for us to declare that we renounced war forever in a central article of the new Constitution.'' </P>
<P> ``The Japanese chose the principle of eternal peace as the basis of morality for our rebirth after the War. </P>
<P> ``To obliterate from the Constitution the principle of eternal peace will be nothing but an act of betrayal against the peoples of Asia and the victims of the atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki,'' Oe told an audience of close to 500 people. </P>
