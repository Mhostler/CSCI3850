<P> By Susan Cornwell  President Clinton said Wednesday that after a shuttle mission by Secretary of State Warren Christopher to the Middle East he now sees a real chance to secure a durable peace in the region. </P>
<P> Clinton was speaking after an upbeat meeting with Morocco's King Hassan and as Christopher returned to Washington having persuaded one of the main holdouts from regional peace -- Syria -- to resume direct talks with Israel. </P>
<P> ``This is a very encouraging development,'' Clinton said at a news conference with Hassan in the White House Rose Garden after they had conferred for over 90 minutes. </P>
<P> ``Combined with the new energy we see in the Israeli-Palestinian discussions and continued progress in implementing the Jordan-Israel peace treaty, I believe there is now a real opportunity to secure a durable resolution to the Arab-Israeli conflict,'' Clinton said. </P>
<P> He declined to be more specific about his optimism, but said the United States saw its role as a facilitator. </P>
<P> ``We cannot make a peace for the parties, and we're doing what we can, once again, to make our best case to both sides about what things will make them secure in making the decision,'' the president said. </P>
<P> The Israeli-Syrian talks, broken off by Syria last December, were expected to start next week between the ambassadors of the two nations in Washington. </P>
<P> Hassan said progress in those talks could lead to an Arab League decision to lift its economic boycott of Israel. </P>
<P> ``There is no doubt that the progress that is scored in the peace negotiations between Israel and Syria will certainly bring about a collective decision on the part of all of the members of the Arab League concerning the lifting of the boycott,'' the king said. </P>
<P> Morocco does not participate in the embargo of Israel, and the Persian Gulf states have lifted secondary aspects of the boycott. </P>
<P> Clinton and Hassan noted the fragility of the Middle East peace process and said it had to be accelerated. </P>
<P> At a White House arrival ceremony, Hassan said he was moved to be standing where Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat shook hands over a peace agreement 18 months ago. </P>
<P> ``This newborn peace appears to be threatened by dangers, because it's not a full-fledged peace,'' said the king, wearing a royal blue suit on a splendid early spring day. ``For peace to be achieved, the pace of the negotiations between the Palestinians and the Israelis needs to be accelerated.'' </P>
<P> At an evening state dinner that included a couscous course, Clinton told Hassan in a toast that Americans admired the king's ``steadfast devotion'' to securing a comprehensive Middle East peace. </P>
<P> ``In a region where passion and hatred have so often overwhelmed cooler heads and clearer minds, yours has always been a voice of reason,'' Clinton said. </P>
<P> Hassan, in his toast, said he and Clinton talked with ''heavy frankness'' on ways to bring tensions down in the Middle East. </P>
<P> During their talks, the two leaders agreed to forge stronger economic bonds and signed a trade and investment framework agreement. </P>
<P> Hassan also attended a ceremony at which a U.S. government agency offered $200 million in political risk insurance to a Michigan company building a $1.5 billion power plant near Casablanca. </P>
<P> At their news conference, Clinton said he emphasized to Hassan the importance of an indefinite extension of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to help create a nuclear-free Middle East. </P>
<P> Hassan expressed concern that a treaty not signed by Israel ``would be difficult for many states to support,'' U.S. officials told reporters after the meeting. </P>
