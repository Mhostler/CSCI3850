<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Hundreds of black South African children protested against discrimination Friday a few city blocks from where President Nelson Mandela issued a stern warning against racism in a speech to parliament. </P>
<P> Armed police formed a cordon around the children to prevent a repeat of Thursday's incidents when black youths mugged several white women and wrecked fruit-stalls during protests in Cape Town. </P>
<P> Witnesses said the children danced and chanted outside provincial government offices in the city center before leaving in buses which had ferried them in from Khayelitsha township. </P>
<P> Earlier Friday, police barred the children from leaving Khayelitsha for an abandoned school in the mainly white Ruyterwacht suburb, where racial tensions between black pupils and white residents flared earlier this week. </P>
<P> Mandela, opening a new session of parliament, said racism remained a cancer in South African society and had to be rooted out. </P>
<P> ``Those who are responsible for these crimes of racism must be brought to book without delay,'' said Mandela referring to the incidents at Ruyterwacht where a black child was beaten by a white armed with a whip. </P>
<P> Thursday, provincial Education Minister Martha Olckers ordered police to prevent children from returning to the school which she said was being closed because it had been vandalised to the extent it was a health risk. </P>
<P> Pupils responded by saying they were determined to show their disapproval of Olckers, a minister of the National Party, which is backed mainly by whites and people of mixed race. </P>
<P> The lobby group organizing the school busing, the National Education Coordination Committee (NECC), agreed with the province's NP premier Hernus Kriel Friday that black children would be able to return to Ruyterwacht and two other empty schools. </P>
<P> An NECC spokesman said the agreement included establishment of a joint committee to address problems in education. He said black children were unlikely to return to Ruyterwacht before Wednesday. </P>
<P> Before being given permission to protest in Cape Town on Friday, about 1,000 pupils, chanting and dancing along a railway line from Khayelitsha toward the city, were stopped by riot police armed with shields, helmets, teargas and rubber bullets. </P>
<P> ``Are you ready for a fight, for a war,'' one of the pupils asked the police. </P>
<P> About 3,000 black pupils were bused under police guard Monday to Ruyterwacht where they had planned to register for other schools, because those in their township were full. </P>
<P> Scores of under-utilized whites-only schools were closed during the last decades of apartheid, but the country lacks classrooms in mainly black areas. </P>
