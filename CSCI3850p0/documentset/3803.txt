<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Karl Malone scored a season-high 42 points as the Utah Jazz won their 13th straight road game, matching the second longest road streak in NBA history with a 99-98 win over the Indiana Pacers Monday. </P>
<P> The Jazz equalled the road streak of the 1964-65 Celtics. The all-time record of 16 is held by the 1971-72 Lakers. Both those teams went on to win NBA championships. </P>
<P> John Stockton had 15 points and 19 assists for Utah, which erased a nine-point deficit in the final eight minutes of the fourth quarter. </P>
<P> ``This team is tough,'' said Jazz coach Jerry Sloan, who was known for his toughness during his playing days with Chicago. ''The way we worked today, the season will come out good if we continue to work like that.'' </P>
<P> Dale Davis had 20 points and 12 rebounds to lead the Pacers, who have lost five of their last seven games. </P>
<P> Malone fouled out in overtime, but Antoine Carr scored six of his eight points in OT as Indiana missed four straight free throws. Reggie Miller missed a 3-pointer in the final seconds. </P>
<P> At Minnesota, the lowly Timberwolves upset the defending champion Houston Rockets 94-75, using a 10-2 run in the third quarter and a 13-1 tear to start the fourth. </P>
<P> Minnesota's Isaiah Rider had a game-high 24 points as the Wolves held Houston, led by Hakeem Olajuwon's 22 points, to just 37 percent (30-of-82) shooting from the field. </P>
<P> ``They had an off night,'' Timberwolves coach Bill Blair said of the Rockets. ``I don't want to put it all on our team, but I thought we played extremely well.'' </P>
<P> The T-Wolves beat the Rockets for only the third time in 25 games and got only their second win in the last 10 games. </P>
<P> ``Tonight was a great example that if you don't play hard, and you don't play intelligently, you're going to get your butt whipped,'' Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``We just can't show up and expect to win.'' </P>
<P> At Golden State, Tom Gugliotta hit a 3-pointer with 40.2 seconds left to break a tie as the Warriors spoiled the debut of Denver Nuggets coach Gene Littles, 77-73. </P>
<P> Littles replaced Dan Issel, who quit in a surprise move Sunday. ``It feels the same way as when you are an assistant, especially when you lose,'' Littles said. </P>
<P> The 73 points were the least Denver has ever scored in the NBA and one more than the franchise record. The ABA Nuggets totalled just 72 against San Antonio in 1973. </P>
<P> The Warriors, led by Tim Hardaway's 21 points, won for only the fourth time in 26 games. </P>
<P> In Philadelphia, Joe Dumars scored 13 of his 35 points in the fourth quarter, including a 3-pointer with 1:02 left, to lift the Detroit Pistons past the reeling 76ers, 116-110. </P>
<P> Detroit won for only third time in its last 18 games. </P>
<P> Dana Barros had 26 points and 12 assists for the Sixers, who have lost nine straight games and 14 of their last 16. </P>
<P> In New York, Patrick Ewing scored 22 of his season-high 32 points in the first half and grabbed 15 rebounds as the Knicks coasted to a 107-90 victory over the New Jersey Nets. </P>
<P> The Knicks have won nine of their last 10 games. </P>
<P> The Nets have lost nine of their last 12 games and 17 of their last 20 contests at Madison Square Garden. </P>
<P> Derrick Coleman had 22 points and 12 rebounds for the Nets, but had just six points over the final three quarters. </P>
<P> The Los Angeles Lakers got 24 points from Nick Van Exel and 23 from Eddie Jones as they rallied for a 96-88 victory over the visiting Los Angeles Clippers, handing their crosstown rivals their sixth straight loss. </P>
<P> The Lakers erased a 12-point deficit to win their seventh in nine games. </P>
<P> Loy Vaught scored 18 points and rookie Lamond Murray added 17 for the Clips, who dropped to a league-worst 5-31. </P>
<P> In Atlanta, Mookie Blaylock had 20 points and Craig Ehlo added 19 as the Hawks continued their home dominance of the Miami Heat with a 99-95 triumph. </P>
<P> The Heat remained winless in Atlanta, falling to 0-11. </P>
<P> Billy Owens had 22 points and 13 rebounds to lead Miami, which has lost seven of its last nine games. </P>
<P> At Washington, Calbert Cheaney scored 15 of his 23 points in the fourth quarter as the Bullets snapped a 10-game losing streak with a 109-101 victory over the Chicago Bulls. </P>
<P> The Bullets, who had five players in double figures, won for just the second time in their last 20 games. </P>
<P> The Bulls, who have lost three straight, got 26 points from B.J. Armstrong and 21 points and 10 rebounds from Scottie Pippen. </P>
