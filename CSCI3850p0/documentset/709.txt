<P>  President Clinton was expected to name Abner Mikva, chief judge of the federal appeals court here, as his new White House counsel Thursday, officials said. </P>
<P> The president will make an announcement at the White House at 3:30 p.m. EDT, spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said. While she did not name Mikva, senior officials said the job would go to him. </P>
<P> The new counsel will take over from Lloyd Cutler, the prominent Washington lawyer and Democratic party stalwart who had agreed to serve only 130 days, the limit for a special government employee. That period expires sometime in September. </P>
<P> Myers said there might be some overlap between Cutler and the new counsel, with the new official probably taking over on October 1. </P>
<P> Cutler, a senior partner at the law firm of Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering, took over from Clinton's first White House counsel, Bernard Nussbaum. </P>
<P> Nussbaum resigned last spring under criticism for his role in White House-Treasury contacts about a federal investigation of an Arkansas savings and loan that touched on Clinton. </P>
<P> Cutler will attend the Thursday afternoon ceremony, along with White House chief of staff Leon Panetta, Myers said. </P>
<P> Mikva's appointment will be the first major White House personnel change since Panetta took over as chief of staff last month from Thomas ``Mack'' McLarty. </P>
<P> Panetta is expected to recommend a White House staff shakeup to Clinton soon. But Myers said no more personnel changes were expected to be announced Thursday. </P>
<P> Mikva, 68, served in the House of Representatives and in the Illinois legislature before being named to the federal bench by President Jimmy Carter in 1979. </P>
<P> Since 1991 he has been the chief judge of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. </P>
