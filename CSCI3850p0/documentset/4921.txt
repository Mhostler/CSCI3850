<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  House Republican leaders Tuesday announced plans for floor consideration later this month of at least three versions of a constitutional amendment limiting the terms of members of Congress. </P>
<P> Term limits proponents acknowledged that they faced an uphill fight to win the required two-thirds majority and called for a grass-roots lobbying campaign to help get votes. </P>
<P> Republicans promised a House vote on term limits in their Contract with America, but the vote was delayed in the face of a possible embarrassing defeat. </P>
<P> House Republican Leader Dick Armey told reporters Tuesday that the House would debate term limits March 27-28. </P>
<P> Under the plan, the House will consider two proposals calling for limits of six two-year terms in the House and two six-year terms in the Senate -- one of which would allow states to set lower limits. There will also be a proposal limiting House membership to six years and an expected Democratic alternative. </P>
<P> At least a dozen alternatives had been proposed, including legislation allowing the states to set term limits. Some of the more hawkish proponents of limits have been demanding that House Republicans allow a vote on such legislation, which would require only a simple majority for passage. </P>
<P> Twenty-two states have already set term limits, but the laws are being reviewed by the Supreme Court. </P>
<P> Conservative columnist Pat Buchanan, who will announce his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination Monday in New Hampshire, called for a limit of six years for House members and warned Republicans of dire consequences if they did not support limits. </P>
<P> ``If the Republican Party is perceived as undermining term limits, the populist revolt that helped elect the Republican Party in 1994 in that great revolution will round and turn on the Republican Party,'' he told a news conference. </P>
<P> A constitutional amendment requires a two-thirds majority in both the House and Senate and ratification by 38 states. Even if it passes the House, the amendment would face strong opposition in the Senate. </P>
<P> ``I think we have a chance to pass it (in the House). It's an uphill fight ... but I think we have a chance to do it if the grass roots decide to get very, very active and if we get enough phone calls,'' House Speaker Newt Gingrich said. </P>
<P> Term limits supporters need 290 votes to win passage of a constitutional amendment in the House. Republicans control the House with a 230-205 majority. </P>
<P> Term limit supporters say it will make members more responsive to the public and prevent a small group of long-term incumbents from controlling Congress. Opponents say voters now have the power to end terms at any election. </P>
<P> Presidents are limited to two four-year terms under an amendment ratified in 1951. </P>
