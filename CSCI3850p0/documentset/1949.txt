<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The White House released Tuesday an internal report indicating Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy had ''run afoul'' of ethics standards but saying no action was needed because Espy has announced his resignation. </P>
<P> The report said President Clinton needed to take no further action against Espy because the Agriculture Secretary has reimbursed questionable government expenses and gifts from companies regulated by his department, and is stepping down. </P>
<P> ``In light of Secretary Espy's reimbursement of the costs of questionable transactions, his announced intention to resign at the end of this year, his recusal, and the institution of additional measures for reviewing his travel, we do not believe any further action should be taken at this time,'' said the report, by new White House counsel Abner Mikva. </P>
<P> The document also appeared to defer final judgment of possible criminal violations in the Espy case to a separate probe by an independent counsel . </P>
<P> Mikva's report said that after the criminal probe is completed, the inspector general in the Agriculture Department should examine whether any additional money is owed to the department or others. </P>
<P> ``Members of the Cabinet should set an example for all federal employees,'' Mikva said in the report. </P>
<P> ``When they run afoul of the standards of conduct, however inadvertently, their actions reflect negatively on the president and the executive branch, and promote distrust of the government.'' </P>
<P> Mikva's report said his office is checking to make sure each department head in the Clinton administration ``has received the required ethics training'' so he or she does not run afoul of ethics guidelines. </P>
<P> A senior official defended the bland tone of the report, saying it was never the counsel's job to be punitive but to simply determine whether Clinton needed to take any further action on the Espy case. </P>
<P> ``There are clearly contentions and counter-contentions and nuances that he (Espy) would have offered. He never conceded that he breached his trust,'' the official told Reuters. </P>
<P> ``And there was no way we could come to a conclusion on that without more investigating powers than we had,'' the senior official said. </P>
<P> Espy announced his resignation Oct 3, effective at the end of the year, and said he would devote his energies full-time to defending his reputation. </P>
<P> The report, which was sent to the president Tuesday and then released to the media, reviews allegations against Espy. It tells the steps he has taken to rectify the situation, and lists the applicable ethical standards of conduct for executive branch employees. </P>
<P></P>
<P> -- The Agriculture Department leased a Jeep Cherokee for official use by Espy when he travelled to Mississippi, his home state. Espy reimbursed the department for the cost of the lease, the report says, but does not name the amount. </P>
<P> -- Espy's girlfriend, Patricia Dempsy, received a $1,200 educational scholarship from a foundation of the Arkansas-based Tyson Foods Inc., the country's largest poultry producer. The report said Dempsey recently repaid the foundation for the entire amount of the scholarship. </P>
<P> -- Espy reimbursed Tyson, Quaker Oats and Fernbank Museum for a variety of basketball, football and Super Bowl tickets and other gifts he received from them. </P>
<P> -- Espy reimbursed the Agriculture department for lodging costs incurred on one of this trips. He also instituted additional screening procedures of his travel by his agency ethics official to ensure compliance with all travel regulations. </P>
