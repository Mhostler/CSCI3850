<P>  Bowing to what it called vehement objections by a Catholic group, Miramax Films said Friday it will change the release date of its controversial movie ''Priest,'' originally set for Good Friday. </P>
<P> The nationwide release of ``Priest,'' which opened Friday in New York and Los Angeles, will be moved to Wednesday, April 19, from Friday, April 14, said Mark Gill, president of marketing for Miramax. </P>
<P> The secular Catholic League, saying the film ``insults'' the church and its members, had threatened a possible boycott of Walt Disney Co., parent of Miramax. The group had asked that the release date be changed and that Disney disassociate itself from the movie. </P>
<P> ``We think their concern about the release date is valid,'' Gill said at a news conference. ``We clearly expected a debate but this was a total surprise.'' </P>
<P> ``Priest'' features five fictional priests, two of whom are sexually active -- one gay and one heterosexual. </P>
<P> Miramax is autonomous, Gill added, and Disney was not involved in the decision to change the release. Miramax has made films such as ``Pulp Fiction'' and ``The Crying Game.'' </P>
<P> Disney officials declined comment, refering queries to Miramax. </P>
<P> William Donohue, president of the Catholic League, said he welcomed the change in the release date but still wanted Disney to disassociate itself from the movie. </P>
<P> He said he contacted Disney chief Michael Eisner and would wait until next week to decide the group's next move. </P>
<P> Donohue also said he was angry about a statement Miramax released by the movie's director, Antonia Bird. </P>
<P> In her statement, Bird defended the film and said she had ''gained a huge respect and sympathy for Catholicism and the priesthood as a result of researching and making the film.'' </P>
<P> But she lambasted the Catholic League for what she called ''transparent attempts at moral blackmail'' and ``the blinkered, indeed totalitarian, view that the rest of us should share its assumptions.'' </P>
<P> The head of the Catholic group said Miramax's decision to release the director's statement ``shows they want to continue the war.'' </P>
