<P>  About 100 Operation Rescue activists interrupted their anti-abortion rally outside a clinic Tuesday to protest the jailing of illegal Chinese immigrants at the Orleans Parish Prison, police said. </P>
<P> The Chinese held in New Orleans and elsewhere fled their homeland because of government-mandated abortions and forced sterilizations, Operation Rescue founder and former national director Randall Terry told Reuters said . </P>
<P> Terry announced at a press conference in Washington, D.C., that he would organize protests in the capital April 18-19 to urge the Chinese be freed and granted asylum. </P>
<P> New Orleans police spokesman Sgt. Marlon Defillo said there were no disturbances at the parish prison or outside Gentilly Medical Clinic for Women, the group's first target for demonstrations. </P>
<P> ``Everything's been quiet, peaceful and wet,'' he said. The New Orleans area was drenched with several inches of rain Tuesday morning. </P>
<P> The Rev. Mark Vincent, one local demonstration leader, said, ``We're wet to the bone, but our hearts are full of joy.'' </P>
<P> He claimed it was not necessary to blockade clinic doors -- a move now illegal under federal law -- because five clinics including Gentilly were closed. </P>
<P> He credited the planned protests for the closings, but representatives at each clinic said they were open for business. </P>
<P> The protests are expected to continue this week. </P>
