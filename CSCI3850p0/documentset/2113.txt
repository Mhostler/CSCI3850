<P>  Testing for tar and nicotine in U.S. cigarettes may be due for an overhaul because the tests may not accurately reflect the way smokers smoke, a Federal Trade Commission lawyer said Wednesday. </P>
<P> Phillip Priesman, an attorney at the FTC's division of advertising practices, said statistics on which American cigarettes have the highest and lowest levels of nicotine and tar may not mean much. </P>
<P> ``There is some concern now that the numbers don't really reflect the way smokers smoke,'' Priesman said in a telephone interview. </P>
<P> The numbers are important because they can be used on cigarette packaging and advertising. </P>
<P> The FTC monitors the levels of chemicals in cigarettes, but the numbers are provided by the tobacco industry's laboratory and the tests -- done by machine -- do not duplicate some smokers' habits of compensating when they smoke a so-called ''light'' or ``low tar'' cigarette, he said. </P>
<P> People who smoke some of the cigarettes on the FTC's list of those lowest in tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide often inhale more deeply, take more puffs on each cigarette or cover up the filter, Priesman said. </P>
<P> ``Because of this controversy we have asked the National Cancer Institute to review testing procedures being used ... (and) to issue recommendations on how to do it,'' he said. </P>
<P> The cancer institute has agreed to hold a conference on the subject. </P>
<P> The FTC's annual report on the amount of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide in 933 varieties of domestic cigarettes, released Wednesday, relies primarily on testing performed by the Tobacco Institute Testing Laboratory, which is supported by the six biggest U.S. tobacco companies. </P>
