<P>  NATO Secretary-General Willy Claes said Friday he will hold talks next week with envoys from Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, Israel, and Mauritania on threats to stability in the Mediterranean. </P>
<P> He announced the meeting, to take place next Friday in Brussels, at a news conference at which he also stressed that his concern over Islamic extremism was not a ``battle'' by the Western alliance against the Muslim religion. </P>
<P> Claes said he would outline NATO's aims at next week's meeting and invite the envoys to present their concerns about ``the problems facing them.'' </P>
<P> It will mark the first step in NATO's proposed dialog with the five countries. An aide to Claes said ambassadors to Belgium from the five countries had been invited to the talks and confirmed they would attend. </P>
<P> Claes, who took up his post last October, angered several NATO members and Islamic countries after a German newspaper interview in which he was quoted as saying Islamic fundamentalism had replaced communism as a threat to the West. </P>
<P> He told the news conference his remarks had been misinterpreted and that he was referring to extremist violence. ``NATO has no quarrel with Islam and certainly no wish to conjure up new imaginary risks to Western security to justify its existence,'' he said. </P>
