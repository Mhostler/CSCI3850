<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A House committee Friday approved a bill to reduce the burden of government red tape on Americans, but deleted a section that critics said would benefit one publishing company. </P>
<P> The Government Reform and Oversight Committee sent the so-called paperwork reduction bill to the full House after chairman William Clinger, R-Pa., promised to hold hearings on the disputed provision. </P>
<P> The provision would have barred the government from using public information if any person outside the government had added to its value. </P>
<P> Critics said the provision was designed to help West Publishing Co., which dominates the legal publishing field and is involved in litigation with the government. </P>
<P> The Justice Department had asked that the language be removed from the bill saying it had been advocated by West Publishing because of unfounded fears that the department would take steps affecting its database products. </P>
<P> But in a letter to Clinger, Assistant Attorney General Sheila Anthony said the provision could allow West to restrict the government's ability to cite judicial opinions using West's citation system. It said the provision would give more rights to West than to other copyright owners. </P>
<P> Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., proposing that the language be stricken from the bill, said it involved ``hundreds of millions of dollars of profits for one company'' and said it had been promoted by lobbyists. </P>
<P> A committee official said the measure would have an impact on any company that took raw government information, added to its value and sold it to the public. </P>
<P> Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C., said the provision would erect ``a barrier in the (information) superhighway.'' </P>
<P> Clinger said he was willing to accept Kanjorski's amendment and would hold hearings on the issue next week. </P>
<P> In other action on the bill, the committee defeated an amendment by Rep. Cardiss Collins, D-Ill., to remove a provision that she said would overturn a 1990 Supreme Court decision barring the White House Budget Office from blocking regulations requiring companies to post notices to their workers of any toxic chemical used at the work site. </P>
