<P> Two planes were waiting in Port-au-Prince Wednesday to fly the two military men and some family members out of Haiti three days before exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was expected to return. </P>
<P> Both the United States and Aristide have asked Panama to take in Cedras and Biamby. Panama said it was studying the request and Shelly indicated that it was this arrangement that was causing the holdup. </P>
<P> ``I think as to where exactly they're going to go, I think that there would likely be an announcement coming out of the host country who would be receiving them, on whatever basis that might be,'' she said, without further explanation. </P>
<P> Shelly said the United States had not yet addressed the issue of whether financial assets of Cedras and Biamby would be unfrozen if and when they leave Haiti. </P>
<P> A formal White House announcement was expected shortly confirming that Secretary of State Warren Christopher would accompany Aristide and an entourage of supporters back to Haiti on Saturday. </P>
