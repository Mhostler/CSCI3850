<P>  A small Canadian company that helped give birth to the nation is enjoying renewed success after a return towards its historic businesses, including fur-trading. </P>
<P> North West Company Inc. still operates Canada's first fur-trading post at Waskaganish, on the shores of James Bay in Quebec. </P>
<P> ``They've done extremely well by focusing on their traditional markets,'' said Marie-Josee Privyk, an analyst with Marleau Lemire Securities Inc. </P>
<P> Waskaganish was founded in 1668 by North West's then arch-rival, Hudson's Bay Company. In a move typical of the two companies' intertwined history, North West recently acquired all of Hudson's Bay's ancient trading posts, including Waskaganish. </P>
<P> Based in Winnipeg, Manitoba, North West owns and operates 153 stores in Canada, 26 in Alaska and eight fur marketing branches -- stores that buy and sell furs from trappers. </P>
<P> They stretch across Alaska, the Northwest Territories, the northern prairie provinces and Quebec into Labrador and Newfoundland. </P>
<P> ``We think of ourselves as a northern retailer,'' said Gary Eggerston, North West's chief financial officer. </P>
<P> North West was founded in 1779 to compete with Hudson's Bay. Eggerston said the new company's business plan involved setting up a trading post 200 miles inland to intercept trappers on their way to the Hudson's Bay outpost. </P>
<P> ``So when North West put in a store, the Bay put in another one, and they leapfrogged each other further and further into the Canadian West,'' he said. </P>
<P> Many Canadian communities grew up around these outposts. </P>
<P> The intense rivalry continued for 40 years until 1821, when the two enemies -- claiming equal numbers of trading posts -- called a truce and formed a partnership. </P>
<P> North West continued happily as Hudson's Bay's fur division for a couple of centuries. But in 1987, as part of a company-wide restructuring, Hudson's Bay decided to sell its fur auction houses and its northern stores division. </P>
<P> A group of employees and private investors bought the division, and repatriated the North West Company name. In 1992, the company decided to sell some of its more ``southern'' stores to focus on its smaller, more remote outlets. </P>
<P> ``Our earnings have continued to increase,'' Eggerston said. </P>
<P> And earnings should improve as the benefits from recent renovations to older stores filter through the company and offset the costs of an expansion into Alaska, Privyk said. </P>
<P> Eggerston said the unusual nature of North West's business leads to an odd combination of goods on store shelves. Guns, snowmobiles, wedding dresses and video rentals are available in outlets averaging about 6,000 square feet in size. </P>
<P> ``We sell musical instruments, rifles for hunting, things required for people who live off the land,'' Eggerston said. </P>
<P> Often the only store in town, North West also cashes cheques and occasionally sells fast food through franchises. </P>
<P> North West also acts as North America's largest distributor of Inuit -- or Eskimo -- art, buying carvings from local artists and distributing them to galleries around the world from an office in Toronto. ``We are the largest distributor of Inuit carvings,'' Eggerston said. </P>
<P> While the company's earnings have improved since it sold the southern stores, its share price outlook is less rosy. ``The whole merchandising sector is out of favor now,'' Privyk said. ''If 1996 figures are strong, that might turn the stock.'' </P>
<P> North West's share price is languishing at C$11 3/4 after trading as high as C$20 on the Toronto Stock Exchange last summer. </P>
