<DATELINE>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Quebec Nordiques will not go 48-0. </P>
<P> Stephane Richer's second goal of the game broke a tie with 3:46 left as the New Jersey Devils handed the Nordiques their first loss of the season, 5-4 Thursday. </P>
<P> Bobby Holik fed Richer, who was parked in front, from behind the net and Richer put a wrist shot over the stick of Stephane Fiset for the game-winnner. </P>
<P> ``It's a big, big win for us,'' Richer said. ``It's a great effort from everybody. It doesn't matter if I score the winning goal or not.'' </P>
<P> It was Quebec's first setback after starting the season with five straight wins. </P>
<P> ``Obviously, we weren't going to go 48-0,'' said Quebec defenseman Craig Wolanin, a former Devil. ``Sooner or later we were going to lose one. There is a handful of teams in this league that are capable of winning when they are not their best, and they (the Devils) are one of them.'' </P>
<P> New Jersey, which erupted for five goals after scoring just six times in its first five games, earned its second straight victory after opening the season 0-3-1. </P>
<P> Quebec's Martin Rucinsky tied the game at 4-4 early in the third period with a wrist shot from the top of the left circle. John MacLean had given New Jersey a 4-3 lead 1:38 into the period. </P>
<P> Corey Millen put the Devils up 1-0 midway through the first period before Wendel Clark and Bob Bassen scored 58 seconds apart early in the second to give Quebec a 2-1 lead. </P>
<P> Bill Guerin tied it up 2-2 at the eight-minute mark of the second period before Richer's first goal of the game. Joe Sakic tied it up again for Quebec at 3-3. </P>
<P> In Boston, Ray Bourque scored his first two goals of the season and Bryan Smolinski tallied twice in a wild third period as the Boston Bruins held off the Ottawa Senators, 6-4, keeping them the only winless team in the NHL. </P>
<P> The Senators have five losses and a tie this season and have never beaten the Bruins in 13 meetings. </P>
<P> After Smolinski made it 5-3, Pavol Demitra tallied with 6:42 left to cut the deficit to 5-4, but Smolinski's second goal with 75 seconds left made the final two-goal margin. </P>
<P> Boston built a 4-1 lead on Bourque's two goals and scores from Steve Leach and Mariusz Czerkawski, but Alexei Yashin, Alexandre Daigle and Phil Bourque pulled Ottawa within 4-3. </P>
<P> In Winnipeg, Brett Hull scored with 88 seconds left in overtime to lift the St Louis Blues to a 5-4 victory over the Jets. </P>
<P> Winnipeg blew leads of 2-0 and 4-3 on its way to a fourth straight defeat. </P>
<P> Tony Twist of St Louis scored with 7:08 left in the third period to tie the score at 4-4. </P>
<P> In Philadelphia, Ray Ferraro's second goal of the game deflected off the glove of the Flyers' Garry Galley and past goaltender Dominic Roussel at 1:43 of overtime and lifted the New York Islanders to a 5-4 victory. </P>
<P> Ferraro had two goals and two assists and defenseman Scott Lachance also scored a pair of goals for the Islanders. </P>
<P> It was New York's second one-goal win over Philadelphia in two meetings this season and overshadowed Josef Beranek's first career hat trick for the Flyers. </P>
<P> In New York, Marc Bureau's shorthanded goal with 3:01 left in the second period gave the Tampa Bay Lightning a 3-3 tie with the Rangers. </P>
<P> Alexei Kovalev's second goal of the game seven minutes earlier had given the Rangers a 3-2 lead, but Bureau's goal brought Tampa Bay back for the second time. </P>
<P> The Lightning also erased a 2-0 lead that the Rangers built in the first period on goals by Steve Larmer and Kovalev. Peter Klima and Roman Hamrlik scored for Tampa Bay. </P>
<P> In Dallas, Sandis Ozolinsh's unassisted goal with 7:53 remaining in the third period lifted the San Jose Sharks to a 2-1 victory over the Stars. </P>
<P> The win was the fifth in a row for San Jose after a season-opening loss to St Louis. </P>
<P> Ulf Dahlen's goal at 10:24 of the second period tied the game at 1-1 for San Jose. Dahlen was making his first appearance in Dallas since being traded away. </P>
<P> Mike Kennedy scored for Dallas. </P>
<P> At Washington, Dominik Hasek made 33 saves for his ninth career shutout and Dale Hawerchuk scored the game's only goal as the Buffalo Sabres beat the Washington Capitals 1-0. </P>
<P> Washington got more than twice as many shots on goal as Buffalo, but was frustrated by Hasek. Last season's Vezina Trophy winner stopped 14 shots in the third period. </P>
<P> At Florida, Stu Barnes scored his third goal of the season and John Vanbiesbrouck stopped 22 shots as the Panthers stayed unbeaten against Montreal, tying the Canadiens 1-1. </P>
<P> The Panthers are 3-0-2 all-time against Montreal. </P>
<P> Kirk Muller scored on the power play for the Canadiens. </P>
