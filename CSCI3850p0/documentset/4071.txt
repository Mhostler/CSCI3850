<DATELINE>DALLAS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A regional group of the NAACP urged economic sanctions Tuesday against beverage maker Dr. Pepper/Seven-Up Cos., saying they have treated blacks unfairly in employment and business. </P>
<P> The Texas State Conference of NAACP branches told a news conference it had passed a resolution against the Dallas-based beverage maker and that it would submit the resolution to its national board for consideration and adoption at its annual meeting Feb. 18. </P>
<P> Among other things, the group seeks a $500 million ''financial parity package'' over five years. </P>
<P> The group said it had been monitoring the development of the merger talks between Dr. Pepper and Cadbury Schweppes Plc over the past six months. </P>
<P> The two companies agreed to a deal last week in which Cadbury, a U.K.-based confectionery giant, would pay $33 a share or $1.71 billion for the 77 percent of Dr Pepper it does not already own. </P>
<P> A Dr. Pepper spokesman said he had no immediate comment, as he had not seen a copy of the resolutions. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People branches wrote to Dr. Pepper's chief executive John Albers last Friday, asking for a meeting. </P>
<P> Shannon Reeves, regional director of the NAACP's Southwest Region, said Dr. Pepper had not answered the letter but that its general counsel had sent a fax to the NAACP's national headquarters, asking for its views about the regional request. </P>
<P> ``We considered that a blatant act of disrespect,'' Reeves said at the news conference. </P>
<P> Reeves, who said the Dr. Pepper action was one part of a new NAACP focus on an economic agenda, said blacks provide over 20 percent of consumer support for Dr. Pepper/Seven-Up brands, but that they receive less than five percent of the cash outflows from operations.  ``We only want what we put in,'' Reeves said, adding that the group is talking to Dr. Pepper bondholders. </P>
<P> Robert Starr, a member of the NAACP's 64-member board of directors, said at the news conference he has ``no doubt'' the national board will approve the resolution. </P>
<P> The group stopped short of calling for an outright boycott of Dr. Pepper products, saying it was currently in the process of educating consumers. But its members said this action should also serve as a warning for Cadbury. ``Welcome to the big leagues,'' Reeves said. ``But in the big leagues we only play one kind of ball, and that's hard-ball.'' </P>
