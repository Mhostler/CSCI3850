<P>  The Philippine government Monday tried to stop two U.S. lawyers from gathering evidence from Filipino torture victims as a squabble over claims to the fortune of former president Ferdinand Marcos intensified. </P>
<P> President Fidel Ramos' government petitioned a local court to stop the hearings being conducted in Manila by U.S. lawyers John Carroll and Kenneth Dang to determine compensation levels for victims of human rights abuses under the ousted president. </P>
<P> Solicitor General Raul Goco said the hearings violated Philippine sovereignty. He added that the disposition of the Marcos assets should be decided exclusively by a Filipino court. </P>
<P> Goco filed a petition hours after the two lawyers, appointed by U.S. Federal Judge Manuel Real in Hawaii, began taking the testimony of victims of military and police abuses during the Marcos years. </P>
<P> Judge Real's decision to send court-appointed lawyers to gather evidence in Manila ``is openly violative of Philippine laws,'' Goco's petition said. </P>
<P> In 1992 a Hawaiian jury found the Marcos estate liable for human rights violations in a class-action suit filed in Honolulu on behalf of an estimated 10,000 victims. </P>
<P> The jury awarded the victims $1.2 billion in damages but Real has proposed a $100 million out-of-court settlement so that the victims could get the money more quickly, their Filipino lawyers said. </P>
<P> Marcos was ousted in a popular revolt in 1986 and died in exile in Hawaii three years later. </P>
<P> The Philippine government has said it has priority in claims over the wealth Marcos and his associates allegedly stole from the people during his 20-year rule. </P>
<P> Government estimates of the disputed fortune range as high as $5 billion, including $350 million it says Marcos and his family stashed away in secret Swiss bank accounts. </P>
<P> Lawyers of Filipinos tortured or killed during the Marcos years said the victims deserve a share of the money. </P>
<P> As the Manila hearings began Monday, farmer Wilfredo Figuerres, 60, recounted to Carroll and Dang how Marcos police arrested his two brothers in 1980 and shot them dead because they were suspected of being communist subversives. </P>
<P> Lawyers for former first lady Imelda Marcos refused to take part in the hearings, saying only Philippine courts had jurisdiction over the Marcos estate. </P>
<P> A Manila court in September 1993 convicted Imelda Marcos of corruption and sentenced her to 18 years in jail. She is free on bail while the Supreme Court studies her appeal. </P>
