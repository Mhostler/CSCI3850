<P>  President Clinton, blamed by Ukraine President Leonid Kuchma for not providing more aid, will boost U.S. assistance to the former Soviet republic by $200 million, administration officials said Monday. </P>
<P> Clinton Tuesday hosts a state visit at the White House for Kuchma, who Monday complained at the United Nations about the size and speed of U.S. assistance for his country. </P>
<P> Administration officials said Clinton has approved an increase of $200 million in U.S. assistance over previous commitments to Ukraine -- half of it to help pay its immediate debts to retain its credit rating. </P>
<P> The remaining $100 million would be earmarked for providing technical assistance for the former Soviet republic. </P>
<P> ``They need an immediate transfusion of capital to stablize their financial situation,'' said one administration official. ''We have not done this kind of thing in the past. We are making an exception for Ukraine.'' </P>
<P> The decision raises the total amount of U.S. assistance for Ukraine to $900 million in 1994 and 1995 -- making it the fourth largest recipient of U.S. foreign aid. </P>
<P> Administration officials, who met with reporters at the White House to discuss the visit by Kuchma, defended the amount of U.S. aid, with one noting that Ukraine ranks as ``the fourth largest recipient of United States assistance anywhere in the world.'' </P>
<P> ``In this day and age, given the budget restrictions under which we operate, this is a significant amount of money and it shows you the order of importance of Ukraine in our eyes,'' one official said. </P>
<P> With the new Republican-controlled Congress taking over in January, Clinton faces a tougher task on foreign aid -- particularly with Sen. Jesse Helms, of North Carolina, a longtime critic of foreign assistance, becoming chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. </P>
<P> Israel and Egypt currently top the list of U.S. aid recipients, followed by Russia and other former Soviet republics in third place. </P>
<P> ``I regret that I have to say it from the U.N. rostrum: such a policy meets no adequate response,'' Kuchma said. </P>
<P> ``To date, Ukraine has not obtained the necessary compensation for tactical nuclear warheads already withdrawn, while the assistance under (U.S. law) is rendered very slowly and on the whole does not meet the fixed terms.'' </P>
<P> The administration officials stressed that the United States was urging the European Union to commit $100 million in balance of payment support. Japan also has been asked to contribute such funds, but officials declined to cite how much they would like Tokyo to pledge. </P>
