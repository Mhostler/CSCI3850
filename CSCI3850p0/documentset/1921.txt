<DATELINE>SHANGHAI, China (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Shanghai's leading dissident, Yang Zhou, has been sentenced to three years of ``re-education through labor,'' his wife said Tuesday. </P>
<P> Li Guopin said Public Securities Bureau officials informed her of the sentencing Tuesday morning. She told Reuters she would immediately start a 24-hour hunger strike in protest. </P>
<P> Yang, a founder member of the Shanghai-based Association for Human Rights, was detained earlier this year. </P>
<P> ``Re-education through labor'' is a form of administrative detention that does not require a court trial. Three years is the maximum sentence, although in practice it can be extended. </P>
<P> ``The sentencing is illegal,'' Li said. ``Authorities just want to avoid a public trial.'' </P>
<P> Virtually every member of Shanghai's small dissident community is now under some form of administrative detention, although Yang is the first to have been sentenced, according to families of the dissidents. </P>
<P> Yang was prominent in the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and an earlier round of pro-democracy agitation in 1978. </P>
<P> He has been in an out of jail for years and has angered Shanghai city authorities with his constant attempts to register the human-rights group legally. </P>
