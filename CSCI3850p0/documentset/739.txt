<P>  The party of former Guatemalan coup leader General Efrain Rios Montt leads the polls in congressional elections to be held here Sunday. </P>
<P> Local polls Friday showed that the Guatemalan Republican Front (FRG), led by the fundamentalist evangelical general, leads with 22 percent of the vote in elections called 15 months early in a bid to rid the Congress of corrupt deputies. </P>
<P> Human rights groups presented a list to the country's Supreme Court this week of more than 14,000 Guatemalans who were killed or ``disappeared'' after Rios Montt seized power in a March 1982 military coup. </P>
<P> ``We have a moral duty to remind people what happened during that period, there were massacres, killings and disappearances,'' said human rights activist Nineth Montenegro. </P>
<P> Even the exhumation of two mass graves containing the remains of hundreds of peasants killed by security forces during sweeps to root out leftist guerrillas in the early 1980s have not dented Rios Montt's campaign, say analysts. </P>
<P> But despite Rios Montt's bloody regime, people perceive him as a man who could restore order in a society that is tired of crime and corruption. His television advertisements, for instance, promise that he will crack down on crime. </P>
<P> ``Every time somebody's car gets stolen, a girl gets raped or a bus gets held up, that's another vote for Rios Montt,'' said deputy Jorge Skinner Klee. </P>
<P> The election for a reduced congress of 80 members was called after constitutional reforms were approved by Guatemalans in a referendum in January. </P>
<P> Polls show more than 51 percent of Guatemalans are undecided, and the abstention rate is expected to be high. </P>
<P> The FRG and the party of Guatemala's economic elite, the Party for National Advancement (PAN), which pollsters Multivex say will win around 17 percent of the vote, appear to have the most credibility with Guatemala's disaffected electorate. </P>
<P> Deputies from other parties have been involved in fights in Congress, corruption scandals and restaurant brawls. </P>
<P> While other parties, angry over President Ramiro de Leon's attempts to purge them, have boycotted legislation including tax reform and the renegotiation of foreign debt, the FRG and PAN have not opposed the government. </P>
