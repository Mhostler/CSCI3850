<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Deportation hearings began Wednesday for Belfast native Gabriel Megahey, who was convicted in 1981 in the United States on charges he shipped arms to the Irish Republican Army. </P>
<P> Irish activists such as Gerard Conlon, whose life inspired the movie ``In the Name of the Father,'' attended the hearing in New York, prepared to testify on Megahey's behalf. </P>
<P> Conlon spent 15 years in prison for a bombing as part of the so-called Guildford Four and was released in 1989 when a court quashed the convictions. The four had been convicted on the basis of confessions that were later discredited. </P>
<P> Former Member of Parliament Bernadette Devlin testified if Megahey were deported to Northern Ireland, he and his family would be in danger. One of Megahey's co-defendents was killed by masked gunmen. </P>
<P> ``There seems to be no reason why if Mr. Megahey returns that he would not be targeted,'' Devlin testified. ``That pattern is well-established.'' </P>
<P> She said Megahey also would face unemployment, harrassment and possible extradiction to Britain if deported. </P>
<P> Megahey was convicted in 1981 and spent time in prison in Wisconsin. </P>
<P> Conlon and Devlin said the case is part of a pattern of deportation cases being accelerated or reopened since the latest efforts at peace began between Britain and the IRA. </P>
<P> Devlin said Megahey is one of about 20 Irish activists in the United States whose cases have been reactivated. ``There seems to be a pattern ... Americans are seemingly digging up cases that must have six inches of dust on them,'' she said. </P>
<P> The first witness to testify on Wednesday was Megahey's wife Patricia, who said he was the family's main source of support. If he were deported, she said she would sell their house in New York and go with him to Northern Ireland, although raising their daughter there is ``a situation I don't even want to entertain.'' </P>
