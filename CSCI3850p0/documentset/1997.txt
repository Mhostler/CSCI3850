<P>  A judge removed himself Thursday from the trial of a police officer accused of sexually molesting his 12-year-old daughter, a day after he ordered the girl to jail for refusing to turn over her diary. </P>
<P> Broward County Circuit Judge Robert Carney stepped down in the face of an unusual alliance, as prosecutors and public defenders filed motions asking for his recusal, a public defender said. </P>
<P> The girl was taken from the courtroom in tears and handcuffs Wednesday when Carney found her in contempt of court and ordered her to spend five days in a juvenile detention center for refusing three times to hand over her diary. </P>
<P> The child was taken to the center and checked in, but the judge later allowed her to go home until lawyers appealed the contempt order. </P>
<P> Her father, a Fort Lauderdale police detective whose name is not being used to protect the identity of the child, is charged with five counts of indecent assault on a person under 16, for allegedly fondling his daughter during a six-month period. </P>
<P> ``She had turned to the adult system for protection from an adult who violated her trust, and the system incarcerated her,'' said attorney Howard Finkelstein, the public defender who sought Carney's ouster. </P>
<P> Finkelstein said the judge's stance had put the case in jeopardy. </P>
<P> ``This girl was completely traumatized,'' he said. ``She told me she would not walk into that courtroom with that judge again under any circumstances.'' </P>
<P> The child's diary became an issue in the case when defense attorney Michael Dutko learned of its existence during pretrial interviews and asked to see it. The girl has said it includes nothing about her father's alleged crimes. </P>
<P> A new judge will be assigned to the case before jury selection resumes, Finkelstein said. </P>
