<DATELINE>PRETORIA, South Africa (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  South African liberal theologian Johan Heyns was shot and killed at his home in a possible assassination by white rightists, police said Sunday. </P>
<P> The murder late Saturday night outraged political and religious leaders, including Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu and President Nelson Mandela, who had worked closely with Heyns to promote peace during the country's transition to democracy. </P>
<P> Police offered a $28,000 reward for information about his death. </P>
<P> A police spokesman said Heyns died instantly when he was hit in the head with a single high-caliber rifle bullet fired through the window of his suburban house near Pretoria as he played cards with relatives. </P>
<P> ``At this stage police are dealing with the case as if it were an assassination,'' the spokesman said. </P>
<P> Heyns, 66, was a respected theology lecturer who championed the anti-apartheid movement while leading the Dutch Reformed Church, the country's main Afrikaans church. </P>
<P> He aroused the hatred of rightist extremists by calling for racial reconciliation in the final years of white minority rule which ended with democratic elections last April. </P>
<P> Asked whether white rightists could have murdered Heyns, a police source said: ``Police will be investigating that angle.'' </P>
<P> A neighbor, David Strauss, who saw Heyns two hours before he was shot, told Reuters the theologian had previously mentioned threats to his life. He gave no details. </P>
<P> Mandela called Heyns a ``soldier of peace'' whose death was a loss for the entire country. </P>
<P> ``It is with shock and outrage that I've heard of the cold-blooded murder of Professor Johan Heyns,'' Mandela said, addressing Hindu leaders at a religious celebration in Durban. </P>
<P> Tutu said: ``The Anglican Church is deeply shocked at the brutal murder of Professor Heyns.'' </P>
