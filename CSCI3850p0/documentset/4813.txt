<P>  Major League Baseball Thursday awarded expansion franchises to Phoenix, Arizona, and Tampa-St Petersburg, Florida. </P>
<P> The new franchises, which will field teams beginning with the 1988 season, were selected by major league owners during their quarterly meetings. </P>
<P> ``It gives me great pleasure to announce that Major League Baseball has voted 28 to 0 to award expansion franchises to Tampa-St Petersburg, Florida and Phoenix Arizona,'' Executive Council chairman and acting commissioner Bud Selig announced at the Breakers Hotel, where the owners are holding their three-day meeting. </P>
<P> ``Major League Baseball is very excited to be moving into two such outstanding markets with two excellent ownership groups.'' </P>
<P> The Tampa Bay Devil Rays and the Arizona Diamondbacks, which will become the 29th and 30th major league teams, will pay an expansion fee of $130 million each, up from the $95 million paid by the Colorado Rockies and Florida Marlins in the last major league expansion in 1993. </P>
<P> The league and division assignments for the two new clubs will be determined at a later date. </P>
<P> Phoenix and St Petersburg were recommended by the Expansion Committee Tuesday night after the committee also heard presentations from an Orlando group and two groups that wanted to bring a major league team to northern Virginia. </P>
<P> Boston Red Sox owner John Harrington, who heads the expansion committee, said: ``Our committee members put a great deal of time and effort in deciding, first, whether to expand right now and second, where to put the new teams. </P>
<P> ``We strongly believe the time is right and these two cities clearly are the best choices.'' </P>
<P> Harrington said northern Virginia remained a strong possibility for futher expansion. </P>
<P> ``Northern Virginia appears to be a very good location for Major League Baseball,'' Harrington said. ``In the event of additional expansion, we will continue to look at northern Virginia, as well as Orlando.'' </P>
<P> Selig said they would consider adding more teams in the near future and said they are also interested in expanding into Mexico. </P>
<P> ``I expect the clubs will continue to consider expanding and it will take place sooner rather than later,'' he said. </P>
