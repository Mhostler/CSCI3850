<P>  Gabonese President Omar Bongo has instructed a lawyer to sue the French newspaper Le Monde for libel over a commentary it published on the trial of an Italian fashion designer charged with procuring prostitutes for him. </P>
<P> French lawyer Jacques Verges, whose clients include jailed guerrilla mastermind ``Carlos the Jackal,'' said Thursday that Bongo considered the article a ``serious attack on his honor and reputation and an insult to a foreign head of state.'' </P>
<P> ``President Bongo ... has engaged the office of Jacques Verges to file a libel suit,'' he said in a statement. </P>
<P> In an article starting ``The customer is king. Or president,'' Le Monde commentator Pierre Georges referred to the trial in Paris Tuesday of Italian fashion designer Francesco Smalto who admitted in court he supplied Bongo with call girls. </P>
<P> Smalto, prosecuted for aggravated pimping, said he flew the girls regularly from France to Gabon to ``accompany'' clothes deliveries to Bongo during 1992 and 1993. The prosecution said Bongo was Smalto's biggest customer, spending about three million francs ($600,000) a year on clothes from his firm. </P>
<P> Verges told Reuters the president considered Le Monde's commentary libelous because it gave credence to rumors, mentioned in testimony in open court, that he had AIDS. </P>
<P> He said the commentary did not mention testimony that one of the women had tested negative for AIDS on her return from Gabon. </P>
<P> Bongo was sworn in for his fifth five-year term as Gabonese head of state in January 1994. </P>
<P> The court was told that the president paid the airfare and also paid the women 15,000 to 80,000 francs ($3,000 to $16,000) for their visits. He occasionally sent his personal plane to Paris to transport them, according to testimony. </P>
<P> The prosecution requested a suspended prison sentence and a 300,000 franc ($61,000) fine on Smalto, 67. The court is due to issue its verdict May 16. </P>
