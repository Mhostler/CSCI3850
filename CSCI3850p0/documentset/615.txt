<P>  A ``good news'' radio station to give Rwandan refugees tips on aid, hygiene and how to reunite families dispersed by the civil war was going on the air in eastern Zaire Friday, organizers said. </P>
<P> The French press-freedom pressure group Reporters sans Frontieres (Reporters without Borders, RSF) said Radio Gatashya (the swallow that brings good news) would start broadcasting at 5 p.m. on 95 MHz from Goma in Zaire. </P>
<P> RSF said the 600-watt station should reach 1.5 million people in refugee camps in the northern Kivu region. </P>
<P> A 250-watt station is to go on the air in Bukavu to cover southern Kivu in the next few days. </P>
<P> The stations will broadcast information from relief agencies and personal messages three hours a day in three languages -- French, Swahili and Kinyarwanda. </P>
<P> They will carry messages from refugees looking for lost relatives and information on where to get drinking water, food and medicine and how to avoid epidemics. </P>
<P> The project was sponsored by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to counter hate broadcasts from a hard-line Hutu radio station that recently started transmitting anew from an unknown location. </P>
<P> Radio des Milles Collines (thousand hills), which had incited the butchery of minority Tutsis, has been off the air since July 17. </P>
