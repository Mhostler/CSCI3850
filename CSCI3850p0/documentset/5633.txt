<P>  Jury selection began Monday in the murder trial of migrant worker Frank Potts, who is charged with killing an Indiana teen-ager whose body was found on his 40-acre farm in rural northeast Alabama. </P>
<P> Potts, 51, who has been identified by police as a suspect in the deaths of as many as 15 other people, is charged with the death of Robert Earl Jines, 19. The murder warrant alleges Jines was struck in the head with a blunt object. </P>
<P> The discovery of Jines' body in a shallow grave on Garrett Mountain March 11, 1994, led authorities to begin a four-month search of Potts' rugged mountain property just a few miles south of the Tennessee state line. </P>
<P> Bloodhounds identified about 20 suspected grave sites but no other bodies were found. </P>
<P> At the time the body was discovered, Potts was jailed in Florida on charges of sexually abusing an 11-year-old girl and was subsequently sentenced to life in prison without parole for sexual battery. </P>
<P> Potts maintains he did not kill Jines or anyone else. He also faces an unrelated kidnapping charge for allegedly forcing a game warden to leave an area near the cabin on his property. </P>
