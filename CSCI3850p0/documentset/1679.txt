<DATELINE>TAITUNG, Taiwan (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Taiwan must boost its defenses in case of attack by China and is ready to repel an invasion, President Lee Teng-hui said as he inaugurated the island's biggest military exercise in a decade Thursday. </P>
<P> ``Only if we form strong military defenses will we have no need to fear the military threats of communist China, and only then can we move toward normalization of relations between the two sides,'' Lee said at the start of the one-day joint forces exercise near the southeastern port of Taitung. </P>
<P> Taiwan's locally designed Indigenous Defense Fighter (IDF) -- being used for the first time in exercises -- and American-made F-5E jets screamed overhead in a mock battle in a show of the island's newest defense technology and latest buying spree acquisitions to upgrade its defenses. </P>
<P> ``If we consider that communist China has the power to invade Taiwan, we should presume it could invade at any time and strengthen our combat readiness,'' Lee said. </P>
<P> Thousands of rockets fired from mobile launchers ripped across the sky in front of the viewing stand while rows of dozens of U.S.-made M-48H tanks rolled forward, firing at wooden target tanks lined up on the beach. </P>
<P> The Han Kuang 11 exercise involving 6,000 from the island's 500,000-strong army, air force and navy follows a large amphibious drill by China along its southeastern coast facing Taiwan. </P>
<P> Taiwan military officers said the Chinese exercise used Taiwan as its hypothetical enemy, and not the former Soviet Union as in previous such drills. </P>
<P> China, which has viewed Taiwan as a renegade province since the Nationalists fled to the island after losing the civil war in 1949, has refused to rule out the use of force to recover the territory. </P>
<P> Taiwan has been building up its military in recent years to try to find a military balance with China, but has said it would not take an offensive stance. </P>
