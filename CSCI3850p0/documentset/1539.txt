<P>  Former Soviet Ukraine, one of Europe's largest countries and among its most poverty- stricken, faces a massive surge in unemployment, the International Labor Organization said Thursday. </P>
<P> In a report prepared for a conference in Kiev next week, the United Nations agency said the Ukrainian economy was in deep collapse and more than a quarter of factory managers expected their firms to go bankrupt within a year. </P>
<P> Ukraine, an official summary of the report said, ``has the highest level of hidden unemployment in eastern and central Europe, the lowest minumum wage, possibly the greatest degree of poverty and the most alarming growth of open unemployment.'' </P>
<P> The vast state with a population of 52 million that became independent in 1991 was an industrial powerhouse of the old Russian empire and Soviet Union. It was also the empire's breadbasket, despite famines and political purges under communist rule. </P>
<P> But the ILO report, the most comprehensive study yet made of social and labor market developments since Ukrainian independence, found its economy had plunged into stagflation -- very high inflation combined with plunging economic output. </P>
<P> The report said restructuring or the switch to a market economy affected over one third of Ukrainian industry and firms covered in the study. The firms had released over 12 percent of their work forces in the past year. </P>
<P> ``Labor surplus has taken on chronic proportions,'' it declared. </P>
<P> ``Over 48 percent of all factories have resorted to putting workers on extensive unpaid ``administrative leave', a few more have put workers on partially-paid leave and a large number of other workers are on compulsory short-time working,'' the study added. </P>
<P> In 1991-94, the level of employment fell by more than 15 times the rise in registered unemployment. Only officially- registered job-seekers were counted and dismissed workers could not sign up for just under three months after they left, the report said. </P>
