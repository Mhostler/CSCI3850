<P>  Staff at a London hospital rushed to man back-up life support systems for 13 adults and eight babies after machines powering intensive care unit ventilators were tampered with, hospital managers said Saturday. </P>
<P> They said the prompt action of doctors and nurses ensured the patients were not put at risk during the 20 minutes that the ventilators at Guy's Hospital stopped working. </P>
<P> The incident occurred in the early hours of Dec.21. Alarms sounded after four electric machines housed in high security areas which power ventilators in the hospital's intensive care unit were turned off, police sources said. </P>
<P> In a statement issued Saturday, the trust which manages the hospital said: ``Essential engineering equipment was tampered with, resulting in the malfunctioning of that equipment.'' </P>
<P> ``The incident was contained by the quick action of nurses, doctors and department staff and no patients were put at risk. The hospital has put additional security in place,'' it added. </P>
<P> A 33-year-old unemployed man from south London appeared in a London court Friday charged over the incident and was remanded in jail, a police spokeswoman said. </P>
