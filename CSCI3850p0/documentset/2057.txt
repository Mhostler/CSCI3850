<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Jordan, feuding with the Palestinians over rival claims to Muslim holy sites in East Jerusalem, appointed a chief Muslim jurist Sunday for the disputed city. </P>
<P> Jordan's state-run news agency Petra said the Council of Ministers decided in its meeting Saturday to appoint Sheik Abdul Qader Abdeen, as Jerusalem mufti -- a professional jurist who interprets Muslim law -- to replace Sheik Suleiman al-Jaabari, who died last month. </P>
<P> Abdeen is currently the chief judge of the Islamic Sharia Courts in Arab Jerusalem, run by Jordan, which ruled Arab Jerusalem and the West Bank from 1950 until it lost it to Israel in 1967. </P>
<P> Despite the occupation, Jordan remains the legal guardian of Islamic shrines in East Jerusalem, which Israel annexed after the occupation and says is part of its eternal capital. Palestinians also want East Jerusalem to be the capital of their future state. </P>
<P> The appointment to the largely non-political post is the latest in a tug of war between Jordan and the Palestinian Authority running the Gaza Strip and the Jericho enclave since May. </P>
<P> Jordan, responding to Palestinian pressures, last month agreed to hand over all Islamic affairs and mosques to the authority but excluded Arab Jerusalem because of historic rights and for fear Israel might use the vacuum to flex its muscles. </P>
<P> The future of the disputed city will be decided in 1996 under a PLO-Israeli agreement. </P>
<P> The move was announced as Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres arrived in Amman to hammer out differences blocking a peace treaty with Jordan's King Hussein. </P>
<P> Palestinians were infuriated when Israel emphasized the monarch's responsibility for Jerusalem's Muslim shrines in a declaration it signed with Jordan in July ending a 46-year state of war. </P>
