<DATELINE>HOUSTON, (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A jury was set to begin deliberations Thursday in the first silicone breast implant trial involving chemical giant Dow Chemical Co. </P>
<P> Jenny Ladner, a cardiologist, and Gladys Laas, a registered nurse, are seeking actual damages of $33 million from Dow Chemical and its 50 percent-owned Dow Corning Corp. subsidiary for injuries they say were caused by silicone gel implants. </P>
<P> State District Judge Michael Schneider ruled last October that Dow Chemical could be a defendant in the case involving implants manufactured by Dow Corning. </P>
<P> The plaintiffs' attorneys said the outcome of the case may have an impact on how many women decide to participate in a $4.3 billion global settlement with breast implant makers. </P>
<P> Lawyers for Dow Chemical said in closing arguments Wednesday that their client is not responsible for the actions of its Dow Corning subsidiary, which it jointly owns with Corning Inc. </P>
<P> ``Dow Chemical was never in the silicone gel breast implant business,'' its lawyer, Richard Josephson, told the jury of six men and six women. ``Where, ladies and gentlemen, is the proof that Dow Chemical knew that Dow Corning was out marketing defective products and encouraged them?'' </P>
<P> Ladner's attorney, Richard Mithoff, said it was Dow Chemical that tested the materials, conspired with the manufacturer to keep marketing the product and reaped $250 million in sales of it. Dow Chemical lawyers put the sales figure at $20 million. </P>
<P> ``It was Dow Chemical, not Dow Corning, that created the market,'' said Mithoff in his closing argument. ``Dow Chemical made the money. Dow Chemical had the most to lose if things went wrong. Dow Chemical had the most to lose if the truth ever got out about the safety of breast implants.'' </P>
<P> The final arguments followed a 2 3/8-month trial. </P>
<P> If the jurors find that one or both of the companies were grossly negligent in making and selling the products, they will return to consider punitive damages, which are aimed at deterring similar conduct by other companies. </P>
