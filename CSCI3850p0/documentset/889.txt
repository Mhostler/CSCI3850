<P>  The United Nations will have to reconsider its billion-dollar a year operation in Somalia if rival factions fail to make progress towards reconciliation by the end of September, Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said Friday. </P>
<P> In the meantime the 18,760-strong U.N. force should be reduced by 1,500 troops immediately and then trimmed to 15,000 as soon as possible, Boutros-Ghali proposed in a report to the council. </P>
<P> The U.N. Operation in Somalia II (UNOSOM II), as it is called, needs a minimum 15,000 troops to carry out its mandate and still hope to complete its mission by next March. </P>
<P> It is the successor to a less ambitious U.N. operation set up in 1992 to help the Somalis battle mass starvation aggravated by civil war and the lack of any effective government. </P>
<P> UNOSOM II took over in May 1993 from an even larger United States-led task force deployed in December 1992, although the last U.S. troops did not leave until March this year after suffering casualties in clashes with Somali gunmen. </P>
<P> Boutros-Ghali said a key to national reconciliation would be a conference to resolve conflicts among members of the dominant Hawiye clan, to which the two main faction leaders, Ali Mahdi and General Mohamed Farah Aideed, both belong. </P>
<P> ``If ... no significant progress has been made by the end of September 1994, particularly with respect to the Hawiye conference, the Security Council will have to decide how much longer it wishes to maintain a 15,000-strong force just to provide some degree of protection to humanitarian operations and to United Nations and other international personnel.'' </P>
<P> The secretary-general said some Security Council members as well as many troop-contributing countries had made it clear they were not prepared to continue indefinitely their costly commitments, particularly in the absence of signs the Somali leaders were ready to assume responsibility for the proper running of their own country. </P>
<P> But if, as a result of a rapprochement between the Hawiye sub-clans, reconciliation could be achieved and an interim government established by the end of this year, there would be ``just enough time to complete UNOSOM II's mandate by March 31, 1995,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``In such welcome circumstances, there might even be a case for extending the mission...for some months, though not necessarily at its present strength.'' </P>
<P> Boutros-Ghali concluded that ``the United Nations should continue for a little longer to give the Somali leaders the opportunity to demonstrate that they are ready to cooperate with the United Nations and with each other in order to bring their country back from the abyss.'' </P>
<P> ``It is my hope that the Somali leaders concerned will realize that the nature and the duration of international support to Somalia depend very much on their own resolve to achieve political compromise,'' he added. </P>
