<DATELINE>SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Two people were killed and three wounded when two mortar shells exploded during an evening of heavy skirmishes in the besieged Bosnian capital of Sarajevo Monday. </P>
<P> The United Nations said inital reports suggested that two mortar shells had landed near the Gavrilo Princip Bridge close to a cemetery on the front line in the city center. U.N. officials could not immediately say who fired them. </P>
<P> Bursts of heavy machinegun fire could be heard across the city along with the noise of small arms fire exchanges. </P>
<P> ``Sarajevo has been quite active tonight with a great deal of fire around the Jewish cemetery area,'' U.N. spokeswoman Capt. Miriam Souchaki said. </P>
<P> One of those killed was a man born in 1978. The identity of the second was not immediately known. The three injured included two women and one man, hospital sources told Reuters. </P>
<P> Reporters on the scene saw lots of debris within a 60-yard radius of the blast, which shattered windows on surrounding buildings. </P>
<P> Sarajevo is a NATO-protected zone and heavy weapons are banned within a radius of 12 miles of the city center. </P>
<P> The capital has come under an increasing number of shelling and sniping attacks as a tattered cease-fire nears its expiry date on May 1. </P>
