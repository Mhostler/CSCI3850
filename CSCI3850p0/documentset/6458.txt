<P>  The Philippine government will open formal peace talks with the communist-led National Democratic Front (NDF) next month in Brussels, Manila's chief negotiator said on Thursday. </P>
<P> Howard Dee, head of the government negotiating panel, said the talks, originally set for June 1, were moved to June 26 to give both sides more time to prepare. </P>
<P> Talks aimed at ending the 26-year-old communist insurgency have long been planned but disagreements over venue, security arrangements for the NDF negotiators and other issues have delayed their start. </P>
<P> Another government panel is scheduled to sit down with representatives from the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) in Indonesia next month in the second stage of formal peace talks. </P>
<P> The MNLF is seeking self-rule for more than five million Moslems in the south. </P>
