<P>  The two major Kurdish groups in northern Iraq, long divided by factional fighting, signed a peace deal Thursday promising elections after a May census of the Kurdish region, the Kurdistan regional government said. </P>
<P> ``Today the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) announced a 14-point peace agreement to end the state of hostility and tension between the two parties,'' the KRG office in London said. </P>
<P> ``The two parties agreed on conducting a population census to prepare an electoral register before 19 May 1995, to be followed by a free and fair general election,'' it added. </P>
<P> Fighting between KDP and PUK factions, as well as religious groups from the Islamic Movement of Iraqi Kurdistan (IMK), erupted in the three Kurdish-controlled northern Iraqi provinces of Sulaimaniyah, Irbil and Dahouk in May and again in August. </P>
<P> The fighting jeopardized the democratic experiment in Iraqi Kurdistan, set up as a haven under Western protection after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's army brutally crushed an uprising in 1991. </P>
<P> Elections were held in 1992, which gave equal power to the KDP and PUK, but the two parties found joint leadership difficult to sustain due to dual decision-making and internal one-upmanship. </P>
<P> New elections were scheduled for next May, but little preparation had been made to lay the ground until recently. </P>
<P> According to the deal, KDP leader Massoud Barzani and PUK leader Jalal Talabani agreed to set up joint political leadership to oversee the agreement. </P>
<P> The present 50-50 rule will, however, continue until the next election, the KRG said. </P>
<P> The agreement, signed in Irbil, capital of the Kurdish-controlled Iraqi province of the same name, forbids the use of violence and arms to solve disputes and bans single parties from monopolizing political and organizational work in any region, as is currently the case. </P>
<P> The agreement proposes to widen the base of the de facto Kurdish government by including other parties in the administration, such as the IMK, the communists and minority parties. </P>
<P> The KDP and PUK will also determine government policy toward the Iraqi umbrella opposition group, the Iraqi National Congress. </P>
<P> ``The two parties pledged to work by this agreement until the end of this century,'' the statement said. </P>
