<DATELINE>KIRKSVILLE, Mo (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A man convicted of sabotaging a levy on the Mississippi River during a 1993 flood was sentenced to life in prison Monday. </P>
<P> James Scott, 24, of Fowler, Ill., said during a jury trial last month that he pulled a few sandbags from the levy but not enough to cause the massive break that eventually innundated about 14,000 acres and damaged a commerical area in West Quincy, Mo. </P>
<P> His motive for the action did not become clear during the trial. On Monday in state court Judge Bruce Nomile sentenced Scott to life, the maximum penalty for the charge of causing a catastrophe. </P>
<P> He also ordered that the life term be served consecutively with a 10-year sentence for a burglary conviction not related to the levy incident. </P>
<P> Scott's lawyer indicated he would appeal the sentence. </P>
