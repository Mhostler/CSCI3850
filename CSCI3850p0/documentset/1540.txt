<P>  Police in the Iranian holy city of Qom have beheaded 12,000 birds in crackdown on the popular hobbies of pigeon rearing and racing, a Tehran newspaper said Thursday. </P>
<P> The daily Abrar gave no explicit reason for the slaughter but said ``pigeon-flying on Qom rooftops...has created some problems for families in recent years.'' </P>
<P> ``No pigeon flies in the Qom skies -- 12,000 have been beheaded by the Qom police,'' it said. </P>
<P> The birds were collected from pigeon fanciers and bird shops in the city, the paper said. </P>
<P> Iran has many thousands of pigeon fanciers but their hobby is often regarded as a pastime of idlers. </P>
