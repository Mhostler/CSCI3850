<P>  A giant iceberg that is drifting northward in seas near the tip of South America could pose a serious danger to shipping in the region if it breaks up, Chilean ecologists said Thursday. </P>
<P> ``The movement of the giant iceberg toward warmer waters will cause it to break into numerous smaller chunks of ice which could cause unimaginable difficulties to maritime traffic in the area,'' Manual Baquedano of the Political Ecology Institute told a news conference. </P>
<P> The iceberg, which broke off recently from the Antarctic Peninsula, is 45 miles long and is drifting in freezing seas 620 miles from Cape Horn. </P>
<P> The ecologist said that huge icebergs will become an ever-increasing phenomenon in future years as the Earth's climate becomes warmer, melting Antarctica's ice cap. </P>
<P> ``Everything indicates we should expect (them) to increase in frequency,'' said Baquedano. </P>
<P> The average temperature in Antarctica has risen four degrees Fahrenheit since the 1940s, he said. </P>
<P> ``But more than a meteorological problem, the break-up of the ice cap is the result of the industrial model of development which is dominant throughout the world,'' said Baquedano. </P>
<P> Baquedano called on satellite stations to track the iceberg to provide information that could help reduce the dangers from the break-up of the ice mass. </P>
