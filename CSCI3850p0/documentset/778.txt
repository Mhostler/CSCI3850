<DATELINE>SAN SEBASTIAN, Spain (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Six people were arrested and some 50 others injured when radical Basque nationalist youths clashed with police during San Sebastian's annual ``Salve'' festival, officials said Monday. </P>
<P> Clashes between radicals and autonomous Basque police continued until late Sunday night after a procession through the city led by leaders of regional and local governments. </P>
<P> Nationalist groups, who support the Basque separatist group ETA, regularly attempt to disrupt the procession, the biggest event of the year in San Sebastian. The city is the capital of Guipuzcoa, the most intensely nationalistic of Spain's three Basque provinces. </P>
<P> The authorities said the clashes this year were on a smaller scale than in previous years, mainly due to heavy police deployment. They said most of those hurt only suffered minor injuries. </P>
<P> In separate incidents reported overnight, a small bomb exploded in a bank in nearby Renteria, causing minor damage and no casualties, and a car belonging to a Basque policeman was burned in the coastal resort of Zarauz. </P>
<P> ETA (Basque Homeland and Freedom), fighting for an independent Basque state, has staged a 26-year campaign of violence in which some 800 people have died. </P>
