<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Management and unions at San Francisco's two main daily newspapers were negotiating Monday in an attempt to reach agreement on pay and other issues before a midnight strike deadline, officials said. </P>
<P> Unions representing 2,600 employees at the San Francisco Chronicle and San Francisco Examiner last month set a strike deadline of midnight PST Oct. 31 unless a new labor agreement was reached. </P>
<P> Managers say they will continue to publish the newspapers without the unions if they strike. </P>
<P> The eight unions, including journalists, printers and truck drivers, have worked without a contract since November 1993. </P>
<P> Steve Chin, a spokesman for the Conference of Newspaper Unions, grouping the eight unions, said he was encouraged by substantial progress made in the negotiations over the weekend. </P>
<P> ``Neither side wants a strike,'' he said. But he said it was a question of whether both sides could reach agreement on all the issues in the time left. </P>
<P> In the first part of the talks, individual unions have been holding talks with management on ``non-economic'' issues such as management proposals to cut the jobs of 150 truck drivers. </P>
<P> Chin said management was currently in negotiations on non-economic issues with the Teamsters, representing truck drivers. </P>
<P> If agreement could be reached there, the talks would go on to discuss pay for all of the unions, he said. </P>
<P> Chin said newspaper managers were seeking a wage freeze. He declined to say what unions were seeking, but said they would not be satisified with a wage freeze. </P>
<P> Jim Hale, president and chief executive officer of the San Francisco Newspaper Agency, representing management at both newspapers, said he was hopeful about the negotiations. </P>
<P> He said management had reached tentative agreements with all but two unions. </P>
<P> ``We are negotiating now ... and I hope that we will be able to reach an agreement before the deadline at midnight,'' he said. </P>
<P> The San Francisco Chronicle, a morning newspaper, has a circulation of about 500,000 while the Examiner, an afternoon paper, has a circulation of about 130,000. </P>
<P> They are independent newspapers but publish under a joint operating agreement, combining some functions such as advertising. </P>
