<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The newly hired and fired historian of the U.S. House cried foul Tuesday over her dismissal because of nine-year-old remarks that Nazi and Ku Klux Klan views should have been included in a course about the Holocaust. </P>
<P> ``Let me say that the charges against me are slanderous and outrageous,'' she said. ``I have nothing to say at this time.'' </P>
<P> In a letter released Tuesday but dated Monday and timed at 9.15 p.m. EST, Gingrich requested Jeffrey's resignation from her new $85,000 a year job. </P>
<P> ``I sincerely appreciate your willingness and eagerness to assume the position of House Historian,'' the letter said. ''However, I do not feel that it would be prudent nor beneficial for you or your family nor for the House of Representatives to continue your employment at this time.'' </P>
<P> The letter wished Jeffery continued success in her teaching career and was signed ``Your friend, Newt.'' </P>
<P> At the White House, Press Secretary Mike McCurry said, ''It's hard to imagine how someone with those extreme views would have been considered in the first place, but the speaker quickly recognized that and made a decision that strikes us as appropriate.'' </P>
<P> Gingrich's Republicans took control of the House last week after 40 years of Democratic rule. </P>
<P> The speaker had hired Jeffrey -- an assistant professor at Kennesaw State University in Georgia, where he himself had taught before entering politics -- to replace Raymond Smock, who had headed the office since it was created in 1983. </P>
<P> At the heart of the Jeffrey controversy is a 1986 evaluation she wrote of a U.S. Department of Education-funded program on the Holocaust for junior high school students. </P>
<P> According to a congressional report of a hearing in 1988, Jeffrey, whose name was then Christina Price, wrote: ``The program gives no evidence of balance or objectivity. The Nazi point of view, however unpopular, is still a point of view and is not represented, nor are the views of the Ku Klux Klan.'' </P>
<P> Reports of her involvement in the matter surfaced Monday and prompted an outcry from major Jewish groups and lawmakers. </P>
<P> Gingrich spokesman Tony Blankley said Jeffrey served on a Department of Education panel that was set up to review a curriculum titled ``Facing History and Ourselves,'' but the panel rejected a $70,000 grant for the program because it was not balanced or objective. </P>
<P> Then-Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., investigated the Education Department's denial of funding for the program and Jeffrey's evaluation became part of the hearing. </P>
<P> Blankley said neither Gingrich nor his staff was aware of the incident before Jeffrey was appointed, because Jeffrey had married and changed her name since 1986. </P>
<P> ``No one was aware of it,'' he told Reuters Monday night. ''Newt just learned of the incident ... and upon corroborating those facts, has asked for her resignation this evening.'' </P>
<P> A spokesman for the World Jewish Congress praised Gingrich for moving swiftly on the matter. </P>
<P> But the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., told Reuters Tuesday the incident ``is sort of a metaphor of the first 100 days'' of the Republican Congress. </P>
<P> ``Making haste often leads to mistakes. There seems to be a sense of having to make everything happen overnight,'' he said. </P>
<P> Fazio said that if a new historian was being sought, it should have been an eminent scholar. </P>
<P> Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole said he thought Gingrich had nipped trouble in the bud, adding: ``I think he cut his losses, if there were losses, quickly.'' </P>
<P> In Georgia, Kennesaw State College said the college encouraged ``the faculty of Kennesaw State to present all sides fairly when controversial issues are discussed in the classroom and we do not assume that professors necessarily support or espouse the views they are presenting.'' </P>
