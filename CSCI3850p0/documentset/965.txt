<P>  Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama promised the Philippines Wednesday that Japan would take positive steps to show its remorse for the Asian women Japanese troops used as sex slaves in World War Two. </P>
<P> These would include the setting up of vocational training centers for Filipino women in general, Philippine and Japanese officials told reporters. </P>
<P> They were speaking after talks between the Socialist prime minister, here at the start of a four-nation Asian tour, and Philippine President Fidel Ramos. </P>
<P> Ramos welcomed Murayama's remarks as an expression ``of remorse and apology,'' the officials said. </P>
<P> There was no mention of direct compensation for the surviving so-called ``comfort women.'' </P>
<P> Japanese officials accompanying Murayama have said survivors must pursue any compensation claims through Japan's courts as the government believes it has no legal obligations to them. </P>
<P> The officials said Murayama had also promised that young Japanese would learn the truth about their country's wartime past. </P>
<P> ``The Murayama government is going to take some measures to deliver the true historical facts to the younger Japanese people,'' said Kishichiro Amae, deputy press secretary at the Japanese Foreign Ministry. </P>
<P> Philippine foreign affairs undersecretary Rodolfo Severino said: ``The prime minister noted that next year would be the 50th anniversary of the end of the Pacific war. He said it was important for Japan to face the past with respect to the countries of Asia, including the Philippines.'' </P>
<P> Japanese troops occupied much of Asia during World War Two, committing widespread atrocities against opposing armies and civilian populations. </P>
<P> About 30 former ``comfort women'' demonstrated near Malacanang presidential palace where Ramos and Murayama met, waving placards demanding individual compensation. </P>
<P> About 200,000 comfort women, most of them Koreans but also Filipinos, Chinese, Taiwanese, Indonesians and Dutch, were forcibly recruited by the Imperial Army during the war to provide sex for their troops. </P>
<P> The Japanese government repeatedly denied their existence until historians unearthed official documents linking the government to the practice. </P>
