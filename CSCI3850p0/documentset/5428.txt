<P>  Canadian police chiefs said Monday they support plans to force gun owners to register their firearms, despite a widespread backlash against the government's planned crackdown on crime. </P>
<P> The Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police said at a news conference that its members feel they have enough resources to enforce the proposed laws. </P>
<P> ``The Minister of Justice has assured us this new legislation will not take police off the streets,'' said Ontario Provincial Police Commissioner Thomas O'Grady. </P>
<P> In February, Justice Minister Allan Rock outlined a plan to force all gun owners to register their weapons. </P>
<P> The government also outlawed certain firearms and increased penalties for some crimes committed by people using guns. </P>
<P> Gun owners have said they fear the plan to register their firearms will be costly and will not cut down on crime. </P>
