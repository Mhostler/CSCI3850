<P>  U.S. Marines and warplanes gathered off Somalia will respond with heavy force if they are fired at during the final withdrawal of U.N. troops from Mogadishu next month, a U.S. military official said Thursday. </P>
<P> ``We not only have positioned a decisive force there ... we have also given that force rules of engagement which will allow it to have all of the self-protection that you would think they should have,'' the official told reporters. </P>
<P> The Marine force's commander ``has rules of engagement that allow him to respond with the appropriate level of force,'' added the official, who asked not to be identified. </P>
<P> He noted that Somali clan leaders had given assurances that they would not interfere with the withdrawal. </P>
<P> The force commander, Marine Lt. Gen. Tony Zinnis, arrived in the Somali capital Mogadishu by helicopter Wednesday from warships offshore that are carrying 2,500 Marines prepared to cover the final withdrawal of U.N. troops from the troubled African nation beginning in early March. </P>
<P> Another 500 Italian Marines are also aboard an Italian warship near Mogadishu and will be available if needed. </P>
<P> President Clinton in December offered U.S. forces to cover the withdrawal, and the U.S. military official said Thursday the cost to Washington would be $15 million. </P>
<P> ``The numbers I have heard quoted are in the neighborhood of $15 million for the overall operation. And they will be borne by the United States because this is a United States operation,'' the official added. </P>
<P> He said the final withdrawal would begin in early March and will be covered by at least 12 U.S. attack helicopters, six Harrier fighter jets, three heavily armed AC-130 attack planes and a yet-undetermined number of Marines who will go ashore. </P>
<P> There are currently about 8,000 U.N. troops from Pakistan, Egypt and Bangladesh remaining in Mogadishu, but only about 2,000 to 3,000 from Pakistan and Bangladesh will still be there when the final phase of the withdrawal begins under U.S. protection. The U.N. troops will be gone by the end of March. </P>
<P> Before the U.S. forces leave, they will take a number of American tanks, armored personnel carriers and helicopters that have been leased by U.N. forces in Somalia. </P>
<P> The official said the U.S. military did not expect any trouble because American negotiators had been assured by the clan leaders earlier that there would be no interference with the withdrawal. </P>
<P> ``We will stay clear of inter-faction fighting and not get caught in crossfires,'' he said. </P>
<P> But the three AC-130 aircraft, armed with heavy cannon and machine guns, ``are sitting alert today (in Mombasa, Kenya) in case something happens,'' the official added. </P>
