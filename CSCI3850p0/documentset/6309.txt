<P>  Palestinian police said Friday special patrols would be deployed in a week to enforce restrictions on political activities in Gaza mosques. </P>
<P> The patrols were another step in PLO head Yasser Arafat's campaign in the self-rule enclave against Islamic militants opposed to his peace deal with Israel. </P>
<P> Leaders of the Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas rejected the move. Some used mosque pulpits to make their protest against the self-rule Palestinian Authority (PA). </P>
<P> ``It would be better if these police patrols worked to get rid of corruption in the community,'' Sheik Ahmed Bahar, a Hamas leader, told Reuters. </P>
<P> Mahmoud al-Zahhar, another leader of the movement, told 3,000 people at Gaza's Palestine Mosque to shouts of ``Death and not humiliation'': ``We will not accept the policy of Israel to be imposed on us, it doesn't matter who implements it.'' </P>
<P> He called for an independent investigation into clashes in Gaza with police Nov. 18 in which 13 people were killed. </P>
<P> Zahhar said: ``We want to assert to the PA that the (Nov. 18) Palestinian massacre cannot be forgotten until every criminal will be convicted, otherwise we will take our rights with our own hands. </P>
<P> ``We are sending a clear message to the PA that if it wants us to bring masses into the streets we can. This is a symbolic protest only.'' </P>
<P> Gaza Police Chief Ghazi al-Jabali, who spoke to Reuters before Zahhar's mosque speech, said the patrols would begin work in a week. </P>
<P> The PA, under pressure from Israel to curb militants who attack the Jewish state, has forbidden political leaflets and posters in mosques. Jabali said Friday that political speeches were also inappropriate in mosques. </P>
