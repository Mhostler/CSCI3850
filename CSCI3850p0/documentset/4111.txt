<P>  British schoolboy Bjorn Borg, who suffered constant bullying because of his name, died after stepping in front of a train, an inquest heard Thursday. </P>
<P> ``They beat him so much, They didn't leave him alone until he couldn't move,'' Borg's mother Loudia said. </P>
<P> Bjorn, named after the Swedish tennis star, also suffered regular bullying, beating and taunting from his school mates because of his ethnic origin. His father is Maltese and his mother is from Iraq. </P>
<P> The 12-year-old died last September at Gillingham railway station in Kent, southern England. The North Kent coroner ruled the death as an accident. </P>
