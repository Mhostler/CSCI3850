<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.(Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Five Americans and a Russian aboard the space shuttle Discovery practiced Saturday for a rendezvous with Russia's orbiting Mir space station while officials from both countries discussed a potential obstacle to the close encounter. </P>
<P> The historic orbital rendezvous -- a prelude for future missions in which shuttles will dock with Mir -- remained set for Monday, despite a persistent slow leak in one of Discovery's 44 steering jets. </P>
<P> The talks on Earth were necessary because of Russian officials' fears that the leaky thruster would contaminate their space station. </P>
<P> Discovery commander Jim Wetherbee said Saturday that icy fuel was spewing from the thruster on the shuttle's back right side every 20 to 30 seconds ``like a geyser.'' </P>
<P> National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials played down the propellant leak as ``very small'' and said they were working to convince their Russian counterparts in Kaliningrad, near Moscow, that it was of little concern. </P>
<P> ``We have a relative degree of confidence that contamination would not be an issue ... but we have to arrive at that conclusion together,'' mission operations director Randy Stone said in a news conference at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. </P>
<P> Discovery was about 4,900 miles behind Mir early Saturday and gaining 207 miles with each passing 90-minute orbit of Earth. </P>
<P> If all goes according to plan, the crew will nudge their spaceship within 38 feet of Mir, close enough for Vladimir Titov to see his fellow cosmonauts waving at him from inside their station. </P>
<P> However, Russia's agreement with the United States -- intended to protect the aging space station's delicate solar power arrays from damaging exhaust plumes -- prohibits the shuttle from drawing nearer than 1,000 feet unless certain thrusters are operating to full capacity. </P>
<P> Though not directly involved in the rendezvous, the leaky jet is connected to a cluster of thrusters that are specified in the agreement. If engineers find it necessary to shut down the cluster to stop the leak, their actions could keep Discovery at the farther distance. </P>
<P> Stone said the former Cold War foes likely would settle on an interim distance of 400 feet. </P>
<P> NASA would be forced to sacrifice a practice approach to Mir's docking port. But at that distance, according to Stone, Discovery still could fly around the space station and complete a photographic survey as planned. </P>
<P> ``We have to ask ourselves how we would feel if the roles were reversed,'' Stone told reporters. </P>
<P> The leak, reported less than a minute after the shuttle reached orbit Friday morning, had dwindled to a half-pound of propellant per hour by Saturday. The propellant tanks that feed the jet contain more than 2,000 pounds when full. </P>
<P> Amid the rendezvous preparations, the four men and two women of Discovery devoted much of Saturday to scientific and technological work. </P>
<P> Early in the day, they launched several metal balls and rods that ground radars around the world will track as part of a calibration exercise. </P>
<P> Janice Voss and Titov, an Air Force officer who spent a year aboard the orbiting Mir, operated a small telescope on Discovery's outstretched robot arm for several hours to observe a fuzzy green phenomenon called ``shuttle glow.'' </P>
<P> The fuzz appears on the winged shuttle's leading edges as it slices through atomic oxygen in the thin, upper reaches of Earth's atmosphere. </P>
<P> The telescope was taken aloft to be deployed for two days of free-flying astronomy studies. </P>
<P> In her first news conference since takeoff, Eileen Collins, the first woman shuttle pilot, described Friday's midnight ascent as ``a real kick.'' </P>
<P> Tito, who escaped from an exploding rocket in Russia in 1983, did not appear as impressed. Asked to compare an eight-day shuttle ride with that experience, Titov deadpanned in English, ``It's okay.'' </P>
