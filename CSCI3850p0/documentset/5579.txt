<DATELINE>AUBURN HILLS, Mich.(Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Rookie sensation Grant Hill notched his first career triple-double Friday to help the Detroit Pistons to a 104-94 win over the undermanned Orlando Magic. </P>
<P> Allan Houston led Detroit with 25 points and set the club record for 3-pointers in a season with 128, breaking Joe Dumars' mark of 124. But Dumars also made his mark by sanking five free throws in the final 46 seconds to seal the victory. </P>
<P> Shaquille O'Neal had 31 points and 18 rebounds, but made just 5-of-16 free throws for Orlando, which played without injured starting guards Anfernee Hardaway and Nick Anderson. </P>
<P> The Magic used a 10-2 run to pull within 89-86 with 8:23 left. But the Pistons answered with a 10-2 burst, including four points by Hill, to build an 11-point lead with 2:17 left. </P>
<P> In Dallas, Jason Kidd recorded his second straight triple double and Jamal Mashburn scored 31 points as the Mavericks continued their run at the playoffs with a 111-94 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves. </P>
<P> Kidd had 10 points, 10 rebounds and 13 assists for Dallas, which had six players in double figures for the 11th time in 14 games to move within 1 3/8 games of Sacramento for the final playoff spot in the West. </P>
<P> Christian Laettner led Minnesota with 22 points. </P>
<P> In Chicago, Michael Jordan scored 28 points and Scottie Pippen added 25 as the Bulls posted a 97-88 victory over the injury-plagued Cleveland Cavaliers. </P>
<P> Toni Kukoc added 19 points for Chicago, which notched its season-high sixth straight win and improved to 7-2 since Jordan's return. </P>
<P> Bobby Phills scored 22 points and Mark Price had 19 for the Cavs, who have dropped six of their last seven games. </P>
<P> At Washington, Alonzo Mourning scored 25 points and Larry Johnson added 22 as the Charlotte Hornets handed the Bullets their 10th straight defeat, 98-93. </P>
<P> Hersey Hawkins scored 17 points and Muggsy Bogues added 15 points, eight assists and seven rebounds for the Hornets, who have won three straight games to move within two games of first-place Indiana in the Central Division. </P>
<P> Chris Webber recorded a triple-double with 23 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists for Washington. </P>
<P> In Atlanta, Steve Smith scored 21 of his 26 points in the third quarter as the Hawks rolled to a 102-90 victory over the Indiana Pacers. </P>
<P> Smith buried five of Atlanta's team-record eight 3-pointers in the third quarter as the Hawks handed the Pacers only their second loss in 10 games. </P>
<P> Reggie Miller scored 15 points and Sam Mitchell added 13 for the Pacers, who wasted an opportunity to move into a second-place tie with the idle New York Knicks in the Eastern Conference standings. </P>
<P> In Boston, Dominique Wilkins scored eight of his 31 points during a 14-0 third-quarter run as the Celtics tightened their grip on the final Eastern playoff spot with a 91-81 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers. </P>

<P> Philadelphia's Dana Barros scored 27 points and extended his NBA record for consecutive games with at least one 3-point basket to 50. </P>
<P> In Milwaukee, Glenn Robinson hit consecutive 3-pointers to trigger a key third-quarter run as the Bucks coasted to a 107-92 victory over the floundering New Jersey Nets. </P>
<P> Robinson finished with 25 points and Vin Baker added 16 for the Bucks, who had lost four of their previous five games but trail Boston by just two games in the struggle for the final Eastern Conference playoff berth. </P>
<P> Armon Gilliam scored 26 points for New Jersey, which has dropped six straight games and 10 of the last 11 games. </P>
