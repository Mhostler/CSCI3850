<DATELINE>EVERETT, Wash (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Russian President Boris Yeltsin visited the Seattle area Thursday on a mission to drum up trade and investment from the capital of the Pacific Northwest. </P>
<P> His first stop was the sprawling Boeing Company plant in Everett, 35 miles north of Seattle, where Boeing assembles its jumbo 747, 767 and the new 777 wide-body airliners. </P>
<P> Yeltsin flew to Everett at the end of a five-day state visit highlighted by his third summit with President Clinton, where the two leaders agreed to speed up the destruction of their nuclear arsenals. </P>
<P> The Russian president was given a tour of the plant, billed as the largest building in the world, by Boeing Chairman Frank Shrontz and other top company officials. </P>
<P> Among the things he was expected to see was a mock-up of a part of the international space state Freedom, in which the United States and Russia are major partners, which is being built at Boeing. </P>
<P> He was also expected to discuss possible aircraft deals with Shrontz and other Boeing officials as well as Russia's role in the space station project, for which Boeing is the prime U.S. contractor. </P>
<P> Yeltsin, who was accompanied by Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, also planned to address about 800 business and political leaders at a luncheon in downtown Seattle and then take a boat tour of the city's port facilities. </P>
<P> Before leaving Washington, Yeltsin told a post-summit press conference Wednesday night, ``I want to get to know the U.S. West Coast. I've never been there. I want to get to know Boeing, see how Americans live and work there, see what they look like.'' </P>
<P> Yeltsin's visit to the Seattle area, less than a year after 14 Pacific Rim leaders gathered in the city for an unprecedented summit, was the latest symbol of its growing role as a gateway for Pacific trade. </P>
<P> Both Aeroflot and Alaska Airlines now fly directly between Seattle and Russia, and two-way waterborne trade between Russia and the Puget Sound ports has grown to $193 million last year from $24 million in 1991. </P>
<P> That's just a drop in the bucket compared with No. 1 trading partner Japan, which racked up $16 billion in two-way trade using the region's ports last year. </P>
<P> But economists and business leaders see Russia as a market of huge potential, particularly given Seattle's location and its ties with the port cities of the Russian Far East. </P>
