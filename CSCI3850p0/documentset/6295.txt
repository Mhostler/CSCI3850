<P>  President Clinton's proposals to give authorities more resources to deter terrorism are not likely to expand police powers, Attorney General Janet Reno said Thursday. </P>
<P> ``This is a carefully crafted package that I don't think provides for any additional police powers,'' Reno said of the measures Clinton presented to Congress. She was speaking with reporters after a speech. </P>
<P> The package would make it easier for authorities battling terrorists to conduct electronic surveillance, obtain wiretaps and gain access to records from hotels, motels, storage facilities and vehicle rental facilities. </P>
<P> But Reno said it would simply make the power to battle terrorism consistent with other criminal investigations. </P>
<P> She called on individuals to speak out against bigots and hatemongers. ``Haters are most often cowards. They too often count on us to be silent,'' she said. </P>
<P> ``We must make those who deal in hate and violence and bigotry unwelcome in our communities, in our neighborhoods, in our towns,'' she said. </P>
<P> Reno was in Cleveland for the 50th anniversary of the city's Community Relations Board, one of the first government agencies in the nation formed to address race relations. </P>
<P> Reno said Americans should work together to improve their communities and neighborhoods, particularly for children. </P>
<P> Individuals and communities should strive to give children ''parents old enough, wise enough and financially able enough to take care of them,'' as well as medical care, child care programs, a good education and freedom from domestic violence, Reno said. </P>
