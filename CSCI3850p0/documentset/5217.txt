<P>  Kim Jong-il, long-designated heir of North Korea, will soon officially take over the posts held by his father, Kim Il-sung, who died last July, a senior Chinese official said on Monday. </P>
<P> ``When Kim Jong-il will come to power is North Korea's internal affair but the power succession will soon be carried out,'' Li Shuzheng, head of external liaison for the Chinese Communist Party, told reporters after his arrival in Seoul. </P>
<P> Li said the North Korean military was under full control of Kim Jong-il and the political situation was stable. </P>
<P> Kim Jong-il has been de facto leader of North Korea since his father's death last July, but he has yet to be officially confirmed in the key posts of the ``great leader,'' head of state and chief of the ruling Workers' Party, to accomplish communism's first dynastic succession. </P>
<P> Li, who has ministerial level status in the Chinese hierarchy, is in Seoul at the invitation of South Korea's ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) for a week-long trip, a DLP official said. </P>
<P> He said Li would meet DLP leaders for talks on improving bilateral parliamentary relations and hold talks with Seoul government officials and leading businessmen on promoting ties between the two nations. </P>
<P> Yonhap agency quoted Li as saying he was convinced President Jiang Zemin would visit Seoul this year for talks with his South Korean counterpart, Kim Young-sam. </P>
