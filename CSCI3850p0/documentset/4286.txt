<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The House voted Friday to give states $10.5 billion to build more prisons, provided they keep violent criminals behind bars longer, and to make federal prison conditions tougher. </P>
<P> The House clampdown means prison movie screens will show only family fare. </P>
<P> Also banned in federal prisons will be weight-training, premium cable TV channels with movies, pornographic materials, miniature golf, televisions and coffee pots in cells, personally owned computers and modems, expensive electronic musical instruments and movies rated NC-17, R or X. </P>
<P> ``Some criminals have come to view jail as an almost acceptable lifestyle because amenities are better for them on the inside than on the outside. You should pay the price for your crime, not be rewarded with a vacation watching premium cable on your personal TV,'' said Rep. Dick Zimmer, R-N.J., sponsor of the no-frills amendment. </P>
<P> The prison construction measure passed on a vote of 265 to 156, the fourth in a series of bills sponsored by the new Republican leadership aimed at rewriting the hard-fought crime package that passed the Democratic-led Congress last year. </P>
<P> It boosts the money for prison construction to $10.5 billion over five years from $8.0 billion approved last year. But Republicans added strings to the money. </P>
<P> To qualify for the funds, states must show that violent criminals serve 85 percent of the time in prison to which they were sentenced. The 1994 prison funds passed under Democratic leadership did not contain this requirement. </P>
<P> The bill also reimburses states for the cost of imprisoning illegal aliens, estimated at about $650 million. The money would mainly go to Texas, California, New Mexico and Arizona. </P>
<P> The prison construction bill passed over the objections of the Justice Department, which charged that no states would be eligible for the federal funds because none would meet the sentencing rules. </P>
<P> ``This bill says it's tougher, but it misfires and would actually put fewer criminals behind bars. When it comes to locking up criminals, (the crime bill) isn't tough on crime, it's tough on states,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said. </P>
<P> Reno said it would take years for states to show that prisoners had spent the required time in jail. </P>
<P> But Rep. Bill McCollum of Florida, chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on crime, said it was not a mandate but an option for states. </P>
<P> ``Change your laws and you get the money. Don't change your laws, and the money is not there,'' he said during the debate. </P>
<P> The House then quickly passed a non-controversial fifth crime bill on a vote of 380 to 20 to require deportation proceedings be started immediately when an illegal alien is sentenced to prison. Currently, deportation measures begin when the prisoner is released and this can take years. </P>
<P> Democrats are expected to put up a major fight next week when the Republican majority moves to take $10 billion approved last year for more police and give it to states as a block grant to spend as they choose on law enforcement. </P>
<P> A group of Democratic women members of Congress said they will also seek to have the money spent to pay local law enforcement agencies for providing security at abortion clinics. </P>
