<P>  Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide met with journalists Wednesday and asked them to help him get the government's message across to the Haitian people. </P>
<P> One day before leaving for Miami to attend the Summit of the Americas, Aristide called on the members of the media gathered at the National Palace to ``tell the truth to the Haitian people without fear.'' </P>
<P> Aristide held a moment's silence for reporters killed or injured by the army during the three years of military rule. </P>
<P> The military regime that toppled Aristide in September 1991 was ousted in October, allowing Aristide to returned to power Oct. 15. His meeting with reporters was the latest in a series of encounters with sectors of Haitian society aimed at fostering reconciliation in the divided nation. </P>
<P> Prompted by reporters' questions, Aristide addressed several topics such as the relative lack of women in the business, the role of the Information Ministry and the sorry state of communications in the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation. </P>
<P> Earlier Wednesday Aristide formally installed Clausel Debrosses as new president of the country's Supreme Court. </P>
<P> At the ceremony at the presidential palace, Aristide said he hoped within 24 hours to take another step toward legislative elections. The president said his government was working on a deal with parliament to choose an electoral council, a first step toward organizing the crucial ballots. </P>
<P> The elections for more than 2,000 officials were supposed to have taken place this month, but have been postponed until March. </P>
