<DATELINE>LONDON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Police battled opponents of a new law and order bill in central London Sunday after what organizers said was Britain's biggest civil rights march. </P>
<P> Rioters hurled bottles and cans at police equipped with shields, helmets and clubs in exclusive Park Lane alongside Hyde Park, where the march ended. </P>
<P> They demolished a bus shelter, burned rubbish and fought off police charges after hundreds of people refused to disperse. Police arrested at least 16. </P>
<P> Organizers said 100,000 people had turned out to call for the Criminal Justice Bill to be scrapped before it becomes law this month. Police estimated there were 20,000. </P>
<P> The bill weakens a defendant's traditional right to silence and tightens the law to prevent squatting. </P>
<P> It also gives police new powers to deal the phenomenon of ''New Age travelers'' -- hippies and other dropouts who roam the countryside and are often in conflict with local people. Police will be able to break up groups of more than nine. </P>
<P> Police will also be able to break up so-called ``rave'' parties that go on all night, often in rented warehouses. </P>
<P> Speakers told the rally the bill would curb civil rights. Unions, civil liberties and environment groups and political parties other than the ruling Conservatives were represented, as were groups like the Lesbian Avengers and the mystical Druid Clan of Dana. </P>
