<P>  Iran Thursday rejected a call by the United Nations refugee agency for it to move thousands of Iraqi refugees away from areas bordering Iraq. </P>
<P> An interior ministry official in charge of refugee affairs was quoted by Tehran radio as saying the call by the United Nations High Comissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was ``irresponsible.'' </P>
<P> ``It has been our consistent policy to accept refugees... However, decisions about their settlement and their geographic location belong solely to...Iran, and have nothing to do with the duties and responsibilities of the UNHCR,'' the radio quoted the official as saying. </P>
<P> The radio said Iran was reacting to remarks by Pierre Jambor, head of the UNHCR mission in Tehran, to Reuters Monday. </P>
<P> Jambor had told Reuters the UNHCR was concerned about 4,000 Iraqi Shi'ite refugees many of whom were sick due to lack of hygiene and sufficient shelter. </P>
<P> UNHCR had asked Iran to resettle the refugees in areas away from the border with Iraq, he said. </P>
<P> ``We have not yet received any response from Iranian officials but we expect that this group will be moved to proper camps soon, as another 8,000 refugees were resettled recently,'' he said. </P>
<P> Iran, recognized by the UNHCR as the country sheltering the highest number of refugees in the world, has been critical of international bodies for the low level of support it gets for its refugee programs. </P>
<P> Tehran said in December it had received a ``paltry'' $150 million in overseas aid for refugees while some Western countries with a much smaller number of refugees had secured more than $1 billion. </P>
