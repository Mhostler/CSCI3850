<P>  British doctors mistakenly implanted the wrong embryos in two mothers undergoing test-tube fertility treatment, a government watchdog body admitted Monday. </P>
<P> But the Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority (HFEA), which licenses British test-tube baby clinics, said the mistake was realized quickly and neither case resulted in a birth. </P>
<P> It also denied press reports that up to 100 embryos had been implanted in the wrong women, saying it was ``pure speculation.'' </P>
<P> ``We are aware of only two cases since 1984-85 in about 100,000 test-tube fertilizations in Britain and neither resulted in pregnancy,'' said Ben Plumley, a HFEA spokesman. </P>
<P> He added HFEA inspectors had investigated both cases and set up improved procedures for matching the mothers and embryos. </P>
<P> In Britain, 67 clinics are licensed to perform in-vitro fertilizations, in which sperm and egg are united in a test tube and the resulting embryo is implanted into the mother. </P>
<P> Plumley said doctors are allowed to implant only three embryos per treatment to reduce the risk of multiple births. </P>
