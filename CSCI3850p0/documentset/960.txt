<P>  President Alberto Fujimori said Tuesday night that he was stripping his wife, Susana Higuchi, of her official functions as Peru's first lady, a position she has used to openly criticize his government. </P>
<P> ``I have decided to separate my wife from her functions as first lady,'' Fujimori said in a televised address to the nation. </P>
<P> ``From now on, Mrs Higuchi can carry out her political activities in open opposition to the government when and where she pleases, like any citizen, but not as first lady,'' he added. </P>
<P> Fujimori has been visibly affected by public statements by Higuchi, from whom he has been living apart since her public protest this month over an electoral law that bans her from seeking office and criticizing his rule. </P>
<P> Higuchi, who uses her maiden name, has made ``generalized and vague accusations'' of corruption in Fujimori's government which generate uncertainty and damage the country's image abroad, the president said. </P>
<P> Higuchi, who prefers to use her maiden name, is responsible for running the Foundation for the Children of Peru. </P>
<P> The president, who for the last two weeks has been sleeping in Peru's army headquarters known as the ``Little Pentagon'' with three of their four children, made no reference to the presidential couple's marital status. </P>
<P> Higuchi in early August publicly voiced her protest against an article of Peru's electoral law which bans her from seeking office in next April's general elections, saying it violated Peru's new constitution. </P>
<P> In subsequent interviews, she said she might consider running for president in order to challenge the constitutionality of the law. </P>
<P> But she also gave voice to allegations that some government ministers appeared to be involved in cases of corruption. </P>
<P> Fujimori, who like his wife is the son of Japanese immigrants, said Higuchi was employing tactics characteristic of ``most die-hard opposition politicians'' and called her attitude ``totally incomprehensible.'' </P>
