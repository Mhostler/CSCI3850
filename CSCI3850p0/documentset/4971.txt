<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams met President Clinton for the first time Thursday and the two had what Adams called a positive and cordial talk. </P>
<P> Adams, who heads the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, has been a focus of Clinton's drive to advance the peace process in Northern Ireland. He told reporters after the meeting that he had commended Clinton for his efforts. </P>
<P> The meeting, said by Adams to have lasted four or five minutes, took place at a St Patrick's Day lunch hosted by House Speaker Newt Gingrich at which Irish Prime Minister John Bruton was guest of honor. </P>
<P> ``The engagement was positive, was cordial,'' Adams said. </P>
<P> Both Bruton and Adams are to attend a St Patrick's Day party at the White House Friday. </P>
<P> Clinton has taken a high profile role in seeking to advance Northern Ireland peace. After allowing Adams to visit the United States last year, he moved further last week by allowing the Sinn Fein leader to undertake fund raising here. </P>
<P> His move, popular among the politically important Irish-American community, caused irritation in London and reports in the British press that the transatlantic ``special relationship'' was dead. But the Irish government sees the moves as advancing the peace process. </P>
<P> At the White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters Clinton would have a telephopne talk with British Prime Minister John Major this weekend to discuss Northern Ireland, the Middle East peace process and other issues. </P>
<P> ``I don't know that they'll spend much time talking about Gerry Adams. I mean that will be over and done with at that point,'' said McCurry, who has previously appeared to dismiss London concerns at Clinton's Northern Ireland involvement. </P>
<P> Rep Peter King, a New York Republican, accompanying Adams at a news conference after the lunch, said spontaneous applause erupted when Adams and Clinton shook hands. </P>
<P> He said Clinton at one point raised his fist in the air and said, ``This is going to work.'' </P>
<P> Adams told reporters that Clinton did not talk about the decommissioning of IRA weapons and did not expect to discuss this at the White House Friday. </P>
<P> He said that all weapons, in the hands of the IRA, the unionists and the British army, had to be removed. </P>
<P> ``It means a total demilitarization of the situation,'' he said. </P>
<P> He said his party was poised to enter into talks with the British government at ministerial level but Britain had banned ministerial contact with the Sinn Fein. </P>
<P> ``I would appeal to Mr Major ... to start real peace talks,'' he said. </P>
<P> At a House hearing Wednesday, Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke said Clinton had ``taken a risk'' by allowing Sinn Fein fund-raising. </P>
<P> ``The ball is in their court now to show that they are serious about removing the gun from the political arena in Northern Ireland,'' he said. </P>
<P> The St. Patrick's Day lunch, an annual event, took place in a stately wood-panelled room in the Capitol a few feet from the chamber of the House of Representatives. About 50 guests, many of them members of Congress of Irish descent, attended. </P>
<P> Bruton sat between Gingrich and Clinton. Guests at their table included former House Speaker Thomas Foley and former Republican Leader Robert Michel. </P>
<P> Adams sat at another table between House Republican Whip Tom DeLay of Texas and Rep King. </P>
<P> Although the dinner was private the press was allowed in briefly. Reporters heard Irish tenor Mark Forrest sing ``Danny Boy'' -- and watched Bruton and Foley sing quietly along with him. </P>
<P> Gingrich presented Bruton with a china bowl he said contained peanuts from his home state of Georgia. Bruton, amid laughter, gave Gingrich an 1840 Irish book on welfare reform - a Republican priority. </P>
