<P>  A powerful regional chief in Russia's Far East was quoted on Tuesday as saying he would oppose plans by Moscow to cede territory to China. </P>
<P> A border agreement signed in 1991 would surrender to China 15 square km (5 3/8 sq miles) of territory. </P>
<P> But Yevgeny Nazdratenko, governor of the Maritime region bordering China, was quoted in a newspaper interview as saying he would not comply with the pact. </P>
<P> ``As long as I remain governor, I shall not cede a single metre of land,'' he told the newspaper Trud. </P>
<P> ``I serve Russia and its interests. In this I am supported not only by people in the Far East,'' he said. </P>
<P> The pact was intended to end a dispute under which China claimed back three tiny strips of land seized by the Soviet Union in the mid-1930s on the 4,300-km (2,700-mile) border. </P>
<P> Only last month, Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev told Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen during a visit to Beijing that Moscow would stand by the agreement on demarcating the border. </P>
<P> Nazdratenko, President Boris Yeltsin's appointee in the region, took particular exception over cession of Lake Hasan under the demarcation treaty. </P>
<P> The locality, where the tip of Russia meets China and North Korea, was the scene of a major battle between Soviet forces and Japanese troops in July and August 1938. </P>
<P> ``Now it is being suggested that border posts be shifted, leaving abroad the graves of Soviet soldiers who gave their lives in fighting for Lake Hasan,'' he said. </P>
<P> At the height of ideological confrontation between Russia and China in the late 1960s, Beijing sought back a huge swathe of Soviet territory. </P>
<P> Post-communist Russia now seeks stable relations with Beijing and is keen to avoid fresh friction with a partner which provides a huge market for its industries. </P>
