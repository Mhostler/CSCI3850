<DATELINE>CHEQUERS, England (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  British Prime Minister John Major and Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds said Monday they had narrowed their differences on a key document outlining a political solution for Northern Ireland's future. </P>
<P> Speaking after three hours of talks at Major's country residence Chequers, northwest of London, they declined to put a deadline on when the so-called ``framework document'' would be ready or to detail the remaining stumbling blocks. </P>
<P> Reynolds told reporters: ``The gap is narrower today than it was yesterday.'' </P>
<P> Major and Reynolds, partners in a push to cement peace after rival guerrillas halted 25 years of violence, said they were confident of producing an agreement that would satisfy not only the two governments but also the Protestant and Catholic communities in the British-ruled province. </P>
<P> ``There's a tangible will for this to succeed among the people of Northern Ireland,'' Major said. </P>
<P> Both leaders said they would not drag their feet but neither would they be rushed into a hasty agreement that could unravel with time. </P>
<P> The peace process has quickened since truces were declared in September by the Irish Republican Army (IRA), which was battling to oust Britain from Northern Ireland, and two weeks ago by Protestant guerrillas fighting to retain British links. </P>
<P> Ireland has in the past been critical of what it has seen as Britain's over-cautious approach to the IRA cease-fire. But Reynolds dismissed media suggestions that today's meeting was a ``do or die'' showdown. </P>
<P> ``The balance we strike at the end of the day will decide if we can get the accommodation between the two communities that will carry them through in the years ahead,'' Reynolds said. </P>
<P> ``We have made progress, we will make progress, and I'm confident we will reach a conclusion. But we will take it in our own time to be certain we've got it right,'' Major added. </P>
<P> The two leaders agreed to order their officials to study the logistics of collecting guerrillas' redundant weapons. </P>
<P> ``This process cannot succeed if the arms are still out in the communities,'' Reynolds said. </P>
<P> Major, who said Friday he would start talks with the IRA's political allies by Christmas, described the framework document not as a blueprint for all-party talks but ``our joint understanding of what is most likely to secure widespread acceptance by the parties.'' </P>
<P> Officials have said the key sticking points include the form of cross-border institutions between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. The two sides must strike a balance between Catholic republicans in the north who want to see the province reunited with Ireland and pro-British Protestants worried that cross-border agencies could mark a start of British withdrawal. </P>
<P> Meanwhile, the British army said Monday it had scaled down operations in parts of Northern Ireland. </P>
<P> The army has reduced its visible presence in the counties of Londonderry and Tyrone, predominantly pro-Irish Catholic districts, but stressed that the number of troops in the British-ruled province was not being cut. </P>
<P> Some 18,500 troops are in the province, where they act in support of the Royal Ulster Constabulary police. </P>
