<P>  The former interim head of the Haitian armed forces has been appointed military attache to Brazil, a local radio station, citing unnamed army sources, said Thursday. </P>
<P> Radio Metropole said Jean-Claude Duperval, the general replaced as commander-in-chief two weeks ago, would be joined in South America by other top officers. </P>
<P> Brig. Gen. Max Mayard was named military attache in Ecuador, Col. Marc Valmond was appointed to Colombia and navy commander Col. Charles Andre was sent to Belgium, Metropole said. </P>

<P> All the senior officers who led the country during three years of military rule have either fled into exile or been transferred outside Haiti. </P>
