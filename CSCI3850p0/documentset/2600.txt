<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Clinton, struggling to regain his footing since last week's election setbacks, Monday tried to shift the focus to Asian security as he and other leaders gathered here for an economic summit. </P>
<P> But the political upheaval that brought a Republican takeover of Congress and put Clinton's own Democrats in the minority kept creeping into discussions the president held with some of the most powerful leaders in the region. </P>
<P> The power structure change in the new Congress to be seated in January was raised in talks between Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama. </P>
<P> In opening remarks to Clinton during a bilateral session on the eve of the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, the prime minister made a point of saying he had been reassured by Americans following the elections that there would be no change in American foreign policy. </P>
<P> Clinton joked that last year it was the American government that was being reassured by a new Japanese government about the continuity of policy and now positions were reversed, officials said. </P>
<P> The president's political woes also drifted into the discussions with Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating Monday, officials said. </P>
<P> ``When two practicing politicians get together they talk about each their own politics ... they compare notes,'' an administration official said. ``It wasn't in the context of reassurance about continuity, they were talking about politics.'' </P>
<P> Talks were also overshadowed by a group of East Timor demonstrators who been staging a protest against the Indonesian government on U.S. embassy grounds after scaling the walls Saturday. </P>
<P> Clinton said at a news conference that the Indonesian government assured the United States there would be no reprisals against the 29 demonstrators who have put the issue of human rights abuses in front of the 18-nation APEC forum. </P>
<P> ``We have been assured that there will be no retribution against them for exercising their political expression and bringing their concerns to us,'' Clinton said. </P>
<P> ``We have been assured of that, and I feel comfortable that the commitment we received will be honored,'' he added. Clinton has said he will discuss U.S. human rights concerns in a bilateral session with Indonesian President Suharto after the close of the APEC summit. </P>
<P> Clinton spoke to reporters after a 45-minute meeting with South Korean President Kim Young-sam at which they discussed APEC and the goal of establishing free trade in the Pacific region and relations with North Korea and Pyongyang's agreement to freeze and dismantle its nuclear weapons program. </P>
<P> Clinton said all the leaders he met Monday, including Chinese President Jiang Zemin, expressed support for the agreement with Pyongyang that will cost some $4 billion to replace North Korea's nuclear power plants. They also agreed on the need for a dialogue between North and South, he said. </P>
<P> Clinton was also to hold further discussions on North Korea late Monday night in a previously unscheduled session with Murayama and Kim following an opening dinner with the APEC leaders. </P>
<P> Korea also dominated discussions with Chinese President Jiang Zemin, officials said. Last week's election results did not come up, they said. </P>
<P> China ``welcomed strongly'' the agreement and declared there is ``no difference between the United States and China on implementing it,'' one American official said. </P>
<P> Officials said Jiang was less forthcoming over human rights. ``The Chinese responded in general terms as they have before,'' one said. </P>
<P> ``They say they are trying to extend human rights within their society, but stability is very important and the sovereignty of China is very important.'' </P>
