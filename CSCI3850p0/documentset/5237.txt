<P> By Sandra Marquez  A plan to register an estimated 3.5 million voters by mid-April has been delayed because property owners are afraid to rent space for use as voter bureaus, electoral officials said Monday. </P>
<P> The planned June 4 general elections will be a big test for Haiti, a country whose first experience with democracy was aborted following a September 1991 coup which ousted elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide from power. </P>
<P> President Clinton and United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros Ghali will lend their support for Haitian democracy Friday at a ceremony to transfer U.S. command for multinational peacekeeping forces to the United Nations. </P>
<P> But electoral officials must also convince a skeptical Haitian public that voting will be safe. </P>
<P> Electoral Council officials said they have repeatedly been offered -- and then refused -- real estate for an office that will organize elections in the capital and its environs. </P>
<P> Marie Laurence Lassegue, general secretary of the Provisional Electoral Council, launched an appeal Monday on independent Radio Metropole to address the problem. </P>
<P> She called on property owners with available sites in the capital and the surrounding province to show their support for free and fair elections by making their properties available to the electoral council. </P>
<P> On Sunday, only a handful of offices in the nation launched a scheduled registration campaign that is planned to end April 17, officials said. </P>
<P> Despite the setbacks, officials say the June 4 general elections will take place on schedule. </P>
<P> U.S.-led multinational forces in Haiti since September to restore Aristide to power have distributed millions of ballots and registration forms by helicopter to the voter offices throughout the country, a U.S. Embassy spokesman said. </P>
<P> In 1987, gunmen linked to the former Duvalier dictatorship halted Haiti's civilian-run elections, killing at least 34 voters waiting to cast their ballots. Three years later, Haiti held its first-ever peaceful, democratic elections in which Aristide was a landslide winner. </P>
