<P>  Argentine boxing fans jeered the United States national anthem after a U.S. fighter won one of the finals at the Pan-American Games in controversial style Saturday. </P>
<P> The crowd was incensed when judges declared David Reid the winner of the welterweight final over Puerto Rico's Daniel Pena by 47 points to 45. The fans, who thought Santos deserved to win, whistled the decision. </P>
<P> They also jeered when Reid was presented his medal on the podium and when the American anthem was played, while Santos received huge applause when he was given the silver medal. Reid grinned throughout the ceremony. </P>
<P> Reid clearly dominated the first round. But the second appeared even and at one stage in the third and final round, the American was knocked to the canvas. </P>
<P> The bout was the only one of Saturday's six finals not to feature a Cuban. Cubans won four of the other five fights. </P>
<P> Veteran Cuban Felix Savon successfully defended his Pan-Am heavyweight title by beating American Lamon Brewster. Brewster was sent flying by a series of punches early in the second round and the referee stopped the contest shortly afterwards as Brewster wobbled again after receiving more punishment. </P>
<P> Savon is also the Olympic champion and four-time world champion. </P>
<P> Juan Antonio Despaigne, Julio Gonzalez and Azcy Hernandez won the other golds for Cuba. But despite its dominance, the Caribbean nation will fall well short of its haul of 11 golds at the 1991 Pan-American Games, which they hosted. </P>
<P> Cuba can reach a maximum of eight golds as they are represented in four of the six remaining finals on Sunday. </P>
<P> Light flyweight Juan Ramirez was the only Cuban to lose when he went down on points to Edgar Alexander Velazquez of Venezuela. </P>
<P> Velazquez was slightly the better of a dramatic fight and wept on the shoulder of his trainer when it was announced he had won by 11 points to six. </P>
<P> Despaigne had a comfortable points win over Jose Cotto Vazquez of Puerto Rico in the bantamweight final. </P>
<P> Gonzalez outpointed Brazil's Acelino Freitas in the lightweight final. </P>
