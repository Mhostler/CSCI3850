<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  An explosion at a refinery south of Los Angeles that injured 20 people, including three people critically and others who suffered less serious burn and smoke inhalation injuries, Mobil Corp. said. </P>
<P> The blast shortly after 3 p.m. PDT (6 p.m. EDT) at the refinery in Torrance, Calif., caused a three-alarm fire, which was brought under control within half an hour, the company said. </P>
<P> The blast started at a pipe rack, which transports feed chemicals and products between different parts of the plant. An investigation into the cause of the blast was under way. </P>
<P> Mobil said the blast appears to have involved a feed line which supplies liquid petroleum gas from storage to its alkylation unit. </P>
<P> The 17,200 barrel per day alkylation unit was not involved, but was earlier shut down because of damage to the feed line, Mobil said. No other refinery operating unit has been shut down as a result of the incident, it said. </P>
<P> Mobil said it is conducting an investigation to determine the cause of the incident and the extent the damage at the refinery, which processes 127,000 barrels per day. </P>
<P> The area of the incident is secure and the majority of the refinery process units have returned to normal operations. </P>
<P> Mobil earlier reported that the blast caused 17 injuries. </P>
<P> Injured workers have been transported to four hospitals in the area for examination and treatment, Mobil said. It said there was no toxic release or other impact to the area around the plant. </P>
