<P>  Russia Friday summoned the U.S. ambassador to Moscow to tell him that Washington's contacts with separatist Chechen leader Dhzokhar Dudayev's foreign minister were unacceptable, Russian news agencies reported. </P>
<P> The official news agency Itar-Tass said First Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told ambassador Thomas Pickering that Moscow was ``perplexed by Washington's contacts with a certain Shamsettin Yusuf who calls himself Chechen foreign minister.'' </P>
<P> Yusuf, in Washington to try to build political support for Chechnya's struggle against Moscow, has held talks with members of Congress whom he refused to name. </P>
<P> Aides said he was due to meet a relatively low-level State Department official, reflecting the U.S. position that Chechnya is part of Russia, not an independent state. </P>
<P> Ambassador Pickering, confirming that he was called to the Russian Foreign Ministry Friday, told Reuters: ``Yusuf had been given a private visa to the United States. He came to the United States as a private individual.'' </P>
<P> Pickering said Yusuf met ``a very low level official at the State Department'' and members of Congress as a private individual, but added: ``Yusuf is the alleged foreign minister of Chechnya and we in no way recognize the state of Chechnya.'' </P>
<P> Tass said Ivanov told Pickering that Yusuf had ``provocative goals'' and hoped the U.S. side would take all necessary measures to ``prevent anti-Russian actions by Yusuf on U.S. territory and contacts between him and U.S. officials under any pretext.'' </P>
<P> Yusuf said in a speech at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington think tank, that Chechens would not be satisfied with anything less than independence from Moscow and predicted that other regions in Russia would also eventually break away. </P>
<P> He ruled out negotiations with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, calling him untrustworthy, a drunkard and ``the leader of the mafia.'' </P>
<P> The Chechen foreign minister also said in Washington: ``I think we burn Moscow. We have people who can do that.'' </P>
<P> Interfax news agency quoted Ivanov as telling Pickering that such statements were a provocation. </P>
<P> ``We believe that the U.S. authorities will act in the spirit of partnership between our countries by putting an end to the anti-Russian activities of Dudayev's emissary to the U.S.,'' Ivanov said, Interfax reported. </P>
<P> Interfax said the Russian embassy in Washington had separately told the U.S. administration any contacts with Yusuf were ``unacceptable.'' </P>
