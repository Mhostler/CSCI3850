<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Chile halted sales of vast tracts of woodland Tuesday after reports that loggers were clear-cutting rare temperate rain forest they bought for as little as $2 an acre. </P>
<P> Minister of National Assets Adriana Delpiano ordered a stop to all sales of land containing ``native forests'' belonging to the ministry, including stands of old-growth woods in southern Chile. </P>
<P> ``Lands had been sold to private concerns at scandalously low prices,'' said Delpiano's spokesman, Hugo Soiza. </P>
<P> Local television reports said loggers bought land near the southern port of Punta Arenas for as little as $2 an acre and then sold its lumber at top market prices. </P>
<P> The reports helped focus public attention on the plight of the native forests on Chile's southern coast. The forests have become a rallying cry for the country's growing environmental movement. </P>
<P> Delpiano's order applied to nearly 2.4 million acres of land covered mostly in old-growth larch and pine forests along the Pacific coast, said Soiza. </P>
<P> The order applies only to new sales, not those for which sale contracts have already been signed although there are currently few pending sales, said Soiza. </P>
<P> The halt will stay in effect at least as long as it takes the ministry to carry out studies on the forests' commercial value, which could take a couple of years, said Soiza. </P>
<P> Chile's ``native forests,'' or woods with tree species native to Chile as opposed to introduced varieties, are among the world's last remaining temperate rainforests, found also on the coasts of Alaska, Washington state and British Columbia and parts of Siberia. </P>
