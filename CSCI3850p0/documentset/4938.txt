<DATELINE>BUJUMBURA, Burundi (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Tutsi youths attacked Hutus in the the Burundi capital Wednesday after police found the mutilated and crucified body of kidnapped Tutsi government advisor, witnesses said. </P>
<P> They said Tutsis thowing hand grenades and armed with knives wounded a large number of members of the Hutu majority in the center of Bujumbura before police intervened and stopped the violence. </P>
<P> No exact casualty toll was immediately available. </P>
<P> The Tutsis rioted to avenge the killing of Lucien Sakubu, an interior ministry adviser and former mayor of Bujumbura, who was kidnapped by suspected Hutu militants Monday. </P>
<P> Sakubu's body was found by police in Kinama suburb Friday after a two-day search. His heart and intestines had been cut out and he had been crucified, police sources said. </P>
<P> Sakubu, a former colonel, was a Tutsi. </P>
<P> Residents said they feared that violence would resume Thursday in the city, which has been under a dusk to dawn curfew since last December. </P>
<P> A funeral for Hutu Minister for Mines and Energy Ernest Kabushemeye, who was assassinated in Bujumbura last Saturday by at least three gunmen, is to be held Thursday. </P>
<P> His killing triggered fears of renewed ethnic conflict in this central African country. Diplomats have said they believe Tutsi militants killed Kabushemeye and Hutus would take revenge. </P>
<P> Diplomats said the assassination was the first major test for Prime Minister Antoine Nduwayo, a Tutsi appointed last month after the Tutsi-dominated opposition forced his predecessor to resign. </P>
<P> Burundi has been gripped by an ethnic tit-for-tat war since the slaughter of its first democratically-elected president, Melchior Ndadaye, in October 1993 by rebellious Tutsi troops. </P>
<P> Some 50,000 people were slaughtered after Ndadaye's death. </P>
<P> Last year, the next Burundi president, Cyprien Ntaryamira, and Rwandan leader Juvenal Habyarimana were killed in a plane crash that unleashed a genocide of Tutsis and Hutu moderates in neighboring Rwanda. </P>
<P> The killing heightened ethnic hatred in Burundi. </P>
