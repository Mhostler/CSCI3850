<P>  NATO has stepped up enforcement of a U.N. ban on flights over Bosnia following allegations of increased violations and arms-running to the Muslim-led government, NATO military sources said Friday. </P>
<P> They said in recent weeks they had stepped up policing of the skies over Bosnia, particularly at night. The no-fly zone was created about two years ago to try to limit the conflict in Bosnia by preventing Serbs bombing Muslim positions. </P>
<P> A military source said NATO was using two high-tech AWACS (Airborne Warning and Control Systems) monitoring planes for the first time in several months. One flies over Hungary and the other over the Adriatic. </P>
<P> ``We were burning out the AWACS guys and decided to fly more randomly,'' one military source told Reuters. </P>
<P> He added that on the night of Feb. 10 when U.N. officers first reported seeing air activity and said they heard noise they believed to be that of a military transport plane, neither of the two monitoring planes was up in the air. </P>
<P> Instead, they said on that night a far less-sophisticated plane, an E2 C equipped with reconnaissance and forward radar facilities, was on patrol. </P>
<P> NATO military personnel say they found no evidence to support claims by U.N. officers of several violations in February by unidentified planes, including a military transport aircraft, around Tuzla airport in northern Bosnia. </P>
<P> The NATO report was supported by the departing U.N. commander in former Yugoslavia, Gen. Bertrand de Lapresle of France, who played down differences between the United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on the issue. </P>
<P> De Lapresle, distancing himself from previous U.N. reports, said there was no evidence of planes landing or unloading cargo in Tuzla and dismissed media reports of a covert arms-supply operation operation as ``pure speculation.'' </P>
<P> ``There had not been clear evidence that any plane either landed in Tuzla or dropped any deliveries,'' he told reporters in Zagreb. </P>
<P> The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug accused both the United States and NATO Friday of colluding to fly weapons secretly to Muslim forces at Tuzla airport. </P>
<P> It said the Bosnian Serb army suspected that advanced weapons were sent to its Muslim foes aboard flights violating both the U.N. arms embargo and the no-fly zone over Bosnia. </P>
