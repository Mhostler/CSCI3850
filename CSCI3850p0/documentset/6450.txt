<P>  The House Wednesday rejected a compromise water quality bill that offered stronger protection for wetlands and coastal waters and stiffer anti-pollution measures than a House committee bill the Clinton administration threatened to veto. </P>
<P> The substitute bill to reauthorize the Clean Water Act failed 184-242, clearing the way for a vote expected later this week on the Transportation Committee's bill which would ease pollution controls on industry, farmers and cities and allow development of many wetlands. </P>
<P> Rep. Jim Saxton of New Jersey, who sponsored the substitute proposal along with fellow Republican Sherwood Boehlert of New York, said the substitute bill kept about 70 percent of the committee's bill. </P>
<P> But Transportation Committee Chairman Bud Shuster, R-Pa., said the substitute bill ``guts the committee's bill'' and put too many restrictions on property owners and communities. </P>
<P> Shuster said his committee's bill would give states and communities flexibility to address pollution issues and maintain water quality. </P>
<P> But the White House Office of Management and Budget, the Interior and Justice Departments and the Environmental Protection Agency called the bill a setback and said they would urge Clinton to veto it in its current form. </P>
<P> ``The bill weakens strong standards, provides authority to degrade water quality, weakens enforcement of the law, avoids rather than solves the difficult problems of polluted runoff, and removes most wetlands from federal protection,'' the EPA said in a statement. </P>
<P> ``The substitute is far superior to the (committee) bill, however in some key areas it still falls short of the administration's environmental and public health goals,'' an EPA official said before the vote on the Saxton-Boehlert bill. </P>
<P> Several Democratic members of Congress said that while the substitute was better than the committee bill, it was not strong enough to support. </P>
