<P>  Rescue officials were searching for eight fishermen missing after a cyclone generating winds of up to 140 mph hammered Australia's northwest coast Saturday and began moving inland. </P>
<P> Police said two boats carrying six fishermen had been located, but one boat with three passengers and another with five were still missing after the fury of Cyclone Bobby moved in from the Indian Ocean early Saturday and lashed the coast. </P>
<P> ``It could be that their communications systems are damaged or their boats have capsized -- we just don't know,'' Western Australian State Emergency Service duty officer Stuart Cowie told Reuters. </P>
<P> Residents of the fishing village of Onslow, about 870 miles north of Perth, bore the brunt of the storm. Bobby hit the town early Saturday, tearing the roofs from about 20 homes, uprooting trees and cutting power and water supplies. </P>
<P> Police said torrential rains had caused heavy flooding and washed out many roads, stranding several remote Aboriginal communities in the region of Pilbara, 854 miles north of Perth. Rescue officials have put those areas on alert. </P>
<P> The Tropical Cyclone Warning Center said destructive winds were expected to continue for another 12 hours in the farming, mining and oil-producing region, although the main part of the storm was continuing to move south and lose speed. </P>
<P> Police said residents of Onslow, a town of about 750 people, were battened down in their homes as heavy rain and high winds continued to lash the area. Army troops were expected to reach Onslow to reinforce rescue workers late Saturday. </P>
<P> Emergency officials said damage was likely to be heavy in several small towns but there were no reports of missing people or injuries on shore. The approach of the storm forced the closure of the Griffin oil field Thursday. </P>
