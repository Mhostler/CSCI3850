<P>  The curious came from near and far Sunday morning, armed with cameras and camcorders, hoping to catch a glimpse of the jury in the O.J. Simpson case on a visit to the home of murder victim Nicole Simpson Brown. </P>
<P> ``This is history in the making and eventually my children will be asking me what happened,'' said airline salesman R.C. Williams, explaining why he drove 72 miles from his home in Ontario, Calif. </P>
<P> Williams, who was taking photos with a disposable camera, said he left Ontario east of Los Angeles, and then stopped in Carson and Gardena to pick up his brother and a friend before arriving in the tony Brentwood section. </P>
<P> After keeping watch at Brown's Mediterranean-style townhouse in Brentwood, Williams planned to follow the jury when it went on to visit Simpson's mansion about two miles away. Others on hand had the same itinerary. </P>
<P> Carmen Perron, a second grade school teacher who lives in Huntington Beach about 40 miles south of Los Angeles, said she left her home at about 7:30 a.m. to show up for the jury visit. </P>
<P> She believes Simpson is innocent of the murder of his ex-wife and her friend Ronald Goldman. ``I'm an O.J. supporter,'' Perron said. ``I sent him a telegram on his birthday.'' </P>
<P> But intense police security, including the barricading of all streets and alleys surrounding Brown's home, kept visitors some distance away. </P>
<P> Onlookers were one and a half blocks south of Brown's white stucco, tile-roofed townhouse, when the jury arrived on a charter bus, accompanied by a police motorcade. </P>
<P> The jury bus appeared at the home after first visiting the apartment of Ronald Goldman, who was killed along with Brown last June 12. The panel also stopped at Mezzaluna Restaurant, where Goldman was a waiter and where Brown dined the night of the double murder. </P>
<P> Onlookers armed with cameras and camcorders milled around the intersection, with many area residents admitting that they came in spite of their better instincts. </P>
<P> ``My intention was to get up and run away from it, but then I thought I'd see if there was anything to see,'' said Lori Bort, who said she lived about two blocks from the murder scene. </P>
<P> ``We're watching a lot of people watching a lot of people,'' said one man, who identified himself only as Ken. </P>
<P> ``It's a circus,'' said his wife. But the couple, who were recording the scene on a camcorder, said they had been awakened by police helicopters that began relentlessly circling the area at 6 a.m. and felt drawn to the scene. </P>
<P> About three blocks north of Brown's townhouse, at the other end of police barricades to the street, the curious gathered in hopes of seeing the arrival of the jury. </P>
<P> But at 10:30 a.m., onlookers interviewed were unaware that the jury had arrived at the house 30 minutes earlier. ``They're already here?'' said Liz Goldman, who said she hoped to catch a glimpse of the motorcade arrival. </P>
<P> John Dunkin, a lieutenant with the Los Angeles Police Department, said the department had about 250 officers on duty in the area, including around Brown's home on South Bundy Drive and at O.J. Simpson's mansion on Rockingham Avenue, about two miles away. The jury was to visit the Rockingham site after touring Brown's house. </P>
