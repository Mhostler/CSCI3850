<P>  Britain's High Court Friday decided that Jamaican gospel singer John Folkes wrote the hit reggae classic ``Oh Carolina.'' </P>
<P> Judge Anthony Grabiner ruled in Folkes' favor after saying he did not believe evidence by leading Jamaican reggae star Prince Buster who claimed he was the song's original author. </P>
<P> ``Oh Carolina'' became a hit in Britain and across Europe last year when a revamped version was recorded by the singer Shaggy. Its success provided massive financial spin-offs. </P>
<P> Folkes, a founding member of a Jamaican gospel-singing trio who is now a teacher in Canada, said he wrote the song in 1958 but he was challenged by Buster who said he named the song after a girlfriend who was seeing another man. </P>
<P> Folkes, the son of a Jamaican church minister from a Kingston ghetto, said he wrote it in 20 minutes, sitting on his doorstep. </P>
<P> Buster, angered by the decision, said afterwards he would like to see the case appealed. </P>
<P> A spokesman for Folkes' recording company said: ``We are delighted that the record has been put straight.'' </P>
