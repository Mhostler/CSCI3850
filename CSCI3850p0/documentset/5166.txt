<DATELINE>LONDON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  British lawmakers Friday attacked a campaign by a radical gay activist group to force homosexual members of Parliament to ``come out.'' </P>
<P> A total of 127 MPs -- almost 20 percent of the House of Commons -- signed a motion condemning the campaign by the group OutRage!, which has already targetted the Church of England with allegations that 10 bishops or former bishops were gay. </P>
<P> Stepping up its campaign this week, OutRage! said Monday it had written to 20 MPs, two of them cabinet ministers, saying they should admit to being homosexual. </P>
<P> But the campaign was condemned after newspapers linked the death from a heart attack of a Northern Irish Unionist MP, Sir James Kilfedder, to the outing campaign. The group did not confirm it had targetted Kilfedder. </P>
<P> In Friday's motion, the MPs said the consensual sexual behavior of everybody was a private matter. </P>
<P> ``Any attempt to harass or blackmail members (of Parliament) about their sexual life is unacceptable. (The House of Commons) deplores and rejects the behavior of those who are currently threatening pwople in public life,'' they said. </P>
<P> The MPs also called on people targetted by OutRage! not to respond and on the media not to publicize such attacks. </P>
<P> The MPs were not the first to condemn the campaign. Last week, the Church of England's third-ranking clergyman, Bishop of London David Hope, described his sexuality as ambiguous and complained that OutRage had intimidated him. </P>
