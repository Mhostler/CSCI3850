<DATELINE>JAKARTA, April 25 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Suharto on Tuesday declared more autonomy for 26 Indonesian districts, including one in troubled East Timor, adding that greater autonomy would not cause disintegration of the sprawling archipelago. </P>
<P> ``The national spirit and and the people's awareness of democracy has been examined...so giving greater autonomy to districts will not create risks of national disintegration,'' Suharto in a speech to district officials. </P>
<P> The move will give district officials more authority in administrative matters that previously needed approval from Jakarta and is expected to give a boost to economic development in the area. </P>
<P> Interior Minister Yogie Memet said it would give officials more room to manage and develop the districts. </P>
<P> ``However, matters of defence and security, justice, finance and foreign policy will still be under the head government in the districts,'' Yogie said. </P>
<P> The 26 districts are scattered throughout Indonesia and include Aileu in East Timor. </P>
<P> Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 after the Portuguese colonialists left and annexed it the following year. Its rule there, however, is not recognised by the United Nations. </P>
<P> A small band of guerrillas have been fighting for East Timor's independence from Indonesia. Other opponents of Indonesian rule there have sought greater autonomy instead. </P>
