<P> The sale was due to end Tuesday. </P>
<P> USAir is struggling to convince the public that its operations are safe after a deadly crash near Pittsburgh that killed 132. </P>
<P> ``These fares have been very well-received in the nine-day selling period, so we're extending it to accomodate even more last-minute travel bargain hunters,'' Gary Harrig, USAir assistant vice president for pricing and inventory management, said in a statement. </P>
<P> Blackout dates are Dec. 21, 22, 23, 26 and 27, as well as Jan. 1, 2 and 3. </P>
<P> USAir said its bookings were well above last year's for the Christmas and New Year's tarvel period. </P>
<P> It said the most seats were available on flights within regions, while flights between major east-west markets and the north-south service between Eastern cities and Florida were generally very full. </P>
