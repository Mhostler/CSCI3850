<DATELINE>TAIPEI, April 4 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A top Taiwan official responsible for an aborted patrol of the disputed Spratly islands fought a hail of criticism on Tuesday and threatened to punish others for the incident. </P>
<P> Interior minister Huang Kun-huei also denied the armed patrol's mission to the tense South China Sea area had been intended to reinforce Taiwan's sovereignty claims there, contradicting previous official statements. </P>
<P> The Spratlys, seen as a possible flashpoint in the region, are a potentially oil-rich cluster of isles, reefs and atolls in the South China Sea claimed wholly or in part by China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei. </P>
<P> ``We want to know how this big fuss happened,'' Huang told reporters. ``Was it done by our colleagues or how did it happen? Or was it because of media reports?'' </P>
<P> ``Of course, we will impose punishments,'' he added. </P>
<P> Several opposition party members and legislators called for Huang's resignation, chiding him for dispatching the patrol in a blaze of publicity and then recalling it before it reached its destination. </P>
<P> The mass circulation China Times newspaper on Tuesday quoted a spokesman for the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) as saying the incident was a joke and the government is impotent to protect its territory. </P>
<P> ``For making this big international joke, government officials should certainly shoulder the political responsibility,'' the newspaper quoted the DPP's Su Chen-chang as saying. </P>
<P> Opposition legislators also called for the resignation of Lu Yu-chun, director-general of the National Police Administration (NPA), the body directly in charge of sending the armed patrol. </P>
<P> Taiwan said it withdrew the patrol to avoid international confrontation. The Philippines had said it might boost its forces in the Spratlys after hearing of Taiwan's actions. </P>
<P> Beijing maintains a considerable military presence there. </P>
<P> The Philippines last week arrested 62 Chinese fishermen and seized four Chinese boats for allegedly intruding into an area in the Spratlys claimed by Manila. </P>
<P> In February, it accused China of building possible naval structures in the area. </P>
<P> Beijing has denied the allegations. </P>
<P> Taiwan's Interior Minister Huang said the patrol had been dispatched to protect Taiwanese fishermen in the region and not to reinforce sovereignty claims. </P>
<P> This contradicted earlier statements from officials. The patrol's mission included erecting a monument on the biggest island in the Spratlys, called Taiping here but also known as Itu Aba, to emphasise sovereignty. </P>
<P> Asian nations claiming the Spratly islands made their concern over tension in the area loud and clear to China, Philippine Foreign Secretary Roberto Romulo said on Monday. </P>
<P> He said he expected the Spratlys row to be discussed in talks starting on Monday in Hangzhou near Shanghai among senior officials from China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). </P>
