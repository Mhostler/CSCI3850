<DATELINE>KIEV, Ukraine (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Post-Soviet Ukraine has degenerated into a society riven with poverty, disease, reduced life expectancy and high unemployment, the United Nations said in a report issued over the weekend. </P>
<P> The report, coinciding with this week's U.N. summit on social development, said the former Soviet republic had created democratic institutions, maintained social peace and retained good prospects with a highly educated workforce. </P>
<P> The document, ``Ukraine Human Development Report 1995,'' outlined how the transition from 70 years of communism to a market-oriented independent state had made millions destitute and undermined educational and social institutions. </P>
<P> According to U.N. figures, Soviet living standards ranked 33rd of 160 countries but post-Soviet Ukraine stood in 52nd place of 173 nations. </P>
<P> Living standards declined 80 percent in a 28-month period after independence, with some families spending up to 82 percent of their budget on food. Official unemployment was one percent but U.N. figures say large numbers in unproductive or unpaid work put the real figure at up to 40 percent. </P>
<P> The average life span for men declined from 66.1 years in 1991 to 63.5 in 1993 and for women from 75.2 to 73.4 years. </P>
<P> Infant mortality, which remained high but was declining in the final years of Soviet rule, climbed from 12.3 per 1,000 in 1990 to 14.9 by 1993. Diseases virtually wiped out in the West, such as cholera and diphtheria, were on the rise. </P>
<P> ``Prior to independence, Ukraine was a reasonably equitable society. Today...inequalities are exacerbated by a decline in the living standards of the majority and a fortuitous and spectacular rise the wealth of a minority,'' the report said. </P>
<P> ``In a centrally controlled economy people were locked into a state welfare system. As the panoply of controls weakens, many people are bereft of the means for material support.'' </P>
<P> President Leonid Kuchma, among the 130 heads of state and government attending the Copenhagen summit, will use the occasion to press for Western aid to shore up Ukraine's economy and prevent social upheaval. </P>
<P> He needs to canvass for pledges to meet an International Monetary Fund (IMF) demand for Ukraine to secure $800 million in bilateral aid as part of a $1.8 billion stand-by loan package agreed in principle with Kiev authorities this week. </P>
<P> Kuchma ended nearly three years of drift in post-Soviet economics after his election last July by immediately pressing forward with a program of economic reforms -- bound to make living standards even worse for a time. </P>
<P> He secured parliamentary approval in October for a plan to reduce inflation, phase out subsidies and move rapidly on privatisation. The IMF showed approval by granting the first tranche of a $700 million ``systemic transformation facility.'' </P>
<P> The U.N. report praised Kuchma's reform plan as well as efforts to help the least well-off -- particularly in view of the burden imposed by the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster. </P>
<P> An explosion and fire at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in April 1986 spewed radiation over much of Europe. </P>
<P> The report also said the peaceful staging of parliamentary and presidential elections last year ``embodied an important manifestation of the new democratic era.'' </P>
