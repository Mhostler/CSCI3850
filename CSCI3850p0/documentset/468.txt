<P>  Japan said Friday it would strive to settle a trade dispute with the United States and keep talking even if a July 31 deadline passed without an agreement. </P>
<P> ``I'm hoping the talks will be concluded, but even if there were no accord (by July 31), we would continue to seek one,'' Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura told a news conference. </P>
<P> Currency market hopes for a deal on greater access to Japan's government procurement market helped boost the dollar above 100 yen in New York Thursday and here briefly Friday for the first time in a month. </P>
<P> But prospects for a quick agreement remained uncertain. </P>
<P> ``I am neither very optimistic nor very pessimistic,'' Minister for International Trade and Industry Ryutaro Hashimoto told a separate news conference. </P>
<P> Japanese media reports said Japanese negotiators now in Washington for last-ditch talks would table a compromise proposal, but officials here were silent on the contents. </P>
<P> ``The United States and Japan have not yet closed the gap, but a final round of efforts is being made in Washington now,'' Takemura said. </P>
<P> ``There are serious talks going on and it cannot be denied that both sides are making concessions to each other,'' he said. </P>
<P> Washington has set a July 31 deadline for deciding whether Tokyo's procedures for government procurement of medical equipment and telecommunications equipment are discriminatory, the first step toward possible sanctions. </P>
<P> Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky met Deputy Foreign Minister Sadayuki Hayashi Thursday night in Washington ahead of more substantial talks Friday. </P>
<P> A Posts and Telecommunications Ministry official declined to comment on reports that Japan would propose improved bidding procedures for government contracts but would continue opposing a U.S. demand for forward-looking indicators to measure market access improvement. </P>
<P> ``We will discuss both (bidding) procedures and objective criteria as much as possible,'' the official said. </P>
<P> Japan's opposition to numerical indicators, which Tokyo fears could become targets that would trigger sanctions if not met, has been a major hurdle in the economic framework talks since the two nations reached a broad pact last year. </P>
<P> A U.S. official in Tokyo, however, said an even more basic issue was a stake in the talks. </P>
<P> ``We want it clear that the objective of the overall process is to increase the sales of competitive foreign products,'' the official said. </P>
<P> Government procurement, along with insurance and cars and car parts, is a priority sector in the framework talks. </P>
<P> Barshefsky, speaking ahead of her initial meeting with Hayashi, said Washington had no plan to delay the July 31 deadline. It has done so twice already. </P>
<P> Even if Washington does launch sanctions proceedings, sanctions would be implemented only if the two sides failed to reach agreement during a 60-day consultation period. </P>
<P> Japanese officials had said they might exercise their right to call off the talks if the United States took unilateral action, but Takemura's comment suggested Tokyo had had second thoughts about taking such a hard line. </P>
<P> A U.S. source said Washington was also likely to seek to contain adverse fallout should the two sides fail to reach agreement before Sunday. </P>
<P> ``Come Monday and we don't have an agreement, I think the U.S. will downplay the significance of what happens next,'' the source said. </P>
