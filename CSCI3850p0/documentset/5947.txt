<P>  A British newspaper said Sunday Germany is trying to retrieve some of Adolf Hitler's relics, including his last will and testament which is said to be in a London strongroom. </P>
<P> The Sunday Telegraph said the relics also included Hitler's jawbone and part of his skull which it reported were in a cardboard box in Moscow. </P>
<P> As the 50th anniversary of Hitler's suicide approached next weekend, a tussle had broken out over who owned the relics of the Third Reich, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> It said the British government decided long ago that key Nazi documents and artifacts should be kept in Britain but bit by bit many were being returned at Germany's request. </P>
<P> ``The transfer of documents back to Germany is a continuous process,'' Stephen Walton, curator at Britain's Imperial War Museum, was quoted as saying by the newspaper. </P>
<P> ``It is logical to have the originals in one place for scholarly research,'' he said. </P>
