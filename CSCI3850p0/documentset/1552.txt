<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A federal judge Thursday delayed until October 21 sentencing for Rosario Ames, the wife of former CIA officer and confessed spy Aldrich Ames, because she had hired a new lawyer. </P>
<P> Sentencing scheduled for Friday was delayed at the last minute following a request by her new lawyer, John Hume. </P>
<P> Hume later said he had been hired within the past 24 hours, but declined to go into the reason why Ames switched lawyers right before her sentencing. He said his client had no intention of withdrawing her guilty plea. </P>
<P> Under a plea bargain agreement last April, the couple pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit espionage and to evade taxes. The husband confessed to spying for Moscow since 1985 for $2.5 million. </P>
<P> Ames, a veteran CIA officer who served as head of a Soviet counterintelligence desk in the 1980s, agreed to a sentence of life in prison without parole and agreed to cooperate with investigators in return for leniency for his wife. </P>
<P> The Colombian-born Rosario Ames, 41, could have faced a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison. </P>
<P> But under the plea deal, both prosecutors and defense attorneys agreed that she would get between 63 and 72 months in prison as long as Ames cooperates. </P>
<P> Sentencing initially had been set in August for Rosario, but was delayed so government investigators could finish questioning him. </P>
