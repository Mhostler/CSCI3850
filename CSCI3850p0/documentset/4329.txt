<P>  Ecuadoran President Sixto Duran Ballen said Monday that a proposal made by mediating nations to end the 18-day old armed border conflict with Peru is acceptable and that both nations could have peace if Peru agrees to it. </P>
<P> ``The mediating nations have finally come to realize what their responsibility is and have presented a new proposal that very well could lead to a cease-fire, without Ecuador having to back down a single step'', Duran Ballen told reporters. </P>
<P> ``It now depends on the other side,'' he added. </P>
<P> The statement was made hours after the country's Armed Forces reported that Peruvian troops attacked Ecuadoran positions at the disputed border with artillery fire. </P>
<P> A high ranking military official told Reuters that Tiwinza and Cueva de Los Tayos military posts were pounded with 120-mm shells throughout the day. </P>
<P> The Joint Command added in a communiqu that patrols from both sides clashed in the tropical jungle as booth nations aim to strengthen their control of the 212 square miles patch of jungle before a cease-fire was reached. </P>
<P> The statement also denied Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori's claim that its country had shot down two Ecuadoran planes Sunday. </P>
