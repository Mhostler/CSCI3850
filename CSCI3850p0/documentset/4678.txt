<DATELINE>LONDON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  British Prime Minister John Major narrowly won a vital parliamentary skirmish Wednesday in his battle to hold his ruling Conservative Party together over Europe, but the issue looks set to remain a thorn in his side. </P>
<P> Members of parliament rejected a motion from the opposition Labor Party expressing a lack of support for the government's stance toward the European Union by 319 votes to 314. </P>
<P> The victory saved the unpopular Major from a crisis of confidence over his leadership after he had put his reputation on the line by opting to lead the government's assault on the motion. </P>
<P> His triumph was marred, however, by the fact that Norman Lamont, increasingly critical of Europe since he quit as Major's finance minister in 1993, voted with Labor. </P>
<P> Major wooed ``Euroskeptic'' Conservatives, including nine who expelled from the parliamentary party for an earlier revolt over Europe, with a speech in which he said he might accept the referendum they demand on any further European integration. </P>
<P> Speaking of the possibility of future moves toward a single European currency or to make sweeping changes to the EU constitution, he said: ``We will need to carry the country with us. I am prepared to keep that option (of a referendum) open.'' </P>
<P> Major's speech in the lower House of Commons succeeded in persuading enough of the nine rebels to abstain in the climactic vote. </P>
<P> Yet it was also calculated not to offend the majority of his members of parliament and ministers who are committed to Britain staying in the EU and playing a full part in its development. </P>
<P> ``Most of us in this House ... believe we are right to be in the EU, and it is overwhelmingly in our national economic interest to be so,'' he said. </P>
<P> Labor foreign affairs spokesman Robin Cook commented sarcastically in a speech winding up the debate: ``The prime minister made a passionate speech for the don't-knows.'' </P>
<P> He later told Sky Television: ``The Conservative Party are split from top to bottom over Europe.'' </P>
<P> Lamont's dramatic gesture and interventions in the debate confirmed Cook's assessment that the Conservatives remain deeply divided over the single currency and other European issues. </P>
<P> One of the nine Euroskeptic rebels, Christopher Gill, told the Commons: ``The institutions of the European Union must be overhauled to reverse the current one-way drift to federalism.'' </P>
<P> Another Euroskeptic, Bill Cash, said: ``What I was looking for today was a commitment that we would not have a single currency in any circumstances.'' </P>
<P></P>
<P> ``Not a single good thing has been said about Europe and the EU by the government or its representatives over the past 15 years. We have had nothing but condemnation, quite unjustified.'' </P>
<P> The government's problems over Europe have been worsened by last week's Anglo-Irish proposals for the future of Northern Ireland which have offended pro-British politicians from the province. All nine Ulster Unionists, who had been allied with the Conservatives, voted with Labor. </P>
<P> Labor leader Tony Blair told the Commons that divisions in Major's government made it incapable of serving Britain's interests in Europe and were forcing Major increasingly to appease those who opposed the development of the EU. </P>
<P> ``The center of gravity in the Conservative Party is shifting and shifting fast,'' he said. </P>
