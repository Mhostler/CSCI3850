<P>  A raging wildfire that killed 14 firefighters in Colorado was the result of a series of errors in judgment and blunders that compromised standard firefighting procedures, a government study released Monday said. </P>
<P> The behavior of the fire July 6 near Glenwood Springs, Colorado could have been predicted on the basis of fuels, weather and the steep terrain, but fire behavior information was not requested nor provided by anyone involved in fighting the fire, according to the report's authors. </P>
<P> The study, begun hours after the fire, was conducted by the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service. </P>
<P> The firefighters were killed when winds suddenly whipped a small fire on Storm King Mountain into a huge inferno, trapping them in a wall of flame on a mountain ridge covered with thick brush. </P>
