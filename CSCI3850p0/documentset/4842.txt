<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A special army and police team were forced Friday to set two children of a Colombian drug lord free an hour after arresting them because their arrest warrants had already expired, the prosecutor-general's office said. </P>
<P> ``They didn't have any valid warrants for their arrest,'' said a spokeswoman for the office. </P>
<P> The team arrested the teen-age son and daughter of Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela during an operation early Friday in Cali, about 180 miles southwest of Bogota. </P>
<P> Rodriguez Orejuela is allegedly a leader of the Cali cartel, which controls most of the world's cocaine trade. </P>
<P> The team arrested Humberto and Maria Alejandra at the southwestern city's Alfonso Bonilla Aragon airport upon their arrival from the United States. </P>
<P> Local news reports had earlier said the State Department had revoked their visas, forcing them to return to Colombia. </P>
<P> The spokeswoman said a regional prosecutor in the Caribbean port of Barranquilla had issued warrants for their arrest in October 1993 for illicit enrichment. But the warrants had since expired. </P>
<P> The arrest came eight days after the capture of the younger brother of Rodriguez Orejuela. </P>
<P> The special army and police team, which has been searching for Gilberto for more than a year, captured Jorge Eliecer in front of a fortune teller's house in Cali Thursday, March 2. </P>
<P> Jorge Eliecer is being held at the La Picota prison in Bogota. </P>
