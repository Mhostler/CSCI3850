<P>  China Wednesday narrowly lost a bid to block a resolution voicing concern over its limits on freedom of expression and religion and other curbs, meaning Beijing's human rights record will be put to a vote. </P>
<P> In late-night voting, the 53-member United Nations Human Rights Commission also passed a resolution criticizing Cuba for violating political and religious freedoms and rights to assembly and free speech. </P>
<P> China and Cuba staunchly defended their own and each other's records, rejecting as politically motivated the allegations contained in resolutions backed by Washington. </P>
<P> The U.S. delegation, led by former Democratic Vice Presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro, waged strong campaigns against the two countries in the closing days of the commission's annual six-week session. </P>
<P> ``This year, it is time for us all to stand up and be counted,'' Ferraro said in a speech ahead of the China vote. </P>
<P> ``Vote to open the debate, so that this commission can once again be true to its principles,'' she told delegates. </P>
<P> Almost exactly a year ago to the day, China narrowly succeeded in shelving consideration of a Western resolution critical of violations, including torture and limits on freedoms. </P>
<P> On behalf of the European Union, France introduced this year's moderate resolution on China, which was jointly sponsored by a number of countries, including Japan and the United States. </P>
<P> France's delegation said: ``Violations of human rights are a legitimate concern of the international community. Expressing a concern of this kind is something that cannot be considered interference in the internal affairs of a state.'' </P>
<P> The resolution acknowledged ``recent positive developments in the situation of human rights in China, in particular steps towards reform of the Chinese legal system.'' </P>
<P> But it expressed concern at continuing reports of violations by local, provincial and national authorities and severe limits on citizens' rights to freedom of expression, assembly and religion, as well as to due legal process and a fair trial. </P>
<P> China's delegation promptly submitted a ``no action'' motion to quash the text, dismissing the allegations and arguing that all ethnic groups, including Tibetans, enjoyed basic freedoms. </P>
<P> ``The co-sponsors of this draft resolution have turned a blind eye to the achievements of China in the field of human rights and have made groundless allegations against China,'' Beijing's ambassador said in an appeal to end further debate. </P>
<P> ``The Chinese people are happy with their lives ... and the Chinese government attaches great importance to the construction of democracy and improvement of its legal system,'' he added. </P>
<P> Despite strong backing from several Asian states, including India, Pakistan, Indonesia and Malaysia but with the notable exception of the Philippines, China saw its procedural motion defeated by a vote of 22 countries for, 22 against with nine abstentions. </P>
<P> Under U.N. rules, Beijing would have needed one more vote to kill any further debate. </P>
<P> ``This is a historic vote. It is the first time a no-action motion on China has been defeated,'' a U.N. official told Reuters after the session was adjoured well past midnight. </P>
<P> Diplomats said there had been last-minute vote switches on China's procedural motion, which left unclear how the voting on the Western resolution would go later Wednesday. </P>
<P> The Commission called on Cuba to allow a special U.N. investigator to visit the island to look into allegations. </P>
<P> The vote on Cuba was 22 yes votes to eight against with 23 abstentions, almost exactly the same as a year ago. </P>
<P> Cuba's delegation said the allegations were part of ``an immoral exercise undertaken by the United States in resolutions since 1991.'' </P>
