<DATELINE>KIGALI, April 6 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Rwanda's genocide trials began on Thursday with a defendant admitting he killed 900 people in the holocaust that began exactly 12 months ago. </P>
<P> The first in what could be a marathon series of trials began almost seven hours late. It was then adjourned until further notice because none of the prosecution witnesses was present. </P>
<P> Looking frightened and dressed in pink prison T-shirts and shorts, the first seven of up to 30,000 jailed suspects appeared in a magistrates' court in the capital Kigali. </P>
<P> They were accused of taking part in the genocide of up to a million Tutsis and allied Hutus between last April and June. </P>
<P> ``I am going to be accused of genocide. It is true, I killed 900 people and I expect to be executed,'' Musoro Ndura said as he was led to his place in the cuort. </P>
<P> Presiding Judge Claudien Gatere declared the trial adjourned until further notice because witnesses had failed to turn up. </P>
<P> A large crowd, mainly Tutsis bereaved in the slaughter by hardline Hutus, packed the streets around the court as the defendants drove up in a pickup truck under tight security. </P>
<P> The first in the dock was Ngomayubu Nkulikingoma, a 17-year-old accused of the genocide of 12 people in the commune of Butamwa on the outskirts of the capital. </P>
<P> He pleaded not guilty and was represented by a United Nations Children's Fund lawyer because he is a minor. </P>
<P> Other defendants just answered their names read out by state prosecutor Silas Munyigashali. Those found guilty of genocide in Rwandan courts could face the death penalty by firing squad. </P>
<P> An international tribunal, to try ringleaders who planned last year's massacres, is due to start in Arusha, Tanzania, at the end of 1995. Its maximum penalty will be life imprisonment. </P>
<P> ``These people deserve to be executed publicly if they are found guilty. After all that is what they did to our families,'' 58-year-old Francois Kayimba, shaking with fury, told Reuters as he stood outside the court. </P>
<P> Critics said Rwanda was incapable of holding a free and fair trial but the U.N. has welcomed the start of the trials. </P>
<P> ``Either one waits a long time for a perfect, or near-perfect system, or one accepts an imperfect system which is ready, start on that and try and improve on it,'' U.N. special representative Shaharyar Khan said in Kigali Wednesday. </P>
<P> The trials in Rwanda began on the first anniversary of the assassination of Hutu President Juvenal Habyarimana. </P>
<P> His death triggered the start of the three-month bloodbath, and the exodus of some two million Hutus into neighboring Zaire, Tanzania and Burundi. </P>
<P> Commemorations of the anniversary were held in many capitals around Africa and in Europe. </P>
<P> But the ethnic enmity between Tutsis and Hutus infected even those ceremonies with some recalling the genocide of Tutsis and others the deaths of Habyarimana and the Hutu president of Burundi, Cyprien Ntaryamira, who was killed with Habyarimana. </P>
<P> An alleged ``death list'' drawn up by Rwandan Hutus forced the cancellation of memorial meetings in Ivory Coast. </P>
<P> In London, Rwandan survivors, church leaders and aid workers laid 10,000 palm crosses on the steps of St. Martin-in-the-Fields church at Trafalgar Square, each cross representing 100 Rwandans killed. </P>
<P> Prominent exiled Hutus in Kenya held a church service for their dead leader. </P>
<P> Paris-based Koffi Olomide, a Zairean economics graduate turned celebrity musician, told a Nairobi news conference the Kigali seemed peaceful to him now and the atmosphere at his three jampacked, live concerts at Kigali stadium last weekend was ``spiritual and fulfilling.'' </P>
