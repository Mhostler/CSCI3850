<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  European Union officials met Sunday to discuss tactics in the fish dispute with Canada, a European Commission spokesman said. </P>
<P> The meeting, which one EU diplomat said was ``essentially a stock-taking exercise,'' prepared the ground for discussions scheduled for Monday on possible trade sanctions against Ottawa. </P>
<P> ``This was of course one of the issues we have to prepare,'' spokesman Josep Coll told Reuters when asked whether sanctions were discussed Sunday. </P>
<P> He said the Commission was working on a list of possible sanctions to present to the EU's 15 member countries Monday. </P>
<P> Canada and the European Union have been at loggerheads since Thursday's seizure by Canada of the Estai, a Spanish fishing vessel, which cranked up a rumbling EU-Canada row about fishing rights in the north Atlantic. </P>
<P> The Estai was fishing for Greenland halibut 28 miles outside Canada's 200-mile limit when it was chased and boarded by a Canadian government ship. </P>
<P> The seized trawler was escorted into St. John's harbor in Newfoundland Sunday where Canadian fisheries officials prepared to bring charges against the boat, its captain and owners. </P>
<P> European Union negotiators in Brussels had no face-to-face talks with the Canadians Sunday, Coll said, though he added that informal contacts had taken place. </P>
<P> EU Fisheries Commissioner Emma Bonino Friday ruled out talks with Ottawa so long as the Estai was in Canadian hands. </P>
<P> Bonino, on a visit to Africa, issued a statement Sunday deploring the use of the Estai as a bargaining tool. </P>
<P> ``I cannot accept that (an EU) fishing vessel and its equipment be used as a means of pressure against the European Union,'' the statement said. </P>
