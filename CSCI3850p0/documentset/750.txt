<P>  Gunmen shot dead a U.N. peacekeeper in an ambush Friday night on Iraq's side of the volatile Gulf War border with Kuwait and the world body protested angrily to Baghdad about ``this criminal act.'' </P>
<P> The Bangladeshi warrant officer was the first member of the U.N. Iraq Kuwait Observer Mission to be killed in an armed incident since the force was deployed in 1991, a spokesman said. </P>
<P> ``The incident constitutes a very serious violation of the DMZ and puts at risk the lives and property of UNIKOM personnel,'' the UNIKOM spokesman told Reuters by telephone. </P>
<P> ``UNIKOM is investigating the matter and has strongly protested to the Iraqi authorities over this criminal act.'' </P>
<P> None of the unidentified assailants was captured. </P>
<P> Another Bangladeshi peacekeeper was wounded in the ambush and a third Bangladeshi soldier injured himself when he tried to help his wounded colleague. </P>
<P> The three were members of a patrol of Bangladeshi peacekeepers attacked near Safwan town, which is about 12 miles west of Umm Qasr port. </P>
<P> The attack occurred on the Safwan to Baghdad highway in the six-mile-wide Iraqi sector of the demilitarized zone. </P>
<P> The United Nations set up the demilitarized zone and deployed UNIKOM along it after a U.S.-led alliance drove Iraqi troops out of Kuwait in the six-week Gulf War in 1991. Iraq had invaded Kuwait in 1990 and claimed the emirate as its own. </P>
<P> The 32-nation UNIKOM consists of about 250 unarmed military observers, 180 civilian support staff and 775 Bangladeshi peacekeepers who provide armed reinforcement for the observers. </P>
<P> The killing of the Bangladeshi officer was the first violent incident reported along the border for many months and only the third armed incident in the zone since November. In one, unidentified men robbed a UNIKOM dormitory. </P>
<P> A military source said he understood that after the ambush there had been an exchange of fire between the UNIKOM patrol, which was in a four-wheel drive vehicle, and the assailants. </P>
<P> The spokesman said it would take several days to complete the investigation into the incident. There had been no official response from the Iraqis so far. </P>
<P> The Bangladeshi troops arrived in December 1993 and January 1994 and are equipped with anti-tank recoilless rifles, mortars, armoured personnel carriers, automatic rifles and machineguns. </P>
<P> The Iraqi government has refused to recognize the 130-mile demarcated border. The demilitarized zone extends three miles into Kuwaiti territory. </P>
