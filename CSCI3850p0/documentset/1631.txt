<DATELINE>STUART, Fla (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Attorneys for screen star Burt Reynolds said Tuesday they will file a civil damage lawsuit Wednesday against Loni Anderson, the actor's ex-wife, on the actor's behalf. </P>
<P> The legal action was taken only weeks after Anderson filed a motion charging that Reynolds had missed two alimony payments and failed to return some $37,000 of personal possessions. </P>
<P> A hearing on Anderson's motion is set for October 6. </P>
<P> Specifics about Reynolds' suit were not immediately available. But Robert Montgomery, an attorney for Reynolds, said the actor was charging that Anderson had not kept up her legal obligation to share parental responsibility for their adopted son, Quinton. </P>
<P> Speaking to reporters after Reynolds made a videotaped deposition on Anderson's motion here, Montgomery said the actor had complied with his side of the complicated settlement agreement finalized in June. </P>
<P> ``He has met every legal responsibility required. He owes nothing, zero,'' Montgomery said. </P>
<P> He said the actor's expenses related to his bitter divorce from Anderson, including alimony and child support payments, have totaled $1.014 million. He also said Anderson or her representatives were free to come to Reynolds' house and go through 25 boxes of goods and take anything they wanted. </P>
<P> A serious-looking Reynolds would not speak to reporters after his taped testimony. But he stopped to sign an autograph for a fan as he departed. </P>
<P> Montgomery said Anderson had allowed Quinton to visit Reynolds. But he said the boy was not allowed to ride in Reynolds' car nor to be separated from his nanny. </P>
<P> Anderson and Reynolds' divorce, for which they filed in June 1993, was contested here, where they owned a ranch outside Jupiter, a community near Stuart. </P>
<P> Under the divorce settlement agreement, Reynolds is ordered to pay Anderson alimony of $11,000 per month, except during months when the actress makes $25,000 or more. </P>
