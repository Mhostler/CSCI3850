<P>  Alaska Natives and local municipalities launched their plea Tuesday for $110 million in compensation from Exxon for damage they blamed on the nation's worst oil spill. </P>
<P> Attorneys for six Native-owned corporations, six municipalities and Exxon gave opening arguments in state Superior Court in one of two ongoing trials over damages from 11 million-gallon Exxon Valdez spill. </P>
<P> In the first phase of a federal trial, a jury found that recklessness by Exxon and captain Joseph Hazelwood caused the spill. That paved the way for a punitive award that could go as high as the $15 billion in punitive damages sought by the plaintives. </P>
<P> Some 582,000 acres of Native and municipal land was damaged or made temporarily unusable by the spill, plaintiff attorney Tim Petumenos told the state jury. </P>
<P> For Alaska Natives there is a special connection to the land that was harmed by the initial pollution and by lingering ecological damages, plaintiff attorney Sam Fortier said. </P>
<P> ``People live in Prince William Sound, and they've lived for thousands of years (there), because of what the land provided and what the sea provided,'' Fortier said. </P>
<P> ``Exxon insists that everything is OK to eat now. The Native people say, 'No, it's not... We know that there's something wrong out there.''' </P>
<P> During the spill cleanup, when some 11,000 workers were mobilized in the fight, the Natives lost control over their land, Fortier said. And spill-caused devaluation made their land useless as collateral, limiting the Native' economic opportunities. </P>
<P> For municipalities, the spill brought extraordinary expenses that were not reimbursed by Exxon, attorney Robert Stoll said. </P>
<P> Exxon attorney John Clough argued that the cleanup and the forces of nature have restored the Alaska environment to pre-spill conditions. </P>
<P> ``The evidence will show that these shorelines and these lands have recovered from the oil spill,'' Clough said. </P>
<P> The plaintiffs have ``greatly exaggerated'' their losses, he said, ``and are seeking damages for mountain tops, glaciers landlocked parcels, underground acres and thousands of acres located miles from coastlines and thousands of acres of shorelines that were never even touched by the oil.'' </P>
