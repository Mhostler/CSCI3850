<P>  The United States and Luxembourg have initialed an ``open sky'' agreement to reduce restrictions on airline flights between the two countries, the Transportation Department said Friday. </P>
<P> It was the fifth free-market accord the United States has signed with smaller European nations in the past two weeks as part of a nine-nation ``open sky'' effort. </P>
<P> The other agreements have been with Switzerland, Belgium, Austria and Iceland. </P>
<P> Talks with Finland will open the week of March 20. Talks with Norway, Sweden and Denmark are set for April. The accords will go into effect once agreements have been reached with all nine, department officials said. </P>
<P> They said they hoped the U.S. accords with the smaller European nations would persuade Europe's larger nations to reach similar pacts with the United States. </P>
<P> U.S. officials have tried for several years to negotiate a free-market air accord with Britain, but have failed because of Britain's reluctance to open London's Heathrow airport, a gateway to the European continent now dominated by British Airways. </P>
<P> There are also no free-market accords with France, Italy and Spain, although the United States has reached an agreement with Germany to gradually end air barriers over the next four years. </P>
