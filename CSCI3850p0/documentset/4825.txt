<P>  Canadian Jamie Hill cracked a bone in her left ankle and will not be able to compete in the Pan-American Games, women's gymnastics team coach Lise Simard said Thursday. </P>
<P> ``It's not serious but enough to keep her out of the competition,'' Simard said. ``She twisted her ankle when she landed badly during practice Wednesday.'' </P>
<P> The women's competition starts on Friday with the team compulsories. </P>
<P> With Lena Dejteva also not fully fit after a recent injury, the loss of Hill seriously hampers the Canadians' medal chances. </P>
<P> The Canadian men's team was third after the first day of compulsories as gymnastics opened Pan-American Games competition. </P>
<P> Cuba, with Erick Lopez making the best scores, was in the lead with 276.625 points. The United States was second with 275.700 and Canada third on 273.600. </P>
<P> The men's team competition concludes on Saturday with the optionals. </P>
