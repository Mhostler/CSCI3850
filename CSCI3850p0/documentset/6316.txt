<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  North Korea on Friday proposed to the United States a date and place for restarting talks on Pyongyang's nuclear program and Washington is confident the talks will resume soon, a State Department spokesman said. </P>
<P> Spokesman Nicholas Burns told a news conference that a letter transmitted through North Korea's United Nations mission in New York included proposals for resuming the talks, but he indicated Washington did not fully accept them. </P>
<P> ``We have not yet resolved the issue to our mutual satisfaction as to where and when these talks should be held,'' he said. ``That's the only point that's at issue.'' </P>
<P> He added: ``We are quite confident we will resolve these issues shortly and we look forward to these very important discussions Ambassador (Robert) Gallucci will be having with his counterpart Vice Foreign Minister Kang (Sok-ju).'' </P>
<P> The Japanese television station TBS said earlier on Friday the talks would start on May 15 and last for five days but its report, which it said was based on North Korean sources in New York, said the location had not been decided. </P>
<P> ``The ball is now in the U.S. court and we will respond ... very shortly to this (North Korean) letter,'' Burns said. </P>
<P> The talks are the latest in a series of meetings following an agreement last October under which North Korea accepted a $4.5 billion package of safer reactors and fuel in return for freezing its existing nuclear program, suspected by the West of being used to produce material for nuclear weapons. </P>
<P> The last round in Berlin broke off without progress two weeks ago when North Korea balked at Washington's insistence that the nuclear reactors be a South Korean model. </P>
<P> Pyongyang then threatened to restart some of its nuclear facilities. Washington warned it would again push for sanctions against Pyongyang if it carried out the threat. </P>
