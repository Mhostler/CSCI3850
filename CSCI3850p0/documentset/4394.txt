<P>  Second-seeded American Amy Frazier had her hands full with Dutch teenager Yvette Basting Thursday, barely surviving a second-round encounter at the IGA Classic tennis tournament. </P>
<P> Never in a comfortable position until the well into the third set against a player ranked 119 places below her, the 15th-ranked Frazier finally prevailed 4-6, 7-6 (7-5), 6-2 in just under two hours. </P>
<P> Frazier, who won this tournament in 1990 and reached the semifinals two of the last three years, managed to avoid facing a match point in the second set or the tie-break. But she was under serious pressure from the 17-year-old Basting throughout. </P>
<P> ``She is such a good player and hits so many good shots,'' Frazier said of the 134-ranked Basting. ``I had to fight the whole match. It seems like all the games were duece. </P>
<P> ``The depth is so unbelievable on tour. I know every person I play is going to be good. I was happy with the way I played because I wasn't quite sure what to expect.'' </P>
<P> Unseeded Audra Keller scored the day's lone upset when the 111-ranked American picked off sixth seed Nicole Bradtke of Australia 3-6, 7-5, 7-6 (7-2) in another second round match. Bradtke is ranked 54th in the world. </P>
