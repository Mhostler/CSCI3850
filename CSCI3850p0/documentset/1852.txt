<P>  Exiled Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin, condemned to death by Muslim fundamentalists, rejected Friday a French offer to grant her a three or four day visa after a government decision to admit her for just 24 hours sparked widespread outrage. </P>
<P> The press freedom group Reporters sans Frontieres (Reporters without Borders), which invited Nasrin for a week, said the foreign ministry had offered her a shorter stay as a compromise but she had replied: ``I will not come to France for the moment.'' </P>
<P> Political sources said Prime Minister Edouard Balladur had intervened to seek a solution after senior ministers argued in public over who was responsible for deciding that France could not guarantee Nasrin's safety for more than 24 hours. </P>
<P> But Nasrin's statement appeared to indicate his efforts had been rebuffed. </P>
<P> ``Why does France want to limit my freedom of movement and expression?'' the writer was quoted as saying. </P>
<P> Intellectuals and editorial writers lambasted the government for cowardice and incompetence Friday over the visa decision, saying it was an appeasement to Muslim fundamentalism at a time when Paris claimed to be combatting religious intolerance. </P>
