<DATELINE>BOSTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A grand jury returned seven indictments Tuesday against John Salvi, the suspected gunman charged with two murderous abortion clinic attacks in a Boston suburb.  Salvi is accused of shooting dead two women and wounding five other people in a rampage last year at two clinics. </P>
<P> The grand jury in Norfolk County, Mass. charged Salvi with two counts of first-degree murder and five counts of assault with intent to murder. </P>
<P> The attacks took place Dec. 30 at two Brookline, Mass. women's clinics where abortions are performed. </P>
<P> ``The Norfolk County grand jury took testimony from some 156 witnesses in sitting for 12 days ...,'' Norfolk County District Attorney William Delahunt told reporters. </P>
<P> Salvi is scheduled to appear Wednesday in the Norfolk County Superior Court. </P>
<P> Any federal prosecution of Salvi will be deferred until after the state trial, U.S. Attorney Donald Stern told reporters. </P>
<P> ``State authorities have demonstrated the ability and willingness to prosecute the case vigorously,'' Stern said. ''All options are open for the future.'' </P>
<P> Federal prosecutors are considering charging Salvi under a combination of federal laws. If federal charges are laid for first-degree and attempted murder, they could carry the death penalty and would skirt Massachusetts state laws, which do not provide for capital punishment. </P>
<P> Stern declined to say what charges may be levied against Salvi, who could become the first person to face the death penalty under the federal crime bill passed late last year. </P>
<P> Killed in the clinic shootings were Lee Ann Nichols, 38, of Salem, N.H., a receptionist at Preterm Health Services, and Shannon Lowney, 25, of Arlington, a receptionist at Planned Parenthood. The two clinics are located about a mile and a half apart in the same Brookline street. </P>
