<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Supreme Court Monday rejected an appeal arguing that a Pennsylvania law shielding doctors from liability lawsuits over prenatal advice interferes with a woman's right to choose an abortion. </P>
<P> The appeal challenged the law, which prevents children born with birth defects and their parents from bringing claims for damages, for imposing an unconstitutional burden on a woman's reproductive choices. </P>
<P> According to the lawsuit, the law was adopted with the intent of preventing women from choosing an abortion by protecting doctors from lawsuits over their failure to provide full prenatal information. </P>
<P> Such ``wrongful birth'' lawsuits arise when a doctor fails to tell a patient of possible genetic testing, fails to discover a disorder or fails to tell the woman of the diagnosis. ''Wrongful life'' lawsuits are brought on behalf of the child. </P>
<P> Eight states -- Idaho, Indiana, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, North and South Dakota and Utah -- have laws similar to the one in Pennsylvania. </P>
<P> The case involved Julie Sejpal, whose daughter was born in 1989 with Down syndrome. She sued her physicians for failing to provide complete and proper genetic counseling and testing. </P>
<P> The lawsuit charged the doctors failed to tell her the results of preliminary tests that showed she had a greater than normal risk of giving birth to a child with Down syndrome. </P>
<P> In addition, Sejpal had given her approval for a fallopian tubal ligation, a method of sterilization, to be performed immediately after the birth. </P>
<P> The doctor allegedly performed the procedure without telling the family of their daughter's condition and without determining if she still wanted the sterilization. </P>
<P> The lawsuit sought damages, arguing that Sejpal would have chosen an abortion or would have decided against the sterilization if the doctors had not been negligent. </P>
<P> The Pennsylvania state courts dismissed the lawsuit without addressing the constitutionality of the law. </P>
<P> Kathyrn Kolbert of the New York-based Center for Reproductive Law and Policy said in the appeal that the Supreme Court should order further state judicial proceedings so evidence can be presented on the law's constitutionality. </P>
<P> ``This case presents matters of grave public importance affecting the ability of women and families to make fully informed procreative decisions,'' she said. </P>
<P> Attorneys for the doctors replied that the law's constitutionality had not been considered by the state courts and could not be raised at the last-minute in the Supreme Court appeal. </P>
<P> The Supreme Court turned down the appeal without any comment or dissent. </P>
