<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Clinton's ratings with the public were significantly buoyed by his State of the Union speech, according to three nationwide polls conducted during or just after his 81-minute speech Tuesday evening. </P>
<P> In the biggest of the three polls, CBS News found that 85 percent of Americans approved of the proposals Clinton made in his address to a joint session of Congress, and 56 percent felt that he understood the problems facing the country better than Republicans in Congress. </P>
<P> CBS used interactive technology to poll 2,048 adults immediately after Clinton's unexpectedly long speech. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus two percentage points. </P>
<P> CBS said Americans were evenly split at 49 percent on whether Clinton or the Republicans in Congress would be more likely to bring about changes in government. </P>
<P> The upbeat tone conveyed by the CBS poll was mirrored in similar polls conducted by CNN/USA Today/Gallup and ABC News. </P>
<P> The CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll of 408 Americans conducted during the speech showed that 83 percent of Americans believed Clinton was leading the country in the right direction, up from 51 percent who held that view before the speech. </P>
<P> Eighty-six percent believed proposals outlined by Clinton Tuesday evening would significantly improve the state of the nation, while only 12 percent believed they would not. </P>
<P> In the speech, Clinton admitted he had made mistakes, but called on both parties to ``put aside partisanship, pettiness and pride'' and work to tackle the nation's problems. </P>
<P> He called for more and better jobs, expanded educational opportunities, a fairer tax system and political reform, as well as outlining new initiatives, including a drive to curb teen pregnancy and raise the $4.25 hourly minimum wage. </P>
<P> But while Americans appeared enthusiastic about Clinton's proposals, they were considerably less certain he would actually be able to implement them, the CNN poll showed. </P>
<P> Fifty-five percent believed Clinton would be able to accomplish a significant number of his new initiatives, while 39 percent doubted that, it showed. </P>
<P> After the speech, sixty-six percent of Americans believe Clinton has been somewhat or very successful at solving the nation's problems since taking office two years ago, up from 54 percent before his remarks. </P>
<P> Thirty-three percent believed he had been somewhat or very unsuccessful in solving problems, down from 44 percent who held that view before the speech. </P>
<P> The CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll had a margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points. </P>
<P> ABC News polled 507 adults immediately after the speech ended, and it too found that a high percentage of the 296 people who watched Clinton's speech -- 79 percent -- approved of most of what Clinton said. </P>
<P> Seventy-six percent supported his call for a higher minimum wage, 87 percent favored Clinton's proposed tax cuts for middle class Americans, and 73 percent supported the federal program that helps pay college tuition for young people after they complete community service jobs. </P>
<P> But a majority of Americans still don't believe Clinton deserves another term as president, the poll showed. Fifty-five percent don't believe Clinton deserves a second term, compared to 41 percent who say he does. </P>
<P> However, that does represent a slight improvement from a similar poll taken in August, when only 38 percent said he deserved a second term and 56 percent said he did not. </P>
<P> The ABC poll had a margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points. </P>
