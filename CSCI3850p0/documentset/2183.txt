<P>  Australian-born media mogul Rupert Murdoch has been named Hollywood's ``top player'' in Entertainment Weekly magazine's annual Power 101 survey. </P>
<P> The 63-year-old Murdoch, whose News Corp empire has interests throughout the world in movies, television, cable and publishing, moves up from last year's number-five position, unseating Tele-Communications Inc chairman John Malone who tumbles to 23 in the magazine's Top-101. </P>
<P> ``In the year of Tonya & Nancy, Lyle & Erik, Lorena & John, and O.J. & Nicole, it's only appropriate that the most powerful man in entertainment launched his empire with a string of Australian rags famous for headlines like 'Leper Rapes Virgin, Gives Birth to Monster Baby','' the magazine said. </P>
<P> Viacom chairman Sumner Redstone moves to the runner-up position from fourth, while Gerald Levin, chairman of Time Warner Inc which publishes Entertainment Weekly, slips to third. Oscar-winning director, producer and budding studio owner Steven Spielberg rises to fourth from 13. </P>
<P> New entrants include MCA chairman Lew Wasserman in seventh, television producer Aaron Spelling in 50th, actor Jim Carrey in 67th, author Tom Clancy in 72nd, ``gangsta'' rap pioneer Dr Dre in 78th, radio humorist and moviemaker Howard Stern in 85th and Microsoft chairman Bill Gates in 100th. </P>
<P> Talk show host David Letterman's mom Dorothy debuts in 101st, while her son moves to 18th from 28th. </P>
<P> Players kicked off the list included volatile Guns n' Roses vocalist W. Axl Rose, Barney the Dinosaur and Lawrence Kasdan, who directed this summer's flop ``Wyatt Earp.'' </P>
