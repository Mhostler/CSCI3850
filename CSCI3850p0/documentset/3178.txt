<P>  Slovak President Michal Kovac swore in nationalist Vladimir Meciar as prime minister Tuesday for his third term in as many years, ending 10 weeks of political limbo for the country. </P>
<P> Meciar, who was ousted last March in a no-confidence vote, will lead a coalition of his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) and two fringe parties, the left-wing Workers' Party and the far-right Slovak National Party. </P>
<P> The ceremony at Bratislava castle gave Slovakia a new government 10 weeks and three days after HZDS won the first elections since independence with 35 percent of the vote. </P>
<P> Kovac played a leading role in Meciar's downfall, the second of his stormy political career, nine months ago. </P>
<P> During campaigning Kovac questioned his suitability as government leader, warning voters against a Meciar personality cult and saying he could scare off foreign investors. </P>
<P> After signing the oath of office, Meciar smiled broadly and shook Kovac's hand. Kovac remained stony-faced. </P>
<P> Both of Meciar's past governments fell apart as much due to disputes over his strong leadership style as policies. He first fell in March 1991 when he was premier of the Slovak Republic, then part of the Czechoslovak federation. </P>
<P> The three parties of his latest coalition hold 83 seats in the 150-member parliament, seven short of the three-fifths majority they would need to unseat Kovac. </P>
<P> Analysts say Meciar was forced to ally with fringe parties because mainstream groups, notably the reformed communists, refused to join his government. </P>
<P> While immediate political uncertainty is over, many questions surround the new government's policies, which it must present for a parliamentary confidence vote within 30 days. </P>
<P> Meciar said Monday he wanted to delay a huge privatization program that is due to start Thursday. </P>
<P> More than three million Slovaks have registered for the coupon privatization program, under which ordinary citizens can buy vouchers for a nominal price and use them to bid for stock in state enterprises. </P>
