<P>  French President Francois Mitterrand tried to stop Paris-Match from publishing pictures of his illegitimate daughter, Mazarine, but the weekly went ahead without his permission, sources close to him said Friday. </P>
<P> The sources said Mitterrand was told last month that Paris-Match planned to print the photographs and his office appealed to the magazine not to do so. </P>
<P> ``We were informed three weeks ago by Paris-Match of such a project. After we made an approach opposing publication, the editors of Paris-Match said they would not do so. They obviously changed their minds without telling us,'' a source close to the president said. </P>
<P> Mitterrand, in office since 1981, has two sons by his wife, Danielle. Paris-Match said she first met Mazarine and her mother in 1992 when the president had a prostate cancer operation. </P>
<P> The magazine ran the pictures Thursday, unleashing a torrent of condemnation from the French media and the political establishment. </P>
<P> Newspapers deplored the breach of a longstanding convention shielding politicians' private lives and warned of the danger of British-style gutter journalism in France. </P>
<P> The presidential sources denied the magazine's assertion that Mazarine had accompanied Mitterrand on a state visit to South Africa in July but confirmed she attended an official Elysee palace dinner for the emperor of Japan last month. </P>
<P> The photographs, taken without his knowledge with a long lens, showed Mitterrand, 78, leaving a Paris restaurant with the dark-haired 20-year-old student. </P>
<P> The photographic agency Gamma said it was not the source of the pictures, which Paris-Match had credited to the agency. </P>
<P> Gamma editor Floris de Bonneville said the pictures were credited to Gamma photograher Alexis Orand due to an error by the magazine. Orand had taken pictures of a Frenchman climbing New York skyscrapers which appeared on other pages. </P>
<P> The conservative daily Le Figaro described publication of the Mitterrand pictures as ``pigsty journalism'' and the popular daily France-Soir warned against following the Anglo-Saxon media's example and pursuing politicians into their beds. </P>
<P> In contrast to Britain and the United States, the media in France traditionally draws a discreet veil over public figures' personal lives. It is an offense to publish photographs without the permission of the subject, although Mitterrand has pledged never to sue a newspaper. </P>
<P> ``For years, France had remained an island of wisdom in the ocean of disclosures that pollute American, British, Italian or German newspapers,'' Le Figaro said. </P>
<P> ``If all eyes look below the belt, are we not going to furthermore discredit a political class already destabilized by financial scandals?'' it asked. </P>
<P> France-Soir said the unprecedented pictures plunged the French press into the ruthless world of British and U.S. media ``which think policy is also made on the pillow.'' </P>
<P> ``It is hard to see how the fact that he has an illegitimate daughter can or will influence the head of state in his mission,'' it added. </P>
