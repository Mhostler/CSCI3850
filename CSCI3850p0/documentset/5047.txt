<P>  The Defense Department informed Congress Monday that Greece wants to buy Raytheon-made improvement kits for its Hawk missile battery ground support systems for $150 million. </P>
<P> It said Greece would use the modification kits to improve its air defenses and said the sale would not upset the military balance in the region. </P>
<P> Such weapons sales must be made through the governments involved, not directly with the manufacturer, and the Defense Department must notify Congress in advance to give it a chance to block a sale if opposition is strong enough. </P>
