<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Former Indian Prime Minister Morarji Desai was cremated on the site of his guide Mahatma Gandhi's retreat Wednesday to the sound of booming canon and the chanting of ancient Hindu scriptures. </P>
<P> Desai, who became the country's oldest prime minister at the age of 81 when he swept Indira Gandhi out of power in 1977, died Monday aged 99. </P>
<P> His only son, Kantibhai Desai, and grandsons lit the sandlewood funeral pyre along the banks of the sacred Sabarmati River in western India as Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao, cabinet members and opposition leaders stood solemnly by. </P>
<P> Thousands of people flocked to the ashram, or religious retreat, built by the late Mahatma Gandhi, India's apostle of peace and non-violence, and Desai's mentor. </P>
<P> The cremation in the city of Ahmedabad was broadcast live on state television as the nation observed a second day of mourning that closed banks, stock and commodity markets, government offices, schools and colleges. </P>
<P> The shutdown created major difficulties for money and stock market traders. Thursday and Friday were already scheduled as holidays, and Desai's death resulted in markets and government offices being effectively shut down for a whole week ahead of Easter. </P>
<P> Bowing to pressure from cash-starved bank clients, the Reserve Bank of India ordered all banks to keep their branches open for a full day instead of a half day Saturday. </P>
<P> The government authorized customs offices to open Wednesday and Saturday to avoid bringing trade to a standstill. </P>
<P> Thousands of mourners lined the route of the funeral procession, throwing garlands on the gun carriage bearing Desai's body. </P>
<P> Crowds of people shouted ``Morarji Lives Forever'' and ``Victory to Mother India'' and sang praise for the Hindu god Ram, local agencies said. </P>
<P> Desai, the first prime minister to be cremated outside the capital New Delhi, had lain in state for two days in Bombay before being flown to Ahmedabad. </P>
<P> Like many politicians of his generation, Desai's principles flowered in India's epic independence struggle. </P>
<P> But his rule turned out to be a brief interlude in Indira Gandhi's lengthy domination of Indian politics. He lasted only 27 months before resigning amid internal party bickering, and she reclaimed power. </P>
