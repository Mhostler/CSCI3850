<P>  An international animal-rights groups said Sunday that a proposed Sino-Canadian trade deal could threaten the world's seal population. </P>
<P> At a news conference in Hong Kong, the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) voiced concern on the eve of talks between China's Shanghai Fisheries Corporation and a sealing industry delegation from Canada's Magdalen Islands. </P>
<P> IFAW said the Canadians were hoping to greatly expand trade in seal parts and products and that China could take the blame for wiping out seal herds if it responded. </P>
<P> ``We fear that seals around the world are doomed if Canada succeeds in its efforts to develop a demand for seal products in China and the Far East,'' said Richard Moore, the group's executive director. </P>
<P> The Fund said Shanghai Fisheries bought 50,000 seals last year from Terra Nova Fishery in Newfoundland, with the economics of the deal relying on substantial Canadian government subsidies. </P>
<P> The group, based in Massachusetts in the United States and claiming 1.4 million supporters worldwide, claimed that Canada was spending millions of dollars to find new markets for the sealing industry, which was devastated by a European import ban on baby seal products imposed in 1983. </P>
<P> It said Canada was trying to replace income lost from its hard-hit fishing industry and that the government maintains that seals are partly responsible for the fishing crisis by eating cod, one of the key commercial species in Canadian waters. </P>
