<DATELINE>THE HAGUE (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A bomb at a shopping mall in The Hague slightly injured seven people Friday, but Dutch police said they did not suspect terrorism. </P>
<P> ``We are not working on that assumption,'' police spokeswoman Ineke Bennema said. ``There are no political targets in the neighborhood.'' </P>
<P> No one immediately claimed responsibilty for the explosion, police said. The bomb, planted in a metal litter bin, shattered several windows. </P>
<P> Police could not say whether it was professionally manufactured or whether it was made from fireworks. </P>
