<P>  President Kim Young-sam warned Saturday that South Korea would push for sanctions against North Korea if the communist state failed to resolve the dispute over its nuclear program in talks with the United States. </P>
<P> Taking a tough line on the North, Kim also said the annual ``Team Spirit'' military exercises between Seoul and Washington would be resumed unless the North agrees to halt its suspected development of nuclear weapons. </P>
<P> ``If the North is genuinely interested in establishing peace on the Korean Peninsula, it must stop its nuclear development,'' Kim told local reporters. </P>
<P> Kim said if on-going talks between the North and United States on the nuclear question ended in failure, ``the issue will be brought to the United Nations Security Council (for possible sanctions). That is the only alternative.'' </P>
<P> In Geneva, U.S. and North Korean negotiators were reported still far from agreement Friday in talks on reshaping Pyongyang's nuclear program to ensure it cannot produce atomic weapons. </P>
<P> The negotiators in Geneva have been trying to build on an outline accord reached in August under which Pyongyang agreed to freeze its graphite nuclear reactor program and switch to a safer, light-water version with international financing. </P>
<P> In an inteview with the New York Times published Saturday, Kim accused the Clinton administration of being naive and eager to compromise in negotiations with North Korea. </P>
<P> Kim attacked Washington's basic stance in the talks and said the administration must increase the pressure on North Korea. </P>
<P> He told the Times the North Korean government was close to a possible economic and political crisis and would bend to pressure. </P>
<P> ``If the United States wants to settle with a half-baked compromise and the media wants to describe it as a good agreement, they can. But I think it would bring more peril and danger,'' Kim said in the interview. </P>
<P> Kim told the Times further compromise would prolong the life of the North Korean government, which he said was manipulating the United States. </P>
<P> ``We should not make any more concessions in the future. Time is on our side ... It is North Korea that is restless,'' he said. </P>
<P> Diplomats and senior officials in the Clinton administration have said increased pressure on the Communist North could bring the divided peninsula close to war. </P>
