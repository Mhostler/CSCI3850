<P>  British Prime Minister John Major and newly elected Irish Prime Minister John Bruton agreed Tuesday to breathe new life into the search for peace in Northern Ireland after a month-long political vacuum in Dublin. </P>
<P> Major and Bruton, elected last Thursday after the downfall of former premier Albert Reynolds, decided officials and then their foreign ministers would meet in early January to try to surmount obstacles to all-party talks in the province. </P>
<P> Major said he was delighted that Bruton and Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring had accepted his invitation to talks so soon after taking office. </P>
<P> ``I think that shows that they share the same determination as their predecessor government to make speedy progress, effective progress and lasting progress toward peace,'' Major told reporters outside his Downing Street residence. </P>
<P> Bruton, standing alongside Major, said he thought the ``get-acquainted'' session would speed up the talks process. </P>
<P> ``There are a number of issues remaining to be resolved, but I think that this meeting shows a determination on both our parts to resolve those issues quickly,'' he said. </P>
<P> The two governments are seeking to put together a so-called framework document that will serve as a starting point for talks on a political settlement to cement recent cease-fires by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and its pro-British extremist Protestant foes. </P>
<P> Major said he and Bruton had refused to set a target date for completion of the framework document. But he denied the talks were in trouble and said they were both optimistic about prospects for agreement. </P>
<P> Major and Bruton said they had no confirmation of who planted a potentially lethal bomb in the border town of Enniskillen Sunday evening. The device was safely defused. </P>
<P> The IRA, which ushered in a new era of peace with its August 31 cease-fire, denied planting the bomb and its political arm, Sinn Fein, Tuesday accused British agents of responsibility. </P>
