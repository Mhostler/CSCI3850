<P>  Indian authorities reimposed a strict 24-hour curfew in parts of the Kashmir city of Srinagar Tuesday and warned that violators would be fired on as violent protests flared up again following last week's destruction of a Muslim shrine. </P>
<P> Police sources said a strict curfew had been clamped back on eight areas of the city of one million people after demonstrators took advantage of an easing of controls to clash with police. </P>
<P> Residents said police vehicles with loudhailers toured areas where the curfew had been reimposed warning that troops had been issued orders to shoot at anyone violating the restrictions. </P>
<P> Police fired tear gas and used bamboo sticks to disperse rock-throwing crowds in at least 11 locations in Srinagar, the summer capital of India's only Muslim-majority state, Jammu and Kashmir, Tuesday, police sources said. </P>
<P> They said that at least 19 people were injured in the clashes, including four policemen hit by flying rocks. </P>
<P> The sources said there were also at least five peaceful demonstrations in the city, in two of which protesters burned effigies of Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao. </P>
<P> In the northwestern Kashmir town of Sopore, 30 miles from Srinagar, the sources said, crowds of protesters set ablaze a car and a jeep belonging to the state Horticultural Department. </P>
<P> Police sources said a 24-hour curfew had also been imposed in the town of Bhaderwah in Jammu in the south of the state on Tuesday following demonstrations after two separatist guerrillas were killed in police fire. </P>
<P> They said the guerrillas had thrown a grenade at a Hindu temple, injuring a priest and a member of the security forces. </P>
<P> An army spokesman said it had ended its operations in the town of Charar-e-Sharief, gutted along with its 15th century shrine to the patron saint of Kashmir, Sheik Nooruddin Wali, last week, and was handing over control of the area to police. </P>
<P> The destruction of the shrine, one of Kashmir's most popular pilgrim centres, has inflamed residents of the Himalayan region, and a strict round-the-clock curfew in place since last Thursday has failed to stop street protests and arson attacks. </P>
<P> The army, fighting a five-year-old insurgency in Kashmir against Muslim separatists, says guerrillas razed the shrine and several hundred surrounding homes. The militants say the army started the fires. </P>
<P> Fire service sources said there had been 37 incidents of arson in the Kashmir valley since Monday evening. Most of the attacks were overnight, but fire tenders could be heard around Srinagar Tuesday. </P>
<P> More than 100 arson attacks have been reported throughout the Kashmir valley in the past five days, mostly aimed at government offices, small Hindu temples and the homes of Hindu Kashmiris who have fled the region. In many cases gasoline bombs have been thrown into the buildings. </P>
<P> The All Party Hurriyat (Freedom) Conference, a coalition of more than 30 political, religious and social organizations with wide support in the Kashmir Valley, has appealed for an end to the arson, saying it is against the teachings of Islam and the spirit of religious tolerance of Kashmir. </P>
<P> Rao has come under fierce criticism for the administration's handling of the Charar-e-Sharief affair, which has jeopardised state assembly elections that were being planned for next month. </P>
