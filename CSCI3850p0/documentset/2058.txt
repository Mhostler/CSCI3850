<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Nearly 70,000 people took to the streets of Los Angeles Sunday in a protest march against the controversial ``Save Our State'' measure, a California ballot proposal that would cut off most public services to illegal immigrants. </P>
<P> Billed as one of the largest protests ever mounted for immigrant rights, the procession of chanting, sign-waving protesters started out in mostly Hispanic East Los Angeles and snaked along a four-mile route to the steps of City Hall. </P>
<P> Police equipped with riot gear stood by and a number of streets were cordoned off, but authorities said there were no signs of serious trouble. ``For such a large crowd, it was incredibly quiet,'' said police spokesman Arthur Holmes. </P>
<P> In the city's sprawling Mexican immigrant community, it was the largest demonstration yet of strong opposition to Proposition 187, which would bar illegal immigrants from public schools, non-emergency medical services and welfare rolls. </P>
<P> Only three weeks before the Nov. 8 election, the measure is favored by 59 percent of likely voters and opposed by 33 percent, according to a Los Angeles Times poll. </P>
<P> Marching to the festive beat of mariachi musicians, protesters accused the measure's sponsors of immigrant-bashing and worried that its passage could throw more than 300,000 children out of the state's public schools. </P>
<P> Police put the crowd's size at about 70,000, but unofficial estimates ran as high as 100,000. </P>
<P> United Farm Workers union official Arturo Rodriguez, son-in-law of the late labor leader Cesar Chavez, said the march showed that Latinos ``are just tired of hearing people use immigrants as the scapegoats.'' </P>
<P> But Ron Prince, a spokesman for the ``Save Our State'' cause, told radio station KFWB that the measure will not only curb the influx from Mexico, but may ``encourage illegal aliens already here to pack up and leave.'' </P>
<P> In addition to cutting off most basic services, the measure would call on teachers, doctors and police to act as ''snitches'' and report those suspected of being illegal aliens. </P>
<P> Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, who has rebounded to take a solid lead in the polls in his re-election bid, has made the get-tough measure the cornerstone of his campaign. His Democratic challenger, state Treasurer Kathleen Brown, strongly opposes it. </P>
<P> Political analysts attribute the measure's popularity to a growing sense among California voters that their state is being overrun by illegal Mexican immigrants who are draining the public coffers. </P>
<P> But opponents -- a coalition of civil rights activists, union leaders, clergy and law-enforcement officials -- say it would create a new underclass -- and vow to tie Proposition 187 up in the courts with a legal challenge if it passes. </P>
