<P>  Organizations around the world decry heavy metal lyrics that put down women and promote sexual violence, but a new study suggests the music the words are sung to is at least as important as the words. </P>
<P> Steven Kruse, a researcher in psychology at the University of Florida studied 178 students and found that young men who listened to heavy metal lyrics with music were much more likely to agree with statements that denigrated women than those who listened to the words alone. </P>
<P> ``It is not the sexually violent lyrics that affect behavior, it is the music itself,'' Kruse said . </P>
<P> To conduct his research, Kruse divided University of Florida freshman and sophomores into four groups who listened to heavy metal music with sexually violent lyrics, instrumental heavy metal, sexually violent lyrics read aloud with no music and classical or ``easy listening'' music. </P>
<P> One survey on gender attitudes was given to the young men before they listened to the music or lyrics and another was given afterward. </P>
<P> The researchers found men most likely to agree with statements including, ``Women should never argue with their husbands in public,'' ``It is ridiculous for women to move a locomotive and for men to darn socks,'' and ``It is childish for a woman to assert her independence by retaining her maiden name after marriage'' after listening to heavy metal music and lyrics. </P>
<P> But men who listened to sexually violent lyrics alone were far less likely to agree with such statements. In fact, their attitudes fell midway between those who had listened to heavy metal words and music and those who had heard classical music, Kruse said. </P>
<P> ``The lyrics are rather irrelevant. It is the music that is having some sort of effect,'' Kruse said. </P>
<P> Songs used for the study were, ``On Your Knees'' by Great White, ``To Young to Fall in Love'' and ``Livewire'' by Motley Crue, ``Eat Me Alive'' by Judas Priest, and ``Let Me Put My Love Into You'' by AC/DC. </P>
