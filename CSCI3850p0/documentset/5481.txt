<DATELINE>PARIS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A Socialist Paris city councillor Wednesday asked Mayor Jacques Chirac, conservative frontrunner in the French presidential race, to order an audit of the city-run, low-cost housing firm that owns Chirac's luxury apartment. </P>
<P> ``The French people have the right to know. So speak up,'' Councillor Bertrand Delanoe, president of the council's Socialist bloc, wrote to Chirac. </P>
<P> The satirical weekly Le Canard Enchaine reported last week that subsidized housing company SGIM, jointly owned by the city and a holding company controlled by friends of the mayor, bought the building in which Chirac lives. </P>
<P> Its officers wanted to ensure he could not be forced out or have his rent raised, it said. </P>
<P> The weekly said Chirac, who has a vast official apartment at City Hall, used the SGIM-owned apartment privately. </P>
<P> ``To assure complete openness in this affair, I ask you to order the state auditing agency to shed all the necessary light on the operations, investments and social missions of the subsidized housing firm, SGIM,'' wrote Delanoe. </P>
<P> A Chirac campaign aide said the mayor considered his home to be a personal matter and noted that he had already denied any impropriety surrounding the apartment. </P>
<P> The newspaper said Chirac paid a monthly rent of $2,200 -- about half the normal rate -- for the spacious ground-floor apartment, complete with private garden, in a villa in a chic Left Bank neighborhood. </P>
<P> Delanoe said the transaction was a scandal given the French capital's high homelessness rate. </P>
<P> Judicial authorities already are investigating subsidized housing programs in the Paris area which are suspected of providing illegal funding for Chirac's neo-Gaulllst RPR party. </P>
<P> Two former senior aides to Chirac are being probed in connection with the alleged scheme. Last December, Delanoe had asked Chirac to order an independent audit of all area subsidized housing operations over the past decade. </P>
<P> Chirac had yet to respond to the request, Delanoe said in his latest letter. </P>
