<P>  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin initialed a draft treaty with Jordan Monday and said he hoped the two countries would sign a full treaty in the Middle East at the end of next week. </P>
<P> ``The ceremony will be in the area, I hope at the end of next week,'' he said in remarks broadcast by Israel Radio from Amman where the radio said he and the Jordanian prime minister initialed the draft agreement. </P>
<P> Israel Television said the signing of the full treaty would take place Oct. 27. </P>
<P> President Clinton Monday hailed the draft peace accord and said it shows the alternative to the hatreds that still stalk the Middle East.

<P> ``I can't tell you exactly where it will be at this stage but probably it will be somewhere on the border,'' Jordan's King Hussein said at a news conference. Israeli officials earlier said some details still had to be worked out. </P>
<P> Speaking with reporters at Andrews Air Force Base, in suburban Maryland, Clinton said the the leaders of Israel and Jordan ``today resolved that their nations should henceforth live in peace and as good neighbors.'' </P>
<P> Clinton said that at a time when hatred and extremism still stalk the Mideast, Rabin and King Hussein had shown that ''nations can put conflict behind them.'' </P>
