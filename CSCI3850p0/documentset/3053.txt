<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Say goodbye to ``National Random Acts of Kindness Week.'' Bid a fond farewell to ``National Pizza and Pasta Day.'' And say so long to ``National Good Teens Day.''  One in a series of internal reforms approved Wednesday by House Republicans would bar so-called commemorative legislation creating special days, weeks or months to celebrate everything from asparagus to square dancing to biomedical research. </P>
<P> Republicans, who will take control of the House in January for the first time in 40 years, estimate that the commemorative legislation costs taxpayers about $300,000 per year. </P>
<P> The special bills have long been the bane of overworked congressional staffers who have to field a multitude of phone calls on such weighty topics as ``Classical Music Month'' or ''Education and Sharing Day'' as eager sponsors try to round up the support of 218 lawmakers to pass their bills. </P>
<P> Incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia shrugged off suggestions that the decision to dump commemoratives might anger Americans or the Democratic party. </P>
<P> ``We'll offer lower taxes ... They (Democrats) can offer more commemoratives,'' Gingrich said. </P>
<P> Some of the bills address weightier issues such as remembering World War II or drawing attention to illnesses such as Lyme Disease and breast cancer. </P>
<P> But many of the special pieces of legislation address the spectrum of special interests, hobbies and foods that make up American life. </P>
<P> While the rules change must still be voted on by the full House in January, the change looks like a done deal. </P>
<P> So, for all you who forgot to celebrate May 1-7 as National Walking Week or completely missed the fact that Nov. 14 was National Geography Week or spaced out on National Character Counts Week, which ended Oct. 22 -- tough luck. </P>
<P> But you still have time to throw a party to celebrate the fact that 1994 has been designated as ``The Year of Gospel Music -- and all of 1995 to celebrate the ``Year of the Grandparent.'' </P>
