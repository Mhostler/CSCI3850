<P>  Colin Ferguson, on trial for killing six people and wounding 19 others in a shooting spree aboard a Long Island railroad train, backed out of a Larry King interview Tuesday when he learned the show would be taped, his legal adviser said. </P>
<P> Ferguson, who is defending himself at his murder and attempted murder trial, was supposed to appear on the show Tuesday night, but backed out when prison authorities refused to let him do it live. </P>
<P> His legal adviser Alton Rose said Ferguson refused to do a taped show with King because he feared it would be edited. </P>
<P> Ferguson started his defense case Tuesday but called only one witness -- a police detective who works with the prosecution. Nassau County Court Judge Donald Belfi ordered Ferguson to present his full case Wednesday, including making a decision as to whether he will testify in his own behalf. </P>
<P> The judge also chided Ferguson for delaying and complaining that he had insufficient time to prepare his case. </P>
<P> ``You had time to do television interviews, did you not?'' the judge asked, referring to a ``Today'' show interview Ferguson did Tuesday morning and another television interview he did Monday night. </P>
<P> Ferguson called Nassau County Detective Brian Parpan as a witness to ask him whether police had uncovered another man with his name who also came from Kingston, Jamaica. </P>
<P> Parpan, who corrected Ferguson whenever he called him by the lower rank of ``officer,'' said there was another man with his name but that man had nothing to do with the murder case. </P>
<P> Sixteen survivors of the December 1993 shooting have identified Ferguson at the trial as the gunman. He was arrested at the scene after he was wrestled to the ground by passengers. </P>
<P> Ferguson, who is black, claims a white man took his gun from his case and shot passengers on the the train as part of a government conmspiracy against him. A former lawyer of his says that Ferguson is not guilty by reason of insanity. </P>
