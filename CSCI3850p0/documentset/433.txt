<DATELINE>LONDON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Two British women were extradited to the United States Wednesday to face trial on murder conspiracy charges after they failed in a last-minute High Court bid to stay in England. </P>
<P> Aromatherapy teacher Susan Hagan, 47, and chartered accountant Sally Croft, 44, are wanted for allegedly conspiring to kill Oregon state attorney Charles Turner in 1985 when they were members of the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh religious cult. </P>
<P> The two were driven to their United Airlines flight at London's Heathrow airport in a police van after a tearful farewell to family and friends at the airport police station. </P>
<P> An official from the U.S. embassy in London was accompanying them for the eight-hour flight to New York. </P>
<P> In a ruling earlier Wednesday, the High Court rejected an appeal against their extradition by Hagan of Bedmond, southern England, and Croft, of Totnes in southwest England, who argued they would not receive a fair trial in the United States. </P>
<P> The two are accused in the U.S. of conspiring to kill Turner as he investigated the cult, dubbed the ``Orange People'' because its followers wore brightly colored robes. </P>
<P> But the women say they fear ``trial by media'' because of anti-Bhagwan sentiment in the state. </P>
