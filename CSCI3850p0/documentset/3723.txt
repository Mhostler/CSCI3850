<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A plane carrying 52 people exploded in mid-air, split in two and crashed in flames on a farm in northern Colombia Wednesday evening and first reports from eyewitnesses and officials spoke of only one confirmed survivor. </P>
<P> The Colombian Civil Aviation Authority said in a statement that the Intercontinental de Aviacion DC-9 jet crashed minutes before it was due to land at the Caribbean coast holiday resort of Cartagena on a domestic flight from Bogota. </P>
<P> The plane, carrying 47 people and five crew, plunged to the ground near the town of Maria La Baja, about 330 miles north of Bogota shortly after receiving authorization from air traffic control to descend to 8,000 feet prior to landing, the statement said. </P>
<P> RCN Radio, quoting eyewitnesses, said the plane blew up and crashed on a farm located near swamps and that only one survivor, a young girl named Erica Delgado traveling with her family, had so far been rescued from the wreckage. There was no immediate word on the fate of the other passengers. </P>
<P> ``This a very sad thing for the country,'' Alvaro Raad Gomez, director of the Civil Aviation Authority, said in a radio interview. ``The plane exploded at 14,000 feet during its descent.'' </P>
<P> Raad said the plane's last contact with air traffic control was to request permission to descend from 19,000 feet to 8,000 feet prior to landing. The pilot did not report any problem at the time, he added. </P>
<P> ``An aeroplane which was traveling behind the DC-9 saw the explosion which came at that moment,'' he said. </P>
<P> Asked about survivors, Raad said, ``For those of us who know anything about aviation it is practically a miracle for us, a miracle of God (that there was) a survivor from an explosion on an airplane like the one of this DC-9 which exploded in the air''. </P>
<P> Alfonso Ramirez, the manager of Intercontinental de Aviacion, said he could not be certain about the causes of the crash but said the plane's maintenance records showed that it was in good condition and had been checked recently. </P>
<P> Air traffic officials said the plane last made radio contact at 7:38 pm local time and crashed two minutes later. </P>
<P> Cartagena's hospitals were put on maximum alert because of the disaster, the latest in a series of plane crashes in Colombia. </P>
<P> International airline passenger and pilots groups have rated Colombia one of the world's most dangerous countries in which to fly because of a series of safety and air traffic lapses. </P>
<P> The last major air disaster in Colombia was on May 19, 1993, when a SAM Airlines jet crashed into a mountain near the city of Medellin on a flight from Panama, killing all 132 people aboard. </P>
<P> Since then there have been several smaller crashes involving small planes on regional flights, with 11 people killed in May 1994 and 7 killed in April 1994. </P>
