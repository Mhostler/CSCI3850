<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Ernesto Zedillo, the candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), was set to win Mexico's watershed presidential elections held Sunday with around 50 percent of the vote, according to two unofficial forecasts. </P>
<P> The projections, by private TV network Television Azteca and polling firms Indemerc-Louis Harris and Mitofsky International, gave Zedillo a wider victory than virtually any forecast by pre-election opinion polls. </P>
<P> Official results were expected later Sunday or early Monday. </P>
<P> The government promised this would be the cleanest election in the country's history. Past votes, including the 1988 victory by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, have been tainted by fraud. </P>
<P> After a tumultuous year with a peasant uprising in the state of Chiapas and the March 23 assassination of then-PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, many here believe Mexico's political stability is riding on a clean election. </P>
<P> Some disturbances were reported at polling places which ran out of ballots in Guadalajara, in the guerrilla stronghold of Chiapas and in the capital Mexico City. </P>
<P> But there were no immediate claims by opposition parties of systematic fraud or major irregularities in the elections, in which Mexicans also choose all 500 members of the lower house of Congress and 96 of the 128-seat Senate. </P>
<P> Azteca said Zedillo would win with 51.8 percent of the vote, while Harris-Mitofsky said an exit poll and quick count showed Zedillo would win with about 50 percent. </P>
<P> Azteca predicted Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the conservative National Action Party would get 24.1 percent of the vote and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the center-left Democratic Revolution Party 17.3 percent, while Harris-Mitofsky projected Fernandez to win 27 percent and Cardenas 16 percent. </P>
<P> Zedillo earlier told reporters he was ``happier than I expected to be'' when asked about his party's own projections. </P>
<P> He declined to predict victory but also said he found it unlikely that his Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) would lose its majority in the lower house of Congress, where it was seen under most threat. </P>
<P> Sunday's vote was also the first test of Mexico's political system since the country signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the United States and Canada. It is seen as a measure of whether the country can match its sweeping economic reforms with a transition to full democracy. </P>
<P> As many as 70 percent of the country's 45.7 million registered voters were expected to cast ballots in the high-stakes election, which many feared could erupt into violence if the results appeared rigged. </P>
<P> In the most serious incident reported, police fired tear gas to disperse several hundred people who threw stones and broke windows at the town hall in Tuxtla Gutierrez, the capital of Chiapas, after they were unable to vote at polling stations which ran out of voting slips. </P>
<P> In the city of Tapachula, also in Chiapas, several hundred people destroyed a voting booth after they too were unable to cast their ballots because of a lack of voting slips. </P>
<P> An IFE spokeswoman said the shortage was in part the result of ``the enthusiastic response'' of Mexican voters. </P>
<P> The situation was an unusual one in Mexico where voter turnout has never been high. It was 48 percent in the 1988 election, which was believed to have been marred by fraud. </P>
<P> Recent electoral reforms assure a much stronger opposition in the PRI-dominated national congress, which traditionally has been a rubber stamp for the president. </P>
<P> The government also spent $1 billion to revamp its electoral system in an attempt to eliminate vote-rigging, but Mexicans remain suspicious that the PRI-dominated government can conduct a clean election. </P>
<P> In Chiapas earlier, thousands of Maya campesinos trekked for hours from remote villages to vote for the first time. </P>
<P> Emerging from decades of isolation from the affairs of the nation, the brightly dressed Maya Indians lined up next to soldiers posted in Chiapas since a January 1 rebellion to cast their ballots. </P>
<P> ``I walked since yesterday to get here,'' Maria Xoche, a 35-year-old peasant woman carrying a baby wrapped in a bright blue shawl, told Reuters in Ocosingo, the site of bloody clashes between the rebels and government troops in January. </P>
