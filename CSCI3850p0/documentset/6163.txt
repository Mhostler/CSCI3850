<DATELINE>PYONGYANG, North Korea (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Stalinist stalwart North Korea marked the traditional communist May Day holiday Sunday with a choreographed mass spectacle designed as much to dazzle visiting foreigners as to hail socialism. </P>
<P> The display of lock-step dancing by tens of thousands of citizens in Pyongyang's Kim Il-sung Square nonetheless made clear an ideological Cold War still rends the Korean peninsula and the communist government is determined to avoid the fate of the Soviet Union and other fallen Marxist allies. </P>
<P> On a central stage dancers in Korean People's Army uniforms sliced the cool evening air with bayonets fixed to assault rifles and a choir sang paeans to the communist Korean Workers' Party and late revolutionary ``great leader'' Kim Il-Sung. </P>
<P> Dominating the square was a huge version of the ubiquitous portraits of Kim who has been deified in North Korea for decades and who died July 8, 1994. </P>
<P> Kim's son and successor, the ``dear leader'' Kim Jong-il, did not attend the May Day eve celebration. </P>
<P> The festivities were witnessed by thousands of foreign visitors attracted to North Korea by the quirky Pyongyang International Sports and Cultural Festival for Peace featuring fake theatrical wrestling bouts between Japanese and Americans. </P>
<P> Pyongyang is seeking to break out of political isolation and redress what North Korean officials regard as deep misunderstandings of the Kim dynasty's pervasive rule. </P>
<P> ``I think this is very strange and unusual,'' a Japanese woman making her first visit to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea said of the near-robotic dancing. </P>
<P> Not so said one of the hundreds of government travel guides who must accompany foreigners during their visits. </P>
<P> ``This is voluntary conformity, very natural,'' he said. ``The people are simply showing their devotion to the great leader comrade Kim Il-sung and the dear leader comrade Kim Jong-il.'' </P>
<P> Tens of thousands of men in business suits and women in billowing ``chima'' gowns whirled in practiced precision beneath huge communist party flags, loudly singing songs praising the Kims. </P>
<P> No formal festivities were planned for May Day itself. </P>
<P> With so many foreigners in town, including large numbers of Americans who are rarely granted visas, North Korean authorities have taken pains to keep them from mingling with local people. </P>
<P> Well-dressed security workers idling in pairs on street corners are an intimidating presence that prevents residents from stopping to chat for more than a moment. </P>
<P> North Korea's careful embrace of foreigners has also been tempered by vitriolic daily attacks on the U.S. government in the tightly-controlled official press. </P>
<P> Washington, which suspects Pyongyang of trying to develop nuclear weapons, has been assailed for what North Korea calls ``wanton violations'' of a bilateral accord signed in 1994 that sets a framework for modernisation of its nuclear program. </P>
<P> Violations include planning military exercises with the South Korean government, which the North Korean media deride daily as a ``traitorous clique'' and puppet of Washington. </P>
<P> North Koreans with whom foreigners are allowed contact, mainly hotel workers and tour guides, are generally able to cite the official line by rote and say they want nothing more than reunification with South Korea -- on terms set by Kim Il-sung. </P>
