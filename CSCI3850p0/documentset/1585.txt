<DATELINE>CAP HAITIEN, Haiti (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  In the deadliest conflict of the U.S. intervention in Haiti, U.S. Marines Saturday shot and killed eight Haitians during a confrontation in the northern coastal city of Cap Haitien, officials said. </P>
<P> ``There was an exchange of gunfire and there apparently were casualties on both sides,'' said U.S. Embassy spokesman Stanley Schrager, who told reporters in the capital Port-au-Prince that one American military man had been wounded. </P>
<P> A journalist at the scene said the U.S. casualty was a U.S. Marine translator. </P>
<P> ``There are eight dead people on the street, all Haitian,'' said Colonel Steve Hartley. </P>
<P> Military officials said the incident began when five shots were fired from an automatic weapon in the vicinity of a Cap Haitien police station and Marines responded to the gunfire. </P>
<P> Reporters at the scene said a Haitian man had pointed a gun at a Marine and that in the ensuing firefight seven other men were killed as they emerged from the station. </P>
<P> It was unclear whether the dead men were police. </P>
<P> The Cable News Network reported late Saturday that a Marine reaction force had sealed off the entire area and that an armored personnel carrier had been brought in. </P>
<P> The deaths occured on the sixth day of a U.S. intervention of the impoverished Caribbean island. </P>
<P> Earlier, U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry said in Port-au-Prince at the end of a day-long visit to Haiti that he expected deposed Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to return to his Caribbean homeland next month. </P>
<P> Perry flew from Washington with Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman General John Shalikashvili to visit 14,000 U.S. troops that have landed in Haiti since Monday to pave the way for Aristide's return to office. </P>
<P> U.S. soldiers entered Haiti peacefully after a last-minute deal was hammered out Sunday between former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and military chief Lieutenant General Raoul Cedras. </P>
<P> The deal, which averted an all-out U.S. invasion, states Haitian military rulers, including Cedras, should step down by October 15.  ``The agreement we made with him (Cedras) does not require him to leave, but we believe he should and we believe that he will,'' Perry told reporters before returning to Washington. </P>
<P> But Cedras, citing the Haitian constitution's ban on exile, insisted Wednesday he would remain in the country. </P>
<P> Cedras' determination to remain in Haiti after October 15 is in direct conflict with President Clinton's call for him to leave the country. </P>
<P> He said the question of him leaving never arose during the weekend negotiations with a Carter-led peace mission. </P>
<P> At a White House news briefing Monday, the day the U.S. occupation began, Clinton said he thought Haiti's military rulers should leave the Caribbean country. </P>
<P> The defense secretary said he expected the ``overwhelming'' U.S. presence would act as a deterrent to violence and allow the Aristide government to return. </P>
<P> ``The last time I spoke to (Aristide), he was anxious to get back and he planned to get back as soon as possible after October 15,'' Perry said. ``I think it will be very soon after that.'' </P>
<P> Aristide, toppled in a military coup in September 1991, said last Wednesday he would be back by October 15, not after. </P>
<P> As Perry reviewed the troops in Port-au-Prince, Haitian policemen broke up a pro-Aristide demonstration near the Haitian military headquarters with tear gas and clubs. At least four people were beaten after soldiers dispersed an anti-Cedras protest of about 150 people. </P>
<P> The demonstration, out of the sight of U.S. soldiers, was the first near Cedras' headquarters since the coup which forced Aristide -- Haiti's first democratically elected president -- into exile. </P>
<P> Thousands of Haitians, emboldened by the U.S. presence after three years of military rule, Saturday packed the streets around the capital's airport and harbor to welcome the American soldiers. </P>
<P> Demonstrating the newly gained confidence of Aristide supporters, thousands of people -- some of them chanting ''Handcuff Cedras'' -- paraded down the airport road in the largest crowd gathered to watch the U.S. soldiers this week. </P>
<P> Some waved branches to symbolize renewal and uprooting. Aristide supporters waved signs reading, ``Thank you America'' and ``Disarm the Death Squads.'' Other demonstrators, some holding paper roosters, a symbol of Aristide, chanted ``We want Aristide. </P>
<P> The U.S. military presence has brought out in force many Aristide supporters who last week would have been in hiding. </P>
<P> As Perry arrived in Port-au-Prince, hundreds of Aristide supporters massed at the harbor to welcome American troops. The gathering spontaneously turned into protest pressing Cedras to leave Haiti. </P>
<P> One protesting Haitian was hacked in the head at the port by a machete-wielding man described by an army lieutenant as a policeman. </P>
<P> The wounded man, a bloodsoaked towel draped around his head, was brought to the port area by shuttle bus and subsequently received medical treatment from U.S. personnel. </P>
<P> At an airport news conference before returning to the United States, Perry said U.S. troops would intervene to protect Haitian lives. ``Our forces have instructions that if they see an overreaction they should take action,'' he said. </P>
<P> He added 1,000 U.S. military police (MPs) would spread out through Port-au-Prince to individual police stations starting Sunday to oversee the Haitian police and help maintain order. </P>
