<P>  Melvin Franklin, one of the original members of the ``Temptations,'' the Motown quintet that epitomized the sound of 1960s Soul, died Thursday due to complications from brain seizures, a hospital spokesman said. </P>
<P> Franklin, who was 52, was admitted to Cedars Sinai Hospital last Friday after suffering seizures. </P>
<P> He was brought into the hospital by paramedics and was still suffering seizures, Cedars Sinai spokesman Ron Wise said. He was unconscious at the time and never regained consciousness, Wise said. </P>
<P> ``He had suffered significant neurological damage from the seizures,'' Wise said. </P>
<P> Franklin had been been ill and had not performed since last July, his publicist, the Mitch Schneider Organization, said. He suffered from diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, Wise said. </P>
<P> ``Unquestionably Melvin Franklin was the living, breathing 'heart' of the temptations,'' his publicist said in a statement. ``He had been with the group since its inception and was arguably the most identifiable Temptation of all. </P>
<P> ``Fans knew him on sight for his wide, round eyes and his warm, ready smile. And they knew him on sound for a bass voice so deep and rich that it had become the standard against which all other basses are measured.'' </P>
<P> ``The Rolling Stone History of Rock and Roll'' called the Temptations ``the finest vocal group in Sixties soul. They could outdress, outdance and outsing any competition in sight.'' </P>
<P> The group has had 19 Top 10 hits, including ``My Girl,'' ''Just My Imagination,'' and ``Papa Was A Rollin Stone.'' </P>
<P> The group was formed in Detroit, but Franklin, like other members of the Temptations, came from the South. </P>
<P> Franklin was born in Montgomery, Ala., in 1942 and was often described as ``12 pounds of bass and brown.'' </P>
<P> Franklin is survived by his wife, Kimberly, mother, Rose Franklin, and five children, as well as two brothers and two sisters. </P>
<P> Funeral services for Franklin will be held February 25 at the Hollywood Hills Forest Lawn Church of the Hills. A public viewing will be held February 24. </P>
