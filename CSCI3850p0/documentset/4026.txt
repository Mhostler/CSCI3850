<P>  Pope John Paul II, making one of his strongest ever condemnations of anti-Semitism, said Sunday the world had to ensure that it would not have to cry over ``other Auschwitzes.'' </P>
<P> Calling the Nazi death camp ``a triumph of evil,'' the pope said: ``Never again anti-Semitism. Never again the arrogance of nationalisms. Never again genocide.'' </P>
<P> Making his first public comment on Friday's 50th anniversary of the liberation of the camp in his native Poland where an estimated 1.5 million people were killed, he said the present world was still full of violence. </P>
<P> ``Unfortunately however, our times continue to be marked by so much violence. God does not want that tomorrow we have to cry over other Auschwitzes of these years. Let us pray and work that this does not happen,'' he said. </P>
<P> The pope did not elaborate but in the past he has often warned of the dangers of nationalist strife, such as that which has torn apart former Yugoslavia. </P>
<P> He also appeared to take sides with Polish authorities in a dispute with Jewish leaders over the ecumenical tone of last week's commemorations. He said that while the Jews suffered the most at Auschwitz, ``many innocent people of various nationalities died.'' </P>
