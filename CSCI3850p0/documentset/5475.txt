<P>  House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Wednesday he is two to three Republicans short of the majority needed to bring up a $189 billion tax cut for a debate and vote later in the day. </P>
<P> ``We are two or three votes short,'' he told reporters shortly before meeting with House Republicans. However, even without the needed Republicans, Gingrich may get the help he needs from two or three sympathetic conservative Democrats. In addition, he hopes to win more Republican votes. </P>
