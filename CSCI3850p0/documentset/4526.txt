<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Some 160,000 Palestinians attended prayers in Jerusalem on the last Friday of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan amid tight Israeli security. </P>
<P> Prayers at al-Aqsa mosque, Islam's third holiest shrine, passed without incident but Israeli troops shot and wounded two Palestinians and arrested 31 other people in unrest in the occupied West Bank towns of Hebron and Nablus. </P>
<P> Israel boosted its forces in Jerusalem by 1,700 police officers and said they would remain in the city until Saturday, the first anniversary of the Hebron mosque massacre in which a Jewish settler killed 29 Arabs at prayer. </P>
<P> A police spokesman put the number of worshippers at al-Aqsa at 160,000. He could not confirm an Israel Radio report that if all went well Friday at al-Aqsa police would recommend lifting a ban against Palestinian entry into Israel. </P>
<P> Israel tightened a two-year-old closure after two Islamic suicide bombers killed 21 Israelis near Tel Aviv Jan. 22. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin eased the ban slightly at the start of this week, allowing 15,000 Palestinian workers, about a third of those usually crossing into Israel, to enter. </P>
<P> Palestinians say the closure is collective punishment and that it, along with slow-moving negotiations on extending self-rule from Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho to the rest of the West Bank, is threatening the peace process. </P>
<P> In the West Bank, Israeli security forces shot and wounded two Arabs and detained 26 other people during clashes with stone- throwing Palestinans in Nablus, residents said. </P>
<P> In Hebron, site of the Feb. 25, 1994, massacre, troops detained five Israeli peace activists and one Palestinian bystander, the army said. Palestinians in Hebron said troops prevented the group of about 30 Israeli peace activists from reaching the Hebron mosque and scuffles ensued. The demonstrators called for an end to Jewish settlement in Hebron and for the establishment of a Palestinian state. </P>
<P> Some 3,000 Muslims attended prayers at the Hebron mosque, Palestinians said. The site, known as the Tomb of the Patriarchs, is sacred to Muslims and Jews. Since the massacre, it has been divided into Jewish and Muslim sides but for the last Friday prayers of Ramadan troops barred Jews from the entire site. </P>
