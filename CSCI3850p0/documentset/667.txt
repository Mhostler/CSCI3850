<P>  The international airlift to Sarajevo resumed Tuesday, a United Nations spokesman said. </P>
<P> The lifeline to the besieged capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina has been interrupted for 19 days, except for a brief resumption last Friday before being suspended as a security precaution. </P>
<P> A Canadian C-130 cargo plane was the first of 14 flights scheduled to land for the day, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). </P>
<P> ``The first plane has already landed,'' spokesman Ron Redmond said. </P>
<P> The airlift was stopped July 21 after a spate of incidents in which aircraft came under fire at the airport. </P>
<P> Last Friday, four relief flights landed before the operation was suspended after Bosnian Serb forces seized back heavy weapons which had been under U.N. guard near Sarajevo. </P>
<P> Sarajevo's nearly 400,000 residents need about 200 tons of supplies a day, according to the UNHCR, the main relief agency operating in former Yugoslavia. </P>
<P> Each cargo plane can carry between 40 and 50 tons. </P>
