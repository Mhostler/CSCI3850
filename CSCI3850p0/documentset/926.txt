<DATELINE>DETROIT (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Police launched a massive search Sunday for four convicted killers and four other inmates still at large after they used a shotgun to blast their way out a Detroit prison. </P>
<P> The Sunday morning breakout originally involved 10 inmates who made a daring getaway after two men outside the facility tossed the gun over the fence into the prison yard. </P>
<P> One of the runaway group sprayed fire at prison guards while the others fled through holes cut in the double fence of the state-run Ryan Regional Correctional Facility here, officials said. </P>
<P> No one was hurt in the incident, but the escapees ran across nearby railroad tracks to two waiting getaway cars. </P>
<P> Detroit police said they captured two of the escapees, along with the female driver of one of the cars. The two inmates were identified as David Whitaker, who was serving a life sentence for first-degree murder, and Marvin Johnson, who was serving two 15- to 30-year terms for assault with intent to murder and armed robbery. </P>
<P> Deputy Detroit Police Chief Benny Napoleon said Detroit and Michigan State Police are conducting an ``intensive cordinated search'' for the remaining escapees, all of whom are serving lengthy prison terms. </P>
<P> Complicating the search is the fact that prisoners at the Ryan facility do not wear prison uniforms -- the inmates already were in street clothes. </P>
<P> The escape occurred at about 8:15 a.m. EDT Sunday as the inmates were in the exercise yard of the medium- security prison on Detroit's northeast side. </P>
<P> ``Basically, a weapon was thrown into the institution,'' said Pat Rodger, administrative assistant to the warden. ``The prisoners fired shots at the prison staff members but no one was hit.'' </P>
<P> Prison officials said guards saw two black men toss the weapon over the fence. Investigators also found wire cutters near the fence holes, as well as a box of shotgun shells, a shirt and other small items. </P>
<P> A total of three shots were fired from the shotgun, officials said. </P>
<P> An emergency roll call was taken, and ten inmates from the 1,044-prisoner facility were reported missing, Rodger said. </P>
<P> She said it was unclear how many guards were overseeing the inmates in the prison yard and the incident was still under investigation. </P>
