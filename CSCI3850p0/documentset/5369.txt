<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  More than eight inches of rain this week soaked the English Turn G.C. course, forcing a five-hour delay of the second round of the New Orleans Classic Friday, and only half the field completed play before a suspension for darkness was called. </P>
<P> Seventy-two players were stranded mid-round, the last groupings off the tee having played just one hole. </P>
<P> The leader in the clubhouse was Canadian golfer Dave Barr, who shot a 68 for a 9-under-par total. </P>
<P> Said Barr: ``It's amazing that we were able to play. I got here at six o'clock this morning, and when it started to rain again at eight, I just wanted to get out of here, go back to the hotel and come back tomorrow. As it turns out, I'm glad we played.'' </P>
<P> Barr was one stroke ahead of overnight leader J.L. Lewis. On Thursday Lewis had been the last golfer to finish, putting out in darkness for a 64, and on Friday he was again the last to finish, making a birdie on the last hole for a 72 that kept him at eight under par. </P>
<P> The cut will not be made until the second round is completed sometime on Saturday, weather permitting. </P>
<P> But Masters defending champion Jose Maria Olazabal of Spain left the course early to head to Augusta National after rounds of 73 and 71 that made it likely he would miss the cut. </P>
<P> Referring to the rain-soaked week here, Olazabal said, ''This was a disaster in terms of preparing to defend at the Masters.'' </P>
