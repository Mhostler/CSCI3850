<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia, (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Colombian President Ernesto Samper's four-month government has riled its chief prosecutor after agreeing with protesting farmers to halt eradication of their illegal coca crops, the raw material for cocaine. </P>
<P> Its pledge to temporarily suspend the fumigation of coca crops smaller than 7.5 acres drew angry words from the prosecutor-general, who said the plan would only benefit the country's drug traffickers, who control most of the world's cocaine trade. </P>
<P> Prosecutor-General Alfonso Valdivieso Sarmiento told local reporters Friday the agreement set a dangerous precedent by practically giving farmers license to continue growing the coca leaf. </P>
<P> ``The agreement institutes miniature land tenure for organized crime,'' he said. ``The problem is not the size but the purpose of these crops and the motives behind them.'' </P>
<P> An equally disapproving government official told the Bogota daily El Tiempo that the agreement violated the country's national statute on drugs. </P>
<P> ``It's not only inconvenient but illegal,'' he was cited as saying in the daily's Saturday edition on condition of anonymity. </P>
<P> The agreement, reached last Thursday between a government commission and the leaders of a massive coca growers protest in eastern Guaviare province, includes investing at least one billion pesos (about $1.2 million) on crop substitution next year. </P>
<P> Thousands of coca growers had converged onto two small towns and blocked a local airstrip for nearly two weeks to protest against the government's eradication program, saying it was destroying their only source of income. </P>
<P> The government eventually sent the commission to meet the leaders of the protest after violence broke out in the area between security forces and suspected Marxist guerrillas. </P>
<P> Colombian drug traffickers buy coca leaves from farmers to later process their paste in laboratories and smuggle the resulting cocaine out of the country. </P>
<P> Some guerrilla groups are known to collaborate with the traffickers, protecting plantations and laboratories. </P>
<P> Valdivieso, who is in charge of investigating and pressing charges against suspected criminals on behalf of the state, also said drug traffickers were bound to use the agreement to their advantage by dividing large coca plantations they owned into smaller plots to avoid getting them sprayed. </P>
<P> But Interior Minister Horacio Serpa defended the agreement, reiterating a common complaint among coca growers that the herbicide glyphosate used in the fumigation was also ruining other crops and endangering the health of their families. </P>
<P> ``A (fumigation) plane can't go over a parcel of land of one hectare where a small farmer has -- along with his coca crop -- his house, children, vegetables, chicken coop and two or three pigs,'' he told local reporters Friday. </P>
<P> Serpa said the government would continue to spray larger plantations, while farmers had agreed to stop growing the illegal crop and gradually eliminate existing ones. </P>
<P> Samper's government, which came to power last August, has come under heavy pressure from the United States to eradicate the thousands of acres of the illegal crop as part of its contribution to the war on drugs. </P>
<P> He has also been urged to be as aggressive in pursuing the Cali cartel as his predecessor was with Pablo Escobar of the rival Medellin cartel. </P>
<P> Since Escobar's shooting death in December 1993, the Cali cartel has drawn much more public attention as the one of the world's most powerful drug organizations, controlling more than 70 percent of the cocaine smuggled to the United States, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. </P>
<P> Colombia is the world's largest producer of cocaine, exporting up to 1,000 tons of the drug every a year, according to DEA figures. </P>
<P> Valdivieso became prosecutor-general last July under former President Cesar Gaviria's government. </P>
