<P>  The swallows of San Juan Capistrano's historic mission have all but abandoned their famous annual haunt, but local officials now hope to lure the legendary visitors back. </P>
<P> Worried about losing the swallows forever, mission officials and environmentalists have begun intense work on a plan to return the flocks to the place where history says they belong each March 19, the Los Angeles Times reported Sunday. </P>
<P> The tiny birds used to arrive by the hundreds at the 219-year-old edifice on their annual migration from Argentina. </P>
<P> Their arrival attracted visitors from all over the world and inspired the popular song ``When the Swallows Come Back to Capistrano.'' </P>
<P> But in recent years only a handful of the tiny birds have been spotted. </P>
<P> Most of the swallows' mud nests that covered the arches and eaves of the mission have been wiped out by state-mandated work to make the building earthquake-safe, the Times said. And the bulk of the swallows displaced over the past six years since the retrofitting began are finding other seasonal homes. </P>
<P> ``We literally lost hundreds of nests,'' mission administrator Gerald Miller told the newspaper, estimating that only about a dozen nests remain. </P>
<P> Environmentalists warn that without drastic action, all the swallows could be gone in five years. </P>
<P> Ideas being considered to entice the birds back include installing wooden nest boxes or clay replica nests, and creating a mud ``swallows wallow,'' the Times said. </P>
<P> Officials are also thinking about whether to seek volunteers to help clear tall reeds along San Juan Creek that choke off the birds' access to fresh mud needed to repair their seasonal homes. </P>
<P> Since the mission has been disrupted by repair work, the birds have found new haunts in the area, including a department store in nearby Mission Viejo and the undersides of bridges along a local interstate highway. </P>
<P> According to legend, the city's relationship with the birds dates back to the late 1700s when Father Junipero Serra is said to have welcomed the swallows each spring by ringing the mission's bells. </P>
