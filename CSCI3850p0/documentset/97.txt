<P>  Leroy Burrell set a world 100 meters record Wednesday when he sliced one-hundredth of a second off his close friend Carl Lewis's three-year-old mark. </P>
<P> Burrell, who also held the record briefly in 1991 before losing it to Lewis, clocked 9.85 seconds with a following wind of 1.2 meters a second at the Lausanne grand prix. </P>
<P> ``I came out today and I felt the conditions were great,'' he said. ``I was just happy to do it today. I just came off the plane yesterday and I feel I can go a little faster.'' </P>
<P> The 27-year-old Burrell was well behind from the blocks behind fellow-American Andre Cason, the world silver medalist, after Canadian Bruny Surin had appeared to get away early. </P>
<P> Olympic and world bronze medalist Dennis Mitchell came briefly into contention but at 60 meters Burrell simply powered away from the field. </P>
<P> He waved his right fist in the air when he saw the time on the trackside clock and turned a cartwheel as he waited for the time to be officially confirmed. </P>
<P> ``I knew at 20 meters I was going to win,'' Burrell added. ``I felt strong, I wasn't in the least bit tired.'' </P>
<P> Burrell has been marked for greatness since he joined the Santa Monica Track Club, where he trains with eight-time Olympic champion Lewis. </P>
<P> In 1991 he set his first world record with 9.90 seconds at the U.S. championships and was the clear gold medal favorite at the Tokyo world championships later that year. </P>
<P> But Burrell was then upstaged by Lewis in the greatest 100 meters race of all time, clocking 9.88 to his compatriot's 9.86. </P>
<P> Lewis unexpectedly failed to qualify for the 1992 Barcelona Olympics and Burrell was again the pre-Games favorite. </P>
<P> He looked good in the early rounds but seemed to freeze in the final, eventually finishing a disappointing fifth behind Britain's Linford Christie. </P>
<P> Hampered by injuries last year, Burrell himself failed to qualify for the Stuttgart world championships although he gained some compensation with victory over Christie in the Zurich grand prix. </P>
<P> He was also a member of the U.S. team which equalled the world 4x100 meters record in the world championships semifinals. </P>
