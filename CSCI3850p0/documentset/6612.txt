<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Clinton is leaning strongly toward vetoing a record $16.4 billion in spending cuts approved by House and Senate members Tuesday because it will scrap scores of federal programs, a White House official said. </P>
<P> The cuts agreed by House and Senate lawmakers will reduce the deficit this year and provide $6.7 billion in disaster aid to states hit by earthquakes, fires and floods and $240 million to fight terrorism and rebuild the Oklahoma City federal building destroyed in last month's bombing. Called a rescission bill, it cuts spending already approved by Congress for the current financial year. </P>
<P> The White House official, who asked not to be identified, said Clinton would air his objections to the spending cut package in a speech Wednesday at an event promoting work-to-school programs in White Plains, Md. </P>
<P> ``I don't know if he'll say the 'V-word,'' but he'll talk about it,'' the official told Reuters. </P>
<P> Earlier White House spokesman Mike McCurry said the Senate made some improvements on the House version of the bill, but the House-Senate conference committee ``has done nothing to improve the bill; if anything, it probably made it worse.'' </P>
<P> ``The president is determined to work with the Congress to meet deficit reduction targets, but he is deeply troubled by the cuts that they have made,'' he said. </P>
<P> He singled out cuts in education and job training as especially onerous. </P>
<P> A total of 60 health, education and jobs programs were terminated to save $3.3 billion. The bill cuts $580 million in unspent funds from 39 government buildings projects and housing programs are cut by $6 billion. </P>
<P> ``You can anticipate that anything that was zeroed will not ever see the light of day,'' House Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Livingston, R-La., told reporters, referring to programs that were left with no funds in the bill. </P>
<P> Republican leaders had said the bill may be veto-proof because it also provides money for FBI counter-terrorism activities now deemed essential. </P>
<P> It also includes $275 million to enable Jordan to write-off its remaining debt owed to the United States, which was part of a deal Clinton made when the kingdom ended its 47-year state of war with Israel. </P>
<P> ``I believe, frankly, that we've got a bill he can sign,'' Livingston said. </P>
<P> The spending cuts cleared by the joint House and Senate Appropriations conference committee will go to the House for probable passage Thursday. The Senate is expected to pass the bill and send it to the White House within another week. </P>
<P> In a compromise with Senate Republicans, the House restored $1 billion in low-income heating assistance for the poor and agreed to keep this year's summer job program for young people, but summer jobs would be terminated in 1996. </P>
<P> Clinton's prized AmeriCorps National Service program was cut by $210 million, about half the House proposal but still one-third of its budget. </P>
