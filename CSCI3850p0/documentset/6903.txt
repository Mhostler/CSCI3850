<P>  Soviet archives documenting a massacre of Polish officers at Katyn during World War II were destroyed in 1959, possibly on the orders of Soviet leader Nikita Krushchev, a Russian newspaper reported Friday. </P>
<P> For decades the Kremlin blamed Nazi Germany for the murders, which wiped out a whole layer of educated Poles captured after the Soviet Union invaded Poland in 1939 under a secret pact with Adolf Hitler. Moscow owned up to the killings only in 1990. </P>
<P> Russian authorities subsequently revealed documents showing how the Soviet Politburo, led by dictator Josef Stalin, ordered the killing of the 21,000 army officers. </P>
<P> But Poland, which is planning a series of events this year to mark the 55th anniversary of the start of the killings, last month renewed calls for Russia to complete probes to reveal the full truth about the massacre. </P>
<P> Anatoly Krayushkin, head of archives and records at the Federal Security Service, told the liberal Sevodnya newpaper that a note had been discovered proposing that the archives be destroyed. </P>
<P> The note, from then-KGB head Alexander Shelepin, had been written in Krushchev's name, Krayushkin said, citing information from Russia's chief military prosecutor. </P>
<P> ``There is a note by KGB chairman Shelepin in Khrushchev's name in which the destruction of 21,859 archive materials on the shooting of the Poles is proposed,'' Sevodnya said. </P>
<P> Krayushkin said the link with Krushchev, who revealed many of the crimes committed by Stalin, was an unexpected twist requiring extra checks. But he considered the case virtually closed. </P>
<P> He did not say what was believed to be in the archives. But he said Russia had no reason to hide any details of the case and that any Polish doubts as to the veracity of information passed on to them were ``unethical.'' </P>
<P> The bodies of 4,000 of the dead Poles were found in mass graves in Katyn, in what is now western Russia, by German forces invading the Soviet Union. </P>
<P> Bodies have also been found at Miednoye and Kharkov in Ukraine, but the resting place of thousands is still unknown. </P>
<P> Krayushkin said he thought Poland was exploiting the Katyn massacre to stir tensions in bilateral relations to back its call to be included in the NATO western defense alliance. Moscow bitterly opposes NATO's plans for eastward expansion. </P>
