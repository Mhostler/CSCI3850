<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  At least 64 people died when fire swept through a karaoke parlor and restaurant complex in Taiwan Wednesday, trapping people in a narrow building that turned into a column of flame. </P>
<P> Police in the central Taiwan city of Taichung told Reuters by telephone that 64 bodies had been recovered from the building. ``We think there are still some more inside,'' one policeman said. </P>
<P> State television said only 12 people had managed to escape from the building. The television quoted firefighters as saying there were about 100 people in the building when it caught fire. </P>
<P> Four seriously injured people were rescued from the building, the television added. </P>
<P> Flames licked up the three-storey building and erupted from the roof before several fire engines and scores of firefighters with water hoses extinguished it. </P>
<P> The cause of the fire was not immediately known. </P>
<P> Karaoke parlors have been the site of lethal fires in Taiwan before. The parlors comprise a warren of small rooms in which customers sing along to the words of tunes displayed on a television screen. </P>
