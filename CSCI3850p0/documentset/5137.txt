<P>  President Clinton said Thursday he would veto any effort by Congress to cut student loan programs but that he hoped it would not come to that. </P>
<P> At a question-and-answer session with college student newspaper reporters, Clinton was asked if he was willing to veto attempts by the Republican-led Congress to cut various programs for student loans. </P>
<P> ``Of course I am in the areas of education which are so important to me,'' Clinton replied. But he said his first choice is ``to try to prevail in the debate in the Congress.'' </P>
<P> He said he did not believe there was as much enthusiasm in the Senate as in the House for cutting the popular programs. </P>
