<DATELINE>BEIJING, April 30 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Beijing's word has been thrown into doubt after it extradited from Thailand China's single most corrupt official saying he faced a maximum 15-year jail term and then sentenced him to death, a human-rights group said on Sunday. </P>
<P> Wang Jianye, former section chief in the Planning Bureau of China's booming southern Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, was sentenced to death on April 7 by the Intermediate People's Court on charges of taking bribes, corruption, bigamy and illegally crossing the border. </P>
<P> ``This is a question of human rights because it involves a life and death case,'' Robin Munro, head of the Hong Kong office of Human Rights Watch/Asia, said in a telephone interview. </P>
<P> ``How is one to believe pledges made by Chinese authorities on other human-rights cases?'' Munro said. </P>
<P> Wang's wife appealed on Saturday to human-rights organisations and the government of Honduras, whose nationality Wang now holds, to help her husband, saying his sexual trifles did not warrant the death penalty. </P>
<P> Munro said Thai police have said they agreed to extradite Wang after receiving assurances from Chinese judicial authorities that Wang faced a maximum 15-year jail term. </P>
<P> ``If the Chinese authorities cannot be trusted to keep their word over a pledge that was given to a foreign government to reassure them that it would be justified to extradite someone, then what credence can be given to Chinese government pledges on human-rights issues short of life and death matters?'' Munro said. </P>
<P> He said the decision in Wang's case cast a shadow over all China's talks with the United States and European Union on human-rights issues. </P>
<P> Officials have said Wang's case involved up to $2 million, making it the biggest corruption case in China. </P>
<P> ``I beg human-rights organisations around the world to pay attention to this case. We do not have much time,'' his wife said in an interview on Saturday. </P>
<P> Wang has appealed, she said, adding that appeals are often cursory with executions carried out immediately after final sentencing. </P>
<P> People convicted of corruption in China are regularly executed in a campaign by Beijing's Communist Party chiefs to crack down on an evil they say threatens party survival. </P>
<P> Wang's wife quoted her husband's lawyer as saying the court had convicted him on insufficient evidence, because the chief witness, who had fled with her husband and another business friend, committed suicide in Thailand before the extradition. </P>
<P> ``The court never even looked at the evidence we tried to present in his defence,'' she said by telephone from Shenzhen. </P>
<P> She contended Wang was facing death as much for his sexual behaviour as for corruption. </P>
<P> Wang's mistress, Shi Yangqing, has been sentenced to death, suspended for two years, on charges of corruption and speculation and profiteering. </P>
