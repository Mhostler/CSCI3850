<DATELINE>BONN, March 29 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Germany has suspended a shipment of military hardware to Turkey because of anger over Ankara's offensive against rebel Kurds in northern Iraq, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said on Wednesday. </P>
<P> Kinkel said the items affected comprised bridge-laying and other engineering equipment that had been promised Ankara but not yet delivered. He said the United Nations would have to become ``massively involved'' in solving Turkey's Kurdish problem. </P>
<P> ``We had planned to deliver some leftover materiel by the summer,'' Kinkel said. ``We have stopped it and that's the end of that.'' Germany, which is a major military supplier to NATO partner Turkey, on Monday froze 150 million marks ($107 million) in grants promised Ankara to help with the purchase of two German-built frigates worth 800 million marks ($571 million). </P>
<P> The decisions reflected Bonn's increasing concern at Turkey's nine-day-old incursion into Iraq and suggestions from Turkish military and political leaders that the 35,000 troops they have committed could stay there for a long time. </P>
<P> Bonn's discomfort has been heightened by the fact that Ankara's 10-year battle against separatist Kurds has been accompanied by increasing tension within Germany's 1.8 million-strong Turkish community, among them 400,000 Kurds. </P>
<P> Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU) and Kinkel's liberal Free Democrats (FDP) say an extended Turkish presence in Iraq is unacceptable. </P>
<P> ``Turkey has to pull out immediately,'' Kinkel told reporters after a meeting of parliament's foreign affairs committee. </P>
<P> ``The United Nations will have to get massively involved with (Turkey's problem) and we will have clear which countries, should it come to it, would be prepared to send ground troops to control a buffer zone in north Iraq.'' </P>
<P> The CDU parliamentary faction noted ``with sorrow'' that Turkey had broadened its military operation in Iraq and had obviously been planning to occupy the region for a long time, CDU deputy parliamentary leader Rudolf Seiters said. </P>
<P> ``It (the CDU) disapproves, in particular, of attacks on civilians by some units of the Turkish armed forces,'' he added. </P>
<P> Sources in Kohl's coalition said the chancellor and his ministers decided on Tuesday night to halt the shipment. </P>
<P> The extra measure, meant to signify Bonn's discontent with Turkey's actions, occurred as criticism of the freeze on the aid for the frigates spread from the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) to Kohl's own party. </P>
<P> ``This gesture will have no effect,'' Karl Lamers, a CDU deputy, told German radio. ``The frigate construction was in any case only a keep-them-in-work programme for German shipyards.'' </P>
<P> Kinkel sharply criticised suggestions of a lengthy Turkish military presence in Iraq during a telephone conversation with the new Turkish foreign minister, Erdal Inonu, on Monday. </P>
<P> Karsten Voigt, SPD foreign affairs spokesman, said that following the end of the Cold War, Bonn should stop supporting the Turkish military and redirect funds towards Eastern Europe. </P>
<P> ``In addition to that, it is a scandal that we still intend to deliver (military supplies) despite human rights abuses, especially in eastern Turkey,'' Voigt told German radio. </P>
<P> The United States, at first sympathetic to Ankara's struggle against the separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and PKK bases in Iraq, on Tuesday said Turkey had to come up with a concrete international plan to deal with the problem. </P>
