<P>  Britain unveiled plans Wednesday to celebrate 50 years of peace in Europe and defended its decision to invite Germany but exclude Japan's leaders from events commemorating the end of World War II. </P>
<P> ``Nobody's seeking to offend anyone. The purpose of this is reconciliation,'' Prime Minister John Major told a news conference. </P>
<P> The wartime allies plan hundreds of events to celebrate the 50th anniversary of peace in Europe in May, 1945, and victory in Asia in August of the same year. </P>
<P> Europe staged spectacular events last year on the 50th anniversary of the D-Day invasion, but emotions ran high as the victorious allies sought to honor veterans without humiliating their one-time enemies. </P>
<P> But while German Chancellor Helmut Kohl is one of 50 leaders asked to celebrations in May marking Victory in Europe Day (VE Day), Japan has been invited only at the ambassadorial level. </P>
<P> Nor will the Japanese be present at August's more somber events commemorating Victory in Japan Day (VJ Day) since, Major said, the schedule would focus on Britain and the Commonwealth. </P>
<P> ``They are content with the arrangements,'' said Major, who was lambasted last year by veterans who felt the government trivialized commemorations of the 1944 allied landings in France. </P>
<P> But the divergent plans reflected modern Britain's ties with its former adversaries as it struggles to win compensation for soldiers held prisoner of war by Japan during the 1939-1945 war. </P>
<P> ``We admire the capabilities of the Japanese warrior. We're perfectly happy to meet Japanese in different circumstances... but we do not necessarily wish to meet them all the time,'' said Lord Slim, whose father commanded the army that fought its way through Burma. </P>
<P> The organizers conceded they must tread a delicate path in commemorating victory over Japan but they insisted that Tokyo, too, was in no rush to join the VJ Day commemorations. </P>
