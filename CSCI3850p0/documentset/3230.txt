<P>  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe Thursday rejected a new peace proposal by Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and repeated warnings of a possible catastrophe in the region. </P>
<P> ``There is a provocative aspect to the plan which is unacceptable,'' Juppe told reporters, referring to Karadzic's proposal. </P>
<P> The Bosnia Serb leader proposed his forces give up some territory, release U.N. prisoners and allow U.N. convoys to move unhindered. He also called for an immediate cease-fire in Sarajevo and the surrounding area and the reopening of Sarajevo airport. </P>
<P> ``We have already said what must be discussed,'' Juppe told reporters. ``The (internationally acccepted) peace plan must be accepted and after that there are a few limited topics that can be discussed,'' he said. </P>
<P> Juppe said he had discussed the situation by telephone overnight with Secretary of State Warren Christopher. He and Christopher agreed that a new meeting should be called of experts from the so-called Contact Group of nations monitoring the situation in Bosnia. </P>
<P> The Contact Group includes Britain, France, Germany, Russia and the United States. </P>
<P> Juppe said the only avenue open to the group at the present time was to try to spark new talks among the parties, ``which, at the moment, has not succeeded.'' </P>
<P> United Nations peacekeeping forces ``cannot remain in the situation where they now find themselves,'' he added. </P>
<P> ``Either we withdraw -- which we do not wish to do...or we stay, which we want to do and which is now demanded of us by all sides including Belgrade, Washington, Sarajevo and all European capitals,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``But to stay, we must have the means,'' he said. ``The U.N. command must be allowed to do its work, it must be allowed to obtain provisions and not remain at the mercy of the Bosnian Serbs, as is the case today.'' </P>
