<P>  The Filipino chief mate of the ill-fated ferry Cebu City was found alive but injured near shore Sunday, two days after his vessel sank at the mouth of Manila Bay with a feared loss of more than 140 lives. </P>
<P> ``He was reportedly recovered by a fisherman this morning. He was alive but injured,'' coast guard spokesman Amado Samanante said. </P>
<P> The spokesman said Reynaldo Boludo was found floating close to the shore of Cavite Province after being washed out of Manila Bay and down the coast. He had no details of his injuries. </P>
<P> A spokesman for the ship's owners, William Lines, confirmed Boludo had been found but had no further information. </P>
<P> Boludo is the most senior officer of the inter-island ferry to be discovered alive since it sank before dawn on Friday after colliding with the Singapore-registered container ship Kota Suria. </P>
<P> The Cebu City's Capt. Wenceslau Lampong is among more than 100 people still missing after the accident. More than 450 were recovered alive. </P>
<P> Divers scouring the wreck of the 2,452-ton Cebu City Sunday recovered three more bodies from the hull, which is lying on its side in about 82 feet of water. </P>
<P> Dozens more are feared to be trapped in the cabins, where they drowned when the ship went down a few minutes after the collision, but divers are having problems getting to some parts of the vessel, the coast guard said. </P>
<P> ``They have to break the portholes before they can get inside and that is difficult,'' Samante said. </P>
<P> Their task has been hampered by a lack of cutting equipment and pitch darkness inside the vessel. </P>
<P> The coast guard has ordered alcohol and drug tests for the crews of the ferry and the 12,549-ton Kota Suria and summoned them to appear before a marine board of inquiry on Monday to try to discover what happened. </P>
<P> ``The sea is so wide it is difficult to imagine how they could have collided,'' Jaime Daquilanea of the coast guard said. </P>
<P> The accident happened in a busy shipping lane between Corregidor Island and the southern rim of Manila Bay in good weather conditions. </P>
<P> The Kota Suria's Filipino captain, Paquito Miraflor, refused to comment ahead of the inquiry, saying: ``There will be an inquiry Monday and everything will be known then.'' </P>
<P> William Lines crewing manager Gemma Mayo said the search for the remaining missing passengers would continue until all the people aboard the Cebu City were accounted for. </P>
