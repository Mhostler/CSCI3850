<P>  A 15-year-old boy accused of murdering his parents with a shotgun appeared to be plotting an interstate crime spree like the one depicted in the movie ``Natural Born Killers,'' authorities said Tuesday. </P>
<P> A day after police arrested high school freshman Jason Edward Lewis in the deaths of James and Ann Lewis, police announced that they had also charged three of the boy's friends in connection with the murders. </P>
<P> Authorities believe the catalyst for the slayings was a disagreement over a midnight curfew that the parents recently had imposed on the teen-ager. </P>
<P> ``Basically, what we're investigating is the theory that there was a plan to kill their parents and then go across country, heading for Mexico, and commit a crime spree across the United States ... a la 'Natural Born Killers,''' Coweta County District Attorney Pete Skandalakis said in an interview aired on local television. </P>
<P> Lewis allegedly shot his parents several times in the head with a 12-gauge shotgun Sunday as they watched television in the family's mobile home near this small town, about 40 miles southwest of Atlanta. James Lewis, a truck driver, and Ann Lewis, a factory worker, had been married for almost 20 years and had two children, including a 19-year-old daughter who was not at home. </P>
<P> The Atlanta Constitution reported Tuesday that Lewis exchanged notes with friends referring to the main characters in the Oliver Stone film ``Natural Born Killers,'' a movie about a homicidal couple who murder the woman's parents before setting off on a killing spree in which dozens of people die. </P>
<P> One note allegedly talked about a plan to ``kill our parents ... rob a pawn shop and make our way across the country.'' Another letter that police say was passed among the teen-agers said, ``Let's kill 'til we are killed.'' </P>
