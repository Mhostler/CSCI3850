<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  California Gov. Pete Wilson will announce Thursday that he is forming a committee to explore a bid for the White House in 1996, sources close to Wilson said Wednesday. </P>
<P> Wilson, deemed a potential front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, will make the announcement at an event in Los Angeles Thursday morning, the sources said. </P>
<P> The launch of the exploratory committee is a necessary legal preliminary that will allow Wilson to organize a national campaign staff and begin raising funds for a full-fledged presidential campaign. </P>
<P> While Wilson is not expected to announce definitively Thursday that he is joining the presidential race, one source close to Wilson portrayed that as a formality. ``He's running,'' the source said. </P>
<P> He said it would be clear from Wilson's announcement Thursday that it is ``highly probable that he will run.'' </P>
<P> Wilson, 61, has acknowledged in the past few weeks that he was considering a presidential bid, stirring intense media interest. </P>
<P> Wilson's star has been rising since his landslide victory in last November's gubernatorial election gave him a second term as governor of America's most populous state. </P>
<P> Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole is the current front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination. </P>
<P> Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, Senators Phil Gramm, Arlen Specter and Richard Lugar and conservative Pat Buchanan are also competing for the right to face the Democratic nominee, presumably President Clinton, in 1996. </P>
<P> Wilson will embark on a six-day trip to the East Coast Friday, allowing him to extract maximum publicity from the announcement of the exploratory committee. </P>
<P> During the trip, he has fundraisers scheduled in Washington, New York and Boston. They will raise money to pay off a $1 million debt left from his re-election campaign and will not raise money for a presidential campaign. </P>
<P> He is also scheduled to speak Saturday with a group of newspaper editors in Washington. </P>
<P> Wilson, a former U.S. senator and mayor of San Diego, is regarded as a moderate. He favors abortion rights and, as governor of California, he has signed gay rights legislation and the biggest tax increase in the state's history. </P>
<P> But he took a more conservative stance during last year's re-election campaign, calling for welfare reform and a crackdown on illegal immigration and crime. </P>
<P> This year, he is calling for state tax cuts and has endorsed a proposed California voter initiative which would abolish state government affirmative action programs which increase opportunities for women and racial minorities. </P>
