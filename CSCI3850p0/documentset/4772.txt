<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Pilot error probably contributed to the crash of a Mexican Learjet in heavy fog near Washington last summer that killed all 12 people aboard, U.S. aviation officials said Tuesday. </P>
<P> The Transportes Aereos Ejecutivos (Executive Air Transport) jet crashed into trees just short of the runway at Dulles airport on its second attempt at landing on June 18. </P>
<P> The plane was carrying 10 passengers, including four children, and two crew member on a flight from Mexico City to a World Cup soccer match in Washington. </P>
<P> The National Transportation Safety Board said the probable cause of the accident was the pilot's lack of flying skills in making a descent to below an authorized altitude without being able to see the runway. </P>
<P> It also said the crew may have been fatigued after the all-night flight from Mexico City via New Orleans. </P>
<P> The board said another factor was the jet's lack of a ground warning alarm, which would have given a continuous alert for the last 64 seconds of the flight and might have given the pilot time to pull out of his descent. </P>
<P> The board also noted that the Learjet carried 10 passengers even though the plane had eight seats, a violation of International Civil Aviation Organization standards. </P>
<P> Nor did it have flight data recorder, also a violation of the organization's standards. </P>
<P> The board added that oversight of the plane's operation and of that specific flight by the airline and by the Mexican government was inadequate. </P>
<P> It recommended that the Federal Aviation Administration require that within two years turbojets with six or more passenger seats have ground warning alarm devices, a requirement that now applies only to planes with 10 or more seats. </P>
<P> The board also recommended that the FAA notify the Mexican authorities of the circumstances of the accident, with particular emphasis on the failure to follow national and international aviation regulations. </P>
