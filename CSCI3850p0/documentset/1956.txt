<P>  Afghanistan's main warring factions are joining U.N.-sponsored peace talks in the Pakistani city of Quetta, a U.N. spokesman said Wednesday. </P>
<P> He said Masoud Khalili, representing Afghan President Burhanudd Rabbani, had arrived in Quetta, where U.N. special envoy Mahmoud Mestiri has been holding consultations with about 20 prominent independent Afghans for the past two weeks. </P>
<P> Envoys from the opposition Supreme Coordination Council, which includes Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and General Abdul Rashid Dostum, were due to join the gathering Thursday. </P>
<P> One moderate party leader, Pir Gailani, and representatives of two other leaders, Ayatollah Mohsini and Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi, arrived in Quetta earlier this week. </P>
<P> A senior U.N. official, Sotirios Mousouris, said Rabbani had agreed to a three-day cease-fire in Kabul to allow the United Nations to deliver urgently needed emergency relief supplies. </P>
<P> He said Mestiri would discuss this in Quetta Thursday with the representatives of opposition parties which have been locked in battle with Rabbani's forces in the Afghan capital. </P>
<P> The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) estimates that up to 800 people have been killed and 17,000 wounded in bitter fighting over the past four weeks. </P>
<P> The Quetta talks have discussed how to set up an interim government and convene a Loya Jirga -- a traditional Afghan council -- to decide how Afghanistan should be ruled. </P>
