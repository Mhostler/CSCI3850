<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Brazilian authorities denied Tuesday that they had found Finance Minister Pedro Malan's desk telephone was being tapped. </P>
<P> The capital's Correio Braziliense daily said Federal Police agents found a voice-activated device beneath the carpet in Malan's office last week and disconnected it. </P>
<P> The police said in a statement that agents had carried out a routine electronic sweep of the office Jan. 9 and ``no device for clandestine listening or for physical attack was found.'' </P>
<P> The state news agency Agencia Brasil reported that Federal Police Director Wilson Romao had told Justice Minister Nelson Jobim agents found only two stripped wires in Malan's office. </P>
<P> Government officials and legislators occasionally complain their telephones are being tapped by political opponents or law enforcement officers. </P>
