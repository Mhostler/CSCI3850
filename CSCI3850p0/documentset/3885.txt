<P>  O.J. Simpson's attorneys are preparing to present alternative theories to explain the murders of his ex-wife and her friend and may suggest that money or drugs were behind the killings, the Los Angeles Times reported Sunday. </P>
<P> Citing sources familiar with the defense strategy, the newspaper said the football legend's lawyers will not name another potential suspect but will contend that police botched the investigation by overlooking other possible murder scenarios. </P>
<P> In opening trial arguments set for Monday, the prosecution is expected to detail Simpson's alleged history of stalking and beating Nicole Brown Simpson, saying he finally killed her when he could no longer control her. Prosecutors believe Simpson killed her friend, Ronald Goldman, in a jealous rage, believing he was her boyfriend. </P>
<P></P>
<P> -- Nicole Brown Simpson and Goldman might have been killed in a dispute over drugs -- though the defense will not necessarily try to show that either was a drug user, sources were cited as saying. </P>
<P> -- The deaths may somehow be tied to the unsolved murder of a young Hollywood music promoter whose throat was slashed on June 30, 1993. </P>
<P> -- The intended victim of the stabbing attack could have been Goldman, not Nicole Brown Simpson. </P>
<P> A defense source told the Times that attorneys might introduce the drug-killing theory by suggesting socialite Faye Resnick, author of a best-selling book about Nicole's final months, had been using drugs in her friend's house. </P>
<P> Resnick has admitted entering a drug rehabilitation program just before the slayings. </P>
<P> But prosecution sources were cited as saying preparations were being made to belittle the defense theories as absurd and to suggest that physical evidence all points to Simpson as the killer. Simpson has pleaded not guilty.  Underlying each of the new theories is a longstanding defense contention that at least two assailants were responsible for the crime. </P>
<P> Sources told the Times there were signs that Nicole's body could have been moved, suggesting the killer had an accomplice, and a few footprints at the murder scene appear to be slightly different from the rest. </P>
