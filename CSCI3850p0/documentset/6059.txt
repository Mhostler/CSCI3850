<DATELINE>BOLZANO, Italy (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Jews in northern Italy Wednesday condemned the sale of bottles of wine named after Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini as a dangerous trivialization of the horrors of Nazism and Fascism. </P>
<P> ``This sort of thing puts historical figures like them on the same banal level as a Hollywood film star,'' said Federico Steinhaus, president of the small Jewish community in the mixed Italian and German-speaking region of Alto Adige. </P>
<P> ``It takes away all the crime and horror that they represent,'' he said. </P>
<P> The red Italian wines, with pictures of the two dictators on their labels, are being sold by the owner of a bar in Bolzano, the capital of the Alto Adige region. </P>
<P> The man, Luciano Guiato, said he saw nothing wrong with his marketing ploy, which he said was purely commercial. </P>
<P> ``People buy them as a joke or out of (political) sympathy,'' Guiato, who sells the wine for $3.50 a bottle, said. </P>
<P> He said orders for the Hitler label, named Fuehrerwein (Fuehrer's Wine) and put on the market recently, had come from southern Germany. </P>
<P> A similar wine named after the late leader of the conservative Bavarian Christian Social Union party, Franz Josef Strauss, had also gone down well in Germany, Guiato said. </P>
<P> The South Tyrolean People's Party, which represents German speakers in Alto Adige, sought last year to have Guiato prosecuted for selling his Mussolini wine, named Camerata, a Fascist honorific which means ``brother in arms.'' </P>
<P> The complaint was backed by public prosecutors but a judge ruled that Guaito's action was not an offense under Italian laws against Fascist propaganda and shelved the case. </P>
<P> Steinhaus said the judge had ruled that Guaito would be doing wrong only if he put Hitler or Mussolini on a par with Jesus Christ. ``It's an absurd ruling,'' he said. ``In fact, we're more angry about the ruling than we are about the wine.'' </P>
