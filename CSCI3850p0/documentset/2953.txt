<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, Germany (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Frankfurt Friday will become the first city in Germany to offer a place where heroin addicts can shooting up in supervised and hygienic conditions. </P>
<P> People used to crouching in alleys and stabbing for their veins in the dark will be able to take the drug in a bright and hygienic room, using fresh syringes and monitored by social workers trained in first aid. </P>
<P> The room is partly meant to lure some of the city's 300 pale and emaciated addicts away from the streets around the railway station where the sight of them shooting up is familiar. </P>
<P> But it is also an attempt to draw drug users into an environment where they can obtain help and advice and be put on the path toward overcoming their addiction. </P>
<P> ``If you sit in a garden or behind a truck, you have neither light nor clean water and you can't find your veins because they contract in the cold,'' said Horst Burghardt, a social worker who heads the project. </P>
<P> ``That's when overdoses happen. That's what it's about -- to give them a place where they can inject their stuff in peace.'' </P>
<P> The system, which is already standard in most large Swiss cities, remains controversial in Germany. </P>
<P> The room, a yellow-tiled former communal shower, is in a hostel for drug users in a bleak industrial area well outside the city center. </P>
<P> It has two sinks, and one long table set against a wall lined with mirrors. Drug users are given clean syringes, spoons, candles and water and are vetted by two social workers. </P>
<P> The city will run a regular bus service to and from the city center and plans to open a second room near the station, where drug dealing takes place. </P>
<P> Heroin is the only drug allowed and police will try to keep dealers away from the area. </P>
