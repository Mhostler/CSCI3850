<P>  The United States won the men's team gymnastics competition Saturday to claim the first gold medal of the Pan-American Games. </P>
<P> The U.S. gymnasts overtook Cuba in the final exercise of the optionals to take the team title as the holders crumbled with a string of falls off the high bar. </P>
<P> As Cuba's Erick Lopez, the leader on individual scores after Thursday's compulsories, fell American John Roethlisberger stormed in front with a fine floor display. </P>
<P> The Americans, who trailed Cuba after the compulsories, came through to win the optionals and post a total score of 551.150 points to Cuba's 550.900. </P>
<P> Canada, sixth in the 1991 Games in Havana, were third with 546.100 and hosts Argentina fourth with 524.550. </P>
<P> U.S. coach Ed Burch said: ``We're very proud to win in the last minute. We knew it would be tough but we did not give up. </P>
<P> ``Going into the last event we knew Cuba were beating us and we didn't expect them to miss the high bar.'' </P>
<P> He said that towards the end he spent more time keeping an eye on the Cubans. ``I have to be honest. I didn't watch my boys, I watched the Cubans.'' </P>
<P> Cuban journalists pressed Burch on the judging, which they believed had gone against Cuba. But he replied: ``I'm not going to comment on the judging, but I think it was fair.'' </P>
<P> Chris Waller, at 26 the oldest and most experienced member of the U.S. team, said: ``I think we improved as much as a team could from Thursday. </P>
<P> ``We didn't let anyone else's mistakes (on the team) create negative momentum. </P>
<P> ``We were able to let the pressure create great things,'' he added of the Americans' brilliant performance on the floor. </P>
<P> Cuba's coach Ernesto Izaguirre said his gymnasts lost concentration during a protracted spell on the vault when the judges took a long while to decide on the points they were going to award one of the jumpers. </P>
<P> ``That added to the pressure,'' he said. </P>
