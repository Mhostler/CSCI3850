<P>  Seven people were wounded, including one child, when Bosnian Serbs fired converted surface-to-air missiles on the U.N.-designated safe area of Bihac; a U.N. spokesman Friday described the attack as ''terrorism.'' </P>
<P> Two SA-2 surface-to-air missiles hit Bihac town Thursday, damaging buidings and wounding seven, including one child who was seriously injured, U.N. Protection Force spokesman in Sarajevo Thant Myint-U said. </P>
<P> A total of seven SA-2 missiles struck the Bihac pocket, including towns of Cazin and Buzim in the last 48 hours, the U.N. spokesman said. </P>
<P> ``This inexcusable attack by surface-to-air missiles was devoid of any military value and can only be considered an act of terrorism, reckless in its targeting, designed to provoke fear amongst the people of Bihac,'' Thant Myint-U said. </P>
<P> He said one missile landed very close to a school in Bihac town, damaging 30 to 40 buildings. ``It was only by the grace of God that tragic loss of life did not occur.'' </P>
<P> A Muslim breakout from the Bihac enclave this week has driven the Serbs from 95 square miles of territory. </P>
