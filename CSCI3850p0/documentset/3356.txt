<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  North Korea has agreed to return the remains of downed U.S. helicopter pilot Chief Warrant Officer David Hilemon later in the day, the Defense Department announced Wednesday. </P>
<P> The isolated communist state has agreed to hand over Hilemon's body to Rep. Bill Richardson, who will bring it to South Korea Thursday, a U.S. official said in a separate announcement earlier Wednesday. </P>
<P> Richardson, a New Mexico Democrat who was in Pyongyang on a previously scheduled visit, has also been given assurances that a captured U.S. pilot, Chief Warrant Officer Bobby Hall, will be allowed to leave ``shortly,'' the official said. </P>
<P> The official, who declined to be further identified, said Richardson was optimistic that Hall would be home by Christmas, which is Sunday. </P>
<P> Richardson will accompany Hilemon's remains across the heavily fortified demilitarized zone at 10 a.m. local time Thursday, the official added. </P>
<P> U.S. officials said the pilots' two-seat OH-58 Kiowa helicopter had been on a routine training mission when it was shot down or forced to make an emergency landing in North Korea Saturday. </P>
<P> South Korea's Yonhap news agency said U.S. military officers Wednesday again urged North Korean army officers at the border village of Panmunjom to return the pilot of the OH-58 helicopter, which North Korea said it shot down a few miles north of the border. </P>
<P> North Korean and U.S. military officers had met Tuesday, with North Korea withholding any immediate response and only saying information on the incident would be provided after the end of an investigation. </P>
<P> In Washington Tuesday, Secretary of State Warren Christopher warned that further delay would affect relations, which had been warming since Pyongyang agreed in October on restructuring of its nuclear program. </P>
<P> ``We have indicated that a further delay here in returning the pilot and the remains of the co-pilot would be of great concern to us and would affect the atmosphere in which we've been hoping to improve our relations with North Korea,'' he said. </P>
<P> Richardson arrived in Pyongyang on a previously scheduled visit just after Saturday's incident and has been negotiating on behalf of President Clinton. </P>
<P> Richardson is a friend of Clinton and member of the House Intelligence Committee. </P>
