<P>  Pope John Paul plans to visit Israel before the end of the century following this year's establishment of diplomatic relations with the Vatican, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said Friday. </P>
<P> Speaking after meeting the pope, he also raised the prospect of extending the dialogue between Christians and Jews to include the Islamic world to help combat fundamentalism. </P>
<P> Peres said that he had discussed a papal visit to Israel when he met the pontiff in the Vatican City Thursday. </P>
<P> ``He told me that he would do it clearly before the end of this century but he hopes it will be ahead of that,'' Peres told a news conference after flying from Rome to Budapest to attend the bi-annual council meeting of the Socialist International. </P>
<P> ``Whenever he will come I'm sure people of all religions will consider him a very welcome guest,'' he added. </P>
<P> Israel and the Holy See signed a landmark agreement last December that led this year to full diplomatic ties. </P>
<P> The pope said last month it would be ``very significant'' for him if in the year 2000 he could visit the places of the Old Testament. Such a trip would take him to Israel, Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Jordan and other countries. </P>
<P> In 1964 Pope Paul VI became the first pontiff to visit Jerusalem in modern times. The present pope has revolutionized relations with Jews after 2,000 years of distrust, becoming the first pontiff to visit a synagogue, and he played a leading role in the diplomatic recognition of Israel. </P>
<P> Peres said the agreement between the Vatican and Israel had been put to the test, adding: ``I think that both parties are rather satisfied with the way things are progressing.'' </P>
<P> Referring to the dialogue between the Church and Jews, he said: ``They are now trying to enlarge it to the three parties, namely Christians, Muslims and Jewish together.'' Religious fundamentalism had to be tackled on the spiritual side, with tolerance and with pragmatism to improve economic conditions. </P>
<P> Israel declared Jerusalem its ``united and eternal'' capital in 1980, 13 years after its forces captured the city's eastern sector from Jordan in the Six-Day War. The city is sacred to Muslims, Jews and Christians. </P>
