<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  O.J. Simpson's attorneys spent Sunday rehearsing for a courtroom drama that is shaping up like an episode of ``Perry Mason'' or ``L.A. Law'' -- the cross-examination of a detective accused of possibly framing an innocent man. </P>
<P> Det. Mark Fuhrman returns to the witness stand Monday in Simpson's double-murder trial for a third day of gentle questioning by prosecutor Marcia Clark, but the real fireworks are expected to begin when famed attorney F. Lee Bailey finally gets a crack at him. </P>
<P> Bailey, who could begin grilling Fuhrman by the end of the day's session, has vowed to put the 19-year police veteran himself on trial in what may be the most closely watched cross-examination in U.S. history. </P>
<P> Defense attorneys have depicted Fuhrman as an embittered white racist, and have suggested that he may have planted the bloody glove he found at Simpson's estate last June 13, the morning after the murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman. </P>
<P> They have produced no proof that Fuhrman tampered with evidence to frame the black celebrity -- or even that he could have done so -- and Fuhrman's attorney, Robert Tourtelot, has accused the defense of ``character assassination.'' </P>
<P> But a real estate agent named Kathleen Bell has said that Fuhrman made racist comments to her in 1985 or 1986, railing against interracial couples and saying he'd like to see ``all niggers gathered together and killed.'' </P>
<P> In the trial's most dramatic moment so far, Fuhrman -- a tall, chisel-featured investigator who looks every bit the part of a TV detective -- took the witness stand and immediately denied ever having met Bell or having had such a conversation. </P>
<P> Clark chose the risky strategy of confronting the racial allegations head-on in front of Simpson's mostly black jury, and legal experts said Fuhrman's calm, cool-headed response may have partly defused the upcoming defense attack. </P>
<P> But Bailey, a flamboyant cross-examiner who defended Boston Strangler Albert de Salvo and newspaper heiress Patty Hearst, said the prosecution made serious tactical errors that will allow him to destroy Fuhrman's credibility. </P>
<P> ``Any lawyer in his right mind who would not be looking forward to cross-examining Mark Fuhrman is an idiot,'' Bailey told reporters. </P>
<P> Bailey, whose baritone voice and theatrical style have prompted comparisons to legendary TV attorney Perry Mason, sat through Fuhrman's testimony last week without making a single objection. </P>
<P> But when he gets his first shot at the 43-year-old detective -- which may not come until later in the week -- he is expected to launch a blistering attack hoping to provoke him into losing his composure. The defense spent much of the weekend mapping out strategy, a source close to the case said. </P>
<P> ``I think Bailey has a real big ordeal in mind for Det. Fuhrman,'' said Robert Pugsley, a law professor at Southwestern University in Los Angeles. </P>
<P> Bailey has also promised to produce a mystery witness who can corroborate the story given by Bell, who says Fuhrman told her he would stop any car occupied by a black man and a white woman -- even if he had to invent a reason. </P>
<P> A friend of Bell's is expected to testify later during the defense case that Bell introduced her to Fuhrman and that he repeated the racial slurs after she told him she was attracted to athletic men such as black football star Marcus Allen, Newsweek reported, citing defense sources. </P>
<P> In an interview published Sunday in the Long Beach Press-Telegram newspaper, Bell identified her friend only as ''Anita'' and quoted her as saying ``I guess you're right'' about Fuhrman's racial views after she spoke to him at a restaurant. </P>
<P> No other witness is thought to have more potential than Fuhrman to shape the outcome of Simpson's trial -- unless the defendant himself decides to testify. </P>
<P> If Fuhrman comes across to jurors as a good cop, the prosecution's case is strengthened. If he comes across as a racist, the defense raises doubts about Simpson's guilt. </P>
<P> Information has surfaced about other incidents, including records from a 1983 police disability claim in which Fuhrman is reported to have made racist remarks and to have admitted using excessive force during arrests. But Judge Lance Ito has limited questioning to the incident involving Bell. </P>
<P> Fuhrman's testimony ended Friday with the prosecution unveiling a shovel and a large plastic bag found in Simpson's white Ford Bronco -- apparently to imply that Simpson used or intended to use them in connection with the murders. The bloody glove is expected to be the next item shown. </P>
