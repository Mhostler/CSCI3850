<P> ``It is no secret to anyone in the world that we are at a criticial moment in the peace process. We cannot allow the rise of terror again to threaten this peace,'' Clinton said at the start of the meeting at Blair House, an official government guest house opposite the White House. </P>
<P> ``We are prepared in this country to redouble our efforts to get the peace process back in full gear. We are doing what we can on our own and with others to deal with the problem of terror,'' he said. </P>
<P> He hoped the meeting here would establish specific steps the parties could take to keep the peace process going and said he was willing to go to Congress for duty-free treatment of goods from industrial zones on the West Bank and Gaza if the Israelis and Palestinians agreed to set them up. ``I am absolutely convinced we have to move as quickly as we can to show there are economic benefits from peace,'' he said. </P>
<P> The Israel-PLO talks are stuck over Israel's demand for a Palestinian clampdown on Moslem militant groups and Palestinian demands that Israel lift its closure of the West Bank and Gaza and stop settlement activities in those areas. Israel sealed off the areas on January 22 after an Islamic Jihad suicide bomb killed 21 Israelis. </P>
