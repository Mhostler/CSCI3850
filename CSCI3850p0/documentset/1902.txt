<P>  Alfred Gilman, chairman of the pharmacology department at a major Texas medical center, said Monday he was excited about the news that he was one of the winners of the Nobel Prize for medicine. </P>
<P> ``I'm about as excited as I can be,'' Gilman said from his home about an hour after being notified. </P>
<P> Gilman, 53, and Martin Rodbell, 68, won the Nobel Medicine Prize for the discovery of G-proteins and their role in showing how the human body's cells communicate with each other. </P>
<P> Rodbell heads the Signal Transduction Section at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences in North Carolina. </P>
<P> Gilman, who has been with the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center for 13 years, now joins the ranks of those whom he said he held in awe. ``I was always in awe of them,'' he said referring to Nobel prize winners. </P>
<P> His research was on how cell function is controlled by factors such as hormones. ``When we understand all those pathways we'll have a much better understanding of how to use drugs to control them,'' Gilman said. </P>
<P> The research can be applied in areas such as heart disease and cancer, he said. </P>
<P> Asked what the Nobel prize might mean for his work going forward, Gilman replied, ``It's not going to hurt.'' </P>
