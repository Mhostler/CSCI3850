<P>  A woman was treated for a broken leg after she fell naked from a tree while having sex in a park near Windsor Castle, a British newspaper said Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``The young couple had apparently gone to the Great Park for a bit of nookie and decided to climb the oak tree to add a bit of spice to the session,'' a park spokesman told the Times. </P>
<P> ``As they reached the height of their passion, the woman slipped from one of the branches at the top of the tree and plunged to the ground. It was a very clear case of coitus interruptus.'' </P>
<P> Officials at the park near Windsor Castle, one of Queen Elizabeth's royal residences west of London, said the unidentified woman was taken to a nearby hospital. </P>
<P> ``It was early in the morning and there were very few people about. The ambulance crew couldn't believe their eyes,'' said one. </P>
