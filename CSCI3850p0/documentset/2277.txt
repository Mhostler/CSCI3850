<P>  Teen-agers are more likely to take drugs as a result of poor family relationships, rather than because they come from single-parent families, said a Canadian research scientist. </P>
<P> Ed Adlaf, who headed a study released by the Addiction Research Foundation Thursday, said the quality of relationships inside families are more likely to determine whether a youth will abuse alcohol or drugs. </P>
<P> ``There is the perception that children in single-parent families are more at risk,'' Adlaf told Reuters, ``but typically, what's causing the higher drug use isn't so much they don't have both parents as that there is poor communication.'' </P>
<P> He said the study of more than 2,000 students revealed that drug use among teenagers is very low when good relationships are present, regardless of the type of family. </P>
<P> ``Although there were very large differences in drug use between different family structures, when you factor in other family relational variables, those differences disappear,'' Adlaf said. </P>
<P> The study was based on a 1993 questionnaire given to Canadian kids in grades seven, nine, 11 and 13. </P>
