<P>  Two police officers were acquitted Tuesday of charges they used a dog for target practice in a case that caused a stir on the Internet. </P>
<P> Bayou Vista, Texas officers Greg Trantham, 27, and John Overstreet, 32, pumped their fists as the verdict was read. Overstreet broke into tears. Bayou Vista is just outside this Gulf of Mexico port city. </P>
<P> The jury of four men and two women deliberated about six hours after five days of testimony. </P>
<P> The officers denied killing a stray Lhasa apso in April 1994. Their lawyer charged that the case was motivated by politics and exploited by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals as a fund-raising tool. </P>
<P> The alleged shooting was not reported to the district attorney's office until June 1994 and the dog's body was never recovered. </P>
<P> The case received international exposure on the Internet computer network where animal rights activists exchanged a flurry of messages about the incident. </P>
<P> Prosecutor Thomas ``Jay'' Wooten, who had contended the two officers used the 22-pound dog for target practice and then killed it, denied the case was driven by publicity. </P>
<P> ``We filed the charges before there was nationwide media coverage,'' he said. ``We thought we had enough evidence to convict or we wouldn't have brought it to trial.'' </P>
<P> Seven people testified at the trial that they either heard Trantham and Overstreet recount how they shot the dog or saw its bullet-riddled carcass. </P>
<P> Trantham and Overstreet said the dog ran away from them after they picked it up from a Bayou Vista couple who found it wandering in their neighborhood. </P>
