<P>  The ruling Baath Party newspaper al-Thawra urged Iraqis Friday not to expect too much from divisions within the U.N. Security Council over how to deal with the sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. </P>
<P> The paper, while welcoming efforts by France, Russia and China to issue a statement praising Iraq's compliance with Gulf War cease-fire terms, said there were no indications that the embargo would be eased or lifted soon. </P>
<P> ``The positive outcome of deliberations at the Security Council...is not that they will lead to the lifting of sanctions today or tomorrow,'' al-Thawra said in a commentary. ``We do not expect a quick lifting of sanctions.'' </P>
<P> Iraq's official press highlights divisions within the Security Council over how to characterize Baghdad's progress in honoring the 1991 Gulf War cease-fire commitments. </P>
<P> The United Nations imposed stringent trade sanctions on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait, and the ceasefire terms link exports from Iraq, including oil, to compliance with U.N. weapons demands. </P>
<P> Al-Thawra blamed the continuation of the embargo on the United States and Britain, ``whose historical rancor against the people of Iraq has blinded them.'' </P>
<P> It said Iraq was pinning hope on what it termed ``the Russian whale,'' now aided by both France and China, and their efforts to isolate the United States on the Security Council. </P>
<P> The three countries advocate that the council issue a statement welcoming Iraq's cooperation with a U.N. Special Commission charged with ridding Iraq of weapons of mass destruction. </P>
