<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Californians drew on their long experience in dealing with earthquakes and other disasters as they worked to reopen damaged highways and businesses Thursday after devastating floods. </P>
<P> For the most part, the state's residents lamented their losses but calmly set about cleaning up, getting businesses reopened as soon as possible and going on with their lives. </P>
<P> Most of the state was drying out after a week of powerful storms which killed at least 14 people, forced 10,000 to evacuate and flooded hundreds of homes and businesses. </P>
<P> President Clinton Thursday added nine counties to the list of those eligible for federal aid, meaning that 48 of California's 58 counties are now covered by the federal disaster declaration. </P>
<P> The floods have caused widespread destruction, including at least $300 million in damage to agriculture. </P>
<P> Farmworkers are likely to be among those hardest hit because of an expected reduction in harvesting. Some news reports said 20,000 farmworkers in the flood-hit Salinas Valley in central California were without work. </P>
<P> ``They have to rent a house, but there is no money to pay for it ... So some of them are leaving for other areas and some of them stay in the street,'' Efren Barajas, vice-president of the United Farmworkers of America union, said. </P>
<P> About 870 flood victims remained in shelters Thursday, the American Red Cross said. But most people in flood-hit areas were busy cleaning and repairing their homes and businesses. </P>
<P> Eric Butler, head of the state-federal Flood Operations Center in Sacramento, said most rivers were receding although there was still flooding in a few spots in northern California. </P>
<P> ``I think the worst is over for right now,'' Butler said, although he said he was waiting to see how strong storms forecast for the weekend and early next week would be. </P>
<P> The California Highway Patrol said a seventh body was recovered Wednesday from near a bridge on Interstate Highway 5 which was swept away by flood waters last Friday, carrying with it four vehicles. </P>
<P> Sgt. Ted Eichman said the body of Martha Zavala, a 19-year-old student from nearby Huron -- the last person known to be missing -- was found about six miles from the bridge at Coalinga, 150 miles south of San Francisco. </P>
<P> Californians were using the resourcefulness and ingenuity gained in years of dealing with earthquakes and other disasters to get the state back on its feet after the floods. </P>
<P> In recent years, there have been a wave of disasters including the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake in the San Francisco Bay area, the 1992 Los Angeles riots, the 1993 southern California wildfires and the 1994 Los Angeles earthquake. </P>
<P> The state has received billions of dollars in federal disaster relief aid in the last few years. </P>
<P> Jim Drago, a spokesman for the California Department of Transportation, or CalTrans, said the department was using its earthquake experience in repairing highways and bridges damaged by the flooding. </P>
<P> ``We've been getting way too much practice. In the last five years, we've had everything under the sun happening to us,'' he said. </P>
<P> Construction workers were busy around the clock building a temporary bridge to replace the collapsed bridge on Interstate 5, the main freeway from Oregon to the Mexican border. </P>
<P> CalTrans and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have already installed a World War II-type bridge to temporarily replace a bridge on Highway 1 over the Carmel River on the central California coast which was swept away by floods. </P>
