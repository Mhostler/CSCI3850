<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  California smokers entered the New Year Sunday facing the toughest statewide restrictions on lighting up in the country. </P>
<P> From Jan. 1, a new California state law bans smoking in most indoor workplaces, including restaurants. The only smoking that will be allowed in restaurants is in separate bar areas. </P>
<P> The law, passed by the state legislature last year despite strong opposition from the tobacco industry, is aimed at reducing exposure to secondhand smoke and at protecting the health of restaurant workers, who often had to work in a smoke-filled environment. </P>
<P> ``This new law will protect millions of Californians from the dangers of exposure to secondhand smoke,'' said Democratic Assemblyman Terry Friedman, the bill's author. </P>
<P> The new law rationalizes the hundreds of anti-smoking measures passed by cities across the state. The measure replaces more lenient local rules, but cities can still pass tougher smoking restrictions if they wish. </P>
<P> The new law has drawn protests from small restaurant owners, who say their businesses will suffer. Supporters of the measure disagree, saying more people will eat out if they know they will not be exposed to tobacco smoke. </P>
<P> The San Francisco Examiner last week focused on the Narghile Cafe, a Middle Eastern-style cafe in San Francisco where customers go to smoke hookah pipes. </P>
<P> It said that manager Jack Joeanit feared that when the cafe had to go smoke-free Sunday, it could also become customer-free. </P>
<P> ``People come here to smoke the hookah,'' Joeanit said. ``We don't know what we'll do.'' </P>
<P> There are some exceptions to the workplace smoking restrictions. </P>
<P> Smoking will be allowed in parts of hotel and motel lobbies and in up to 65 percent of hotel and motel rooms. People may also smoke in hotel meeting and banquet rooms, except when food or drink is being served. </P>
<P> Smokers may light up in warehouses and in work break rooms that meet special ventilation standards. </P>
<P> The new law will require bars to become non-smoking by 1997 unless new federal ventilation regulations supersede it. </P>
