<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Clinton, an avid jogger whose morning runs are a familiar sight in Washington, opted for a leisurely stroll Thursday. </P>
<P> Clinton, drinking from a white styrofoam cup, emerged from his bulletproof limousine dressed in his usual exercise gear and looking like he was about to jog. </P>
<P> But he began walking, and kept walking, for about 38 minutes near the Lincoln Memorial and on a path by the Potomac River. </P>
<P> Billy Webster, a White House scheduling official and a former chief of staff in the Department of Education, accompanied Clinton on the stroll. They have run together previously. </P>
<P> The president, who jogs on average of about 15 miles per week, ended his walk after about one mile and got into his limousine for the short trip back to the White House. </P>
