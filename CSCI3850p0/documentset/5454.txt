<P>  The Saudi royal family has saved the Arabian oryx by privately breeding and recently releasing 23 of the animals considered extinct in the late 1960s, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) said Tuesday. </P>
<P> The oryx, large antelopes with long, straight horns, were released on March 28 in a protected area of the harsh desert of Rub'al-Khali, or Empty Quarter, their former habitat in the Arabian Peninsula. </P>
<P> ``By 1969 the animal was considered extinct... That it didn't die out completely is a tribute to the Saudi royal family,'' the Swiss-based WWF said in a statement. </P>
<P> ``Now perhaps the tide is turning,'' it added. </P>
<P> The world's largest private conservation organization said the released animals had descended from four oryx first presented by the then King Abdulaziz to WWF in 1963. These had then been interbred with oryx in private and foreign herds. </P>
<P> The oryx, previously overhunted by local people, are now protected by recently-passed Saudi legislation which will prevent hunting for the next five years in the Empty Quarter, according to WWF. </P>
<P> ``The successful oryx project is fine proof of Saudi Arabia's determination to restore and maintain its biological diversity,'' said WWF, which is based in Gland, Switzerland. </P>
<P> The ceremony was attended by Second Deputy Prime Minister Prince Sultan (Bin Abdul-Aziz) and WWF director Claude Martin. </P>
<P> ``We need more examples of such successful schemes,'' Martin, a Swiss, told the ceremony. </P>
