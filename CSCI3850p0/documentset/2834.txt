<P>  Japanese archeologists have salvaged an anchor and pieces of a hull believed to be from one of the Mongolian ships sent by Kublai Khan to invade Japan in the 13th century, a newspaper reported Saturday. </P>
<P> A stone anchor and wooden poles, with pieces of the hull, were found buried in mud under the shallow seabed off Takashima island in southwest Japan, the Asahi Shimbun said. </P>
<P> Documents from the 13th century show that waters near the island were used as an anchorage by part of Kublai Khan's 4,400-ship fleet sent in 1281 to conquer Japan. Most of the fleet was sunk in a typhoon called ``kamikaze,'' or divine wind. It was the last attempt by Khan, the Mongol emperor of China, to subdue Japan. </P>
