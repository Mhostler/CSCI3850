<DATELINE>MANCHESTER, England (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A British investigator said Friday the tank and teargas raid on a religious cult compound in Waco, Texas would never have happened in Britain because the risk to innocent people was too great. </P>
<P> Detective Superintendent Albert Yates told an inquiry into the deaths of 23 Britons among the 75 siege victims, that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms raid on the Branch Davidian compound two years ago was ``fundamentally flawed.'' </P>
<P> ``I think the risk factor was far too great for that to have been considered a realistic option,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``We (British police) take responsibility for the lives of suspects regardless of what they have done ... and in any case there were certainly innocents inside,'' he added. </P>
<P> There were 25 children among the dead. Seventeen cult members died of gunshot wounds while the rest were killed by a fire which swept through the compound on the final morning of the 51-day siege. Only nine people escaped. </P>
<P> Yates, who headed a police investigation in Britain of the tragedy, said British authorities were far more reluctant to use firearms than their American counterparts and other options would certainly have been examined. </P>
<P> It was also inconceivable any group of people in Britain could have amassed the amount of weaponry found in the compound -- 200 million rounds of ammunition and hundreds of guns and rifles, he said. </P>
<P> There did not ever appear to have been an integrated plan for tackling the problem and US authorities had made incorrect assumptions -- such as believing that cult leader David Koresh never left the compound, he said. </P>
<P> Yates told the inquiry he had been unable to substantiate claims that Koresh perpetrated child abuse but DNA tests showed that at least 12 children in the compound were his. </P>
<P> U.S. authorities have pinned the blame for the tragedy squarely on Koresh who also died. </P>
<P> The inquest in this northern English city is giving the first detailed public evidence of the tragedy. </P>
<P> Relatives of British victims at the hearing, now in its fifth and final day, have criticized the U.S. raid and formed the bulk of a group suing U.S. authorities for $500 million in compensation. </P>
<P> ``I came with an open mind but the evidence here has confirmed my suspicions they were wrong to do what they did,'' Elaine, 29, from Derby told Reuters. </P>
<P> Elaine, who declined to give her surname, said she had suspected her brother Clifford was among the Waco victims but did not know for sure until U.S. authorities informed her one year after the disaster. </P>
<P> Two women whose brother was shot in the head at the start of the siege said they were appalled to hear that British doctors could not verify if the bullet was fired at close range because so much of his head was removed in an American autopsy. </P>
<P> ``It's mind-boggling and frustrating -- we get a bit more information every day,'' Claudette Blake from Nottingham said. </P>
<P> Coroner Leonard Gorodkin will deliver his verdict on the deaths later Friday. </P>
