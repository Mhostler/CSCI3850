<P>  A federal judge Wednesday granted the Grateful Dead rock group the authority to seize counterfeit items bearing the band's name or its members' likenesses. </P>
<P> Judge Zita Weinshienk granted a temorary restraining order to Grateful Dead Productions Inc. and the Grateful Dead Merchandising Inc. to prohibit the sale of bootleg merchandise. </P>
<P> ``In view of the importance of trademark law in this country, the plantiffs would suffer irreparable injury if this order were not granted,'' she said. </P>
<P> The lawsuit, naming ``Does 1-500'' as defendants, alleges such sales deprive the Grateful Dead of income and infringe their trademark. </P>
<P> The judge's order requires that the seizure be carried out under the supervision of the legendary psychedelic band's attorneys. </P>
<P> The band is scheduled to appear here next week Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. </P>
