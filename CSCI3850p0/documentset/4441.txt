<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Southern Californians' nerves were rattled by three moderate earthquakes Sunday, but no injuries and no significant damage were reported. </P>
<P> The biggest quake, which registered 4.3 on the open ended Richter scale, hit at 1:24 p.m. PST (4:24 EST) in the mountainous area near Thousand Oaks, north of Los Angeles. </P>
<P> Seismologists at California Institute of Technology in Pasadena said it was not an aftershock to last year's devastating Northridge earthquake, though it was centered in the same geological fault area. </P>
<P> Ninety minutes later, the Thousand Oaks quake produced a 3.7 magnitude earthquake in the mountainous coastal community of Malibu. </P>
<P> The quakes were widely felt, from the San Fernando Valley in the north to Orange County in the south, local news reports said. </P>
<P> Earlier Sunday morning, at 7:47 a.m. PST (10:47 EST) a 3.4 magnitude quake that seismologists said was an aftershock to the 1991 Landers earthquake rocked the Big Bear skiing area east of Los Angeles. </P>
