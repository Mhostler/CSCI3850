<P>  Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson said Saturday during a meeting of the Midwestern party faithful that he would decide by Labor Day whether to run for president. </P>
<P> Some of the top candidates paid homage to the 53-year-old, bespectacled Thompson, whose eight-year reign as governor has seen Wisconsin gain jobs, cut unemployment and make reforms in the 16th largest state's welfare and education systems. </P>
<P> But the current candidates would likely prefer Thompson as a vice presidential running mate, not a rival for the top job. </P>
<P> ``I have a lot of faith in Republican governors like Tommy Thompson,'' Dole, the senate majority leader, told an appreciative audience. </P>
<P> ``I hope he doesn't run.'' </P>
<P> Also setting tongues wagging was California Gov. Pete Wilson, who spent the night Friday at the Wisconsin governor's mansion in Madison and may be trying to horsetrade with Thompson. </P>
<P> Many politicial pundits see Wilson, who will soon declare his candidacy, as the most probable GOP standard-bearer should Dole and Texas Sen. Phil Gramm stumble. Wilson also carries the ``outside-the-Beltway'' credentials coveted by former Gov. Lamar Alexander and Thompson. But that did not stop Thompson from claiming the ``outsider'' mantle. </P>
<P> ``I am the only candidate -- not a candidate -- but the only individual that might consider it who is clearly from the outside,'' Thompson told reporters. </P>
<P> ``If Sen. Dole is able to continue to do the wonderful job that he is doing and wrap it up, then it's going to be all over for all the candidates,'' he said. </P>
<P> Thompson, a lawyer by training, emerged from the Wisconsin legislature to become governor in 1987. Wisconsin, one of the founding states for the Republican Party in the mid-19th Century, had a reputation as having the nation's fattest population, the most cows, and a liberal and generous welfare program. So generous, in fact, that some poor residents of Chicago moved there to take advantage. </P>
<P> Thompson pushed through workfare and school choice programs that required welfare recipients to get jobs or work for the state and put pressure on public education to improve. </P>
<P> He also cut spending and taxes, two hot-button issues at the meeting this weekend and with Republicans in general. </P>
<P> ``All the ideas that everybody's talking about are ideas that I've already done. You talk about balanced budgets, we've done that in Wisconsin. You talk about welfare reform, we started welfare reform as an issue here in Wisconsin,'' Thompson crowed. </P>
<P> ``Wisconsin is a microcosm for what everybody's talking about in Washington except that we've done it, and I think that's a message that could resonate across the country.'' </P>
<P> Thompson said he raised $8 million for his governor's race last year, and believes he could organize a viable, well-funded campaign. </P>
