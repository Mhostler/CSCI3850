<P>  A kidney infection will keep Italian star Deborah Compagnoni from competing in all three North American races on the women's World Cup tour which begins Saturday with a giant slalom at Park City. </P>
<P> Compagnoni, a gold medalist in the last two Olympics, remained in Italy under bed rest and won't race until Dec. 17-18 at Veysonnaz, Switzerland, at the earliest, a source close to the team said. </P>
<P> Meanwhile, Park City officials braced for an impending storm that was expected to dump up to a foot on the race course just prior to Saturday's giant slalom. A slalom also is scheduled for Sunday. </P>
