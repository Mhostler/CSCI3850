<P>  The New York Yankees have apologized for a remark reported in a magazine article quoting a top team official as saying that youths in the South Bronx neighborhood around Yankee Stadium were ``monkeys.'' </P>
<P> The remark was reportedly made by Richard Kraft, vice president for community relations, in an interview with New York magazine given in January and published in the latest edition. </P>
<P> ``It's like monkeys. Those guys can all go up and hang on the rim and crack the rim and bend the hoops,'' Kraft was quoted as saying, referring to youngsters who play basketball on courts near the stadium. ``It's a continuous maintenance problem.'' </P>
<P> The magazine also quoted him as referring to youths in the area as ``colored boys.'' </P>
<P> The Yankees issued an apology Monday, even as Kraft denied through a spokesman that he had ever made such a remark. </P>
<P> The Yankees have had a testy relationship with their neighbors in the borough of the Bronx, blaming the area's gritty condition for low attendance, despite leading the American League's Eastern Division in the standings. </P>
<P> The team has threatened to seek a new home across the Hudson River in New Jersey, joining the Jets and Giants football teams, which long ago fled the city for a sports complex built by New Jersey. </P>
