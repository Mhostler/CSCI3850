<P>  Members of the five-nation Contact Group on the former Yugoslavia circulated rival resolutions on Thursday, underlining growing divisions among the team which has spearheaded Bosnia peace efforts. </P>
<P> The United States, Britain, France and Germany, who first bickered among themselves, have now agreed on a draft toughening conditions under which some sanctions against Yugoslavia have been eased since last October. </P>
<P> The relaxed bans would have to be renewed every 75 days, instead of after every 100 days. </P>
<P> Russia, Belgrade's traditional ally, has drafted a rival document extending the relaxation of sanctions indefinitely. </P>
<P> The Security Council is due to vote on Friday and diplomats expect the Western draft to win general support. </P>
<P> Moscow's ambassador, Sergei Lavrov, would not say how he would vote on the Western draft, although he is expected to abstain. He commented only ``We cannot support that draft.'' </P>
<P> Yugoslavia has been the target of strict economic and other curbs since 1992 for assisting the Bosnian Serbs in their fight against the Moslem-led Sarajevo government. </P>
<P> Sanctions affecting air travel and sporting and cultural ties were scaled back late last year in return for a pledge by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to cut off military supplies to his former Serb proteges in Bosnia. </P>
<P> Lavrov said the council was breaking its promise to Belgrade, which had cooperated in closing its border. </P>
<P> ``We tried to put on paper what the Security Council might consider as a minimum to encourage the authorities (of) Yugoslavia to continue the implementation of their decision to close their border,'' he said. </P>
<P> The United States has been pressing the council to send a clear signal to Belgrade during the latest 100-day review that it cannot be ``business as usual'' because of reports the border closure has become less effective. </P>
<P> New, tougher elements in the Western draft will require renewal every 75 days while the border closure between Yugoslavia and Bosnia will now apply not only to the land frontier but also airspace between the two countries, following reports of illicit helicopter flights. </P>
<P> The draft also includes language aimed at closing a ``backdoor'' through which supplies from Yugoslavia destined for the Bosnian Serbs are sometimes routed through Croatia. </P>
