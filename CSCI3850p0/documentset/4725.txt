<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Under a sunny, clear sky and atop snow spread on the streets overnight by city crews, 58 mushers began the 1,161-mile Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race with a purely ceremonial run staged for the benefit of spectators in Alaska's largest city. </P>
<P> Unlike past years' starts, Saturday's 20-mile jaunt from downtown Anchorage to the suburb of Eagle River will not count in the competition of the world's most famous sled-dog race. </P>
<P> Instead, to ease the big-city stresses on dogs and mushers, the drivers of the sled-dog teams, the time clock will start Sunday in Wasilla, a bedroom community about 40 miles north of Anchorage. </P>
<P> To save money for both competitors and race organizers, another new rule this year stipulates that teams may include no more than 16 dogs. In past years, Iditarod mushers have been allowed to hitch up as many as 20 dogs. </P>
<P> The 16-dog limit and the delay of the start clock until Sunday might produce a speedier race this year, said two-time champion Martin Buser, who last year set the course record of 10 days, 13 hours, 2:39 minutes. </P>
<P> ``It might make for a slower start,'' said Buser, as he prepared to hitch his team in the starting corral. ``But then in the midsection of the trail, hopefully we'll have more big dog teams, which then will overall speed it up.'' </P>
<P> The Swiss-born Buser, who lives in Big Lake, Alaska, predicted that smaller teams would be easier for mushers to manage. </P>
<P> Also new this year were paying passengers for most mushers' sleds. In a fund-raising campaign, Iditarod organizers took bids for race-start sled rides. Iditarod fans from around the nation paid over $35,000 in total for the experience of traveling with a musher on the trail's first few miles. </P>
<P> The ride sales are among the marketing initiatives that have helped race organizers compensate for the estimated $450,000 -- about a third of the race budget -- that was lost when The Timberland Co. and other national companies ended their race sponsorship. </P>
<P> Criticism from animal-rights groups, which argue that the Iditarod is cruel to dogs, has dampened national companies' interest in the event. </P>
<P> But sponsorships from Alaska-based companies and other contributions helped boost this year's total race purse to $350,000, up from the $318,000 paid last year. The winner will receive $52,500, up from the $50,000 Buser won last year. </P>
<P> Among those buying rides was Vanderbilt family heiress Marylou Whitney, who decided to fund musher Larry Williams' Iditarod quest after taking a ride with his Chugiak, Alaska, sled-dog tour company last year. </P>
<P> The biggest celebrity hitching a sled ride Saturday was Alaska Gov. Tony Knowles. The Democratic governor stood on the sled runners with Buser as the defending champion -- and supporter of Democratic politicians -- departed from the Anchorage start line. </P>
<P> Four other past champions are competing in this year's race, along with Buser. </P>
<P> Five-time champion Rick Swenson, the Iditarod's winningest musher, started his 20th race, and he has said it will be his last, at least for several years. </P>
<P> And back in the race this year after a six-year hiatus, is 1985 champion Libby Riddles, the first woman to win the grueling event. </P>
<P> ``I just think I have one more Iditarod to go in my system,'' she said. Her goal, she said, is to ``just finish happy.'' </P>
<P> But absent from the competition is four-time champion Susan Butcher, who is expecting her first baby in May. </P>
