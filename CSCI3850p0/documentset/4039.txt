<P>  Islamic Jihad leader Fathi al-Shikaki has threatened more attacks like the suicide bombing that killed 21 Israelis earlier this month. </P>
<P> Shikaki said in an interview with Britain's Independent newspaper, published Monday, that he had no advance knowledge of the bombing of the coffee bar in Netanya. </P>
<P> He said at his office in Damascus his alliance would continue efforts to wreck the 1993 peace deal between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization. </P>
<P> ``We will continue our struggle,'' Shikaki said. ``A few years ago, we used knives ... Now we have changed our style ... It's more difficult and expensive for us to get explosives than for anyone else in the world, but if you want to, you can do it.'' </P>
<P> Shikaki said the coffee bar was a military target since it was frequented by Israeli soldiers. </P>
<P> ``We are only defending our right to live in our homeland,'' he said. ``Why do the Jews want to live in a colonial state? ... I have no problem with Jews ... but I will fight occupation.'' </P>
