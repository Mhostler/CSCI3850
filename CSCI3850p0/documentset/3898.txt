<DATELINE>MANCHESTER, England (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A British police investigator said Monday the disastrous 1993 raid by U.S. authorities on a religious cult compound in Waco, Texas, was doomed to fail from the start. </P>
<P> Detective Chief Superintendent Albert Yates, who investigated on behalf of the 23 British victims of the raid and fire in which 75 people died, was giving evidence to an inquest in Manchester that promises to present the first detailed public information of what happened. </P>
<P> Yates told a court in the northern city the FBI's tank and tear gas assault ``had very little, if any, chance of success.'' </P>
<P> ``The (U.S.) Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms Bureau raid on Feb. 28 1993 was doomed to fail from the outset,'' said Yates. </P>
<P> ``It put quite clearly police officers and those within the Mount Carmel centre at unnecessary risk of tragic consequences. All was lost from the moment the agents arrived outside the center,'' he said. </P>
<P> A British man who lost his wife and five adult children in the inferno told the inquest in the northern English city of Manchestor he had warned U.S. authorities nine months earlier that David Koresh, leader of the Branch Davidian cult, was dangerous. </P>
<P> Sam Henry, 58, said he had written a letter warning that Koresh could be ``another Jim Jones'' -- a reference to the cult leader who died with his 913 followers in the Guyana jungle after they all took drinks laced with cyanide. </P>
<P> It was not clear to whom his letter had been addressed. </P>
<P> A U.S. Justice Department report said Koresh was responsible for the deaths at Waco. </P>
<P> It also said the fire which broke out appeared to be an act of mass suicide, mass murder or a combination of the two as Koresh sought to fulfil his own apocalyptic prophecies. </P>
<P> The remains of 50 adults and 25 children were found in the ruins. At least 17 died of gunshot wounds, including Koresh, who was shot in the forehead. Only nine cult members survived. </P>
<P> British police collected detailed ballistics and forensic evidence from the site and the Manchester inquest will see videotapes from inside and outside the heavily armed compound. </P>
<P> Hundreds of guns and more than two million rounds of ammunition were found inside. </P>
<P> Yates said there were hundreds of different police forces at work in the United States and he could not identify a single individual in charge of the Waco incident. </P>
<P> Coroner Leonard Gorodkin -- who must determine the cause of the deaths of the 23 Britons -- said he hoped the inquest would redress the lack of a public hearing in the United States. </P>
<P> A coroner's inquest is required under British law whenever Britons are killed. Yates and Gorodkin gave opening oral statements to the inquiry, which will continue this week. </P>
<P> ``There has not been one focal point in the United States to gather all the information and present it to the public and, more importantly and significantly, present it for the families of the deceased,'' Gorodkin said. </P>
<P> Henry also said he hoped the inquest would highlight the ``indiscriminate'' way in which the FBI stormed the compound with tear gas and tanks. </P>
<P> ``One question that is still unanswered is why the British government did not condemn the U.S. authorities for the way they acted,'' he told reporters. </P>
<P> Briton Paul Horslen, whose brother-in-law Winston Blake, 28, from Nottingham, was killed in a gun battle during the Waco assault, said he had also been worried Koresh was planning a mass suicide. </P>
