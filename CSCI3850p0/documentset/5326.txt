<P>  The United States warned Haiti's government before a supporter of the former military regime was killed this week that she was the target of an assassination plot, the White House said Thursday. </P>
<P> Spokesman Mike McCurry said an FBI team has been sent to Haiti to help the government of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide investigate the murder of Mireille Durocher Bertin. He said information about the plot was developed by U.S. peacekeeping forces and that this had led to the arrest of and jailing of several individuals in Haiti. </P>
<P> After the woman was shot to death Tuesday, Aristide requested U.S. law enforcement assistance and Attorney General Janet Reno sent an FBI team to Haiti, McCurry said. </P>
<P> Asked about reports that those arrested had made allegations of possible involvement in the death by an Aristide faction, McCurry said: ``They made some allegations of that nature that are now being considered.'' </P>
<P> ``The Haitian government, based on the information, informed Ms. Bertin that she was the target of an assassination plot,'' he said. </P>
<P> McCurry suggested the incident could be discussed by President Clinton and Aristide during their talks Friday, noting that the general subject of violence and the need for peaceful reconciliation has been a constant subject of dialogue between the two countries. </P>
