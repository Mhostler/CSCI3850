<P>  Russia's main trade union of coal miners has called for a one-day national strike Feb. 8 over salary arrears, its chairman Vitaly Budko said Thursday. </P>
<P> ``Miners no longer trust the government which constantly refuses to meet its obligations and breaks agreements,'' Budko told Reuters by telephone. </P>
<P> The Rosugleprofsoyuz trade union could call on miners to stage an indefinite strike from March 1 and picket government headquarters in Moscow if the authorities fail to pay at least $2.5 billion in subsidies to the coal sector, Budko said. </P>
<P> Protesters may then turn the strike into a campaign for a new government and early presidential elections, Budko said. </P>
<P> Miners want the government to cover part of its debt to the coal industry and pay salary arrears going back three months. </P>
<P> Coal mining enterprises were owed more than $525 million as of Jan. 1 and the government accumulated a further $124 million of debt in January. </P>
<P> The Ekho Moskvy independent radio station said First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais would meet union leaders and representatives of Russia's main coal producing group Rosugol later Thursday to try to resolve the dispute. </P>
<P> Between 50,000 and 60,000 coal workers from regional branches of Rosugol were still on strike in southern Russia's Rostov region Thursday, Budko said. </P>
<P> The move has brought industrial enterprises in the region to a standstill. Russian television said Wednesday four of the eight units at the local hydroelectrical power plant had already been stopped. </P>
