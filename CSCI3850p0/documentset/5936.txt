<P> GREENSBORO, N.C. - Kirk Triplett used a hot putter to vault to a one-stroke lead Friday after the second round of the $1.5 million Kmart Greater Greensboro Open. </P>
<P> Triplett sank a bunch of long putts as he registered seven birdies in a flawless seven-under-par 65 in a moderate breeze at Forest Oaks. </P>
<P> He posted an 11-under 133 halfway total, while two-time 1995 winner Peter Jacobsen was just a stroke behind after also carding a bogey-free 65. </P>
<P> Triplett, 33, has not won on the PGA Tour, but he finished a healthy 38th on last year's money list, and tied for second at the tour's San Diego tournament in February. </P>
<P> ``I had a hot putter,'' said Triplett, who started a run of four consecutive birdies at the 11th hole, his second. </P>
<P> ``Getting off to a fast start, I was thinking a low number all the way. All of a sudden I started making 20-footers.'' </P>
<P> Only one of Triplett's seven birdies came from inside 15 feet, while his longest birdie was from 50 feet. </P>
<P> ``At the hotel this morning the wind was blowing pretty hard and I thought the greens would really be firm, but they were softer today than they've been all week,'' he added. </P>
<P> Jacobsen continued the excellent form that suddenly has catapulted him to one of the game's hottest players. </P>
<P> He also compiled seven birdies, two courtesy of bunker shots. At the par-five 13th he blasted his second bunker shot into the hole from 20 feet after failing to get out of the sand with his first attempt. </P>
<P> Three holes later he holed out again from the sand, from 60 feet, for his final birdie of the day. </P>
<P> ``My short game's definitely better,'' said Jacobsen, 41, when asked why he was enjoying the best year of his career. </P>
<P> ``I feel very confident. I've been out here 19 years and this is my first year like this. Confidence is such a huge part of the game. </P>
<P> ``I'm now getting to each tournament and thinking 'what are my chances of winning.''' </P>
<P> Among those that missed the cut were Payne Stewart, Mark O'Meara, Craig Stadler, Steve Elkington, defending champion Mike Springer and last week's Heritage Classic winner Bob Tway. </P>
