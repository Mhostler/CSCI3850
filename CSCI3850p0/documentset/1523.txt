<P>  About 5,000 hard-line opponents of President Boris Yeltsin gathered in central Moscow Wednesday to condemn his decision one year ago to dissolve the old conservative Russian parliament. </P>
<P> But their mood was a far cry from the fury of crowds that staged a bloody hard-line revolt in Moscow last October after a two-week standoff between Yeltsin and his rebel parliament. </P>
<P> ``Remember, we must be careful, because we have been defeated once already,'' Ilya Konstantinov, one of the most fiery leaders of the old parliament, told the marchers. </P>
<P> Police kept a low profile as the crowd of communists, conservatives and nationalists gathered in the center of the Russian capital on an exceptionally warm autumn afternoon and blocked traffic. </P>
<P> The rally was addressed by former vice president Alexander Rutskoi, who was sworn in as president by the rebel parliament hours after Yeltsin went on national television on September 21, 1993 to announce the legislature was dissolved. </P>
<P> ``Only in unity can we win against the hated (Yeltsin's) regime,'' Rutskoi said. Other speakers also spoke about the need for unity while sniping at each other. </P>
<P> Yeltsin's main opponents were jailed after their attempt to seize power on October 3 failed. But they were freed in February under a sweeping amnesty declared by the new parliament. </P>
<P> Rutskoi, who headed the fight against Yeltsin with former parliament chairman Ruslan Khasbulatov, remains unrepentant and says he still considers himself vice president. </P>
<P> The rally was attended by mainstream communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, militant communist Viktor Anpilov and former chairman of the Soviet parliament Anatoly Lukyanov. </P>
<P> The most notable absentee was popular ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky. </P>
<P> Yeltsin's television announcement that he was dissolving parliament and calling a referendum on a new constitution was aimed at putting an end to a year of debilitating struggle for power between parliament and president. </P>
<P> It brought the crisis to a head. Two weeks later, at a cost of at least 140 lives, Yeltsin crushed his foes when his tanks battered the White House parliament building into submission. </P>
