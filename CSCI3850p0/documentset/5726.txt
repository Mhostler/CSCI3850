<DATELINE>ZAGREB, Croatia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  In a gloomy farewell message, a senior U.N. official says Bosnia faces a quagmire of indefinite war and believes Croatia will not move beyond an uneasy truce without goodwill gestures to its rebel Serb minority. </P>
<P> Michael Williams, the departing spokesman of U.N. peacekeeping operations in former Yugoslavia, delivered a sobering message at a farewell news conference Thursday. </P>
<P> An urbane, articulate Briton and former journalist, Williams leaves this weekend after a turbulent year in the Balkans to take a fellowship at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. </P>
<P> Williams reflected on the uphill struggle faced by the United Nations and Big Power mediators to restore genuine peace in former Yugoslavia. </P>
<P> A four-month truce between Bosnia's Muslim-led government and separatist Serbs is in shambles three weeks before its formal expiry. Big Power mediators tried to fly to Sarajevo this week but were kept out by Serb threats. </P>
<P> ``The inability of the Contact Group to get to Sarajevo is deplorable in this fragile period when the cease-fire is clearly in the process of breaking down,'' Williams told reporters at U.N. regional headquarters in Croatia. </P>
<P> He said the truce had been undermined by the inability of Big Power diplomats to revive political negotiations between Bosnia's Muslims and Serbs on a territorial settlement. </P>
<P> The Serbs, who overran 70 percent of Bosnia early in the three-year-old war, have rejected a peace plan requiring them to cede land. </P>
<P> ``There is a loneliness about peacekeeping, especially when it is divorced from peacemaking,'' said Williams. </P>
<P> He was alluding to the Big Powers' bewilderment about what to do next after having ruled out armed intervention. </P>
<P> ``There is, I fear, a very substantial danger of a fatigue setting in with regard to the conflict in Bosnia,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``The voices in favor of peace are diminishing on all sides and those declaring for a military option are dominating the stage,'' he said, referring to new Muslim offensives and retaliatory Serb shelling of government-held towns. </P>
<P> In Croatia, a cease-fire with rebel Serbs in the Krajina region who revolted in 1991 against Croatia's right-wing nationalist secession from Yugoslavia has held for a year. </P>
<P> But Williams said true peace anchoring a 1994 truce would remain elusive unless Zagreb tried to persuade the Serbs they could live in safety and equality in an independent Croatia. </P>
<P> ``Serbs throughout Croatia share a deeply ingrained mistrust of the Zagreb government's intentions,'' Williams wrote in an essay published in state-controlled Croatian newspapers. </P>
<P> ``Zagreb continues to insist that its guarantees of human rights are more than adequate and that the international community is obliged to ``deliver' the reintegration of Croatia to avoid a pan-European war,'' Williams wrote. </P>
<P> ``Zagreb must be disabused of this self-deception. </P>
<P> ``The international community should strongly advise Zagreb to refocus its energies from the goal of regaining the ``occupied territories' to the goal of gaining the hearts and minds of the population that lives there.'' </P>
