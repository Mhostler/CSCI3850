<DATELINE>NANTES, France (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, runaway favorite to win the French presidency in May, backed away from a clash with students Friday by suspending a decree tightening admission to universities. </P>
<P> He said the government would review new rules, affecting 100,000 students at so-called University Technology Institutes, after a wave of strikes and anti-government protests brought dissent to his otherwise placid presidential campaign. </P>
<P> Students at the 90 technology institutes say the rules would prevent most of them from pursuing university studies at the end of two-year courses ranging from business studies to physics. </P>
<P> ``The circular (on the institutes) is suspended to be reviewed by all partners,'' aides quoted Balladur as telling France 3 television in an interview to be broadcast later. </P>
<P> He was visiting the western town of Nantes, one of several places where students held protests. </P>
<P> They also occupied highway toll booths outside Montpellier to hand out leaflets to motorists and marched through central Paris despite Balladur's assurances, saying the circular should be withdrawn altogether. </P>
<P> Seven students were slightly hurt in a clash with riot police in the eastern town of Besancon Thursday. </P>
<P> The Education Ministry had sought to defuse the dispute, saying the rules it issued in December had been misinterpreted and would be reviewed. </P>
<P> Hundreds of thousands of teachers and students held a wider strike earlier this week to air anti-government grievances about everything from pay to tuition fees. </P>
<P> Balladur, leading the race to succeed President Francois Mitterrand, has been criticized as caving in too easily during his 23 months in power to street protests by groups ranging from students to fishermen. </P>
<P> As an aide to then prime minister George Pompidou in 1968, Balladur was credited with a cool handling of student riots. </P>
<P> Opinion polls show that Balladur has been cruising toward the presidency, even though many voters are still undecided. </P>
<P> A poll due to appear in the weekly magazine Le Point Saturday said he would beat his Gaullist rival Jacques Chirac by a 60-40 percent margin and defeat Socialist candidate Lionel Jospin by 58-42 percent. </P>
