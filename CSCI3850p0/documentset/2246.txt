<P>  An Azeri plane hijacker released over two dozen hostages in an unruly region of southern Russia Wednesday after the authorities gave him a ransom of $2.3 million. </P>
<P> The commercial radio station Ekho Moskvy said he had doubled his ransom demand after freeing two crew members in mid-evening. Earlier in the day, he had set free a total of 26 prisoners. </P>
<P> ``The terrorist is demanding another $2 million,'' Ekho Moskvy said. </P>
<P> There were conflicting reports of how many hostages were still being held. While Ekho Moskvy said only the captain of the plane was still captive, Itar-Tass new agency said two pilots remained on board. </P>
<P> The hijacking began late Tuesday on Russia's volatile southern border, a mountainous region so notorious for mass kidnappings that the local media call it ``The Bermuda Triangle.'' </P>
<P> The hijacker, believed to be acting alone, started releasing hostages at dawn and demanded a passage to Iran. Security officials said discussions were going on at the highest level on whether to let the plane leave. </P>
<P> Russian authorities refueled the Yak-40 plane and made a formal request to Iran to let it land. But Itar-Tass quoted Iran's foreign ministry as saying it would not let the plane into its airspace under any circumstances. </P>
<P> The hijacker, whom Interfax news agency named as Mekhtizade Eton-Said-ogly, seized the plane on a flight from Makhachkala, the crime-ridden capital of the ehtnic republic of Daghestan on the Caspian Sea, and ordered it to return there. </P>
<P> Released passengers said he was carrying only a parcel, which he said contained explosives, and was behaving without undue aggression, Interfax said. </P>
