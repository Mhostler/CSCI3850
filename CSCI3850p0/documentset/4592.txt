<DATELINE>PRETORIA, South Africa (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Nelson Mandela said Monday the government will deploy extra police backed by soldiers to combat crime and violence in South Africa. </P>
<P> ``It was noted that there were areas ... where incidents of violent crime were unacceptably high,'' the president's office said after talks between Mandela, his defense and police ministers and Deputy President F.W. de Klerk. </P>
<P> The statement said police ``would develop a concrete plan to address this problem. This includes...immediate deployment of additional police backed by the South African National Defense Force in areas to be identified.'' </P>
<P> South African Police Commissioner George Fivaz told reporters that specific steps would be taken in the volatile KwaZulu-Natal region. </P>
<P> Violence monitors have given warning of fresh violence in the Zulu heartland of KwaZulu-Natal after Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi announced a boycott of parliament by his Inkatha Freedom Party last week. </P>
<P> The security crackdown comes as police said at least 38 people were murdered over the weekend in and around South Africa's commercial capital Johannesburg. </P>
<P> ``It's quite high at 38 this weekend but it's normal that more murders are reported over a weekend than in the week. Overall it's dropping,'' police spokesman Jan Combrinck said. </P>
<P> Mandela's government has vowed to curb rampant crime and police said Monday overall crime rates had decreased since South Africa's democracy elections last April. </P>
<P> Combrinck said 13 people were found murdered on average every day last year in and around Johannesburg in South Africa's Gauteng province, compared to the daily toll of 18 in the province during during 1993. </P>
<P> Defense Minister Joe Modise, speaking after the meeting with Mandela, told reporters the talks focused on crime in Gauteng and other trouble spots. </P>
<P> ``From the charts that they showed us today it seems the level of crime around Gauteng is very high,'' Modise added. </P>
<P> Police said 72 car hijackings, many at gunpoint, 302 thefts from cars and 599 office and house break-ins were carried out in and around Johannesburg during the weekend. </P>
