<P>  Some of the members of a doomsday cult who died in two Swiss villages this week were murdered, the magistrate conducting the inquiry said Saturday. </P>
<P> ``We spoke at first of a collective suicide,'' Andrei Piller told a news conference. ``We can today affirm that for certain cases it was not suicide but murder.'' </P>
<P> A total of 48 people, all believed linked to a secretive ``Order of the Solar Temple,'' were found dead on Wednesday in Cheiry and Granges in Switzerland and five more at Morin Heights near Montreal in Canada's Quebec province. </P>
<P> Police initially thought they may have been involved in a mass ``death pact.'' But Piller said Saturday, ``There was perhaps suicide for certain people or groups, but for some there was murder.'' </P>
<P> The magistrate would not say if the leaders of the cult, French Canadian businessman Joseph di Mambro, 70, and Belgian homeopathic doctor Luc Jouret, 46, were among the bodies found in Switzerland. But he confirmed that a international arrest warrants have been issued for the two men. </P>
<P> Asked about reports from Canada that the cult leaders were involved in arms trafficking bringing in large sums of money, Piller said studies of bank accounts were continuing but added: ``I can confirm that we will have some astonishing surprises.'' </P>
