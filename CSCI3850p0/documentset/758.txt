<P>  Iran hanged a man in public Saturday for plotting to bomb a mosque in the southern city of Zahedan, the Iranian news agency IRNA reported. </P>
<P> IRNA, describing Bahram Abbas-Zadeh as a member of the Iraqi-based opposition group Mujahideen Khalq, said onlookers chanted ``Death to America'' as the man was hanged in a Zahedan square. </P>
<P> The Mujahideen said in Paris that Abbas-Zadeh had no links with it and described the affair as a prelude to Iranian attacks on its bases in Iraq and on its members abroad. </P>
<P> IRNA said Abbas-Zadeh ``was arrested on June 23 while on his way to bomb the Sunni Makki mosque'' in Zahedan. </P>
<P> He ``had confessed during his trial that MKO (the Mujahideen) had planned the bombing of Makki mosque in order to create Sunni-Shiite strife within the country,'' it added. </P>
<P> Zahedan is a mostly Sunni Muslim city and capital of Sistan Baluchistan province bordering Pakistan and Afghanistan. </P>
<P> IRNA said Sunnis and Shiites watched the hanging at Khayyam square near the mosque. It quoted one of those present, Seyyed Hajji Kurd, as saying the hanging would ``please God.'' </P>
<P> ``May God damn all those who want to sow discord among Muslims,'' it quoted Kurd as adding. </P>
<P> Tehran radio reported in June that authorities had arrested Abbas-Zadeh. The court verdict reported by IRNA on Saturday said ``the divine verdict in the case of the defendant Abbas-Zadeh will be executed.'' </P>
<P> In an interview broadcast on Iranian television Saturday and reported by IRNA, Abbas-Zadeh said he joined the Mujahideen last year and was trained in Iraq before being ``assigned to plant a bomb at Makki mosque.'' </P>
<P> IRNA quoted Abbas-Zadeh, who is from Ardebil in northwestern Iran, as saying that he met Mehdi Nahvi, also described by Iran as a Mujahideen member, before he was to carry out the Zahedan mission. </P>
<P> After Abbas-Zadeh's arrest, Iran named Nahvi as suspect for a blast which killed 26 people at the Imam Reza shrine in Mashad on June 20, the worst bombing in Iran since the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war. </P>
<P> ``Nahvi told me that in the light of the bomb blast...at the holy shrine of Imam Reza...the bombing in Zahedan...where I was assigned to would prompt a conflict between the Shias and the Sunnis,'' IRNA quoted Abbas-Zadeh as saying. </P>
<P> Iran said Nahvi died in the hospital from bullet wounds received during his arrest. </P>
<P> The Mujahideen, which also denies any links with Nahvi, denounced the Abbas-Zadeh affair in a statement from its office in Paris as ``foolish theatrics.'' </P>
