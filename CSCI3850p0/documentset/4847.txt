<P>  Jamaica's Merlene Ottey clinched the first world championship short sprint title of her illustrious career when she won the women's 60 meters on the opening day of the world indoor track and field championships Friday. </P>
<P> The 34-year-old Ottey, who had previously twice won medals in the indoor short sprint but had never managed the gold, dominated the race from the start to win in 6.97 seconds. </P>
<P> Ottey was a good stride ahead of the field at the halfway stage and clinched victory in style. German Melanie Paschke nipped American Carlette Guidry by one-hundredth of a second to claim the silver. </P>
<P> Before Friday's race, Ottey had come tantalizingly close to a short sprint title both indoors and outdoors. </P>
<P> With Russian world record holder Irina Privalova opting to run the 400 meters only in Barcelona, Ottey took her chance to seal a record six world indoor medals and her third title after victories in the 200 at the 1989 and 1991 championships. </P>
<P> The Jamaican finished second over 100 meters at the 1993 world outdoor championships and also took the silver in the 1991 60 meters indoors. </P>
<P> ``That was a very good race for me and I never felt as though I was not in control of it,'' Ottey said. </P>
<P> Canada's Bruny Surin successfully defended his men's 60 meters title with a powerful performance in an 6.46 seconds, the fastest time in the world this year. </P>
<P> The Haiti-born Surin was neck-and-neck with Britain's Darren Braithwaite at the halfway mark but pulled away in the last 30 meters. </P>
<P> Braithwaite held his form to take second in 6.51. The silver was the 26-year-old's first medal at a major championship and made up for his disappointment at last year's European outdoor championships when he dropped the baton in the sprint relay. Canadian Robert Esmie was third in 6.55. </P>
<P> Missing from the competition was Olympic sprint champion Linford Christie. Christie, who was in the stadium to watch the race, had clocked the fastest previous time of 1995 with his European record of 6.47. </P>
<P> The veteran Briton did not compete here after failing to get a wild card from the sport's governing body after he made a late decision to try to take part. </P>
<P> Surin said afterwards: ``I am a bit disappointed that Linford was not in the race but he had his reasons. Perhaps if he would have been here, it would have been even faster.'' </P>
<P> Finland's Mika Halvari won the men's shot put with a best effort of 20.74 meters. American C.J. Hunter took the silver with 20.58 and Yugoslav Dragan Peric won the bronze. </P>
<P> The fourth and final title of the opening day went to Russian Svetlana Moskalets who won the pentathlon ahead of American Kym Carter. </P>
