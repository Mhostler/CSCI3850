<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Attorney General and baseball fan Janet Reno said Thursday any review of Major League Baseball's exemption from the federal anti-trust laws should be done in the future and not because of the forthcoming strike. </P>
<P> Reno, commenting at her weekly briefing with reporters on the long-standing exclusion baseball has had from anti-monopoly laws, left it unclear though whether there would be such a review down the road. </P>
<P> In response to a question, she said any look at baseball's anti-trust exemption should not be made because of the forthcoming strike by players after Friday's deadline. </P>
<P> ``I don't think something like that should be examined in light of the impending strike,'' she said. ``I think it's something that we should review and consider on a long-range basis.'' </P>
<P> But when asked directly if she was advocating a review, she said ``no,'' and referred questions to the Justice Department's Anti-Trust Division, where a spokesman was not immediately available for comment. </P>
<P> While she did not get into any specifics of a review, if one is done, Reno did reveal her life-long love affair with baseball -- especially as a child when she had been a devoted fan of the Brooklyn Dodgers. </P>
<P> And to prove her point, the former Miami prosecutor recited the lineup of the old Dodgers before the team moved to Los Angeles. </P>
<P> ``Jackie Robinson and Pee Wee Reese and Gil Hodges and Duke Snider and Carl Furillo and Roy Campanella were heroes to me,'' she said. </P>
<P> She loved the old Dodgers so much, she said, she even named a pet colt after the team, ``The Dodger.'' </P>
<P> ``Then they moved to Los Angeles and that crushed me, `` she said. </P>
<P> And she confided another disappointment to reporters. </P>
<P> ``All my life I had wanted Major League Baseball in Miami,'' she said. ``Two weeks before I'm about to be able to go to Major League ball in Miami, I come to the only major city in the country (Washington) that doesn't have a Major League team.'' </P>
<P> The National League's Florida Marlins started playing in Miami last season, just after Reno became Attorney-General. </P>
<P> On the expected strike, she said: ``I'm not happy about it.'' </P>
<P> Earlier Thursday, Vice President Al Gore said both sides in the looming baseball strike had rejected the administration's offer to mediate. </P>
