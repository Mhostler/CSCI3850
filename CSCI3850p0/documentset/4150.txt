<P>  A British yachtsman who survived two months adrift on the Indian Ocean with limited food and water Sunday defended his decision to sail from Singapore to Mauritius on a voyage that cost his wife's life. </P>
<P> ``I can't blame myself,'' Ashok Baljoresai said, when asked if he considered it reckless to set out on such a long voyage without a satellite beacon and without notifying anyone in Mauritius of their likely arrival date. </P>
<P> ``I just had very bad luck,'' Baljoresai told a crowded news conference. ``You could go out on the street tomorrow and be knocked over.'' </P>
<P> The ordeal had not put him off ocean sailing, he added. </P>
<P> The 54-year-old yachtsman described drifting on his crippled yacht in the middle of the Indian Ocean and being forced to bury his wife at sea. </P>
<P> The Russian cargo ship that rescued the Mauritian-born former laboratory technician two weeks ago arrived in Fremantle in Western Australia on Saturday. </P>
<P> He said the trip had turned into a nightmare Nov. 28 when a huge storm blew up and his 33-foot yacht lost its mast in strong winds and huge waves. </P>
<P> The engine failed and the batteries powering the yacht's radio died. </P>
<P> His wife of three months, Pamela Thompson, 66, died on or around Jan. 12. They had married in Singapore shortly before setting out to Mauritius. </P>
<P> She had shown signs of illness even before the storm struck, but he was not sure exactly why she died. </P>
<P> ``It was a gradual thing,'' Baljoresai said. </P>
<P> ``The intake of food was diminishing until finally she started vomiting and she couldn't keep down the water. She just became dehydrated.'' </P>
<P> Baljoresai said his wife did not speak about her illness and appeared to enter a coma before she died in his arms. </P>
<P> The day after she died, Baljoresai cleaned his wife's body, dressed her in clean clothes, tied a portion of the mast to her body to act as a weight and said a prayer before lowering her into the water. </P>
<P> Baljoresai said he might have survived a few weeks longer on his rations of flour, rice and the cup of water a day he was able to distill. </P>
<P> ``I probably could have lasted another month maximum.'' </P>
<P> Baljoresai lived in London from 1967 to 1988 and met his wife when they were working at a hospital in London. </P>
<P> The pair became sailing companions in 1988 and had been living in the small Mauritian village of Baie-du-Cap before flying to Singapore to buy the yacht. </P>
<P> The news conference saw heated scenes between Australian and British media representatives as a British reporter who said his paper had paid Baljoresai for exclusive aspects of the story attempted to wind up the briefing. </P>
<P> Baljoresai said he still hoped his uninsured yacht might eventually wash up on the coast of Australia or New Zealand. </P>
<P> Australian police and a coroner had interviewed him on arrival in Fremantle and were satisfied with his explanation of his wife's death, he said. </P>
<P> He planned to return to Mauritius as soon as possible. </P>
