<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Supreme Court agreed Tuesday to decide the constitutionality of a controversial Colorado anti-gay rights ballot measure in a case that could have nationwide impact on gay rights. </P>
<P> The justices agreed to review a Colorado Supreme Court ruling last year that the 1992 measure, which bars state or local governments from adopting gay rights laws, denies gays equal protection under the Constitution. </P>
<P> The high court decision to step into the controversy could have far-reaching implications for gay rights legal battles around the country. </P>
<P> Anti-gay initiatives have become a contentious political issue and have resulted in several court challenges. A federal judge last year struck down a Cincinnati anti-gay law. </P>
<P> The justices will hear arguments in the Colorado case in the term starting in October, with a decision likely early in 1996. </P>
<P> The measure, blocked by the courts from taking effect, would have invalidated gay rights laws in Denver, Boulder and Aspen that barred discrimination in jobs and housing based on sexual orientation. </P>
<P> The amendment, adopted by a 53 percent majority, declared that there was no special legal protection based on a person's ''homosexual, lesbian or bisexual orientation.'' </P>
<P> ``The rights of any minority should not be swept away by popular vote,'' said Kevin Cathcart, executive director of the New York-based Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, a gay rights advocacy group which had challenged the law. </P>
<P> ``The court recognized the serious implications that anti-gay initiatives have on the democratic process. We now look forward to a ruling to end this national assault on lesbian and gay civil rights,'' he said in a statement. </P>
<P> Adoption of the amendment, which had been initiated by a conservative group called Colorado for Family Values, briefly spawned a nationwide boycott against tourism and other state businesses. </P>
<P> Several gay individuals, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and by the Lambda gay rights group, and the three Colorado cities challenged the amendment in court. </P>
<P> Colorado Attorney General Gale Norton appealed to the Supreme Court to uphold the amendment. </P>
<P> ``There are few issues as divisive as the standing of homosexuals and bisexuals in American society,'' she said, criticizing the creation of ``new constitutional rights'' in response to ``socially worrisome issues.'' </P>
<P> She said in the appeal that the amendment sought to prevent gays from receiving preferred legal protection, but was not intended to eliminate all their legal rights. </P>
<P> ``The issue in this case is neither isolated nor inconsequential,'' Norton said arguing that the state high court ``nullified the will of the people of Colorado'' and created uncertainty about popular self-government. </P>
<P> Alabama, Idaho and Virginia supported Colorado's appeal. In court papers filed by failed Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork, the three states said the amendment does not impair any fundamental constitutional right. </P>
<P> Lawyers for opponents of the amendment said Norton's claims were exaggerated. </P>
