<P>  Incoming Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole has threatened to block a $4 billion U.S.-North Korean nuclear deal if a U.S. pilot being held by Pyongyang is not released, The Washington Times reported Wednesday. </P>
<P> Dole said he was not prepared to call for an outright rejection of the deal aimed at reducing North Korea's potential to manufacture nuclear weapons. </P>
<P> Under the accord, Pyongyang suspended its nuclear weapons and energy program in exchange for a promise from Washington to supply some replacement fuel oil by Jan. 21 and organize a consortium to build light-water nuclear reactors worth $4 billion. </P>
<P> The United States and North Korea also agreed to set up the first diplomatic liaison offices in their respective countries since 1953. </P>
<P> But Dole said the capture of Chief Warrant Officer Bobby Hall and the death of Hall's co-pilot could be a reason to block what he called ``a lousy deal anyhow.'' He added, ``You can't trust the North Koreans.'' </P>
<P> Hall and co-pilot David Hilemon landed a helicopter in North Korean territory Dec. 17 under disputed circumstances. North Korea said it shot the chopper down and is convinced the aircraft was on a spying mission. The United States said the helicopter made an emergency landing and was on a routine training mission. </P>
<P> Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., the outgoing chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee, said, ``I don't think we'd proceed with our side of the nuclear accord if they don't release the airman.'' </P>
<P> Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Thomas Hubbard arrived in Pyongyang Wednesday for talks aimed at securing Hall's release. </P>
