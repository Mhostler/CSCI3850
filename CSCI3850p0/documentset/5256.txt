<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, March 28 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Belgium, eager to cash in on expanding business opportunities in India, offered on Tuesday to serve as an intermediary between the European Union and New Delhi as they thrash out trade issues. </P>
<P> Trade Minister Robert Urbain said Belgium was well placed geographically and politically to serve as a conduit for India's concerns, including Western attempts to curb child labour. </P>
<P> ``Almost all the delegations in contact with the European Union (EU) have bilateral contacts with us,'' Urbain told a news conference. ``We can play an intermediary role.'' </P>
<P> Urbain and Belgain Prince Philippe were leading a week-long trade and investment mission to India. </P>
<P> ``Belgium is the gateway to Europe,'' the crown prince told the news conference, saying his country was in the forefront of European integration and located in the heart of the EU. </P>
<P> Indo-Belgian commerce, estimated at about $3 billion in 1994, was growing but dominated by the diamond trade and needs to be diversified, Urbain said. </P>
<P> Urbain said he hoped Belgium would soon ratify a 1993 accord, already approved by India, to avoid double taxation. Belgium also wants to reach an agreement on a bilateral investment protection treaty by the end of 1995, he said. </P>
<P> The use of child labour has also become a trade issue because of pressure to have the new World Trade Organisation (WTO) link trade benefits with environmental standards and social issues such as child labour. </P>
<P> India has stoutly resisted the campaign, led by the United States and France, to have the WTO to take up child labour. Many Western nations claim India and other developing countries use low-cost child labour to gain an unfair trade advantage. </P>
<P> New Delhi argues that the International Labour Organisation is responsible for global labour standards, and that industrialised economies want to use the issue of child labour to erect protectionist barriers. </P>
<P> Urbain said Belgium was concerned over child labour but did not support the use of trade sanctions as curbs. </P>
