<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Clinton said Sunday that one of the helicopter pilots downed over North Korea Saturday had been killed in the incident and the other was uninjured, citing information provided by Pyongyang. </P>
<P> The U.S. government is pressing for the prompt return of the surviving crewman to the United States, as well as the remains of the man who died, Clinton said in a statement released by the White House. </P>
<P> Saying the helicopter had ``strayed into North Korean airspace'', Clinton declared: ``This tragic loss of life was unnecessary.'' </P>
<P> He said Congressman Bill Richardson, a New Mexico Democrat who happened to be in North Korea when the incident happened, was staying there ``for now'' and would be in constant contact with North Korean officials. </P>
<P> ``We are using all available channels to press for an early resolution of this manner,'' Clinton said in the statement. </P>
<P> The United States had been pressuring North Korea for details on the OH-58 helicopter and the pilots since shortly after it went down three to four miles north of the demilitarized zone (DMZ) in the eastern sector of the Korean border Saturday morning. </P>
<P> Clinton said the information about the fate of the chopper's crew came from the North Korean government through Richardson, who is in Pyongyang. </P>
<P> ``We have been informed by the government of the Democratic Republic of North Korea ...that one of the pilots of the U.S. Army helicopter that strayed into North Korean airspace on Dec 16 -- Chief Warrant officer David Hilemon of Clarksville, Tennesee -- was killed in the downing of the helicopter,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``North Korean officials have told Congressman Richardson that the other crewman -- Chief Warrant Officer Bobby Hall of Brooksville, Florida -- is alive and reportedly uninjured,'' Clinton said. </P>
<P> ``Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of both of these dedicated aviators,'' Clinton said. </P>
<P> ``Congressman Richardson, who has been in continuing contact with Secretary of State Warren Christopher during this period, has at my instructions told the North Korean government that we want prompt access to Chief Warrant Officer Hall and his return to a U.S. facility along with the remains of Chief Warrant Officer Hilemon,'' Clinton said. </P>
