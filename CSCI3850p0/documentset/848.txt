<P>  For the second time in five months, German tourists have unknowingly spent the night in a south Florida motel room that contained a rotting corpse, police said Wednesday. </P>
<P> The latest incident occurred at the Venice hotel in Fort Lauderdale, where the manager found the decaying body of a man wrapped in a plastic bag and stuffed under a bed Wednesday. Air fresheners had been placed inside the fly-covered bag. </P>
<P> Police said the man had clearly been dead several days, but that the last guests who stayed in the room apparently did not know the corpse was there. </P>
<P> ``There was a German family in the room on the 15th and 16th (Monday and Tuesday) and they checked out,'' said Fort Lauderdale Police spokeswoman Sonia Friedman. </P>
<P> An autopsy was pending, and investigators were eager to contact the man who rented the room before the Germans. </P>
<P> In March, a maid at the Travelers Hotel near the Miami airport discovered a decaying female corpse under the mattress in a platform-type bed after a German guest complained of a foul odor in his room. </P>
<P> The German visitor was not a suspect and was allowed to return to his homeland. Police were still looking for the man who had occupied the room before him. </P>
