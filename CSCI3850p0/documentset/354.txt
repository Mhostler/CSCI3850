<P>  A frail Rose Kennedy, matriarch of the famed U.S. political family, marked her 104th birthday Friday at her Cape Cod home with 104 pink roses from her only surviving son, Senator Edward Kennedy. </P>
<P> ``She'll have a quiet day today,'' said Scott Ferson, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Democrat. </P>
<P> Mrs Kennedy, confined to a wheelchair and under 24-hour medical care, was to spend much of the day resting for a small private party with family members Saturday. </P>
<P> ``She'll get a delivery of flowers from the senator today. She'll be resting to prepare for the party,'' Ferson said. </P>
<P> Mrs Kennedy's health has declined so that she cannot go to the local Roman Catholic church in Hyannis. Instead she celebrates Mass each day with a priest who comes to her home. </P>
<P> ``At 104 she is very frail ... she is able to communicate with Senator Kennedy and family members,'' said Melody Miller, a spokeswoman for the senator in Washington, who refused to give other details of Mrs Kennedy's health. </P>
<P> Family members, including Kennedy and his sister, Eunice Shriver, as well as a number of Mrs Kennedy's grandchildren and great-grandchildren plan to gather Saturday for a party in her home at the family's Cape Cod compound at Hyannisport. </P>
<P> Miller said Mrs Kennedy enjoys watching videos of her family and being wheeled about the compound by the senator or one of the health aides who attend her 24 hours a day. </P>
<P> ``Mother continues to be a beacon of love and continuity within our family,'' the senator said. ``... This year I've found special pleasure in seeing her impact on Curran and Caroline (his stepchildren, ages 11 and 8) and the discovery that she has inspired them too.'' </P>
<P> The daughter of a Boston mayor and belle of Boston's Irish-American political circles when she married banker Joseph P. Kennedy, Mrs Kennedy has lost four of her nine children to violent death. </P>
<P> Her eldest son Joseph was killed in World War II; her daughter Kathleen died in a 1948 plane crash; President John Kennedy was killed by an assassin in Dallas November 22, 1963; and Senator Robert Kennedy was murdered in Los Angeles in 1968 as he campaigned for the presidency. </P>
<P> Although Kennedy is running for re-election to his sixth term as senator and his mother's birthday comes the same week as the 25th anniversary of the 1969 Chappaquiddick car accident, the family gathering will not include serious political talks, Miller said. </P>
<P> ``We're not having some political meeting here,'' Miller said. ``This is going to be mostly applauding the kids doing poetry, singing Irish songs. Everybody will be cheering and chapping. A lot of love.'' </P>
<P> The senator earlier this week expressed his regrets for the 1969 Chappaquiddick accident in which Mary Jo Kopechne died when the senator's car plunged from a bridge into a tidal stream. </P>
<P> The senator was to attend a Boston gathering Friday at which a card for his mother signed by 700 elderly Boston residents was to be presented in a waterfront park that contains a Rose Kennedy rose garden. </P>
<P> Jean Kennedy Smith, Senator Kennedy's sister and ambassador to Ireland, was to celebrate her mother's birthday in Dublin by sponsoring a gathering for 40 mothers of disabled children, 20 each from the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland, Miller said. </P>
