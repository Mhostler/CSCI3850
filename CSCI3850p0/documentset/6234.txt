<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  South African President Nelson Mandela, in a growing row with Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, threatened Wednesday to amend the constitution to enable financial sanctions against KwaZulu-Natal province. </P>
<P> The threat drew an immediate riposte from Buthelezi, who said he may meet Mandela's unconstitutional move with an unconstitutional act of his own. </P>
<P> Mandela accused Buthelezi, home affairs minister in his coalition cabinet and leader of the federalist Inkatha Freedom Party, of using government funds to foment violence in his home province of KwaZulu-Natal. </P>
<P> ``Chief Buthelezi...has made a call to the Zulus to rise against the government and for that call he uses the resources we give him in order to improve the living conditions of the people in his province,'' he told the Cape Town Press Club. </P>
<P> ``If the situation that is taking place in Natal is allowed to go on, I have no alternative, and I want everyone to know, that I will use everything to protect the lives of innocent People in the province.'' </P>
<P> Mandela renewed a threat made Monday to cut funding to the Inkatha-led provincial government and said if he did not have the power to enforce his threat, he would acquire it. </P>
<P> His recent threat came after his lawyers told reporters on Tuesday the president had backed down from his controversial threat to cut funding for Chief Buthelezi's rebellious KwaZulu-Natal province. </P>
<P> ``If I do not have the legal power to do so, I will have to change the constitution. If I haven't got the power now, I will have to make sure that I have the power,'' he said Wednesday. </P>
<P> Buthelezi Tuesday denied calling for violent resistance to the transitional government of national unity elected a year ago to eradicate the effects of over 300 years of white rule. </P>
<P> But he warned in a repetition of an earlier challenge to Mandela that his people would not be intimidated and would continue to demand federal autonomy for their province. </P>
<P> Wednesday the Zulu leader told reporters in Ulundi, capital of the KwaZulu-Natal province, he had been ``flabbergasted'' by Mandela's threats to change the constitution. </P>
<P> ``I would really be surprised if he would do something that has been described by his own specialist as unconstitutional.'' </P>
<P> He said he would retaliate if Mandela flouted the interim constitution currently governing South Africa until 1999 when the final post-apartheid one would have been completed. </P>
<P> ``If he does something unconstitutional then he must expect other people will take a cue from him and use unconstitutional means to oppose what he's doing,'' Buthelezi said. </P>
<P> Buthelezi had insisted on implementation of a pre-election accord with Mandela and then president F.W. de Klerk on foreign mediation of his party's demand for provincial autonomy. </P>
<P> Kenyan academic Washington Okumu, who helped broker the mediation accord which brought Buthelezi into the 1994 election at the last moment, said Tuesday he hoped to help break the latest constitutional impasse. </P>
<P> Mandela said he would hesitate to impose emergency rule in KwaZulu-Natal, one of only two of South Africa's nine provinces not ruled by his party, but would do so if necessary. </P>
