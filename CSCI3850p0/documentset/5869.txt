<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Clinton Wednesday denounced the car-bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma as the work of ``evil cowards'' and vowed that those responsible will be tracked down and severely punished. </P>
<P> ``The United States will not tolerate and I will not allow the people of this country to be intimidated by evil cowards,'' a grim-faced Clinton declared in a steely voice. </P>
<P> A huge car bomb devastated a government building in Oklahoma City Wednesday, killing scores of people and bringing mayhem and horror to the heart of Middle America. </P>
<P> It was the biggest act of terror in U.S. history, overtaking the 1993 explosion at the World Trade Center in New York City which killed six people and injured 1,000 others. </P>
<P> ``Let there be no room for doubt we will find the people who did this,'' Clinton told reporters at the White House. ``When we do, justice will be swift, certain and severe. These people are killers and must be treated like killers.''  Clinton, who learned of the attack while meeting Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, said ``the bombing in Oklahoma City was an attack on innocent children and defenseless citizens. It was an act of cowardice and it was evil.'' </P>
<P> Attorney General Janet Reno, a longtime foe of capital punishment, said current law authorizes the severest penalty for attacks on federal building in which people are killed. </P>
<P> ``The death penalty is available and we will seek it,'' Reno told reporters, reflecting the stern, angry mood that gripped the White House.  Clinton said he had deployed a crisis management team, under the direction of the FBI, to the scene of the blast -- which was felt as far away as 15 miles. </P>
<P> The team will coordinate efforts of the Department of Justice, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, along with military and local authorities. </P>
<P> Clinton also declared a state of emergency in the city to speed federal emergency aid to help victims. </P>
<P> Reno vowed that ``the FBI and the law enforcement community will pursue every lead and use every possible resource to bring the people responsible to justice.'' </P>
<P> ``We are pursuing absolutely every shred of evidence available,'' she said, but declined to say how long it might take to track down those responsible. </P>
<P> Reno declined to say the bombing was an act of terrorism, telling reporters: ``I would not characterize it as such until the evidence is in.'' </P>
<P> Secretary of State Warren Christopher, however, said the bombing ``reminds us of the urgency and importance of our efforts to combat terrorism, both at home and abroad.'' </P>
<P> He said personnel from the State Department's counterterrorism office would be part of the U.S. team probing the bombing. </P>
<P> Federal agencies told workers around the country to be security conscious and safeguards were increased at the White House. Some reporters had to place their lunchbags on an X-ray machine on entering the complex. </P>
