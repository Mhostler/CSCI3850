<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  South Korean Unification Minister Lee Hong-koo told North Korea Thursday not to try to twist Seoul's plan to resume economic contacts for political gain. </P>
<P> ``We will resolutely cope with any North Korean attempts to politically use South-North economic cooperation by linking the issue to its anti-South strategy,'' Lee told the National Assembly's foreign affairs and unification committee. </P>
<P> South Korea last week said it would allow local firms to set up offices in North Korea and start ``pilot projects for economic cooperation,'' moving swiftly to capitalize on the U.S.-North Korean nuclear deal signed in Geneva last month. </P>
<P> North Korea rejected the offer as ``camouflage for concealing the dark designs'' of Seoul for what it called national division and confrontation. </P>
<P> North Korea said that if South Korea wanted to improve ties, it must first apologise for freezing relations over the issue of the North's nuclear program and abolish security laws, which impose heavy penalties for unauthorized contacts with North Korea. </P>
<P> ``If the North demands the abolition of the National Security Law ... as a precondition for South-North economic cooperation, the government will never consider it,'' Lee said. </P>
<P> He said he expected North Korea to resume economic ties with South Korean firms on a selective basis. </P>
<P> ``What is really on their mind is economic cooperation with the South. But I believe the North will try to freeze ties for the time being in order to tighten control over its people during the period of power transfer (from late President Kim Il-sung to his designated successor Kim Jong-il),'' Lee said. </P>
<P> A Seoul newspaper reported Thursday that a senior North Korean trade official had secretly visited Beijing last week to meet South Korean businessmen. </P>
<P> The Joong-ang Daily News said Kim Jong-u, vice-chairman of North Korea's External Economy Commission, expressed hopes that southern firms would invest in northeastern Najin and Sonbong, where a free trade zone is being set up. </P>
<P> ``Despite the announcement by North Korean authorities (to reject Seoul's offer for economic cooperation), the Northern side strongly asked for investment by southern companies during the contacts,'' it quoted a local business source as saying. </P>
<P> Unification ministry officials declined to comment. </P>
<P> Tension on the Korean peninsula has eased considerably since the nuclear accord between Washington and communist North Korea, raising hopes of renewed inter-Korean dialogue. </P>
<P> South Korea has said its lifting of the two-year-old business ban and other moves to detente are contingent on North Korea implementing the nuclear accord. </P>
<P> Under the accord, North Korea pledged to dismantle its current nuclear program, which the West suspects is being used to make atomic bombs, in return for over $4 billion in international aid for new reactors that produce very little plutonium for bomb-making. </P>
