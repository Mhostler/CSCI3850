<P>  Incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich spoke out Tuesday against last week's abortion clinic murders and said the federal government should coordinate with local law enforcement agencies to prevent more such violence. </P>
<P> ``The events of late last week cannot be tolerated and I don't think that we can accept any one for any reason taking the law into their own hands and violating the political process,'' Gingrich told reporters before leaving for Washington. </P>
<P> The shootings left two dead in Massachusetts. </P>
<P> ``I think that whatever steps need to be taken by the federal government to coordinate with local law enforcement officials should be taken,'' he said. </P>
<P> The Georgia Republican spoke briefly with reporters as he prepared to leave on a chartered Boeing 767 called ``The Speaker's Express,'' with some 200 supporters. He would not take any questions or elaborate on his remarks. </P>
<P> Gingrich, who assumes leadership of the House of Representatives Wednesday, said he hoped to prove that Americans with a wide range of opinions can work together peacefully. </P>
<P> John Salvi, a 22-year-old student hairdresser, has been accused of two counts of first-degree murder in the slayings of receptionists at two abortion clinics in Brookline, near Boston last week. He is also accused of wounding five others there, as well as spraying a Norfolk, Va., clinic with about two dozen bullets. </P>
<P> The killings brought to five the number of murders at abortion clinics in the United States in the past two years. </P>
