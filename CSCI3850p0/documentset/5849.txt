<DATELINE>LONDON, April 19 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The killing of an unarmed London policeman has sparked renewed debate over whether British officers should routinely carry guns. </P>
<P> The 28-year-old trainee policeman received fatal gunshot wounds and a colleague was slightly hurt when they went to investigate a suspected robbery on Tuesday night. Two men were later arrested and a third is being sought. </P>
<P> Police killings in Britain are still rare -- and shocking -- and the rookie policeman's death was front-page news in virtually every national newspaper. </P>
<P> Britain's ``bobbies'' have long prided themselves on keeping the peace without resorting to guns but a steady increase in criminal violence is changing attitudes. </P>
<P> Mike Bennett, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said police should think about carrying guns. </P>
<P> ``The only protection against the gun is another gun,'' he told BBC radio. ``It is pointless having a police service equipped with body armour, long batons or personal spray and then coming up against a gun.'' </P>
<P> But John Hoddinott, president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, said most police officers did not want to carry weapons routinely. </P>
<P> ``The majority of police officers don't want to be armed,'' he told the BBC. ``What we as a society have to ensure is that people who want to take weapons on to the streets are dealt with very harshly indeed.'' </P>
<P> He and others expressed fears that armed police would be treated differently by a public which largely still sees strolling bobbies in a friendly light. </P>
<P> The Home Office (interior ministry) reported an average of 13,000 assaults a year on police in England and Wales and nine officers were killed on duty between 1989 and 1993. </P>
<P> The Police Federation has polled its 120,000 members on their feelings about carrying guns and will release the results next month. </P>
<P> Interior minister Michael Howard said earlier this year that police would be allowed to test CS gas sprays for defensive use. </P>
<P> Last June the goverment also approved a new U.S.-style side-handled baton, said to be better at defending officers from assault than the traditional truncheon. </P>
<P> British police have flocked to take advantage of an offer of used body armour from their U.S. counterparts who, feeling sorry for what they saw as their vulnerable counterparts, donated bullet-proof vests and other equipment. </P>
<P> There were also calls on Wednesday for a return to the death penalty, abolished in 1969. </P>
<P> ``What happened last night convinces me that police need the ultimate deterrent of the death penalty,'' said John Greenway, a Conservative Party member of Parliament and former policeman. </P>
<P> ``Otherwise there is nothing to stop people using guns in order to resist arrest.'' </P>
