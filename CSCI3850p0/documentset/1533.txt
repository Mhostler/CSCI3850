<P>  Former President Jimmy Carter on Wednesday called for discussions between the United States and Cuba to start the communist nation down the road to democratic reform. </P>
<P> Speaking to about 3,500 college students at Emory University, Carter said he hopes for a change in U.S. government policy toward Cuba. </P>
<P> ``It's time for us to begin discussions on how we can alleviate this crisis, which has caused tremendous suffering among the people of Cuba and has distorted this hemisphere's concept of freedom and democracy,'' said Carter, who during his presidency had lifted restrictions on U.S. travel to Cuba. </P>
<P> ``I hope that we can work out with Castro or his successor a step-by-step process through which we can lift the punitive embargo.'' </P>
<P> Carter has been seen as a kind of free-lance diplomat in recent years, having negotiated crises between North and South Korea and most recently a standoff between the U.S. military and Haitian military leaders. </P>
<P> The former president said he has spoken with Cuban leader Fidel Castro in recent weeks about ways to resolve the refugee crisis. </P>
<P> He told his audience that negotiations should turn now toward the eventual opening of Cuban society, democratic reform, market systems, and respect for human rights. ``I don't think that's an impossibility,'' Carter said. </P>
<P> ``But it is impossible if no one will talk to the only man on Earth that can make a decision about these things in Cuba.'' </P>
