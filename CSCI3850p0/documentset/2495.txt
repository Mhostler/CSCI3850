<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Democratic Governor Mario Cuomo, a liberal icon once considered a possible presidential candidate, was narrowly beaten in Tuesday's election by Republican challenger George Pataki. </P>
<P> With 82 percent of the ballots counted, Pataki had 48 percent of the vote to Cuomo's 46 percent. Pataki, a New York state senator, was unknown nationally until his bitter expensive campaign against three-term Cuomo. </P>
<P> The race was so close that it was almost midnight before Cuomo made his concession speech to a glum, tearful crowd that lamented the end of an era. Among them was Republican Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who went against his own party to support the governor. The move has raised questions about Giuliani's own political future. </P>
<P> ``It was a close race and a complicated one,'' Cuomo told supporters. ``It was indeed a long and tough struggle. George Pataki is the next governor of New York.'' </P>
<P> While Cuomo thanked President Clinton and former New York City mayors for their help, his warmest remarks were saved for Giuliani -- comments that drew a roar from the crowd. </P>
<P> ``Through his dramatic endorsement, through an act of courage and independence so rare in politics, the mayor struck a spark that could rekindle the spirit of efficient democracy in this state and reminded us that on all the most important questions facing us as a people, partisanship for its own sake is a waste of time,'' Cuomo said. </P>
<P> He apologized to supporters for letting them down and told them they deserved another four years. He urged New Yorkers to work together. </P>
<P> ``E.B. White told us remember New York is to the nation what the church spire is to the village, the symbol of aspiration and faith. The white plume saying the way is up not down, not backward ... excelsior, let's keep going up.'' </P>
<P> At the end of the speech he and Giuliani hugged each other in an emotional embrace. </P>
<P> Cuomo, who decided against a run for president in 1992 and turned down the opportunity for a U.S. Supreme Court nomination by President Clinton earlier this year, fought back in the polls toward the end of the campaign, but on Election Day it wasn't enough. </P>
<P> Pataki focused his campaign largely on the perception that Cuomo had raised taxes and overspent and generally not lived up to expectations during 12 years in office. </P>
<P> The three candidates together spent $31 million on the campaign, one of the closest and most negative in New York state history. </P>
<P> It was also marked by divisions within the Republican camp, including the Oct. 24 endorsement of Cuomo by Giuliani, who portrayed Pataki as a puppet of conservative Republican Senator Alfonse D'Amato. </P>
<P> ``We have to work together,'' D'Amato said after news broke of Pataki's election. ``Let's get taxes and spending down. It's a great victory for the people.'' </P>
