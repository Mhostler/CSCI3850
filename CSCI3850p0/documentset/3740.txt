<P>  Elie Wiesel, the Auschwitz survivor who won a Nobel Peace Prize for focusing world attention on the horrors of the Holocaust, might not attend Poland's official ceremony marking the 50th anniversary of the death camp's liberation, friends said Thursday. </P>
<P> His office said no decision on whether he would attend the Jan. 27 ceremony has yet been made because he received his invitation very late and had already made other commitments. </P>
<P> But sources close to Wiesel said he was waiting to see an official program of the event before deciding whether to attend. </P>
<P> They said he has turned down a request by Polish President Lech Walesa to write a declaration on tolerance for the ceremony saying he would need more than the three weeks' notice he received to do so. </P>
<P> Meanwhile, the World Jewish Congress said it would send representatives to a Jewish memorial at the death camp on Jan. 26 but had not made a decision on whether to attend the official ceremonies the next day. </P>
<P> ``We are waiting to see the program before deciding. In a matter of such gravity it would only be appropriate and dignified to have a full schedule before us,'' Elan Steinberg, the group's executive director, said. </P>
<P> He said the Jewish memorial was not designed as a substitute for the Polish ceremony. </P>
<P> Jewish groups in the United States have said that the Poles appeared to put together their official program in haste and no one knew how the tragedy was going to be treated, including whether Jews will be able to end the ceremony with the Kaddish, the Jewish prayer for the dead. </P>
<P> With estimates that more than one million Jews were murdered at Auschwitz by the Nazis, Auschwitz has been called the world's largest Jewish cemetery. </P>
