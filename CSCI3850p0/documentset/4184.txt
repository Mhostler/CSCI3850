<P>  A British inquiry has concluded that Margaret Thatcher was unaware of illegal exports of defense-related equipment to Iraq when she was prime minister during the late 1980s, newspapers said Tuesday. </P>
<P> A final report in Britain's politically sensitive ``arms-for-Iraq'' probe, chaired by Lord Justice Richard Scott, has still to be made public. </P>
<P> Draft excerpts from the Scott inquiry showed there was no evidence to substantiate allegations that decisions on the approval of exports in 1987-8 were brought to Thatcher's attention, the Financial Times and Daily Telegraph said. </P>
<P> A spokeswoman for the inquiry declined to comment on the reports. Its findings are due to be published around April. </P>
<P> Set up by Thatcher's successor John Major in November 1992, the inquiry has looked into allegations the government broke its own rules barring arms sales to Iraq before the 1991 Gulf War. </P>
<P> British troops formed part of the multinational force which ejected Iraq from Kuwait in 1991. </P>
<P> The inquiry is also investigating whether the government tried to stop the policy coming to light in a court case, preferring to allow the defendants to go to jail than have official duplicity exposed. </P>
<P> Alan Barrett, who heads a Ministry of Defense working group on arms sales to Iraq and Iran, told the inquiry that Thatcher had approved the export of 50 Matrix Churchill lathes to Baghdad to protect an intelligence source. </P>
<P> But neither Barrett nor any government department was able to provide Scott with documents supporting the allegation, the Financial Times said. </P>
<P> ``I cannot recall if and when the prime minister was told about the Matrix exports -- I can only assume now that I was mistaken,'' the paper quoted Barrett as saying in the report. </P>
<P> But the newspapers added this was only a partial extract of the inquiry's findings and may not totally exonerate Thatcher of the blame which is expected to be shared among government ministers and civil servants. </P>
<P> Thatcher told the inquiry in December 1993 that she was unaware of the illegal exports. She was never told of a secret relaxation in government guidelines covering British arms sales to Iraq in the months before the Gulf War, she added. </P>
<P> Witness have claimed in court that the government knew the Matrix Churchill engineering company, which collapsed in 1992, was selling machine tools to Iraqi arms factories before the Gulf War in breach of an official arms embargo. </P>
