<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A judge Thursday accused the judge hearing the celebrated O.J. Simpson trial of impeding a Manhattan murder case by ordering a defense lawyer to appear in Los Angeles. </P>
<P> Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Harold Rothwax said California Judge Lance Ito and lawyers for Simpson, who is accused of murdering his ex-wife and a friend, were putting the interest of the former football star before those of New York State. </P>
<P> The issue began Monday when Rothwax threatened to jail attorney Peter Neufeld for contempt if he did not appear in his court Thursday to begin defending a man accused of killing a New York City policeman. </P>
<P> But on Wednesday Ito ordered Neufeld, a DNA expert for Simpson, to appear in his court by Dec. 12, when hearings on the admissibility of DNA evidence are scheduled to begin, or face contempt charges. </P>
<P> At a hearing in the New York trial attended by Neufeld Thursday, Rothwax said Ito ``was trying to impede his case'' which he said took precedence over the Simpson trial. </P>
<P> ``It's inexplicable to me why Judge Ito would issue an order since I've already given an order that precedes Judge Ito's order and my order has priority,'' Rothwax said. </P>
<P> Rothwax has refused to excuse Neufeld or allow another lawyer three weeks to take over the case, which has already been postponed twice because of delays in the Simpson trial. </P>
<P> Civil rights lawyer William Kunstler, who represents Neufeld and the Simpson defense, said he would try to have Rothwax's decision reversed in Federal and state court Friday. </P>
