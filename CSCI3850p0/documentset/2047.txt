<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Indonesia is looking increasingly to Europe -- and away from the United States -- for weapons, including submarines, aircraft and light tanks, foreign military sources say. </P>
<P> The shift from Washington, a major supplier during the Cold War, follows moves by the U.S. Congress to link arms sales and training with human rights in troubled East Timor, which Jakarta invaded in 1975 and annexed in 1976. </P>
<P> Indonesia has said it will not accept any conditions for future sales from the United States. </P>
<P> The sources Saturday said Indonesia had shown greater interest in the past year in buying from Europe -- including Britain, France, Germany and The Netherlands -- not only to expand existing arsenals, but to replace aging equipment, some of it up to 40 years old. </P>
<P> ``We need to replace old equipment with new or second-hand equipment for our forces. This is partly because of the size of our country,'' a senior Indonesian military source told Reuters. </P>
<P> Indonesia is an equatorial archipelago of some 14,000 islands stretching over 3,150 miles from west of Malaysia to a line south of Japan -- roughly the distance between New York and San Francisco. </P>
<P> Its priorities are fully equipping a quick-reaction force of 3,000 to 5,000 men for internal use, and a planned standby U.N. peacekeeping battalion of 800 men, the sources said. </P>
<P> The army also wants to put on a show of modern military might next August to mark Indonesia's 50th anniversary of independence. </P>
<P> ``It wants to show the nation its money is being well spent and that the people will be safeguarded with modern equipment,'' one foreign military attache said. </P>
<P> Indonesia's estimated 185 million people makes it the world's fourth most populous country after China, India and the United States. More than 100 million people live on its main Java island. </P>
<P> ``The military's logistic system has had weaknesses. They included a poor capital equipment program, poor stock management and a lack of preventative maintenance,'' he added. </P>
<P> Some artilley supplied by the former Soviet Union is now unserviceable. Indonesia has Soviet 122mm howitzers, 82mm- and 107mm anti-armor guns and amphibious reconnaissance vehicles. </P>
<P> The sources said the military was also emphasising training for a force with a controversial security and socio-politicial role in Indonesia. </P>
<P> ``Combat capability had been hampered by weaknesses in junior commanders, a lack of collective training and poor individual military skills among some soldiers,'' another source said. </P>
<P> Britain and Australia, Indonesia's southern neighbor, are believed to be offering more training to fill some gaps left by the move away from the United States for the 212,000-strong army, 43,000-member navy and air force with 27,000 personnel. </P>
<P> Britain's chief of defense staff, Field Marshal Peter Inge, said in Jakarta last week his country hoped to sell Scorpion light tanks and more Hawk jets to Indonesia. </P>
<P> Indonesia's military commander General Feisal Tanjung, asked if such purchases were likely, told reporters: ``The possibility is always there. ... It all depends on the state budget.'' </P>
<P> Defense spending in 1994-95 is equivalent to about $550 million, roughly the previous year's level in nominal terms. </P>
<P> Foreign military sources said Indonesia might want up to 100 Scorpions, including some next year at around $750,000 each, and had requested British Aerospace to deliver the first 24 Hawks in 1995 instead of 1996. </P>
<P> The Hawk order, comprising eight 100-Series, two-seat trainers and 16 200-Series single-seat fighters, was for $760 million. Indonesia's air force was told this year it could proceed with talks for more Hawks. </P>
<P> France is likely to be in the race to sell Jakarta light tanks and other equipment. Indonesia already has 201 French AMX-13 light tanks with 105mm guns, and about 74 AMX-13s with 75mm guns. </P>
<P> Indonesia has shown interest in other jets, including L-39s produced by the former Czechoslovakia. </P>
<P> The sources said Indonesia, now taking delivery from Germany of 39 aging warships that belonged to the former East Germany, is weighing possible purchase of additional submarines from either Germany or The Netherlands. </P>
