<P>  A former wartime U.S. Naval chief is to meet the Vietnam general who led his communist country to victory in the Vietnam war, officials said Saturday. </P>
<P> Retired U.S. Admiral Elmo Zumwalt, visiting Vietnam next month for the first time since the war, will also pay a courtesy call on state President Le Duc Anh, said the trip organizer, Ca Van Tran. </P>
<P> Tran said Zumwalt, who ordered the Agent Orange defoliant to be used during the war that ended in 1975, will meet General Vo Nguyen Giap and Anh in Hanoi. </P>
<P> Giap was North Vietnam's armed forces commander during the war. Anh was in charge of an army district in the far south in 1969, when Zumwalt commanded U.S. naval forces in Vietnam. </P>
<P> Zumwalt, to visit Vietnam from September 9 to 16, is a guest of a government committee researching the effects of defoliants that were sprayed by U.S. forces during the war. </P>
<P> The retired general had ordered herbicides, such as Agent Orange, to be sprayed in the countryside to destroy communist guerrilla cover. </P>
<P> Zumwalt, 73, is now a campaigner on behalf of victims of the chemicals that can cause cancer, birth defects and other ailments. </P>
<P> His son, a navy lieutenant in command of a boat that sprayed chemicals, died in 1988 of cancer believed caused by the defoliants. </P>
