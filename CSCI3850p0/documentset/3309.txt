<P>  Massive power cuts, believed caused by sabotage, have blacked out parts of the Algerian capital where a central food store was blown up and burnt in an attack by 40 armed men, media and diplomatic sources said Sunday. </P>
<P> Algerian state radio Sunday quoted the Algerian electricity company as saying power cuts in Algiers and the neighboring region of Blida that started last Wednesday night would last a further three to four days. </P>
<P> Blida town, which is both the headquarters of the country's main military region covering the capital and renowned as a Muslim fundamentalist area, is 30 miles south of Algiers. </P>
<P> Cuts were being rotated between areas and life remained normal, the radio said. </P>
<P> It did not explain what it described as a ``dangerous incident'' but two Algerian newspapers said Muslim guerrillas had blown up power pylons supplying the capital. </P>
<P> The main oil and gas export facilities, which are located elsewhere and on which Algeria relies for more than 90 percent of its foreign currency, were not affected. </P>
<P> Algerian television reported overnight that a big food warehouse supplying Algiers, Boumerdes to the east and Tipasa to the west was destroyed by armed men who planted bombs and set it ablaze. </P>
<P> The burning of the warehouse, it said, simply meant starving the Algerian people. An estimated three million people are believed to live in the overcrowded city. </P>
