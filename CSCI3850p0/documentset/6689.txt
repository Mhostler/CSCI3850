<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Italian missionaries appealed Friday for food and other supplies for thousands of displaced people they said faced death in the forests of southern Sudan. </P>
<P> Monsignor Caesar Mazzolari said since January thousands of people displaced to the Sudanese capital of Khartoum had applied to return to their places of origin in the war-ravaged south of the northeast African nation. </P>
<P> They were transported, with the help of aid agencies, to the government-held town of Wau but fled into thick forests in Bahr al-Ghazal province as they could not afford to buy food in Wau. </P>
<P> Mazzolari, visiting Nairobi, said a 2.2 lbs of sorghum was selling in Wau for $350. </P>
<P> ``Fear makes them cross the Bussera river and run away into the anonymity and oblivion of the forest. There the returnees find neither food nor shelter. Out of hunger they are resorting to eating any wild growth or non-poisonous roots,'' he said. </P>
<P> Mazzolari, of the Comboni missionaries, told Reuters he saw some 1,800 returnees in two counties in Bahr al-Ghazal last week and they were short of food and had no shelter from torrential rain. </P>
<P> ``This wave must be stopped now or it will turn the south into a burial ground,'' he said, adding the transfer from Khartoum was not organized by the government but was permitted. </P>
<P> ``Both sides are trying to manipulate these people in the south for the purposes of war -- the government and the rebels,'' said Mazzolari, apostolic administrator in Rumbek in the south. </P>
<P> Rebels in the mainly Christian and animist south have fought since 1983 against rule by the Muslim, Arabized north. The war has forced nearly three million people to leave their homes. </P>
