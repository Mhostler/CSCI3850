<P>  Former vice president Dan Quayle was released from a hospital Tuesday after treatment for blood clots in his lungs, saying the illness will not deter his expected bid for the presidency. </P>
<P> ``I feel good. It will have no impact (on a possible presidential bid) at all,'' the 47-year-old Republican told a news conference. </P>
<P> ``I have a political calendar as I have announced in the past, and will make a decision sometime after the first of the year. And I will stick to that calendar,'' he said. </P>
<P> Quayle said he was feeling much better than he was when he was admitted to the hospital a week ago Monday, complaining of a progressive shortness of breath. </P>
<P> ``I will have a full recovery. It's going to take a little time,'' said Quayle. ``All the physicians and all the analysis indicate it will be a full and complete recovery.'' </P>
<P> Doctors treated him with blood thinners and said he will have to avoid air travel -- where cramped quarters may have led to formation of the clots -- for about a month. </P>
<P> Doctors at Indiana University Medical Center first found a blood clot in one lung and then several clots in both lungs. </P>
<P> ``I will be able to resume a normal, active life in approximately four weeks,'' he said. ``That will include some physical training, jogging, things like that.'' </P>
<P> The former Indiana senator had been expected to announce in a few weeks the formation of a committee to explore a bid for the 1996 Republican presidential nomination. </P>
<P> Quayle said his experience in the hospital proved to him the importance of quality health care. </P>
<P> ``I will re-enter the health care debate by saying ... let us never compromise on quality,'' he said. </P>
<P> The former vice president said it was ``shocking'' to the Washington establishment that the newly elected Republican majority in Congress ``are going to do what they said they were going to do.'' </P>
<P> ``I find it rather refreshing and I think the American people do too,'' he said. </P>
