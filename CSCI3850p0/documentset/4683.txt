<P>  Finland's four-time Olympic champion Lasse Viren, now 45, is back in serious training and considering running the marathon at this year's world championships in Gothenburg. </P>
<P> The Finnish newspaper Iltalehti reported Thursday that Viren, who won the 5,000 and 10,000 meters double at both the 1972 and 1976 Olympic Games, had been training for a marathon in Osaka which had been canceled because of the Japanese earthquake. </P>
<P> Viren, who is seeking a seat in Finland's parliament in this month's general elections, was quoted by the newspaper as telling a candidates' sports panel he could be interested in a marathon in Paris next month. </P>
<P> ``I was asked on the sports panel what distance I could next be interested in and I answered there was the one in Paris that I could fancy,'' the paper quoted Viren as saying. </P>
<P> ``In the same connection I threw in the idea of the marathon at the world championships though I'm not at all sure.'' </P>
<P> Viren's victory in the 1976 Montreal Olympics 10,000 meters was clouded when he was subjected to intensive questioning from reporters about blood doping, the practice of injecting the runner's own blood in to his body shortly before a race to boost his performance. </P>
<P> He has consistently denied any involvement in blood boosting. </P>
