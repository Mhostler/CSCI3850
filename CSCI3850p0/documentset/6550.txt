<DATELINE>KHARG ISLAND, Iran, May 15 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Iran, hit by a U.S. trade ban and a currency crisis, is hoping to exploit offshore fields in the Gulf to ensure it remains the world's second largest oil exporter. </P>
<P> The National Iranian Oil Co (NIOC) Offshore aims to raise capacity at Iran's offshore fields to 600,000 barrels per day (bpd) by March 1996 and to one million bpd by the year 2000, Abdulghasem Hassani, deputy director of operations, told reporters on Sunday. </P>
<P> Oil exports are a key foreign exchange earner for Tehran, facing a U.S. trade embargo from next month which has already caused a run on Irans rapidly depreciating rial currency. </P>
<P> NIOC says offshore fields can be developed despite the sanctions by the United States and Irans limited access to foreign exchange. </P>
<P> ``Sanctions don't bother us. We're used to it for 15 years,'' Hassani told Reuters. </P>
<P> Offshore oil production currently stands at 460,000 bpd, mostly from four fields around Kharg Island and the Salman platform off the more southerly Lavan Island. </P>
<P> Around 90 percent of Iran's total oil output comes from giant onshore fields in the south west of the country, but these fields have already past their peak output rates. </P>
<P> The plan to boost offshore production was disclosed as Iran raised total output by 500,000 bpd to 4.1 million bpd to show touring Western reporters it could sustain an output level which was well above its current OPEC quota of 3.6 million bpd. </P>
<P> NIOC said the move up to 600,000 bpd for offshore production would be accomplished by additional well drilling. One million bpd would be achieved by enlisting the financial resources and technical knowhow of foreign firms. </P>
<P> Iranian officials said French oil group Total SA (TOTF. PA) and Anglo-Dutch giant Royal Dutch/Shell (RD.AS)(SHEL.LL)are leading contenders to secure offshore development contracts now that U.S. oil companies are excluded due to the trade ban. </P>
<P> Tehran has been in talks with foreign firms to develop offshore fields for the past four years but nothing has come of these negotiations because of disagreements over the returns demanded by foreign firms. </P>
<P> One deal which came close to fruition was that negotiated by U.S. company Conoco Inc, a unit of DuPont Co (DD.N), involving the Sirri A and E fields with a potential of 180,000 bpd. </P>
<P> But President Clinton blocked the deal shortly ahead of announcing a general ban on all U.S. trade with Iran as a punishment for Tehrans alleged drive to acquire nuclear weapons and its sponsorship of what Washington calls ``terrorism.'' </P>
<P> Another hurdle for foreign oil companies has been NIOCs insistence that 30 percent of all awarded contract work be carried out by local Iranian firms. </P>
<P> Hassani said this requirement had forced a consortium led by ETPM-McDermott East Inc, a joint venture between U.S. company J.RRay McDermott SA (JRM. N)and a unit of France's GTM Entrepose SA (GTME.PA), to pull out of a deal to expand capacity at the 75,000 bpd Abuzar offshore field. </P>
<P> NIOC engineers said they did not yet know what effect the U.S. trade ban imposed on May 8 would have on their access to spare parts for the industry. </P>
<P> They said Iranian manufacturing firms were increasingly meeting the industrys supply requirements. </P>
