<P>  Three Westerners taken hostage in southern Cambodia in July have been killed by their Khmer Rouge captors, a senior army officer said Thursday. </P>
<P> ``The three corpses were taken to be buried at a place called Andong Pralit,'' Lt. Gen. Sok Bunsoeun, a deputy commander based at the 3rd Military Region, told Reuters. </P>
<P> ``We haven't found the graves yet -- we've only been told the location where they are buried.'' </P>
<P> He said local Khmer Rouge commander Noun Paet, who had been expected to cross over to the government, ``dares not defect'' now because he ordered the three foreigners killed. </P>
<P> Briton Mark Slater, 28, Frenchman Jean-Michel Braquet, 27, and Australian David Wilson, 29, were taken hostage by Khmer Rouge guerrillas during a train ambush July 26 that left 13 people killed. </P>
<P> No word had been heard about their fate since Aug. 29. </P>
<P> The general said they were killed Sept. 27 as government forces were launching a major attack against rebel-held strongholds in Vine Mountain. </P>
<P> Vine Mountain is a general term for a range of thickly wooded hills and rugged limestone outcrops about 93 miles south of Phnom Penh. </P>
<P> Paet's base in Vine Mountain was overrun by government troops Tuesday. There was no sign of the hostages. </P>
<P> Secretary of State for Information Khieu Kanharith said Thursday there had been unconfirmed reports of the executions from local people living at Paet's base. </P>
<P> ``Reports yesterday said General Paet's men were bringing the three hostages into the jungle and shortly after heard some shots. Moments later they emerged from the jungle without the three so it's assumed they were killed,'' he said. </P>
<P> Cambodian Lt. Gen. Meach May, commander of the 3rd Military Region, said he believed the three Western hostages were executed on Paet's orders. </P>
<P> ``According to a report from the front they're probably all dead -- I'm not completely sure. I've briefed the diplomats about this news,'' he said. </P>
<P> Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans told a news conference in Ulan Bator, Mongolia, that an investigation had been launched into reports of the deaths. </P>
<P> In Paris, the French Foreign Ministry said it would seek more information from Cambodian authorities through its ambassador, but said it was unable to confirm the reported killings. </P>
<P> It added in a statement: ``It seems other Cambodian and Vietnamese hostages may have been executed shortly after the foreign hostages were taken. </P>
<P> ``France solemnly condemns these ignoble and cowardly acts which affect unfortunate innocents.'' </P>
