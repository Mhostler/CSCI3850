<P>  Raunchy pop star Madonna says she wants to have three children and has found a prospective father but she's silent about his identity. </P>
<P> Madonna, in an interview broadcast on BBC television Sunday night, acknowledged she had difficulty with relationships because she always had to make the first move and men were often intimidated by her fame and riches. </P>
<P> Asked whether she really wanted children, the 36-year-old rock singer said, ``Yeah definitely. I wish all three of them were sitting on my bed right now.'' </P>
<P> But Madonna, interviewed by comedienne Ruby Wax in a room in the Ritz hotel in Paris, refused to divulge the name of the man she has in mind as their father. </P>
<P> When Wax asked her whether she had found the right man, Madonna replied, ``Yes I have... No it's not a plumber but I could see him fixing my sink.'' </P>
<P> Madonna, also famed for her book ``Sex'' and her screen role in ``Desperately Seeking Susan,'' had confided earlier that she could see herself falling in love with a plumber as long as he was totally committed and enthusiastic about his job. </P>
<P> Madonna said she regretted the breakup of many love affairs, particularly with screen heart-throb Warren Beatty. </P>
<P> She said she had really cared for and loved Beatty and described him as funny and smart. ``I definitely spent a couple of hours a day picking his brains.'' </P>
