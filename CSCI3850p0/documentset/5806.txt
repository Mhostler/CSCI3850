<DATELINE>BOSTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Cosmas Ndeti of Kenya won the 99th Boston Marathon Monday, becoming the third runner in the history of the race to win it three years in a row. </P>
<P> Ndeti, 25, who named his son ``Gideon Boston'' following his first victory here two years ago, shook off countryman Moses Tanui with two miles left and broke the tape at two hours nine minutes and 21 seconds. </P>
<P> Ndeti crossed the finish waving three fingers in the air, signifying his record-tying feat as he joined Clarence DeMar (1922-23-24) and Bill Rodgers (1978-79-80) as the only people to win the world's oldest continuously run marathon three successive years. </P>
<P> Uta Pippig of Germany also repeated as champion, winning the women's competition easily in 2:25:11. </P>
<P> As she approached the finish, looking remarkably fresh, an ebullient Pippig smiled broadly and blew kisses at the crowd lining the course. </P>
<P> Ndeti said with about four miles to go he knew he would win, and he promised to come back for a shot at four in a row at the centennial Boston Maraton. </P>
<P> ``I trusted myself and I knew that God was there and I'm going to win again,'' he said of Monday's race. ``And I think I'll come back and win next year.'' </P>
<P> Tanui, who finished 10th last year, came in second in 2:10:22 as Kenyan runners claimed four of the top five places. </P>
<P> Two-time Chicago marathon winner Luiz Antonio Dos Santos of Brazil was third, followed by Kenyans Lameck Aguta and Paul Yego. </P>
<P> Ndeti refused to divulge the secret of his Boston success. </P>
<P> ``I don't want to tell you my secret. I have my own tactical training for Boston in Kenya and I don't want to tell,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``I'll tell you when I'm like John Kelley,'' he added, referring to the honorary marshal and two-time winner who raced his 61st Boston Marathon in 1992 at the age of 84. </P>
<P> Temperatures were near perfect at 45-50 degrees, but headwinds of 10-15 miles per hour towards the end of the race kept runners from repeating last year's course record times. </P>
<P> Pippig kept pace with South Africa's Elana Meyer, who holds world bests for the 15K and the half marathon, and Kenya's Tegla Loroupe through the middle of the race. </P>
<P> She broke away from Meyer and Loroupe for a short time at the 20-mile mark when they ran past their water bottles at the bottom of ``Heartbreak Hill'' and had to go back. </P>
<P> Pippig pushed the pace up ``Heartbreak Hill'' and knew at the 22.5 mile point that another victory was at hand. ``Elena was getting tired...and I felt very good at this point. I just pushed the pace,'' she said. </P>
<P> Meyer, who stopped briefly to massage a cramp in her right thigh, held on to finish second in 2:26:51 and Madina Biktagirova of Belarus, who was second in last year's New York Marathon, finished third in 2:29:00. </P>
<P> Before the race Pippig said she was going for Ingrid Kristiansen's world record, but the winds and a bout of sore feet kept her from her goal. </P>
<P> ``The only thing I can do is come back next year and try again.'' </P>
