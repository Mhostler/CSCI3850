<P>  The Consumer Product Safety Commission and seven playground equipment makers Thursday joined forces to get potentially dangerous heavy metal and molded plastic ''animal'' swings removed from playgrounds. </P>
<P> The swings, painted to look like horses, zebras, pelicans, ducks, turtles, seals, rockets and other figures, were involved in the 1985 death of a 2-year-old child in California and the 1994 death of a 6-year-old in Pennsylvania. </P>
<P> Both children were struck on the head as they walked near the swings, the commission said. </P>
<P> CPSC also said it had received reports of 42 children who suffered head injuries after being struck by these 30-pound to 80-pound swings, about 10,000 of which were installed on playgrounds throughout the country from 1951 to 1991. </P>
<P> The injuries included skull fractures, concussion and brain damage, serious lacerations and contusions, and one child who lost sight in an eye. </P>
<P> The commission said it was unclear how many of the swings were still in use, but seven of the swings' original manufacturers would now offer incentive plans to parks, schools and daycare centers to replace them. </P>
<P> The companies are BCI Burke of Fond du Lac, Wisc.; Blue Valley Industries of Mexico, Penn.; Game Time of Fort Payne, Ala.; Miracle Recreation Equipment Co of Monett, Mo.; PCA of St. Louis, Mo.; Playworld Systems of New Berlin, Penn.; and Quality Industries of Hillsdale, Mich.  Some of the swings were manufactured by a number of companies that are no longer in business, the CPSC said. </P>
<P> It urged consumers who knew of playgrounds with these animal swings to call their local school boards or park offices or the companies for immediate removal of the swings. </P>
