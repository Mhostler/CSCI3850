<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Martin Marietta Corp's chairman will receive about $8.2 million in cash and stock options from payouts spurred by the company's planned merger with Lockheed Corp., the Wall Street Journal reported Friday. </P>
<P> In December, Martin Marietta originally said chairman Norman Augustine would get about $5 million in payouts from incentive plans, the paper said. </P>
<P> In a proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Martin Marietta's top five executives, including Augustine, will split about $19.6 million, the paper said. </P>
<P> About 460 Martin Marietta managers will get about $82.4 million in various plans covering incentive pay, stock options, restricted stock, deferred compensation and other benefits, the paper said. </P>
<P> The Journal also reported that Martin Marietta and Lockheed agreed to pay shareholders an additional $31 million in the form of higher than anticipated dividends for several quarters after the merger to settle lawsuits challenging the deal. </P>
<P> Lockheed and Martin Marietta estimated that the costs connected with the merger will total about $850 million, including severance, relocation and elimination of duplicate facilities, the paper reported. </P>
<P> Much of the consolidation costs will be billed to the government, assuming that the companies can show a savings for the government in costs and services. </P>
<P> According the the filing, Lockheed chairman Daniel Tellep will receive about $770,000 in value from the acceleration of stock options and from a performance plan payout, the paper said. Lockheed's top five managers will get a total of $2.8 million, the paper said. </P>
<P> All of Lockheed's managers affected by the plan will get $5.9 million overall in payouts, the paper said. </P>
