<DATELINE>BONN, Germany (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU) face a heated debate at a party congress Monday over a proposed quota that would give one-third of posts to women politicians. </P>
<P> CDU general-secretary Peter Hintze, who has championed the quota, said Sunday he was confident the proposal to reserve one-third of all party jobs and elected offices for women would be approved by the one-day congress in Bonn. </P>
<P> Local CDU leaders attacked the idea, but Hintze told the newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung that the party ``simply needs a binding structure.'' </P>
<P> Kohl, who is due to be re-elected national CDU chairman Monday, has given the proposal his backing in an effort to regain lost support among women voters, especially young women. </P>
<P> Kohl's conservatives have long been hostile to the quotas that leftist opposition parties like the Social Democrats and Greens have for women. </P>
<P> Kohl's re-election as chairman is certain, but one open issue that will likely be discussed on the sidelines is the question of his successor. </P>
<P> Kohl, 64, surprised his own party by announcing shortly before the Oct. 16 German elections that he would not stand again as chancellor in the next election in 1998. </P>
<P> CDU deputy chairman Heinz Eggert Sunday criticized Kohl's statement, which many in the party have said will leave him a lame duck. </P>
<P> ``I believe Kohl's announcement was his first word on the matter but not his last word ... Maybe we will have to ask Kohl to stay in office two years longer (than 1998),'' the Saxony state interior minister Eggert told the newspaper Bild am Sonntag. </P>
