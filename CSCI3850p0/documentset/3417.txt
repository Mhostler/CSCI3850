<DATELINE>BETHLEHEM, West Bank (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Thousands of pilgrims streamed into the town of Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank Saturday to celebrate Christmas Eve in the site of Jesus' birth. </P>
<P> The celebrations reflected changes brought about by Middle East peace talks, as tourists from Jordan -- which ended a 46-year formal state of war with Israel with an October peace treaty -- strode under once-outlawed Palestinian flags and pictures of PLO leader Yasser Arafat. </P>
<P> Residents said the atmosphere in Bethlehem's Manger Square was the most festive since the Palestinian uprising plunged the town's Christmas celebrations into gloom for years in 1987. </P>
<P> A crowd estimated at more than 10,000 thronged the town, a sharp increase from past years. Marching bands played Christmas carols as green and red fireworks lit the cold, clear night sky, illuminating the skyline of church spires and Yule decorations. </P>
<P> But the hundreds of Israeli soldiers armed with assault rifles watching from rooftops and streetcorners cast a sobering note for many Palestinians. </P>
<P> Under the 1993 Israeli-PLO peace deal the army was to have pulled out of Palestinian centers in the West Bank by last July. </P>
<P> The withdrawal, which was to have set the stage for Palestinian elections in the next main phase of the accord, has been delayed by Israeli security concerns amid a surge of attacks by Muslim guerrillas opposed to the peace deal. </P>
<P> Israeli officials said last week Bethlehem would be the one of the first towns handed over to the Palestine Liberation Organization if a phased withdrawal plan is agreed. </P>
