<P>  Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati proposed Monday the creation of a forum with the participation of the Gulf countries to develop confidence-building measures for the region. </P>
<P> ``Maintaining security in the Persian Gulf is the responsibility of the countries surrounding the strategic waterway,'' he said in a speech to the General Assembly. </P>
<P> ``We propose here the creation of a forum with the participation of the Persian Gulf countries to review and develop confidence-building measuires compatible with the requirements of the region.'' </P>
<P> Foreign governments, which Velayati said had often been the source of instability and insecurity in the region, should support regional initiatives for cooperation ``and refrain from sowing discord and tension and other divisive policies to which they have historically resorted in order to preserve their interests and justify their presence.'' </P>
<P> He sharply criticized what he called the transformation of the Security Council into an instrument for the justification or enforcement of the policies of a number of its permanent members. </P>
<P> Manipulation by some of these members, whom he did not identify, prevented the council from discharging its primary responsibility in accordance with the U.N. Charter. </P>
<P> ``The most vivid illustration has been the silence and failure of the Security Council to adopt resolute measures in the face of repeated acts of aggression committed by Israel against the people of Palestine, Lebanon and Syria,'' Velayati said. </P>
<P> The council's ``unprincipled approach'' was also demonstrated by what he called its ``questionable handling of the aggression against the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.'' </P>
<P> The council had not only failed to implement its own resolutions but had ``empowered the aggressors to continue their atrocities and deprived a member state of the United Nations'' of the inherent right of self-defense by opposing the call of the international community to lift the arms embargo against Bosnia-Herzegovina. </P>
