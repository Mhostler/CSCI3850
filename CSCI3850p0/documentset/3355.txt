<DATELINE>COVENTRY, England (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Five crew members died when a Boeing 737-200 cargo plane crashed Wednesday in central England, clipping roofs in a populated area before plowing into woods and bursting into flames, police said. </P>
<P> ``This could have been a major catastrophe,'' said Brian Cook of the West Midlands Fire Brigade. ``A few hundred meters was the difference between it hitting a residential estate which could have had devastating results.'' </P>
<P> The plane had two crew and three cargo handlers on board. It was trying to land at Coventry airport after returning from Amsterdam but crashed about two miles short in the Willenhall area of Coventry. </P>
<P> Air Algerie had leased the plane to Phoenix Aviation which recently began a service delivering live calves to the continent from Coventry airport. It carried no cargo at the time of the crash. </P>
<P> ``All five crew members are dead. There are no civilian casualties,'' a police spokesman said at the crash scene. </P>
<P> The crash occurred on the sixth anniversary of the Lockerbie disaster which claimed the lives of 270 people after a Pan-Am jumbo jet crashed into the Scottish town after blowing up in mid-air. </P>
<P> Eyewitnesses said the cargo plane Wednesday seemed to lose power on its approach to the airport. It hit houses and destroyed an electrical power line before crashing, police said. </P>
<P> ``I just saw the plane coming toward us and then it clipped two houses. It landed in woodland near the houses and exploded into a ball of flames,'' eyewitness Maureen Hawkes said. </P>
<P> ``I realized something was wrong when I heard an almighty bang, that was when it hit the houses. There was another bang and I knew there was no way it was going to make the airport.'' </P>
<P> Police and witnesses said explosions continued for more than an hour after the crash in Willenhall, on the outskirts of Coventry, an industrial town. </P>
<P> Witnesses said a 200-foot plume of smoke could be seen above the site of the crash, a wooded expanse popular as a play area with children. </P>
<P> A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman said three people were being treated for serious shock. </P>
<P> The crash blacked out nearby houses and some services at the airport. </P>
<P> Residents said they had often complained about planes flying close overhead. The cattle trade had also been the subject of demonstrations by animal rights activists. </P>
