<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The new GOP House leaders plan to eliminate funding for the Congressional Black Caucus, which would still be able to meet but would not have any staff, Newsweek reported. </P>
<P> No black Democratic incumbents lost their seats in the mid-term elections, but the magazine reported in the issue available Monday that blacks will chair no committees and have virtually no influence with the new House leadership. </P>
<P> Newsweek gave no details on the source for its information on the elimination of funding for the black caucus. </P>
<P> One of two black House Republicans, J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, told the weekly he was ``not sure'' whether or not he will join the black caucus. Newsweek said likely House Speaker Newt Gingrich plans to give Watts a visible public-speaking role. </P>
