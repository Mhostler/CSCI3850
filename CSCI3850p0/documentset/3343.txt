<P>  Louisiana Congressman Billy Tauzin, who has been publicly mulling a switch to the Republicans, said Tuesday he will give the Democratic Party another chance. </P>
<P> Tauzin, a seven-term representative whose district covers the state's southwest corner, said he will remain a Democrat for at least one more year to see how the party's leadership deals with conservative members. If he switches affiliation before the next election, it would increase to 15 the number of seats Democrats would have to capture to regain even a slim majority in the House. </P>
<P> Tauzin said the Democratic Party has treated conservative collegues shabbily. Conservative Democrats have had to ask Republicans for time to talk on the House floor because their own party leadership does not like their views, he said. </P>
<P> In a conciliatory move last week, the Democratic Party's Rules Committee decided it would no longer used a scorecard of how often a person votes along party lines to determine committee assignments, a policy that penalized Tauzin and other conservatives. </P>
