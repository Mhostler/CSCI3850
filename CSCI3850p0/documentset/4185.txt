<P>  Oscar-winning British actress Julie Christie is making a comeback and will swap her reclusive lifestyle for a stint on the stage, a theater company said Tuesday. </P>
<P> Christie is to star in the Theater Clwyd production of Harold Pinter's ``Old Times,'' scheduled to run in northern Wales from May 13 to June 10. </P>
<P> ``I don't know if I am looking forward to the part because theater is such an unknown territory to me,'' the actress said. </P>
<P> Christie, 54, who achieved fame in the 1960s for her performances in films like ``Dr. Zhivago'' and ``Far From The Madding Crowd,'' won an Academy Award for best actress in 1965 for her role in ``Darling.'' </P>
<P> She lives in a remote Wales farmhouse and made only occasional film appearances in the 1980s. She spends most of her time campaigning on issues like nuclear waste, animal cruelty and Palestinian rights. </P>
<P> Her last film role was in 1991 when she made ``The Railway Station Man'' in Ireland with Donald Sutherland. </P>
