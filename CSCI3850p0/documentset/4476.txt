<P>  Israel's deputy foreign minister, taking a new line on Syria, questioned Wednesday the validity of its stated commitment to the pursuit of peace. </P>
<P> Yossi Beilin said Israel had accepted in recent years that Syria had made a strategic decision to achieve peace and the only question was when a deal would be signed. </P>
<P> ``I have some doubts about accepting this because Syria's behavior in the last few months has not been that of someone who decided unequivocally to pursue peace and is prepared to do his utmost to achieve it,'' he told Israel Radio. </P>
<P> Syria's peace talks with Israel are stalled over the extent of an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, captured by Israel in 1967, and the shape of peace and future ties. </P>
<P> ``The current negotiations, or absence of them, is leading to a situation whereby we will not reach peace with the Syrians in 1995 because things are moving at a snail's pace,'' said Beilin, who is close to Foreign Minister Shimon Peres. </P>
<P> Beilin's mention of the date was a clear reminder to Syria that time is running out before Israel goes to elections in 1996. The Labor government's main rival, the right-wing Likud, opposes any territorial compromise on the Golan Heights. </P>
<P> Israel, while blaming Syria for the current deadlock in peace efforts, had in the past pointed to repeated Syrian statements that comprehensive peace in the Middle East was a strategic option as proof of a commitment to the process. </P>
<P> ``They are still playing the game of whether the Syrian ambassador in Washington will or won't come to talks with our ambassador,'' Beilin said. ``If that is the case, it is very possible there are other items at the top of the Syrian agenda.'' </P>
<P> Syria has said further ambassadorial-level meetings would be useful only if Israel presented new ideas. </P>
<P> Beilin said it was possible Syria had only wanted to join the peace process to improve relations with Washington, which still officially regards it as a state that sponsors terrorism, ``without having really intended to reach an agreement with us.'' </P>
<P> He questioned whether Syria was prepared to pay the price of peace, which he described as a change in its position as the leader of Arab confrontation states against Israel and a possible worsening of its relations with Iran. </P>
<P> Monday the Syrian government daily Tishreen said recent Israeli attacks against guerrillas in south Lebanon were destroying the chances of peace in the Middle East. </P>
