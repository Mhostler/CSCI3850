<DATELINE>BORDEAUX, France (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  France Tuesday sought to win allies in its fight for Europe's television future after wooing European culture ministers with haute cuisine and vintage wines. </P>
<P> European Union ministers started a meeting Tuesday morning discussing a French demand for tougher limits on the amount of foreign programs that can be broadcast on the continent's airwaves. </P>
<P> France wants to rally culture ministers behind its view that the bloc must protect Western Europe's cultural heritage from drowning in a flood of Hollywood exports. </P>
<P> But Paris has found many of its allies indifferent and Britain hostile to any tightening of an existing voluntary quota system that reserves at least half of European television airtime for European programs. </P>
<P> While Italy and Spain support France, Britain's Culture Minister Stephen Dorrell Monday proposed the quota be scrapped altogether. </P>
<P> The charm blitz began at a Monday lunch in Bordeaux, the capital of the French wine trade, hosted by octagenarian mayor and former Prime Minister Jacques Chaban-Delmas who served a 1986 Chateau Yquem -- one of the most prestigious regional wines. </P>
<P> Three hours of talks followed in which the ministers agreed to extend and enlarge the EU's Kaleidosope and Ariane aid programs for the arts and literature. </P>
<P> They also agreed to ask the European Commission to formulate a coherent policy toward the emerging multi-media industry before being entertained by a concert of classical music. </P>
<P> The ministers then travelled some 30 km (20 miles) to the village of Saint-Emilion, world-renowned for the wines produced from the vine groves that line its gentle hills. </P>
<P> In a cellar lined with wine barrels, the ministers were admitted to the Order of the Jurade, a Brotherhood for the promotion of red wines. </P>
<P> After a tour through a renovated monastery and church, the group sat down in a giant hall for a copious meal accompanied by no less than five Saint-Emilion wines of ascending age. </P>
<P> Before sending his fellow ministers to sleep in nearby chateaux, French Culture Minister Jacques Toubon stressed the richness of Europe's cultural history, hopeful its expression in French gastronomy will have won converts to his cause. </P>
