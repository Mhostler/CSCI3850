<P>  Ecuador's Congress Thursday opened an investigation against President Sixto Duran Ballen, accused by the opposition of using his influence to obtain a government loan for one of his granddaughters. </P>
<P> The newly elected Congress, in which the government only counts with 13 percent of the seats, formed a comission to investigate the allegations against the president . </P>
<P> Duran Ballen, in a national address Wednesday night, said he was willing to aid the investigation to clear his name. </P>
<P> ``To face these accusations, I have asked the Attourney General to start all procedings needed to clear these charges,'' Duran Ballen said. </P>
<P> Administration spokesman, Carlos Larriategui, called the charges against the president a ``despicable political move.'' </P>
<P> Social Christian Deputy, Javier Neira, who made the first public accusation against the president said once the comission makes its ruling, the case will be brought before a penal court. </P>
<P> Neira, who claims to have enough evident to prove the president's guilt, charged early this week that Enma Paredes Duran-Ballen received an $829,000 loan from the state-run Corporacin Financiera Nacional for her business. </P>
<P> Neira said the corporation approved the loan solely because it was requested by Duran's granddaugther. </P>
<P> The corporation admits granting the loan, but denies any wrongdoing. </P>
