<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  When Americans James Toney and Roy Jones clash Friday night, there will be more at stake than just the International Boxing Federation super middleweight championship. </P>
<P> Also on the line, once again, will be the unofficial title of the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world. </P>
<P> But this time there is substance, not just promotional bluster, to the claim that either Toney or Jones will establish himself as the best in the sport today. </P>
<P> The 26-year-old Toney is undefeated with a record of 44-0-2 with 29 bouts ending early and is the IBF super middleweight champion. </P>
<P> The 25-year-old Jones also is unbeaten with a record of 26-0 with 23 bouts ending early. He relinquished his IBF middleweight title to move up and challenge Toney. </P>
<P> But besides gaudy records, both fighters offer something else. </P>
<P> Toney is the most complete fighter around, combining a level of power, technique and savvy not seen since Marvelous Marvin Hagler and Julio Cesar Chavez were at their peaks. </P>
<P> Jones is, simply, the best athlete in boxing today and the finest since Sugar Ray Leonard. Jones' handspeed is unsurpassed and his creative footwork is a marvel. </P>
<P> World Boxing Council welterweight champion Pernell Whitaker has laid claim to the title of best fighter pound-for-pound. But while a suberb boxer, he has only average power and has shown time and again a proclivity to run rather than stand and trade punches. </P>
<P> So, the question is can a great boxer, Toney, beat a great athlete, Jones? </P>
<P> Las Vegas oddsmakers think so and have made Toney a 7-to-5 favorite. </P>
<P> ``I'm going to knock this boy out in seven,'' says Toney. ''He's said he's going to come out and brawl. If he does that, it will be quicker. </P>
<P> ``Jones' strength is speed,'' said Toney, who's defending his IBF 168-pound crown for the fourth time since winning it in February, 1993. </P>
<P> ``But against me speed don't get it. There are a lot of things he won't be able to do against me because he's in with a real fighter. </P>
<P> ``He doesn't know what he's gotten himself into.'' </P>
<P> Jones is not bashful either when it comes to offering bravado. </P>
<P> ``Toney's talked about ripping my heart out,'' said Jones. ''If that's what he wants to try to do, I'll be there. But he better bring a lunch, because he'll be all night trying. </P>
<P> ``I'm planning on winning and solidifying my position as the best with a knockout,'' continued Jones. </P>
<P> Regardless of who wins, the IBF soon will be looking for a new super middleweight champion. Toney has said this will be his final fight at 168 pounds and Jones has said he'll be moving back soon to the 160-pound middleweight division. </P>
<P> Toney plans two fights in both the 175-pound light heavyweight and the 195-pound cruiserweight divisions and then move up to the heavyweight classification by the end of 1995. </P>
<P> Toney's trainer, Bill Miller, said he believes his fighter can beat ``mediocre'' heavyweights, but admits he would have problems with larger men in that division, citing former world champion Riddock Bowe. </P>
<P> Toney won the IBF middleweight title in May, 1991 and defended successfully six times before moving up in weight late in 1992. </P>
<P> Jones won that same championship in May, 1993 and defended successfully once before moving up to challenge Toney. </P>
