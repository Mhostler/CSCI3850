<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark.(Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Clinton spent a tense Saturday night at one of his old haunts to cheer on the University of Arkansas Razorbacks in their victory over North Carolina to advance to the NCAA championship game. </P>
<P> ``I'm glad we hung on,'' a beaming Clinton told ESPN by cellular phone after Arkansas scrapped to a 75-68 win over North Carolina, giving the Razorbacks a chance at their second straight national title. </P>
<P> They will play UCLA in the championship game in Seattle Monday night, and Clinton left it unclear whether he would make a cross-country jaunt to see the game in person or stay in his home state of Arkansas to watch it on television. </P>
<P> ``Wherever I am, I'm going to be cheering for them,'' he said. ``I'll be screaming my lungs out, wherever.'' </P>
<P> Clinton also made a phone call to Oklahoma State Coach Eddie Sutton to console his old friend on his team's loss to UCLA in the other NCAA semifinal game. </P>
<P> ``I think we've got enough skill and enough talent to beat them, but, boy, they're deep and fast and they're good,'' he said. </P>
<P> Nervously sipping Diet Coke and chewing the ice from his cup, Clinton rooted for the Razorbacks in a back room at Doe's Eat Place, a popular steakhouse for Arkansas' political set where the portions are huge. </P>
<P> A large television was set into the wall of the oak-planked room, and Clinton watched the tense proceedings with two dozen Arkansas friends like two senior White House advisers, Thomas ''Mack'' McLarty and Bruce Lindsey, and his mother-in-law Dorothy Rodham. </P>
<P> Afterward, as he left Doe's, a crowd gathered outside greeted him with the Razorback ``Hog'' yell, which goes: ''Ooooooo. Pig! Sooey! Razorbacks.'' </P>
<P> Clinton was spending the weekend in his home state, last stop of a weeklong trip that took him to Georgia, Florida and Haiti. He is to return to Washington either late Monday or Tuesday. </P>
