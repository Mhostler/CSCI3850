<P>  Chile should be the first South American country admitted to the North American Free Trade Agreement because of its stable economic performance, even during Mexico's recent crisis, a Chilean official said. </P>
<P> The comments were contained in testimony to be given Tuesday by Andres Velasco, an adviser to Chile's ministry of finance, before the U.S. trade representative's trade policy staff committee. Excerpts were released late Monday. </P>
<P> The United States will begin formal negotiations with Chile about an expansion of NAFTA next month. </P>
<P> Velasco made a strong pitch for Chile's early inclusion in the free trade accord, noting that the country was now in its 12th consecutive year of strong economic growth and its gross domestic product had grown annually by an average of 6 percent since 1984. </P>
<P> He said Chile's GDP was expected to rise between 5 percent and 5.5 percent in 1995, in spite of Mexico's cash and currency crisis and the resulting economic problems in Latin America. </P>
<P> ``We visualize Chilean access to NAFTA as beneficial to all parties involved,'' Velasco said. ``Chile and the United States have highly complementary economies, and enhanced trade and investment would enhance economic well-being without representing a threat to any identifiable sectors or groups.'' </P>
<P> Velasco also cited Chile's progess in lifting 10 percent of its population out of poverty in the last five years alone, as well as its work to eliminate subsidies and price controls and keep a lid on inflation. </P>
