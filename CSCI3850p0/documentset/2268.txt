<P>  A British couple said Thursday they had done everything short of demolishing their house to find and free a cat trapped there for three weeks. </P>
<P> Firefighters have pulled up floorboards, builders have removed brickwork and members of the Cats' Protection League left a trail of food to find the mysterious meowing cat. </P>
<P> ``It is absolutely heart-rending to hear the cries from somewhere behind the walls but not be able to reach the cat and bring it out to safety,'' saids Brenda Powell, of Lydney in southwestern England. </P>
<P> Her husband, Mike, suspects the cat may have been attracted to the house by their son's collection of exotic birds. ``We just can't think of anything else we could do to save it, short of demolishing the house,'' he said. </P>
