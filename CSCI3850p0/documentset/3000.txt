<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Maoist guerrillas in India's southern Andhra Pradesh state wounded a state government official in a bomb attack Monday as voting began in crucial assembly polls which the rebels have vowed to disrupt. </P>
<P> Some 20 million people were due to vote for 153 of the 294 seats in the Andhra Pradesh Assembly, officials said. But a majority of rural voters planned to stay away, fearing reprisals by the Maoist People's War Group (PWG), they said. </P>
<P> The PWG hurled a bomb Monday wounding a village development official in the Nizamabad district, a Maoist stronghold. </P>
<P> Sunday, guerrillas set off two landmines, wounding nine policemen and an election official, officials said. </P>
<P> Some 20,000 paramilitary troops were guarding polling booths and escorting voters in the Maoist areas regarded by Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's Congress Party as potentially decisive in their bid to win the crucial state. </P>
<P> The Maoist areas straddle some 50 to 70 assembly constituencies in Andhra Pradesh, Rao's home state, where opinion polls have predicted major losses for the Congress Party. </P>
<P> A senior police official heading the anti-Maoist campaign in Andhra Pradesh told Reuters in a telephone interview from the state capital of Hyderabad that the PWG had threatened to chop off the hands of the person who casts the first vote at any booth in their region. </P>
<P> ``Urban voters are coming out in large numbers, but in the villages voting is very thin,'' the official said. ``They are worried that they are being watched.'' </P>
<P> Police have deployed sniffer dogs in the area to detect explosives after a spate of rebel landmine attacks. </P>
<P> A state minister narrowly escaped a PWG attack last week when rebels targeted his vehicle with a landmine but blew up a police patrol ahead of him. </P>
<P> Rao's ancestral home is in the Karimnagar district, a PWG stronghold and where a heavily protected Rao addressed a major election rally last month. His son, P.V. Ranga Rao, is contesting the polls from a constituency in the region. </P>
<P> The Congress now rules Andhra Pradesh, but appeared to be trailing in the run-up to the election. A loss could affect Rao's leadership of the Congress, party members have privately said. </P>
<P> Rao said last week the Congress would win comfortably in Andhra Pradesh and in three other states -- Goa, Sikkim and Karnataka -- that went to polls in November. </P>
<P> ``He had better be right if he wants to remain Congress leader,'' said a senior Congress deputy from the western Maharashtra state. </P>
<P> ``The Congress doesn't like to be led by people who can't win us plenty of votes,'' he said. </P>
