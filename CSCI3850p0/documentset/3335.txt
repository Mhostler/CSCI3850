<DATELINE>LONDON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  British Prime Minister John Major has said he will push Northern Ireland's peace process ahead as quickly as possible with new Irish leader John Bruton, whom he meets for the first time Tuesday. </P>
<P> But the discovery of a powerful bomb in the province over the weekend only underlined his insistence that the guerrillas would have to neutralize their arsenals before full political talks begin, Major said in an interview published in Tuesday's Financial Times newspaper. </P>
<P> ``What the planting of this device shows precisely is why it is so important to deal with the problems of weapons and explosives,'' he said. </P>
<P> Major said he expected his London meeting with Bruton, who took over as Irish prime minister last week from Albert Reynolds, to be an informal discussion. </P>
<P> He said it was too early to say if an Anglo-Irish framework document for the all-party talks on Northern Ireland's future, the next step in a year-old joint peace effort, would be ready by January. </P>
<P> ``We will move ahead as speedily as we can. There are still some difficult issues to be determined. I think they are determinable but it will take a little while,'' said Major. </P>
<P> British officials and members of the IRA's political wing Sinn Fein said they failed at landmark talks Monday to bridge the wide gap over the issue of arms. </P>
<P> Sinn Fein called for the all-party talks on Northern Ireland's future to be held as soon as possible. But Britain said the Irish Republican Army, which denied responsibility for the safely defused weekend bomb, must first ``decommission'' weapons with which it fought against British rule for 25 years until its Sept. 1 cease-fire. </P>
<P> The year-old Anglo-Irish peace plan offered Sinn Fein a place at talks with all other parties once fighting stopped. Earlier this month Britain and Sinn Fein officially opened the historic dialogue, which is meant to pave the way to the wider talks. </P>
<P> Sinn Fein wants the talks to map out a timetable for Irish reunification but its Protestant opponents, a majority in Northern Ireland, want to stay firmly tied to Britain. </P>
