<P> Clinton said U.SS and Russian interests now coincide on many points ``and where we do disagree, we can discuss our differences in a climate of warm peace, not Cold War ... In short, our nations are growing closer together, replacing suspicion and fear with trust and cooperation.'' </P>
<P> Yeltsin, meeting Clinton for the fifth time since their first summit in Vancouver, Canada, in April 1993, replied through a translator that the United States ``is a strong partner and not an easy one to deal with -- just like Russia.'' </P>
<P> ``We can and indeed must render our collaboration dynamic and make it more effective in the economic sector and coordinate our efforts more closely on the international scene,'' he said. ``I firmly believe that the nations of Russia and America and the nations of the world will only benefit from that.'' </P>
