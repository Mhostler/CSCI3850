<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien arrived in Chile Tuesday for a three-day visit aimed at boosting Canada's trading ties with Chile -- in line to become the fourth member of NAFTA. </P>
<P> ``I am delighted to be here and meet the authorities and the Canadian business delegation will hopefully perform well here too,'' Chretien told reporters upon his arrival in Santiago. </P>
<P> Chretien, who arrived in Chile as part of an 11-day tour of Latin America and the Caribbean, is being accompanied by a group of over 150 businessmen. His arrival was marked by a demonstration at Santiago's airport from Indian leaders, union members and environmentalists opposed to Chile's entry to NAFTA. </P>
<P> Local television showed scenes of the group of around 20 protesters waving banners reading, ``No to NAFTA. Yes to fair trade'' and shouting slogans at the Canadian delegation. </P>
<P> The Canadian prime minister, due to meet with President Eduardo Frei Wednesday, will sign with Frei several accords between the two countries. </P>
<P> Canada, which has billions of dollars invested in Chile especially in the mining sector, has been Chile's biggest supporter in its effort to join NAFTA. It still hopes Chile will join the trading bloc before the end of the year, Chretien told reporters. </P>
<P> ``As I said in Miami, I hope by the end of the year Chile will be the fourth amigo (friend),'' he said. </P>
<P> The United States, Canada and Mexico invited Chile to join the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) at the Miami summit in December. Formal talks are expected to begin in June, with Chile likely to join the trading bloc in mid-1996. </P>
<P> Canada is eager to expand the NAFTA group, and Chretien said Tuesday in Argentina -- the first stop on his tour prior to Chile -- that he will push his NAFTA partners to move faster on hemispheric integration. </P>
<P> ``When we look into the 21st century, we realize that we have to be together economically and politically -- North America and South America,'' he said. </P>
<P> The Canadian leader said, in an interview with a Chilean newspaper published Sunday, that the expansion of NAFTA is key to counterbalance the influence of United States. </P>
<P> Chretien, who has already visited Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay and Argentina, will fly Thursday to Brazil before finishing his tour in Costa Rica. </P>
