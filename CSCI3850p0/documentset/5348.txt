<P>  Maoist Shining Path guerrillas are reorganizing, but the government is confident their leaders will be captured, President Alberto Fujimori said late Thursday. </P>
<P> Fujimori made his comments to Panamericana Television as he rode a bicycle through a Lima shantytown during a campaign tour for April 9 elections. </P>
<P> He said he is confident Peruvian authorities will catch the leaders of the group that is reorganizing. Oscar Ramirez Durand is known as the head of the group's military wing, and comrade ''Rita'' as the group's political chief. </P>
<P> ``We are going to catch both of them,'' Fujimori said. </P>
<P> Comrade ``Rita'' became the political leader following the capture last week of another top guerrilla leader, Margie Calvo Peralta. </P>
<P> The guerrillas, whose strength has been weakened by the 1992 capture of rebel chief Abimael Guzman, have increased attacks in Peru ahead of the presidential and general elections. </P>
<P> About 25 people, including 15 guerrillas, have died in recent weeks, officials said. </P>
<P> More than 27,000 people have died since the group took up arms in the southeastern department of Ayacucho on the eve of elections in 1980. </P>
