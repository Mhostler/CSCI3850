<DATELINE>JAKARTA, March 28 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Indonesia's powerful military has said it would not tolerate any chaos in East Timor when reconciliation talks on the troubled territory take place next month, the official Antara news agency said on Tuesday. </P>
<P> It quoted military commander Major General Adang Ruchiatna as saying in the East Timorese capital of Dili the military would crush any efforts to create chaos in the area during the talks which are scheduled to be held in Austria in late April. </P>
<P> ``Security officers will take stern action against those who try to create unrest among the people,'' Ruchiatna was quoted as saying on Monday. </P>
<P> ``We should be aware. Don't let irresponsible people try to create certain movement to influence and attract the world's attention,'' he said. </P>
<P> Jakarta said last week it would not boycott the talks despite its protest against moves by the U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to invite East Timorese dissident figures to the meeting without consulting Jakarta. </P>
<P> Ruchiatna earlier denied the military had engineered a pro-Indonesia rally in Dili last week attended by 5,000 people. </P>
<P> He said the armed forces did not coerce residents into attending the gathering on Friday when 13 traditional leaders declared their support for Jakarta's rule over the territory. </P>
<P> Indonesia has faced international scrutiny since its invasion of East Timor in 1975 and its annexation the following year. The United Nations does not recognise Indonesian rule. </P>
