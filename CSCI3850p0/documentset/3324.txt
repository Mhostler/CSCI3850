<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Vowing to stay in Bosnia, NATO military chiefs urgently reviewed ways of strengthening the battered U.N. mission Monday and avoiding a humiliating withdrawal of peacekeeping troops. </P>
<P> ``There was great resolve and feeling of unity among the participating chiefs of defense staff and general agreement on the ways in which the effectiveness of UNPROFOR (U.N. Protection Force) could be improved,'' Dutch Chief of Defense Staff Gen. Henk van den Breemen told reporters. </P>
<P> Speaking at the end of the first day of a two-day meeting in The Hague, he declined to give any details of what was discussed by NATO nations with troops in the Bosnian mission and the United States, Germany, Italy and the United Nations. </P>
<P> ``First of all, and most important, all of the chiefs of defense staff declared their determination to continue UNPROFOR's mission,'' van den Breemen read from a prepared statement. </P>
<P> The military chiefs are looking at proposals, pushed by France and the United States, for more equipment, redeploying small groups of peacekeepers into larger units, and the opening of an aid corridor from the Adriatic to Sarajevo. </P>
<P> NATO defense ministers summoned the chiefs of staff last week after endorsing contingency plans to pull out the peacekeepers in the event of a final collapse of the mission, now facing near-daily humiliations. </P>
<P> Hundreds of the 23,000-strong U.N. force in Bosnia have been held hostage by Serbs as human shields against possible NATO air strikes in retaliation for violations of U.N. ``safe havens'' and attacks on peacekeepers. </P>
<P> Van den Breemen said the talks focused on ways to improve UNPROFOR's effectiveness within the existing U.N. mandate and said any suggestions would be passed on to national capitals and the United Nations for final decision. </P>
