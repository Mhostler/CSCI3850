<P>  Prominent Thai social activist Sulak Sivaraksa has been acquitted of a charge of insulting the monarchy brought against him by a former military government, a court official said on Thursday. </P>
<P> The criminal court ruled on Wednesday that Sulak had not intended any insult to Thailand's highly respected and revered monarchy in remarks he made at a university seminar in 1991 during a period of military rule, the official said. </P>
<P> ``It's not right for any group of people to use the nation's highest institution as part of a pretext to serve the group's personal interests,'' said the judge at the hearing, referring to the military body which ruled Thailand after the February 1991 military coup. </P>
<P> The judge's comments were published in local newspapers on Thursday. </P>
<P> A related charge of defaming former army commander general Suchinda Kraprayoon was also dismissed on Wednesday. </P>
<P> Sulak, a well-known scholar and democracy activist, went into hiding and slipped out of Thailand to Europe after the charges were filed. </P>
<P> He came back to face the charges after the September 1992 elections, which returned the country to democratic rule. </P>
