<P>  Orange County officials said Friday the county would ask the Bankruptcy Court for authorization to distribute $175 million in property taxes collected before the county's bankruptcy filing last month. </P>
<P> The funds were invested in the county's investment pool. </P>
<P> County bankruptcy counsel Lee Bogdanoff said the action provides additional relief to municipalities and schools that have been deprived of critical operating funds for the past month. </P>
<P> ``Today's action puts behind us a very difficult and potentially contentious issue,'' Bogdanoff said. </P>
<P> Orange County declared bankruptcy Dec. 6 after disclosing massive investment losses in its portfolio, now estimated at just over $2 billion. </P>
<P> The bankruptcy has caused financial hardship for some of the 187 municipalities and other bodies that invested in Orange County's investment pool and are now unable to get their money out. </P>
<P> Of the $175 million, Orange County will receive about $15.5 million in pre-petition tax revenues, cities and municipalities will receive $22 million and school districts $75 million, Bogdanoff said. </P>
<P> He did not detail who would receive the rest of the money. </P>
<P> ``This is welcome news to the cities and schools who had been anticipating these funds,'' Gaddi Vasquez, chairman of the Orange County Board of Supervisors, said. </P>
<P> Bogdanoff said the move represents ``a cooperative effort on the part of the county and investment pool creditors as well as cities who were caught up in the bankruptcy process -- not as investors -- but as bystanders to the county's financial situation.'' </P>
<P> ``We are justifiably pleased with the progress made thus far,'' Bogdanoff said. </P>
<P> Separately, Orange County said it had opened an Outplacement Assistance Center Friday to help employees laid off as a result of the county's financial crisis. </P>
<P> The center, in Santa Ana, will serve as an information clearing house and as a resource and counseling center to help laid-off employees find new jobs, the county said. </P>
<P> So far, the county has laid off 77 employees and more layoffs are expected as the county moves to cut $40 million in costs over the next six months. </P>
<P> Union leaders say they fear up to 1,000 county employees could lose their jobs. </P>
<P> Agents for the District Attorney from Orange County raided the home of former county treasurer Robert Citron and seized documents, the Orange County Register reported Friday. </P>
<P> It said investigators seized cassette tapes, computer disks and documents as part of a criminal probe of Citron, who was forced to resign last month after disclosing the losses in the county's investment pool that he managed. </P>
<P> The Orange County District Attorney's office confirmed a search warrant was issued Thursday and that an investigation was proceeding, but it would not comment further. </P>
