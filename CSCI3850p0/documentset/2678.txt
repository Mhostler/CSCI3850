<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  More than a week after the election, Alaska still has no governor-elect, although Democrat Tony Knowles is emerging as the clear leader, according to state Division of Elections returns. </P>
<P> Knowles, a former Anchorage mayor, increased his lead by an additional 237 votes from 6,724 that were counted Wednesday and Thursday to extend his lead over Republican Jim Campbell to 710 votes. </P>
<P> Knowles had 84,936 votes, or 41.2 percent, to Campbell's 84,226 votes, or 40.8 percent, according to Division of Elections figures. </P>
<P> Current Lieutenant Governor Jack Coghill, running on the right-wing Alaskan Independence Party's ticket, has 26,841 votes, or 13 percent. Jim Sykes of the environmentalist Green Party had 8,348 votes, or 4 percent. A fifth contender and write-in candidates split the remainder. </P>
<P> Vote counters in four regional Division of Elections offices have worked in the past week under the close scrutiny of campaign legal teams -- and, briefly in Nome, by candlelight because of a power outage there -- to tally absentee and so-called ``questioned'' ballots. </P>
<P> Questioned ballots are those cast by voters outside of their home precincts or those cast by new voters not yet on precinct rolls. They undergo special scrutiny to ensure that voters are registered. </P>
<P> Uncertainty about the race's outcome has scrambled plans around the state. </P>
<P> At a business conference that started Thursday here, a scheduled keynote address by Alaska's governor-elect was replaced with an appearance by the incoming speaker of the state House of Representatives. </P>
<P> Both Knowles and Campbell were invited to the conference, hosted by the Alaska Resource Development Council. Only Knowles attended, and although he has not declared victory, he was behaving like a winner. </P>
<P> He joked about the race's closeness -- ``That's one way to get out of making a speech'' -- and accepted congratulations from conference attendees. </P>
<P> Still to be counted are about 7,000 absentee and questioned ballots. </P>
