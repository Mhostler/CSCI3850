<P>  Senior Iraqi diplomat Nizar Hamdoon defended his country's right to maneuver its troops within its own borders Friday. </P>
<P> Speaking on ABC television's ``Nightline'' program, Hamdoon said, ``I don't think I can tell you anything about what's happening on the ground, except Iraq feels it has the right to move and maneuver its own troops within its borders.'' </P>
<P> ``This is all the signals we are getting from Baghdad,'' he said. ``The signals and statements we are getting is that we are moving our own troops on our own territories and its nobody's business.'' </P>
<P> Iraqi troops and armor began a buildup near the Kuwaiti border Friday and President Clinton ordered U.S. troops on alert for possible duty in Kuwait. U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry said the troop movements were ``extensive enough to cause me concern.'' </P>
<P> Hamdoon said he did not know the purpose of the troop movements, but assumed they may be linked to Iraq's disappointment over the continuing economic sanctions against his country. </P>
<P> ``I'm sure you had some indications of what the Iraqis were feeling in the last few weeks since sanctions have started to pinch,'' he said. </P>
<P> U.N. sanctions were imposed upon Iraq shortly after its troops invaded Kuwait. The sanctions, in effect for more than four years, prevent Iraq from exporting oil, its prime economic asset and have led to increasing hardship for ordinary Iraqis. </P>
