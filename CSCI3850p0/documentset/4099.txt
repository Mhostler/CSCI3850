<DATELINE>MODESTO, Calif (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A Planned Parenthood clinic was among several offices damaged by an early-morning arson fire at an office complex in the central California city of Modesto Wednesday, police said. </P>
<P> However, police said they did not know whether Planned Parenthood, which offers birth control services, was a target of the attack. </P>
<P> They said the blaze appeared to start at the office of a neighboring business, which suffered the most serious damage. </P>
<P> There have been numerous attacks around the country on abortion clinics and doctors who carry out abortions. </P>
<P> Planned Parenthood operates abortion clinics, but no abortions are performed at the Modesto clinic, which offers counseling and other women's health services, Planned Parenthood officials said. </P>
<P> Celeste Malott, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood, said the Modesto clinic had received no threats and there was nothing to indicate it was the target of an attack. </P>
<P> The fast-moving fire engulfed the two-story office complex in Modesto, 100 miles southeast of San Francisco, early Wednesday morning, causing extensive damage to seven businesses, police said. </P>
<P> Noone was injured but damage was estimated at $500,000. </P>
<P> Malott said the Planned Parenthood clinic suffered mainly smoke damage. </P>
<P> Modesto Police Lt. Tim Atchley said investigators concluded that the fire was arson, but said the blaze appeared to have started at the offices of a business next door to the Planned Parenthood clinic. </P>
<P> Police said they immediately called for assistance from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms due to the damage to the Planned Parenthood clinic. </P>
<P> Last November, a small bomb exploded near a Planned Parenthood abortion clinic in San Rafael, 15 miles (24 kms) north of san Francisco, damaging a nearby building but leaving the clinic unscathed. </P>
