<P> (Eds: Adds details, witness account  Rockets fired by guerrillas from Lebanon slammed into northern Israel on Wednesday, less than an hour before Israel and Jordan were due to sign a peace treaty, a witness told Israeli army radio. </P>
<P> The radio said no one was apparently hurt, and security sources said they were still investigating. </P>
<P> The report emerged in northern Israel just as Israelis and Jordanians were gathering at a southern border desert site for the signing. </P>
<P> Residents of northern Israel said the army had ordered them to take shelter. </P>
<P> A witness named Michael told the radio: ``Today at 12:20 some Katyushas fell in this area. We know well the fall of the Katyushas at the school where I work. I sent the kids to the shelter. As we speak another one just fell nearby.'' </P>
<P> Interviewed from the signing ceremony due to start around 7 a.m. EDT, Deputy Defense Minister Mordechai Gur said Israel had expected Muslim militant groups would try to wreck the event. </P>
<P> ``We will react with full force,'' he told army radio. </P>
<P> ``It hurts my heart on this festive day the residents of the north have no peace,'' he said. </P>
<P> Last Thursday and Friday, guerrillas in Lebanon shot Katyusha rockets into northern Israel, causing slight damage but no casualties, in apparent retaliation for an Israeli shelling of a house in south Lebanon which killed five civilians. </P>
<P> Israel later said its shelling was a mistake. </P>
<P> In a U.S.-brokered arrangement last year, Israel undertook not to shell villages in south Lebanon outside its self-proclaimed security zone. Muslim guerrillas pledged not to rocket northern Israel. </P>
<P> The deal ended a weeklong Israeli blitz against guerrillas in the area. </P>
