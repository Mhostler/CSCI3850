<P>  Crime writer Julian Symons, who won fame for novels which explored the ``respectable face of violence,'' has died at 82, his publishers said Tuesday. </P>
<P> Macmillan said Symons, who wrote more than 30 books in a career that spanned 50 years, died of cancer last Saturday. His novels included ``Death's Darkest Face,'' ``Progress Of A Crime,'' ``The End Of Solomon Grundy'' and ``The Man Who Lost His Wife.'' </P>
<P> Born in London in 1912 to a family of poor Russian-Jewish immigrants, Symons was a Trotskyist and a poet in his youth and served in the army during World War II. His first detective story, ``The Immaterial Murder Case'' was published in 1945. </P>
<P> Symons' writings included non-fiction works such as a biography of Edgar Allan Poe and a definitive history of the crime novel. </P>
<P> He said his novels explored what he called the ``respectable face of violence.'' </P>
<P> ``The thing that absorbs me most in our age is the violence behind respectable faces -- the civil servant planning how to kill Jews most efficiently, the judge speaking with passion about the need for capital punishment, the quiet obedient boy who kills for fun,'' Symons once said. </P>
<P> He won literary awards in Britain, America and Sweden and in 1990 he received the Cartier Diamond Dagger Award for a lifetime's achievement in the field of crime fiction, joining P.D. James, John le Carre and Dick Francis. </P>
<P> He was also chairman of the Crime Writers' Association and president of the Detection Club as well as a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. </P>
