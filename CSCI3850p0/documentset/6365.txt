<P>  The hit revival of the classic musical ''Showboat'' topped the list of Broadway's Tony awards nominees Monday, closely followed by Andrew Lloyd Webber's ``Sunset Boulevard'' and ``Indiscretions,'' a Jean Cocteau play written in the 1930s. </P>
<P> ``Showboat'' copped 10 nominations and ``Sunset,'' the only original musical production of the entire season, had nine, as did ``Indiscretions''. </P>
<P> Among major acting nominations, Ralph Fiennes was cited for Best Actor in a Play for ``Hamlet'', Matthew Broderick was nominated for a revival of ``How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying'' and Glenn Close got a nod for her star turn as silent movie queen Norma Desmond in ``Sunset Boulevard''. </P>
<P> The season suffered from a dearth of original musicals, leaving only two nominees in the Best Musical category -- Andrew Lloyd Webber's ``Sunset Boulevard'' and ``Smokey Joe's Cafe''. a musical review. An acclaimed revival of ``The Heiress'' won seven nominations and Terrence McNally's play about a group of gay men on country weekends, ``Love! Valour! Compassion!'' had five, including Best Actor for Nathan Lane. </P>
<P> The nominations were announced at Sardi's restaurant in the theater district by Kathleen Turner, who is starring in ''Indiscretions'', and Jeremy Irons. </P>
