<P>  A couple who kept their five children locked up as virtual prisoners for 18 months in a basement stinking of feces and urine were jailed Wednesday. </P>
<P> The youngsters were hidden in conditions described by the judge as ``deplorable'' to prevent them from testifying against their stepfather on charges of having anal intercourse with the two oldest girls. </P>
<P> The man, 32, was sentenced on Wednesday to five years in jail for three charges of sexual abuse and one of obstructing of justice, crown prosecutor Bill Wilson told Reuters. </P>
<P> The children's biological mother, 33, was jailed for two years for obstruction of justice. Both had pleaded guilty to all charges. </P>
<P> ``The 18 months they spent as virtual prisoners can never be regained and the effects will be something they may take years from which to recover,'' Ontario Court judge Justice Robert Reilly said in sentencing the pair. </P>
<P> Wilson said the four girls and a boy were locked up with 19 cats and four dogs in surroundings reeking of pet feces and urine. They were ordered never to look out of the windows or go near the doors, and played games to pass the time. </P>
<P> The family was discovered to have vanished from their home in Barrie, north of Toronto, in November 1991 when the police went to interview the girls over the sexual abuse charges. They were aged just nine and 10 at the time of the assaults. </P>
<P> Police finally rescued the children in April 1993 after following the stepfather and they are now in the care of a foster family, Wilson said. </P>
