<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  An 86-year-old woman was pronounced dead, placed in a body bag and packed in a morgue cooler for 90 minutes before someone realized she was still alive, local media has reported. </P>
<P> A morgue supervisor, retrieving the body of Mildred Clarke Wednesday for a funeral home, noticed her stomach moving and realized she was breathing, Albany County Coroner Philip Furie told an Albany, N.Y., television station Wednesday night. </P>
<P> She had been examined earlier Wednesday by Fire Department rescue squad members and pronounced dead by the coroner, the Albany Times Union newspaper reported Thursday. </P>
<P> Clarke was conscious and listed in serious condition Thursday at the Albany Medical Center. </P>
<P> ``She certainly appeared as if she had expired,'' the coroner was quoted as saying in the newspaper. ``She was cold as ice and she was stiff.'' </P>
<P> Her body had been placed in the hospital morgue cooler, normally set at 40 degrees F, the coroner told the media. </P>
<P> Clarke is a widow who has lived at a senior citizen apartment complex for 15 years, local reports said. </P>
<P> Albany County does not require its coroners to be licensed physicians. Furie, an insurance salesman, was elected to his post. </P>
