<P>  The virus that causes AIDS duplicates itself much more rapidly than previously thought and this knowledge could speed up the development of drugs to treat the deadly disease, American scientists said Wednesday. </P>
<P> The University of Alabama scientists also discovered that instead of breaking down, the immune system is constantly battling against the virus. </P>
<P> The study was reported in the science journal Nature. </P>
<P> ``We had suspected previously that HIV replicated rapidly but we had no idea the degree to which it actually replicated,'' Michael S. Saag, one of the scientists involved in the study, told Reuters. </P>
<P> ``Thirty percent of the virus that is present in the bloodstream today was not there yesterday,'' he said. </P>
<P> Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection is usually thought to be produced by a pool of chronically infected, virus-producing cells, or of latently infected cells which become activated after a long period of dormancy. </P>
<P> Saag said the findings would have an important impact on treatment of HIV and AIDS (acquired immune deficiency sydrome) and could affect research into the killer disease because it crystallizes understanding of what the virus is doing. </P>
<P> ``It tells us our research agenda ought to be moving toward more aggressive, earlier intervention ... because we know replication is so rapid we can start assessing whether a drug is worth anything or not within an order of three to six weeks which will speed drug development,'' Saag said. </P>
<P> In a separate article, David Ho and colleagues of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center at New York University School of Medicine presented similar results based on work with the new, experimental drug ABT-538. </P>
<P> Simon Wain-Hobson of the Pasteur Institute in Paris where the AIDS virus was first discovered, praised the new findings. </P>
<P> ``The new analyses are most welcome because they clarify the picture considerably. They show that HIV is behaving more and more like a virus, without frills or special effects. It is unique and subtle, but a virus nonetheless,'' he said in an accompanying article in Nature. </P>
<P> Wain-Hobson called for anti-viral treatment at all stages of the disease and said only a combination of drugs have the potential to outgun it. </P>
