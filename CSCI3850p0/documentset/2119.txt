<P>  Even as it threatens anew to open the floodgates of weapons to Bosnian Muslims, the United States is once again exploring with its allies new diplomatic and military moves that would make such a threat unnecessary. </P>
<P> Senior U.S. and European officials say one option under consideration would be to fashion a broader negotiating strategy that would seek to settle the Bosnian war within a regional context, bringing Serbia and Croatia into the mix. </P>
<P> ``We'll see if it's possible for the contact group to devise a wider negotiating strategy,'' one senior European diplomat said, referring to the countries that have spent the year devising and trying to sell a Bosnia peace plan -- the United States, Britain, France, Russia and Germany. </P>
<P> U.S. officials also acknowledged the search for a possible new strategy, noting that the most recent peace approach was focused on Bosnia and its capital Sarajevo. </P>
<P> ``There hasn't been a chance to step back and look at the entire region,'' said one U.S. official, adding that the Kosovo region of Serbia and the Krajina region of Croatia, both disputed areas, may be ``thrown back into the equation.'' </P>
<P> The search for a new approach is a tacit admission that a nearly year-long U.S.-led effort to bring peace to Bosnia -- combining diplomacy and often ambivalent military force -- has failed, a shadow on President Clinton's otherwise improving foreign policy record. </P>
<P> ``We're right in the middle of meetings. I'm not sure how it's going to come out,'' a U.S. official said. </P>
<P> Muslims and Croats accepted the peace plan, which would give them 51 percent of Bosnia. But Serbs who control more than 70 percent of the country and would be entitled to only 49 percent under the proposed plan have rejected it. </P>
<P> Europeans and Americans agree there can be no changes in this Bosnian map. But a senior European official said the possibility of allowing Bosnian Serbs to federate with Serbia is ``an element that has to be looked at.'' </P>
<P> The Clinton administration in the past has opposed any attempt by Belgrade to create a ``greater Serbia'' and a senior U.S. official Wednesday told Reuters that remains an outcome ''we cannot accept,'' raising the prospect of a new serious split between Washington and its allies. </P>
<P> The latest diplomatic activity on Bosnia, centered this week at the United Nations, comes because Clinton is under congressional orders to force the U.N. Security Council to take up the issue of lifting the arms embargo. </P>
<P> Under U.S. law, funds for U.S. activities to enforce the embargo end Nov. 15 if the U.N. has not voted to lift the embargo by then or if Bosnian Serbs still have not agreed to the ``contact group'' peace plan. </P>
<P> White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers Wednesday said Washington ``would look at ways to perhaps lift the embargo unilaterally'' if the U.N. effort for multilateral action fails. </P>
<P> But key U.S. allies remain firmly opposed to lifting a weapons ban that has extracted far greater penalty from Bosnian Muslims than from the much better-armed Bosnian Serbs. </P>
<P> U.S. officials admit unilateral action could seriously damage cooperation on other U.N. resolutions and boomerang badly on the Bosnian Muslims, unless Washington undertakes a most unlikely massive military mission on their behalf. </P>
<P> Increasingly, U.S. officials -- and Bosnian Muslim leaders -- have begun to fear lifting the embargo could invite immediate attack by Serbs. Britain and France have vowed to withdraw their peacekeepers, who have helped deter more sweeping Bosnian Serb advances, if the embargo is lifted. </P>
<P> In this context, Washington and its allies are working on a U.N. resolution that could be passed by the Nov. 15 deadline but postpone actually lifting the embargo until next April. </P>
<P> By that time, officials say, Muslims in beseiged Bosnian areas will have presumably weathered another difficult winter with the help of international relief aid. </P>
<P> Also, Bosnian Serbs may be more apt to accept the peace plan because Serbian efforts to close the border with Bosnian Serb areas of Bosnia will have had an effect, they say. </P>
<P> U.S. and European officials, ignoring previous unrequited demands for Bosnian Serbs to make peace, are saying again they must use the next six months to make another effort. </P>
<P> It would combine diplomacy and ``more robust'' NATO military action when Bosnian Serbs violate U.N. exclusion zones or attack peacekeepers. </P>
<P> Europeans in particular say they hope Clinton's latest round of foreign policy successes in Haiti, Iraq and North Korea will strengthen him politically and make it possible to convince Congress to drop its push for lifting the embargo. </P>
