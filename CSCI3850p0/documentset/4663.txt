<P> Holbrooke is expected to be in Zagreb on Monday and Tuesday and ``have consultations with Tudjman expressing our concerns as to the consequences if UNPROFOR (U.N. protection forces in the former Yugoslavia) were actually to leave'' the country, one U.S. official told Reuters. </P>
<P> He said the decision for Holbrooke to make the trip, which is expected only to include Croatia, reflects growing concern that Tudjman is pursuing ``his war option...(because) basically the withdrawal of UNPROFOR would allow him to militarily take back the Krajina,'' a region of Croatia held by rebel Serbs. </P>
<P> On Monday, Tudjman tried again to fend off international criticism for ordering out U.N. troops, saying their continued presence, not their withdrawal, would lead to a new war with its rebel Serb minority. </P>
<P> ``The cancellation of the U.N. mandate does not mean war, but the continuation of the occupation of Croatia under the present U.N. mandate would mean war, because Croatia cannot tolerate occupation,'' Tudjman said. </P>
