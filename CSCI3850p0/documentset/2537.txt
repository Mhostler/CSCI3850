<P>  Republican Party chairman Haley Barbour Thursday said he would recommend ruling out New York City as a possible site for the GOP's 1996 convention. </P>
<P> In a statement, Barbour said he would recommend that ``New York City be eliminated from consideration'' at a meeting of the Republican National Convention site selection committee next week to narrow down the number of cities vying to host the coveted convention. </P>
<P> Barbour last month told reporters New York City had not been ruled out even though its mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, had endorsed Democratic Governor Mario Cuomo over Republican George Pataki. </P>
<P> He gave no reason for his change of heart Thursday, saying only, ``From the beginning we have said facilities, financing and politics are the three criteria.''  A final decision will be made by the full RNC at its January 1995 meeting, based on the recommendation of the site selection committee. </P>
<P> In April, the GOP narrowed its choice to five cities -- New Orleans, San Antonio, San Diego, Chicago and New York.  But only three cities are left under consideration now, since New York has been ruled out and Chicago will already be hosting the Democratic Convention Aug. 22-29. </P>
<P> The Republicans will meet Aug. 10-16. </P>
