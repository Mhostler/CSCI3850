<P>  Schools in Rwanda opened their doors Monday for the first time since April, when the country was plunged into a civil war in which an estimated one million Rwandans were massacred. </P>
<P> Minister for Primary and Secondary Education Pierre Claver Rwigema visited the northwestern province of Ruhengeri where the first classes were held. More schools will open later this week. </P>
<P> The schools are using kits sent by the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) to replace what was looted or wrecked in fighting which ended in July when the Rwanda Patriotic Front declared victory. </P>
<P> UNICEF and UNESCO are distributing 9,000 kits across Rwanda and have trained up to 250 teachers to use the emergency packages. </P>
<P> The head of U.N. peacekeeping forces, Kofi Annan, arrived in the capital Kigali Monday for a three-day visit to Rwanda. </P>
