<P> (Eds: Adds date in 3rd para)  One of three hemophiliac brothers barred from school because they were infected with the AIDS virus pleaded not guilty to charges of sexual battery, court officials said Thursday. </P>
<P> Robert Ray, 16, entered the plea through his attorney Kirk Kirkconnel Tuesday at an arraignment hearing in Orange County, Florida, juvenile court. </P>
<P> A hearing on the charges is scheduled for November 11, with trial set for November 17. </P>
<P> Ray, a ninth grader, is charged with trying to force a 15-year-old schoolmate to perform oral sex on him in a parking lot last February before she struggled and got away. </P>
<P> Authorities, who do not believe that any bodily fluids were exchanged, said they became involved only recently after the girl told others of the episode. </P>
<P> Ray received a summons but was not arrested, said a spokeswoman for the Orange-Osceola County State Attorney. </P>
<P> Ray was diagnosed with AIDS four years ago and is still in fairly good health, as is his younger brother, Randy. His older brother, Ricky, died of complications from the disease in 1992 after becoming a national spokesman for its victims. </P>
<P> All three brothers are believed to have been infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, before strict U.S. screening of blood products began in 1985. </P>
<P> They were the subject of international news reports after the three boys were barred from attending public school in 1986 in Arcadia, Florida. They moved away from Arcadia when an arsonist torched their home in 1987. </P>
<P> Keith Morrison, a spokesman for the family, said he could not discuss particulars of the case, but stressed that Ray denies all charges. </P>
<P> ``It's our contention that obviously the charges are totally unfounded. She's crying out for help for something,'' he said. ``We have no way of knowing what the motivation is behind the charges.'' </P>
<P> Ray's mother, Louise, is a candidate for the Florida House of Representatives. </P>
