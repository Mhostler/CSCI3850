<P>  Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams said Friday that the partial withdrawal of British troops from Belfast's streets was a ``long overdue small step'' and called for urgent action to cement Northern Ireland peace. </P>
<P> ``I welcome it, nonetheless,'' Adams told journalists on arrival at a Dublin forum which is discussing ways to end the 25-year Northern Ireland conflict. </P>
<P> Adams, head of the Irish Republican Army's political wing, urged the British governemnt to make ``more urgent and generous movement'' to build on five-month-old cease-fires by the IRA and its Protestant Loyalist foes. </P>
<P> ``We have to see all British troops out of our country,'' Adams said 24 hours after the Northern Ireland police chief said that troops would leave Belfast streets in daylight hours from Sunday, but would remain stationed in the province. </P>
<P> The partial withdrawal, the first in a quarter of a century of conflict, was in response to the twin cease-fires and has been broadly welcomed by Irish nationalists who want Northern Ireland reunited with the Irish republic. </P>
<P> Adams said it was not enough. He called for the complete withdrawal of Britain's 18,000 troops, which nationalists see as an occupying colonial army. </P>
