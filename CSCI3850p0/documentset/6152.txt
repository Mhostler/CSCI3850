<DATELINE>HONG KONG, April 30 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Hong Kong's Hilton Hotel, which opened during the water-rationed 1960s and watched the colony transform itself into an economic powerhouse, closed on Sunday, a victim of the city's prosperity. </P>
<P> Its prime location among the headquarters of the colony's three note-printing banks, the Bank of China, the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank and the Standard Chartered Bank, was too valuable to waste, even on a luxury hotel. </P>
<P> Hong Kong's richest man, Li Ka-shing, will tear down the 26-storey building and put up a more profitable office skyscraper in its place. </P>
<P> Tenants in the British colony, which will be handed back to China in 1997, pay some of the highest rents in the world to have an office on the edge of huge potential markets in China and the rest of fast-growing Asia. </P>
<P> Li is currently in talks with the government over how high he can build his new tower. </P>
<P> ``When it opened it was the centre of social activity on Hong Kong island,'' said Phillipa Yule, public relations manager for Hilton International in a recent interview. </P>
<P> At the time Hong Kong was struggling, suffered a severe water shortage -- guests had to wash in a bucket -- and offered few venues for socialites to gather. </P>
<P> ``Hong Kong changes so quickly. It's an example of how the dollar rules,'' Yule said. </P>
<P> Hilton is a hotel management company that had 20 years to run on its Hong Kong contract. But it did not own the site. Li did. </P>
<P> Li paid Hilton US$125 million to tear up its contract, pack up and leave two years after the hotel had a US$15 million facelift. </P>
<P> Now Hilton has nowhere else to hang its brass plaque in Hong Kong. </P>
<P> Albert Chow, deputy managing director of Li's flagship company, Cheung Kong, said in an interview the company planned a dramatic design for its office tower. </P>
<P> It will be supported on giant pillars so that the public can wander underneath and around the base of the structure through a street level garden park. </P>
<P> Some analysts suspect Li, in deference to China, will not want the building to be taller than China's showcase building in the colony, the nearby 70-storey Bank of China tower. </P>
<P> The Hilton is the most prestigious of a clutch of hotels lost to the skyline in Hong Kong's recent real-estate boom. </P>
<P> Room rates are set to rise as accommodation gets more scarce, according to Gordon Crosbie-Walsh, research manager at a brokerage house. </P>
<P> Five-star hotel rooms cost HK$1,400 to HK$1,600 a night (US$180-205) and are set to rise 20 percent this year as tourist and business demand rises, Crosbie-Walsh said. </P>
<P> Hong Kong is not yet at the stage where it is turning away guests, according to the Hong Kong Tourist Association. Last year hotel occupancy was 85 percent. </P>
<P> Hilton's last guests left the hotel on Sunday and the doors were closed for a private 1,000-strong staff party. </P>
<P> A skeleton crew will stay on next week to pack up the luxury fittings that will be absorbed by Li's other businesses. </P>
<P> Soon Hilton will look for another site in Hong Kong to take advantage of the demand for beds, Yule said. </P>
