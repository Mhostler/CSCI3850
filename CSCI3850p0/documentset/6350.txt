<DATELINE>PARIS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Conservative Paris mayor Jacques Chirac won the French presidential election Sunday, beating Socialist opponent Lionel Jospin by a clear margin, reliable computer forecasts showed. </P>
<P> Forecasts broadcast on three television stations as soon as the last polls closed gave Chirac between 52 and 52.2 percent of the vote. Turnout was about 80 percent of the just under 40 million registered voters. </P>
<P> On the dot of 8 p.m. (2 p.m. EDT), when the polls closed, Chirac's face appeared on television screens and cheers of ``We've won'' exploded at his campaign headquarters, where champagne was flowing even before the projections were made public. </P>
<P> The projected result, based on sample ballots made available by the Interior Ministry, was a huge relief for Chirac, 62, who failed in two previous presidential bids, losing to Socialist Francois Mitterrand in 1981 and 1988. </P>
<P> Twice prime minister in 1974-76 and 1986-88, Chirac only narrowly beat fellow Gaullist Edouard Balladur, the man he sent to the prime minister's office in 1993, for second place in the first round of voting two weeks ago. </P>
<P> He is expected to appoint his top cabinet supporter, Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, 49, as prime minister after taking over from the ailing 78-year-old Mitterrand in the next 10 days. </P>
<P> The outgoing president and his successor are due to stand side-by-side at ceremonies at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris Monday marking the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe. </P>
<P> Saying France was suffering from a ``social fracture,'' Chirac pledged during his campaign to give top priority to fighting near-record 12.3 percent unemployment, as well as homelessness. </P>
<P> Both candidates projected themselves as men of change and reform, distancing themselves from Balladur and Mitterrand. </P>
<P> Jospin, a 57-year-old former Socialist party leader and education minister, was a complete outsider when he entered the race in January but emerged the surprise winner of the first ballot with 23.3 percent. </P>
<P> His campaign continued to gather momentum and in the only television debate last Tuesday, he proved himself to be Chirac's equal in what commentators scored as a draw. </P>
<P> The successor to Mitterrand, who has held power for a record 14 years, will be the first leader of a major democracy whose term of office stretches beyond the year 2000. </P>
<P> Chirac has said he sees no reason to dissolve the National Assembly, where the center-right coalition has a four-fifths majority. </P>
<P> Among politicians set for senior cabinet roles under Chirac are free-marketeer Alain Madelin, expected to be economics and finance minister, and centrist Education Minister Francois Bayrou, tipped for the foreign ministry. </P>
