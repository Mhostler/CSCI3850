<P>  Defense Secretary William Perry arrived in Beijing Sunday for three days of talks with Chinese Communist Party, government and defence leaders. </P>
<P> Perry and his entourage arrived aboard a special plane from Kuwait, where he reviewed the U.S.-led response to Iraq's military movements near its Kuwaiti border. </P>
<P> The trip is the first by a U.S. defense chief since military ties were frozen in 1989 after Beijing used the People's Liberation Army to crush pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square with heavy loss of life. </P>
<P> He was due to meet his Chinese counterpart, Chi Haotian, as well as Communist Party chief and President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng. </P>
<P> Li presided over the Tiananmen crackdown while Jiang was installed as party chief in its wake. </P>
