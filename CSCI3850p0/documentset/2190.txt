<P>  Ming Ming, the Chinese panda who refused to mate, returned home to Beijing on Monday. </P>
<P> London Zoo tried to mate her with Bao Bao from the Berlin Zoo, but the fur flew and keepers had to intervene with fire extinguishers to separate the warring pandas. </P>
<P> Ming Ming was accompanied home on her 5,000-mile journey by zoo director Jo Gipps and keeper Michael Carmen. </P>
<P> ``We have had pandas at the zoo for 20 years and I've looked after Ming Ming for the last three years,'' Carmen said. ``I hope there will be a panda at London Zoo but I cannot see there being one in the foreseeable future.'' </P>
<P> ``There is no point in her staying here on her own,'' he added. ``It's best she gets back to China and into the breeding program.'' </P>
<P> Only 600 giant pandas are thought to be alive in China, where there is a shortage of the type of bamboo that is their natural food. There are less than 20 of the species outside China. </P>
