<P>  The Supreme Court agreed Monday to decide the case of a defense lawyer whose drug racketeering conviction was overturned because prosecutors failed to show how his alleged illicit activity affected interstate commerce affect.  The case involves Juan Paul Robertson, an Alaskan gold mine operator and former federal prosecutor who became a criminal defense lawyer in Los Angeles. </P>
<P> Robertson quit the practice of law in California in 1984 and moved to Arizona, living with another couple. He then set up a partnership with the couple to mine gold in Alaska and kept the mining operation after the partnership broke up. </P>
<P> Robertson was convicted on four counts of conspiracy and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, and one count of investing the proceeds from a pattern of racketeering in an enterprise affecting interstate commerce. </P>
<P> A federal judge sentenced him to 20 years in prison. </P>
<P> A U.S. appeals court upheld the drug convictions but overturned the racketeering conviction because the gold mine did not affect interstate commerce. </P>
<P> Justice Department lawyers asked the Supreme Court to reinstate the conviction, citing the interstate movement of goods and people in connection with the gold mine's operation. </P>
<P> Although most of the gold was sold in Alaska, they said Robertson took about $30,000 worth of gold nuggets out of the state. </P>
<P> They said he repeatedly flew to Alaska to visit the mining operation and hired a number of employees from outside of the state to work in the mine. </P>
<P> The Supreme Court will hear arguments in the case early next year, with a decision due by June on whether the gold mine's activities involved interstate commerce. </P>
