<P>  The U.N.'s chief war crimes prosecutor said Friday he believed it would be possible to deliver quick justice to those Rwandan leaders responsible for genocide and crimes against humanity. </P>
<P> ``My impression is that in Rwanda one could be able to go in with a fairly substantial, competent investigative team and go for the jugular -- go for the top leadership and nobody else, get out indictments quickly and get trials on quickly,'' judge Richard Goldstone told reporters. </P>
<P> The South African judge, brought to the Hague in August to prosecute suspected war criminals from the former Yugoslavia, was also last week made chief prosecutor of the United Nations' Rwandan war crimes tribunal set up by the Security Council. </P>
<P> Although he told a meeting of foreign correspondents that it was too early to put a date on the Rwandan tribunal's first likely indictments, Goldstone said his task in Rwanda looked much easier than in Yugoslavia because the war there is over. </P>
<P> ``We will immediately be able to investigate top leadership because it's known who they are; there are 8,000 people in prison at the moment in Rwanda. Many other people presumably are obtainable in neighbouring states,'' Goldstone said. </P>
<P> ``Having tried the top leadership that would be the end of the work and the end of the tribunal. I think Rwanda could be a much shorter exercise than the former Yugoslavia.'' </P>
<P> The Rwanda tribunal is meant to try those responsible for the massacre of around one million mainly minority Tutsis between April and July, a genocide widely blamed on the former Hutu-led government. </P>
<P> Where it will be sited has yet to be decided, but Goldstone said it would probably be in Africa, perhaps Nairobi. </P>
<P> The Rwanda tribunal will have 11 judges and share the appeals judges already serving on the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal here. </P>
<P> Goldstone denied his dual function as prosecutor for both tribunals would stretch his time and curb the efficiency of the courts, saying his role was mainly political -- to ensure the same standards are used for both courts and for every suspect. </P>
