<P>  A third of the rubbish washed up on beaches in the west of Scotland comes from the other side of the Atlantic, a British pressure group said Monday. </P>
<P> The Tidy Britain Group blamed both dumping by ships in North American waters and rubbish blowing into the sea from onshore dumps for the problem. </P>
<P> It said among the items found on the 63 beaches it studied were snowmobile oil containers from cliff-top dumps still common in Newfoundland. </P>
<P> ``The money spent by British authorities on cleaning up water and beaches will be wasted if we get a significant proportion of plastic and sewage-related litter being ``imported' from North America,'' said the group's director general Graham Ashworth. </P>
