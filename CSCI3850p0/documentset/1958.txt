<DATELINE>KIGALI, Rwanda (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Rwandan Vice President Paul Kagame, who masterminded the defeat of the former government's army, Wednesday dismissed the threat of those troops mounting a guerrilla war and ruled out negotiations on power-sharing with their commander. </P>
<P> Kagame, who is also defense minister and commanded rebels who won a three-month civil war in July, said Hutu extremist militiamen had infiltrated back into Rwanda but the problem was being contained. </P>
<P> ``They have been managing to infiltrate a few people inside (Rwanda) to spread this propaganda that they are about to invade the country,'' Kagame told a news conference in Kigali. </P>
<P> ``Maybe the idea ... is to cause confusion in the population, so that people start fleeing the country and create the image that there is lack of security in the country. But it is not a big problem.'' </P>
<P></P>
<P> ``They would not succeed ... I don't think they have a chance. We have defeated them before. I think we are in a better position and if they tried we would give them a big blow.'' </P>
<P> Kagame said a new war would give his Rwanda Patriotic Army (RPA) a chance to complete the task of defeating the estimated 40,000 troops who fled to Zaire, Tanzania and Burundi. </P>
<P> Former Rwandan army chief of staff Major-General Augustine Bizimungu has repeatedly called for talks from exile in Zaire, with the new government so he and his men can return in peace. </P>
<P> ``I do not forsee negotiating with ... Bizimungu because he and his people are on the list of those who are to be brought to justice ... It is a question of time but we shall get them,'' the vice president said. </P>
<P> ``When he is talking of negotiations, I am sure he must be dreaming,'' added Kagame, looking particularly grim. </P>
<P> The new government blames Bizimungu, his troops, Hutu militia and members of the ousted cabinet for the massacre of an estimated one million members of the Tutsi minority and Hutu allies between April and July after the assassination of Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana. </P>
<P> Kagame repeated the government's denials of a report last month from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) which said it had credible evidence that RPA soldiers were systematically killing thousands of Hutus returning to Rwanda. </P>
<P> He accused the UNHCR of encouraging such ``rumors'' to prompt the more than two million Rwandan refugees not to return and said soldiers who committed crimes were arrested and punished. </P>
<P> He said he was far from satisfied with the international community's help to Rwanda, which he said needed money rather than foreign criticism to improve such issues human rights. </P>
<P> The British charity Oxfam Wednesday accused the international community of contributing to Rwanda's tragedy through complacency and inaction and called for a complete reform of United Nations humanitarian efforts. </P>
<P> Launching a pamphlet reviewing the Rwandan crisis, the Oxford-based group attacked Western countries for supplying arms to the Hutu government which ruled Rwanda before a Tutsi-led rebellion, and for what it alleged was the deliberate delaying of the use of U.N. peacekeeping forces. </P>
<P> ``We are all responsible for ensuring that suffering on such a vast scale never happens again,'' said Oxfam director David Bryer in the pamphlet. ``The tragedy of Rwanda has demonstrated more clearly than ever before that the international community lacks the capacity to respond effectively to such crises. </P>
