<P>  NATO, stressing it is not planning a ``crusade against Islam,'' cautiously opened a controversial dialog with five Middle East and North African states Friday. </P>
<P> Hard-pressed NATO Secretary-General Willy Claes, his credibility at risk in a bribery scandal ripping Belgian politics apart, began the initiative by holding talks with representatives from Morocco. </P>
<P> NATO sources said separate meetings would follow with Israel, Egypt, Mauritania and Tunisia, but stressed the low-key nature of the talks which they said would explore the development of areas of mutual concern. </P>
<P> Alliance planners, expressing concern over extremism and weapons proliferation, say they want to extend security and stability on NATO's southern flank. </P>
<P> The initiative has drawn fire from Iran, Libya and Algeria. </P>
