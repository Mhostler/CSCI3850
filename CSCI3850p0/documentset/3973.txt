<P>  The 1995 Alpine skiing world championships, due to start next Monday in the Spanish resort of Sierra Nevada, were officially postponed Thursday because of lack of snow. </P>
<P> Gianfranco Kasper, Secretary General of the International Ski Federation (FIS), told a news conference the championships would be staged in the same resort in 1996. </P>
<P> ``We came to the conclusion that because of force majeure the Alpine world ski championships cannot be carried out in February 1995 in the Sierra Nevada,'' Kasper said. </P>
<P> They will be held in the same resort at the same time next year ``with even greater improvements,'' Kasper said, reading a joint statement from FIS and the Spanish organizing committee headed by Jeronimo Paez. </P>
