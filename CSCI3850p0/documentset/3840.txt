<P>  Camilla Parker Bowles ended her 21-year marriage in a ``quickie'' court hearing Thursday after having three affairs with Prince Charles in 25 years. </P>
<P> A judge at Britain's top divorce court unceremoniously declared ``decree nisi,'' suspending her marriage to husband Andrew with 31 other failed unions read out in a three minute sitting. The divorce cost just $94. </P>
<P> The ``other woman,'' whom Charles's estranged wife Diana is said to blame for her own marriage break-up, will be free to wed again in six weeks and a day when she or Andrew can apply for the ``decree absolute'' which seals a divorce. </P>
<P> The sudden news last week that the Parker Bowles were to divorce sent shockwaves through a British establishment left wondering if Charles and Diana's long-expected divorce would be followed by re-marriage and, one day, a Queen Camilla. </P>
<P> Hoping honesty was the best policy, Charles has admitted to an affair with Camilla in the late 1980s after his marriage to the hugely popular Diana broke down beyond repair. </P>
<P> Most media royal watchers are convinced the relationship is continuing and Lord Charteris, a former aide to Queen Elizabeth, has called Camilla, 47, the real love in Charles' life. </P>
<P> Neither of the Parker Bowles were present in the small court at Somerset House, a mile from Buckingham Palace. </P>
<P> According to the court schedule pinned to the door, Camilla was the party who officially initiated the divorce proceedings against her 55-year-old husband. </P>
<P> Charles's own bitter marital collapse, his adultery and the prospects of his marrying his mistress have sunk the monarchy into its worst crisis since the 1936 abdication of Edward VIII, who chose an American divorcee over the throne. </P>
<P> Charles, 46, has made clear he intends to become king when his mother dies come what may. He says he has no immediate plans to divorce the 33-year-old wife he married in 1981. </P>
<P> Under English law, the Parker Bowles were eligible to an easy divorce with no need to make accusations of adultery or name names, as they had lived apart for two years. </P>
<P> Unlike Charles, who moved out of his and Diana's Kensington Palace home when they split up in December 1992, the Parker Bowles kept their separation secret even from the prying media. They stressed they decided to divorce jointly and amicably. </P>
