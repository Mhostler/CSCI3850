<P>  Former Prime Minister Harold Wilson, a socialist who embodied the bluff, pipe-smoking working-class Englishman and guided the Labor Party to four election victories, died in his sleep Wednesday. He was 79. </P>
<P> The last Labor Party leader to win a general election, Wilson had been suffering from cancer for 15 years. </P>
<P> He presided over a tumultuous period in the 1960s and 70s, as Labor pressed its social policies and nationalization of state industries, while Britain readjusted to a declining role in the world in the post-war, post-colonial period. </P>
<P> Wilson, a consummate political tactician, guided his divided party to four election victories in a record unmatched in modern times even by Margaret Thatcher. </P>
<P> His wife Mary said the former prime minister, who retired suddenly in 1976 after 13 years leading Labor, died peacefully around midnight. </P>
<P> Tributes poured in from political friends and foes and the day's main parliamentary business was cancelled out of respect for a man at the heart of British life for four decades. </P>
<P> ``He was the most successful leader that Labor has ever had, winning four elections out of five, although on each occasion he came to office at a time of great economic difficulty,'' said James Callaghan, who succeeded Wilson. </P>
<P> Conservative Prime Minister John Major, leading tributes in the House of Commons, hailed Wilson as ``one of the most brilliant men of his generation.'' </P>
<P> One of Wilson's biggest battles was with Ian Smith, leader of the white minority regime in Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, who defied Britain in 1965 by declaring unilateral independence. </P>
<P> Yet Smith said Wednesday he never had personal problems with Wilson. ``He was never aggressive. I always found him very reasonable and very well mannered, always prepared to listen.'' </P>
<P> Despite his unsurpassed electoral record, Wilson's legacy is mixed. Many regard him as a good manager and supreme political ``fixer'' rather than a great statesman. </P>
<P> ``I think he will stand in history as not one of the greatest of prime ministers but as a very good member of the second group who certainly had his impact on British politics,'' said Roy Jenkins, an ex-Labor minister. </P>
<P> The need for a firm hand to weld Labor's disparate coalition of social democrats, trade unionists and hard-line leftists into a winning political machine after 13 years in opposition earned Wilson the reputation as a wily plotter. </P>
<P> Others remembered Wilson, a plump pipe-smoker who never lost the broad accent of his native Yorkshire, for his courtesy and wit. </P>
<P> ``His huge abilities and his humor won him respect and affection. His victories brought him the gratitude and admiration of the Labor movement,'' former Labor leader Neil Kinnock, said. </P>
<P> Present leader Tony Blair, who was too young to vote when Wilson first became prime minister in 1964, said his death ``brings to an end a life of extraordinary service both to the country and to the Labor Party. He was a very warm man and a very decent man, utterly lacking in pomposity.'' </P>
<P> Blair said Wilson, when he took power in 1964, was to politics what the Beatles were to popular culture. </P>
<P> ``It was a new era in which the British people were looking forward in a spirit of hope and optimism. He personified this new era,'' Blair told parliament. </P>
<P> Born in March 1916, James Harold Wilson was elected to parliament in 1945 and at 31 became the youngest cabinet minister since the 18th century. </P>
<P> He won the Labor leadership in 1963 after Hugh Gaitskell died and the next year led the party to a narrow victory, becomeing prime minister at the age of 48. He immediately captured the public mood with a promise to forge Britain in the ``white heat of technological revolution.'' </P>
<P> He called another election in 1966, which he won by a handsome majority, but a 14 percent devaluation of the pound in 1967 dented his popularity and he lost power in 1970 to Edward Heath's Conservatives. </P>
<P> Wilson regained office in February 1974 and called another election just eight months later that gave him an overall majority of just three seats. </P>
