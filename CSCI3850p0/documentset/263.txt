<P>  The world's three greatest tenors Saturday performed a reunion concert organizers claimed would be the most watched musical event in history. </P>
<P> Event producer Tibor Rudas said the concert would be seen live by 56,000 people at Dodger Stadium and on television by an estimated audience of more than one billion in 70 countries. </P>
<P> Luciano Pavarotti, Placido Domingo and Jose Carreras prepared a spectacular encore to their historic ``Three Tenors'' concert four years ago in Rome, coinciding again with the World Cup. </P>
<P> With a 500-foot backdrop simulating a tropical rain forest setting behind their elaborate stage, flanked by 20 Roman columns, Indian-born maestro Zubin Mehta, conducting as he had in Rome, led the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and the 60-member Los Angeles Music Center Opera Chorus through Leonard Bernstein's Overture from ``Candide'' to open the night. </P>
<P> Beginning with Carreras and followed by Domingo and Pavarotti, each tenor was to sing two songs before the trio united for a medley entitled ``A Tribute to Hollywood.'' </P>
<P> After the intermission, they each again were to perform individually twice before capping the extravaganza with another medley, entitled ``Around the World,'' in keeping with the World Cup theme. </P>
<P> Among those who attended were former Presidents and first ladies Ronald and Nancy Reagan and George and Barbara Bush, movie star Arnold Schwarzenegger and wife Maria Shriver and crooner Frank Sinatra. </P>
