<P>  The flow of Cubans from their Communist-ruled homeland to the waters off Florida continued Monday despite the U.S. decision to turn the refugees away. </P>
<P> Coast Guard officials said 2,338 Cubans had been picked up by late evening, most from makeshift, unseaworthy rafts made from inner tubes, styrofoam and wood. </P>
<P> Another 1,293 were rescued Sunday, the highest one-day total since the Mariel Boatlift in 1980 when 125,000 Cubans reached southern Florida over several months. </P>
<P> Including Monday's 1,367, the Coast Guard said it has rescued 7,856 Cubans in August and 12,887 in 1994 to date. </P>
<P> In a typical incident, two brothers picked up over the weekend had spent several days at sea on a raft made of tree limbs lashed to several inner tubes. Without storage for water or food, or any shelter from the tropical sun, the two were dazed and exhausted when the Coast Guard reached them. </P>
<P> Coast Guard officials have said they are concerned about the number of Cubans who die trying to make the 90-mile crossing to Florida. Empty, overturned boats and rafts are a common sight in the Florida Straits. </P>
<P> Brothers to the Rescue, a Cuban-American organization whose planes patrol the air over the Straits looking for rafters, regularly sees signs that Cubans have died at sea.  For example, said spokeswoman Maggie Schuss, pilots last week dropped food and water for several days to four Cubans stranded on a desolate spit of rock in the Cay Sal Bank north of Cuba. But the Cubans disappeared without being rescued. </P>
<P> ``My guess is that in desperation, they may have tried to swim to another rock,'' she said. </P>
<P> On Sunday, Brothers to the Rescue pilots saw more than 300 rafts in the waters between Cuba and Florida, as well as dozens of Cubans swimming, she said. </P>
<P> ``Those flimsy rafts break up, so they swim to whatever they can see,'' she said. ``We are never, never going to know how many actually died.'' </P>
<P> Earlier in the day, Defense Secretary William Perry urged Cubans not to take to the sea. ``It's a very dangerous operation,'' he told a news conference in Key West, Florida. </P>
<P> Since late last week, the United States has changed its policy for Cubans so rafters picked up at sea are taken to the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay on Cuba rather than being released to friends and relatives. </P>
<P> At least 1,187 Cuban rafters picked up by the Coast Guard in recent days were scheduled to arrive at Guantanamo Monday. </P>
<P> More than 500 who made it to Florida were being held at a detention center near Miami. </P>
<P> Perry said 25 ships -- 19 Coast Guard cutters and six Navy ships -- were working on the Cuban rescue effort. He said three more Navy ships were due to arrive in the next 24 to 48 hours. </P>
