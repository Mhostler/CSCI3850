<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A TWA jetliner speeding down the runway on take-off sheared off the top of a small charter plane that apparently strayed into its path, killing two people on board the smaller craft, officials said Wednesday. </P>
<P> Passengers and airport officials credited the TWA pilot, whose name was not immediately released, with quick action that averted a disaster. </P>
<P> Eight of the 137 people on board TWA Flight 427, an MD-80 jet bound to Denver from St. Louis, suffered minor injuries in the accident late Tuesday night at Lambert St. Louis International Airport. </P>
<P> The mishap closed one runway at the airport for most of Thanksgiving eve, one of the busiest travel days of the year, causing delays of up to 40 minutes. But officials were in the process of re-opening the runway Wednesday afternoon. </P>
<P> Both people on board the Cessna Conquest 441 twin-engine turbo prop were killed when the cabin roof was torn off and the plane caught fire. The plane was owned by Superior Aviation, a charter service based in Iron Mountain, Mich. </P>
<P> The dead were identified as Ralph Peterson, 55, the pilot, and his passenger, Donald Hendrickson, 35. Hendrickson's wife works for the charter company, police said, and he was along for the ride on a trip to St. Louis where they had dropped off a customer. </P>
<P> The smaller craft was preparing to return Iron Mountain when the accident occurred. </P>
<P> Airport operations director Leonard Griggs told reporters the charter craft apparently made a wrong turn in the dark as it taxied toward a shorter runway it was supposed to be using that ran more or less parallel to the runway the TWA jet had been assigned. </P>
<P> ``The pilot did a great job,'' Peter Hockett, 39, of Madison, Wis., a passenger on the TWA flight told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. </P>
<P> ``We were getting ready for take-off. The front of the plane had not yet lifted off the runway. There was an impact and the plane veered. It was scary. </P>
<P> ``It was scarier when we stopped and they said fuel was leaking,'' added Hockett who was headed for Denver with his family on a Thanksgiving weekend skiiing holiday. </P>
<P> His daughter Anna, 9, said ``I was really scared ... when the flight attendant yelled 'get off as fast as you can'.'' </P>
<P> The TWA jet suffered some minor damage to its wing, and some landing gear damage from debris on the runway, TWA spokesman John McDonald said. </P>
<P> ``Gasoline was going everywhere,'' added another passenger, Pat Durkan, 35, of Atlanta who was also headed to Colorado to ski. ``Fire trucks came. We went down the chutes. Everybody was shaken up.'' </P>
<P> McDonald said there was an emergency evacuation of the TWA jet, which carried 132 passengers and a crew of five. The FAA in Kansas City said there were eight minor injuries among the passengers, apparently suffered in the evacuation process. </P>
<P> Griggs said ``The TWA airplane was cleared for takeoff, he (the pilot) started his takeoff roll, the light airplane ended up on the runway. </P>
<P> ``The TWA pilot saw it, took immediate evasive action, swerved to the left, and the wing clipped and took the top off the light airplane.'' </P>
<P> In Washington, National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Alan Pollock said according to preliminary information and reports from the five crew members aboard the TWA plane, the airliner had reached a speed of about 100 miles an hour when crew members spotted a small plane on the runway. </P>
<P> Pollock said the NTSB was sending a team of investigators to the scene of the accident to determine its cause. </P>
<P> ``The question is what directions did the air traffic controllers give to both planes and were they aware of the location of all the planes on the airport,'' he said. </P>
<P> He said investigators would review all tapes and conversations between air traffic controllers and the planes. </P>
