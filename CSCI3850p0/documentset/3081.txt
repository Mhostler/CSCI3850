<DATELINE>NEW YORK, Dec. 8 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  San Francisco Giants outfielder Darryl Strawberry and his agent, Eric Goldschmidt, were indicted Thursday for conspiracy to evade paying taxes on more than $500,000 of Strawberry's promotional income, federal prosecutors said. </P>
<P> Mary Jo White, Manhattan U.S. attorney, said the income was from autograph signing shows, personal appearances and product endorsements. </P>
<P> The three-count indictment, brought by a federal grand jury in White Plains, New York, alleges that from 1986 through 1990, Strawbery earned about $945,000 in promotional income. </P>
<P> However he only reported about $442,000 of that income on his tax returns, thereby evading about $146,000 in taxes. </P>
<P> If convicted, the men each face a possible maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine or twice the gross loss of the government, whichever is greater, and the cost of prosecution on each of the three counts. </P>
