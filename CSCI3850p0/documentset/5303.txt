<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Fire erupted in an historic New York City fish market at lunch hour Wednesday, just days after the city's mayor announced he was cracking down on corruption and organized crime there. </P>
<P> Dark smoke billowing from the four-alarm blaze shrouded the nearby Brooklyn Bridge and the South Street Seaport, a popular tourist site adjoining the market, was evacuated as firefighters clogged surrounding streets. </P>
<P> Fire Commissioner Howard Safir said the raging fire, which kept tourists and employees of the Wall Street area gawking for several hours, was brought under control at 2:55 p.m. He said indications were that it began in a locker but fire marshalls had not yet entered the charred building to investigate the cause of the blaze. </P>
<P> One firefighter suffered a minor injury in the fire, which appeared to have started on the second floor of the three-story metal-sided, wood-frame building that dated back to 1834, officials said. Flames shot more than 30 feet into the air and part of the building's roof collapsed. </P>
<P> About 200 firefighters battled the blaze, aiming powerful hoses from an elevated highway overhead. More than half a dozen ladder trucks responded, along with helicopters and fireboats on the East River a block away. </P>
<P> The blaze occurred just two days after New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced a crackdown on corruption at the Fulton Fish Market, which he said has been controlled by organized crime for decades. </P>
<P> Asked if there was a connection between the fire and Giuliani's crackdown, Deputy Mayor John Dyson, who was at the scene, said, ``Obviously, that's what everybody has on their minds, but there's no way to know.'' </P>
<P> The mayor, who sent several of the city's mob ``godfathers'' to prison during his previous career as a federal prosecutor in Manhattan, is seeking broad powers to control who does business with and who works at the fish market. </P>
<P> City Council member Kathryne Freed said it was ``an interesting coincidence'' the fire erupted one day after the council began hearings on Giuliani's request for strict oversight of the market. </P>
<P> ``It proves our point of why this market has to be regulated,'' she said. ``Certainly there is a lot of resistance to the city coming in and regulating the market.'' </P>
<P> Speculation was rife that the fire was set as the scene attracted hundreds of workers from nearby Wall Street offices. </P>
<P> ``With everything that's going on with Giuliani, somebody certainly is going to look toward that link,'' said an employee of M. Slavin & Sons, a fish company housed in the building for 50 years. ``There's enough going here I don't want anyone coming after me,'' he said, refusing to give his name. </P>
<P> Most of the market's employees had gone home by the time the fire started, one worker said. Along the building's street level are open stalls used by seafood wholesalers, who conduct most of their business between 3 a.m. and 9 a.m. </P>
<P> Dyson said the fish business is a $1 billion-a-year industry for the city. While it appeared unlikely companies in the building could reopen Thursday, other vendors in nearby buildings appeared unaffected. </P>
