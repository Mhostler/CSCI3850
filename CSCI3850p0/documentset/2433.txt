<P>  President Clinton said Saturday he did not think a controversial anti-illegal immigration measure on the California ballot was the right way to tackle the problem. </P>
<P> The measure, formally known as Proposition 187, would cut off welfare, education and non-emergency health care to California's estimated 1.6 million illegal immigrants. It will be voted on in California Tuesday. </P>
<P> Clinton, in California to campaign for Democratic candidates in next week's election, was speaking from Los Angeles. </P>
<P> Clinton said he disagreed with Proposition 187 because ''nearly everybody thinks it's unconstitutional'' and because it would be directed primarily against children. </P>
<P> ``If you kick children out of the health clinics, you may run the risk of causing health problems for the general California population. If you say kids have got to be kicked out of schools, you turn the teachers into police officers,'' he said. </P>
<P> He said there were too many children on the streets already, and putting more there was likely to raise the crime rate. </P>
<P> ``So my view is that 187 is not the right way to do this and it could cause California a lot of problems,'' he said. </P>
<P> The latest opinion poll showed supporters of Proposition 187 narrowly outnumber opponents, although support for the measure has been eroding. </P>
<P> Clinton said Californians did have a problem with illegal immigration, and he had been trying to help solve it. </P>
<P> He said his administration had almost doubled the border guard on the California-Mexico border near San Diego and he had asked Congress to appropriate hundreds of millions of dollars to help California deal with the costs of education and health care for illegal immigrants. </P>
<P> Asked about a new Newsweek poll showing Clinton with a low approval rating, the president said he did not pay much attention to opinion polls. </P>
<P> He said the polls were directly related to how much people knew about the record of the administration and ``all the surveys show that over 60 percent of the American people approve of the work of this administration if they know the facts.'' </P>
