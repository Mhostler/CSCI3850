<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The U.S. Postal Service pledged to raise stamp prices in early January, with the price of a first-class stamp likely to jump to 32 cents from 29 cents, the Washington Post reported Wednesday. </P>
<P> The paper said Postal Board Chairman Sam Winters pledged to raise stamp prices ``as early as practical in January,'' ending uncertainty among commercial mailers over whether the price hike might be delayed until later in the month. </P>
<P> The 10.3-percent across-the-board prike hike, which is currently being reviewed by the independent Postal Rate Commission, would give the Postal Service an additional $4.7 billion in revenue. </P>
<P> Spokesmen for the postal service said the rate hike would likely take effect from Jan. 1, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> Once the rate increase is approved by the commission, it must still be approved by the Postal Service's board of governors. </P>
