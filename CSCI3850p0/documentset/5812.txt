<P>  Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority has released dozens more of the suspected Islamic militants it detained after the recent killing of eight Jews in a suicide bombing, a Palestinian official said Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``We released 60 to 70 in the last several days because nothing was proved against them and we found them innocent,'' Prosecutor General Khaled al-Kidra told Reuters. </P>
<P> Arafat vowed to get tough with Muslim militants after the April 9 Gaza bombing by Islamic Jihad. The Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas carried out an attack on the same day, wounding several Israelis. </P>
<P> Palestinian police arrested up to 300 people. Many were released after a brief detention. Kidra said about 150 people were still in custody. </P>
<P> Since the April 9 attacks, five members of the militant Muslim groups have been sentenced to jail terms by a Gaza court and one Islamic Jihad man received life imprisonment. </P>
<P> On Monday, Hamas and PLO officials said their officials were secretly meeting to reach an accord to prevent anti-Israeli attacks. </P>
<P> On Monday night, Arafat adviser Ahmed Tibi and Islamic leader Sheikh Abdallah Nimer Darwish, Arab-Israeli figures who were key mediators in a Hamas-PLO confrontation last November, arrived in Gaza for talks with the PLO chairman. </P>
<P> Tibi told Reuters Tuesday he had met Hamas leader Mahmoud al-Zahhar and then Arafat. </P>
<P> ``I am not going to reveal anything now, but the situation is better than yesterday and the day before that,'' Tibi said. </P>
<P> Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin has said there will be no movement on further stages of the peace deal until Arafat curbs guerrillas. Palestinian suicide bombers have killed scores of Israelis since last April. </P>
