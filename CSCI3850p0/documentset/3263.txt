<P>  A bomb explosion damaged an oil pipeline owned by Turkey's national oil company in the troubled southeast of the country this week, a company official said Friday. </P>
<P> The Wednesday night blast caused $40,000 worth of damage to the pipeline near the refinery town of Batman but there were no injuries, a TPAO oil company official said by telephone from the region. </P>
<P> The pipeline had been repaired after the blast and was fully operational again, he said. </P>
<P> Guerrillas of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) have bombed oil pipelines and installations in Batman province in the past as part of their 10-year-old fight to win an independent homeland in southeast Turkey. More than 13,000 people have died in the conflict. </P>
