<P>  The only son of late president Ferdinand Marcos announced Thursday he would run for the Philippine Senate in next May's elections as an opposition candidate. </P>
<P> Ferdinand Marcos Jr. told reporters he would be a candidate of the Nationalist People's Coalition, whose chief financier is his father's former business ally, Eduardo Cojuangco. </P>
<P> ``We are natural allies with the opposition,'' said the younger Marcos, a member of the House of Representatives. </P>
<P> Ferdinand Jr. followed his father into exile in Hawaii when he was overthrown in a popular revolt in 1986. The elder Marcos died in exile in 1989. His son returned home in 1991. </P>
<P> Marcos is running for one of 12 seats in the 24-member Senate. Some 200 seats in the Lower House and all provincial positions will be contested in the May polls. </P>
