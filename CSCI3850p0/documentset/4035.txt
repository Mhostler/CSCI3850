<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Large contributions to the GOP Action Committee (GOPAC), a political action committee chaired by House Speaker Newt Gingrich, are prompting questions concerning federal election law violations and preferential treatment, the Los Angeles Times reported Sunday. </P>
<P> GOPAC has raised over $7 million during the past five years, and helped play a major role in electing congressional candidates as well as state and local officials, the Times said. </P>
<P> The Times also claims that large contributors to the political fund may be receiving special treatment from Gingrich, the most powerful member of the House. </P>
<P> Gingrich has broken with Republican Party policy on the issue of import quotas and allied himself with GOPAC contributor and textile magnate Roger Miliken, the Times said. </P>
<P> The newspaper added that Gingrich is espousing certain health care policy changes for which major GOPAC contributors have lobbied. </P>
<P> On the subject of campaign contributions, the Times said GOPAC has 172 major donors, and that a total 18 contributors gave more than 100,000 each between 1985 and mid-1993. </P>
<P> Critics claim that those contributions may violate federal law and they worry that most of the sources of the donations are undisclosed. </P>
<P> Gingrich maintains that GOPAC follows campaign laws scrupulously. </P>
<P> GOPAC officials maintain that 90 percent of the PAC's spending supports state and local elections, which are not subject to federal laws. Only 10 percent of the funds are used in federal elections and in 1991 GOPAC agreed to disclose those donations. </P>
<P> Still, GOPAC ``has clearly violated the spirit of laws which govern how much people can give to support politicians,'' Ellen Miller, executive director of the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics, told the Times. </P>
<P> Indeed, a complaint against Gingrich is pending before the House Ethics Committee, and Democrats are calling for two Republican who sit on that committee to disqualify themselves from the Gingrich investigation, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> Moreover, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) has filed a lawsuit against GOPAC contending the group violates federal campaign regulations by not registering as a political committee. </P>
<P> ``There is no loophole,'' Lisa Nelson, GOPAC executive director told the Times, ``We are following every law we have to in filing with the FEC and state levels.'' </P>
<P> But the Times said the amount of GOPAC donations from corporate contributors with issues before the federal government raises further questions about preferential treatment. </P>
<P> The newspaper said the fourth largest donor to GOPAC is Roger Miliken, who heads Georgia-based textile manufacturing firm Miliken and Co. </P>
<P> Miliken was an outspoken opponent of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trades (GATT), and Gingrich has acknowledged that he raised questions on GATT after a meeting with Miliken. Gingrich subsequently voted to approve GATT. </P>
