<P>  Canada launched an unprecedented inquiry Tuesday into an elite airborne regiment which was disbanded for brutal behavior in Somalia that shocked their Canadian compatriots. </P>
<P> The 700-member regiment, a mainstay of U.N. peacekeeping missions, was involved in torturing and beating to death a Somali teen-ager in March 1993. Subsequent publicized videos also showed the paratroopers taking part in sadistic and racist activities. </P>
<P> The government said Tuesday it wanted a broader public inquiry into the Canadian Airborne Unit, which is known for its maroon berets and has its roots in World War II. </P>
<P> ``The terms of reference are broad enough to answer all allegations made concerning the activities of the Airborne Regiment and the actions and decisions taken by all levels of the chain of command and the Department of National Defense,'' Defense Minister David Collenette said. </P>
<P> That could mean going as high as the Conservative defense minister at the time, Kim Campbell, who later became prime minister before losing elections later in 1993. </P>
<P> Campbell told Canadian Broadcasting Corp. that she would welcome the chance to testify. </P>
<P> Nine members of the regiment were charged in the brutal 1993 killing of 16-year-old Shidane Arone in a military compound in Somalia. Four of them have been court-martialed. </P>
<P> For the past several years, the regiment had been involved in several racist and disruptive incidents during peacekeeping missions. </P>
<P> Amateur videos aired by Canadian media in January 1995 showed the regiment in Somalia making racist comments and taking part in bizarre initiation rituals that included eating vomit and feces-covered toilet paper. </P>
<P> The videos shocked Canadians, leading to a high-level military investigation of the unit and its subsequent disbanding. </P>
