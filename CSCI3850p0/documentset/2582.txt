<P>  Breaking his silence of five months, the father of Ronald Goldman, in an interview published Sunday, lashed out at the circus atmosphere surrounding the trial of his son's alleged murderer, football legend O.J. Simpson. </P>
<P> Ronald Goldman, 25, was killed along with Simpson's ex-wife, 35-year-old Nicole Brown Simpson outside Nicole's Brentwood apartment on the night of June 12. They were stabbed and slashed to death. </P>
<P> Simpson, who left the football field and found success as a sportscaster, actor and TV pitchman, has pleaded not guilty to the murders. </P>
<P> Fred Goldman, a businessman, told the Los Angeles Times, ''It's bad enough that we've lost Ron, but to see this murder trial turned into a circus is sad. And it doesn't do the memories of Ron and Nicole justice.'' </P>
<P> If Simpson was guilty, Goldman said, he should be punished. </P>
<P> Goldman also had harsh criticism for Simpson's defense team and objected to its treatment of the case issue - a provocative undercurrent in a case in which the victims are white and the suspect is black. </P>
<P> ``They've called police officers liars, they've called people racists, they've inferred there were plots. All with no proof, done from my point of view clearly to manipulate jurors and public opinion. </P>
<P> ``And it's that which I find really disturbing and borderline immoral,'' the 53-year-old businessman said. </P>
<P> Goldman said he was also outraged at the commercialism surrounding the case. He said when he walked into the court for a preliminary hearing he saw his son's now famous driver's license photo being hawked on trading cards. </P>
<P> ``Imagine having your son murdered and then having your kids go to school and see his picture on a trading card. It's an outrage that people see that as okay, and it amazes me that anyone can imagine for a moment trying to make money off the murder of two people. It's beyond my understanding,'' he said. </P>
<P> A jury of eight blacks and four white was seated recently and the judge and the attorneys are currently picking 15 alternate jurors. </P>
