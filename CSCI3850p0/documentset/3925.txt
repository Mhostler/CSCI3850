<P>  Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien said that the best way to bring down Cuba's communist regime is by trading with the Caribbean island. </P>
<P> ``The presence of foreign capital and the presence of thousands and thousands of visitors will force the system to collapse. It was the same thing when the USSR (the Soviet Union) stopped their isolation, the Berlin wall collapsed,'' Chretien told journalists in Argentina's Casa Rosada presidential palace. </P>
<P> Chretien, on a tour of Caribbean and Latin American countries, said he had discussed Cuba with Argentina's President Carlos Menem. </P>
<P> ``We both agreed that we both want to have democracy in Cuba. We think that the best way to achieve our goals is to have trade relations with them...'' he said. </P>
