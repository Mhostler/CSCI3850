<P>  A group of 26 Cubans accused by Havana of hijacking a government boat and killing one of its crew members was en route to Key West, Florida, Wednesday, the U.S. Coast Guard said. </P>
<P> The 26 had been retrieved by the Coast Guard Tuesday afternoon, but had been held in international waters overnight awaiting clearance from Washington to bring them ashore. </P>
<P> Cuba contacted the Coast Guard to report that a naval vessel had been hijacked and one of its crew members, a Cuban naval officer, killed near the port of Mariel at about 5 p.m. EDT Monday, said David Johnson, a U.S. State Department spokesman in Washington. </P>
<P> In Havana, a Cuban deputy foreign minister, Jorge Bolanos, had told reporters earlier Tuesday that the ministry could neither confirm nor deny the reported hijacking. </P>
<P> Quoting the commander of the Monhegan, the cutter that intercepted the Cuban boat, the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel reported Wednesday that the officer reported dead was actually the hijacker. </P>
<P> Johnson also said he was aware of reports, which he could not confirm, that some crew members on the vessel had been thrown overboard. </P>
<P> In Miami, Coast Guard officials said the vessel was intercepted at about 4:15 p.m. EDT Tuesday south of Florida. </P>
<P> The reported hijacking would be the fourth of a Cuban vessel within the past two weeks. News of the first three hijackings contributed to a rare disturbance in the port area of Havana Friday. </P>
<P> Cuban President Fidel Castro has blamed the United States for the disturbance and has threatened to unleash another flood of Cuban refugees on U.S. shores in retaliation. </P>
<P> In the 1980 Cuban refugee exodus known as the Mariel boatlift, 125,000 Cubans arrived in southern Florida within a matter of months, taking authorities by surprise and overwhelming the region's social support network. </P>
<P> Under U.S. law, Cubans fleeing their country are eligible to apply for permanent resident status after living in the United States for one year. </P>
<P> A Coast Guard spokesman said the U.S. service had picked up 116 Cubans in the waters between the Caribbean nation and Florida on Tuesday. </P>
<P> That number brought to 5,270 the number of Cuban boat people picked up by the U.S. Coast Guard so far in 1994, far exceeding the total of 3,656 picked up in 1993. The 1993 total was the highest since Mariel. </P>
