<P>  Three-time Tour de France champion Greg LeMond announced his retirement from competitive cycle racing Saturday, saying he has been diagnosed with a rare energy-robbing muscule disorder. </P>
<P> ``Throughout my career I have had some obstacles to overcome, but I'm now confronting one that I'm not able to surmount,'' LeMond said at a news conference prior to a fund-raising event for the United States Cycling Federation where he will be honored. </P>
<P> ``I have been diagnosed with a muscular disorder called mitochondrial myopathy,'' said LeMond. </P>
<P> ``This condition does not allow me to perform at the level I must to remain cycling, therefore I must announce my retirement from cycling.'' </P>
<P> The 33-year-old LeMond, who was flanked by his wife and appeared to be in good spirits during his statements, is the only American ever to win the Tour de France. </P>
<P> He won the world's most prestigious cycling race in 1986, 1989 and 1990 -- the last two after making a remarkable comeback from being shot in a hunting accident in 1987. LeMond also won road racing world championships in 1983 and 1989. </P>
<P> Earlier this year, LeMond had talked about training for the 1996 Olympics and said Saturday he was disappointed to call an end to his 18-year competitive career. But he said he was also relieved to find a cause for his recent dropoff in performance. </P>
<P> Doctors, who were at a loss to explain LeMond's lack of energy despite an increasingly rigorous training regimen, discovered the condition after performing a biopsy on a sample of the racer's muscle tissue. </P>
<P> LeMond said doctors are now investigating a possible link between his condition and some 40 lead shotgun pellets still in his liver, lung and near his heart as the result the hunting accident. </P>
<P> ``It is clearly one of the things we are most concerned about because if that is the cause, the treatment is removal of the pellets,'' said his physician, Dr Rochelle Taube. </P>
<P> Taube said mitochondrial myopathy is very rare, affecting mostly children. She said that while it can be a degenerative disease in older patients, they usually are afflicted with other ailments, which is clearly not the case with LeMond. </P>
<P> ``In each case it can be different,'' Taube said. ``We don't know what's going to happen with Greg, but we don't expect it to be degenerative.'' </P>
<P> She said there was no known cure and no known treatment for the disease, which was discovered in the mid-1970s through the use of electron microscopy. </P>
<P> LeMond did have some bitter comments reserved for corporate sponsors who he felt abandoned him when his performance began to slip. </P>
<P> ``It's business,'' he said. ``They see the opportunity to save money. They see you're not worth anything to them anymore and you're out.'' </P>
<P> LeMond, credited for the rise in popularity of cycling in the United States over the last decade, said he feels physically fit and plans to ski and fly fish while mulling his options. </P>
<P> He said he might like to coach a road racing or mountain bike racing team. </P>
<P> ``I don't want people to pity me like I'm going to be in a wheelchair three weeks from now,'' he said, smiling. </P>
<P> ``I still have some health.'' </P>
