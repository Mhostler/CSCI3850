<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Senate voted Friday to shift $350 million from the U.S. contribution to U.N. peackeeping operations to reimburse states for the cost of jailing illegal aliens. </P>
<P> The Senate approved the shift 52-44. It was the latest show of congressional discontent with U.S. involvement in U.N. peacekeeping operations as well as support for reimbursing states' illegal alien costs. </P>
<P> But the shift would have to also be approved by the House of Representatives and by President Clinton to become law. </P>
<P> Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Texas Republican and a chief sponsor of the proposal, told the Senate she could not precisely understand the need for supporting U.N. peacekeeping operations. </P>
<P> ``I don't understand what the U.S. mission is in some of these operations,'' she said. She noted that a former Texan, retired Lieutenant Colonel Larry Joyce, has said publicly that his son, Sergeant Casey Joyce, died for nothing in the October 3 battle in Somalia last year that killed 18 Americans. </P>
<P> But she said understands the need of border states like her own for federal reimbursement of the costs of jailing illegal aliens that the federal government is failing to keep out. </P>
<P> California, Florida and Arizona have sued the federal government for reimbursement of their costs of arresting and jailing illegal aliens from Mexico and other countries. Texas plans to sue also. </P>
<P> The Senate voted to shift the $350 million out of a $2.1 billion U.S. payment of its share of the cost of U.N. peacekeeping operations. </P>
<P> That included $1.2 billion for the current U.S. share and $947 million for payments on which it is behind. </P>
<P> The money is in a $28 billion appropriation bill for the departments of State, Justice and Commerce. </P>
