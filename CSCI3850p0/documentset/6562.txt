<DATELINE>TOKYO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Japan told a senior Iranian official Monday it was still undecided about giving Tehran new development loans that have been held up by U.S. pressure on Tokyo to withold the money because of terrorism allegations. </P>
<P> Japanese officials said the message was delivered during a meeting in Tokyo between Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Alaeddin Borujerdi and Deputy Foreign Minister Hiroshi Fukuda. </P>
<P> The officials said Borujerdi asked Tokyo to decide the matter as quickly as possible and also called for increased economic ties between the two nations. </P>
<P> Japan ended a 17-year freeze on loans in 1993 when it gave Tehran $465 million as the first allotment of a $1.8 billion aid package. </P>
<P> The yen loan is for the construction of a dam and hydro-electric power station on the Karun River. </P>
<P> Some Japanese media reports have estimated that the delayed second allotment would amount to $554 million. </P>
<P> Washington has repeatedly asked Tokyo to be cautious about lending to Iran, a state it accuses of sponsoring terrorism. </P>
<P> Last week, even more pressure came to bear on Japan when the United States asked Tokyo to join Washington's ban prohibiting U.S. companies from trading and investing in Iran. </P>
<P> Tokyo only offered a guarded response saying that it will study the request. </P>
<P> Japanese officials have said they wish to encourage moderate groups in Iran, so that they have more influence. </P>
<P> The officials do not believe isolating Iran is the best solution, indicating the reluctance within the Japanese Foreign Ministry to join the U.S. ban against Iran. </P>
<P> Fukuda called on Iran to improve ties with the United States and the Iranian minister replied that Tehran had never closed the doors on possible resumption of relations with Washington. </P>
<P> Borujerdi insisted Iran did not support ``any kind of terrorism,''' the officials said. </P>
<P> Fukuda called on Iran to dispel such concern ``by specific words and action.'' </P>
<P> Borujerdi also denied reports that Iran planned to build 10 nuclear power plants in the next 20 years, the Japanese officials said. </P>
