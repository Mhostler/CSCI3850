<P>  Iraq said Friday a division of its elite Republican Guards was still in the same place it had been since 1991 and accused the United States of trying to escalate tension. </P>
<P> The Iraqi News Agency (INA) quoted an official source as saying: ``One division of the Republican Guards has been present since 1991 in a camp close to Nasiriya city which is 125 miles north of the demilitarized zone between Iraq and Kuwait.'' </P>
<P> It said the source was reacting to statements by U.S. defense officials that one Iraqi division pulling back from the border had stopped about 100 miles northwest of the frontier and tanks had dug defensive battle positions. </P>
<P> ``The U.S. administration intentionally mixes up geographical information to continue escalating the tension,'' INA said. </P>
<P> The United States has proposed barring elite Republican Guards and their armor from entering a ``no drive'' zone south of the 32nd parallel which runs about 135 miles north of Kuwait. </P>
<P> The 32nd parallel delimits a no-fly zone imposed by Western powers to curb Iraqi air power after the 1991 Gulf War and a subsequent uprising against Baghdad by Shiite civilians. </P>
<P> Defense Secretary William Perry flew to Kuwait Friday and threatened Iraq with military action if its armor remained in the south of the country. </P>
<P> The United States says the Iraqi units are 45 miles south of the 32nd parallel. </P>
