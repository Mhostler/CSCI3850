<P> The defense officials, who asked not to be identified, said Francois would meet with U.S. Army Brigadier General Richard Potter, one of the American commanders in Haiti, and Colonel Michael Sullivan, commander of U.S. military police in Haiti. </P>
<P> Although Francois and Haiti's other two military junta leaders did not sign the agreement, the meeting was seen as another sign that they were cooperating with U.S. demands made on Wednesday that Haitian police stop using unnecessary violence to quell demonstations by crowds in Port-au-Prince. </P>
<P> Francois, a feared and shadowy figure, has been one of the most powerful men in Haiti. The other two leaders of the junta are Army Lieutenant General Raoul Cedras and Brigadier General Philippe Biamby. </P>
