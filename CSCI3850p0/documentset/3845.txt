<DATELINE>JAMMU, India (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Up to 110 people are believed dead in avalanches and landslides that roared down Himalayan mountainsides along the Srinagar-Jammu Highway, police said Thursday. </P>
<P> Police said as many as five buses had plunged off the 110-mile highway that winds through the foothills of the Himalayas since heavy snowfalls hit the area three days ago. The United News of India news agency said 65 bodies had been recovered from the area since the avalanches began and many more were thought to be buried in the snow. </P>
<P> The Press Trust of India said 4,500 people had been rescued from vehicles stranded along the highway and Indian Air Force helicopters have dropped food and blankets for travelers who remain stranded. The news agency said fresh snowfalls had hampered repair work at some points along the highway, which snakes through precipitous passes, providing the isolated Kashmir Valley with its only road link to the rest of India. </P>
