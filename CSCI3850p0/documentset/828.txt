<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A Turkish Cypriot farmer plowing his field, uncovered the entrance to what experts believe is a royal tomb dating back to 600 B.C., an antiquities official said Wednesday. </P>
<P> The find Tuesday was the 11th cave tomb found so far in the so-called ``Kings' Tombs site'' near the historic St. Barnabas monastery in the Salamis ruins of Famagusta, assistant director of antiquities, Tuncer Bagiskan said. </P>
<P> The region is in the Turkish-Cypriot north, separated from the Greek Cypriot south since 1974 when Turkey occupied the area after a Greek Cypriot coup in Nicosia backed by the military junta then ruling Greece. </P>
<P> Amphoras, earthen pots, cups, a broken knife, fossilized eggs and a skeleton believed to be that of the horse of the personage buried in the tomb were found in the ante-chamber which was opened, Bagiskan said.. </P>
<P> He said when the burial chamber itself was opened later, it was likely that more artefacts of the nobleman believed buried inside would be found. </P>
<P> According to ancient beliefs of resurrection, the dead must find food and their favorite belongings when they return to a new life, he said. </P>
<P> The artefacts were taken to a museum but the skeleton was not disturbed. </P>
