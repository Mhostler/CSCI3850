<P>  Michael Huffington, narrowly trailing Dianne Feinstein in the polls in a bid for her Senate seat, announced his support Thursday for a California ballot measure that would cut off most public services to illegal immigrants. </P>
<P> With polls showing the ``Save Our State'' proposal favored 2 to 1 by voters, Huffington -- a first-term Republican congressman who has poured $17 million into his campaign -- said ``it's time to send a message to those illegal immigrants who disregard our laws.'' </P>
<P> ``Equally important, it is high time we send a message to Washington,'' the transplanted Texas oil millionaire told supporters. ``The taxpayers of California are sick and tired of paying for Washington's federally imposed mandates while Washington ignores the federal responsibility at the border.'' </P>
<P> Feinstein, who was once considered all but unbeatable but now leads by only seven points in the polls, has yet to take a stand on the measure, officially known as Proposition 187. The race has already become the most expensive in congressional history, with total spending topping $27 million. </P>
<P> Huffington's announcement puts him in the same camp as fellow Republican, Gov. Pete Wilson, who has made immigration the cornerstone of his re-election campaign and rebounded to lead in the polls against state Treasurer Kathleen Brown. </P>
<P> But two leading Republicans, former education secretary William Bennett and former housing secretary Jack Kemp, have issued a statement calling the measure ``politically unwise.'' </P>
<P> Proposition 187 would bar undocumented residents from public schools, non-emergency medical services and welfare rolls. It would also call on teachers, doctors and police to act as ''snitches'' and report those suspected of being illegal. </P>
<P> A coalition of opponents -- made up of civil rights activists, union leaders and law-enforcement officials -- accuse sponsors of immigrant-bashing and vow to tie the measure up in the courts for years if it passes. </P>
