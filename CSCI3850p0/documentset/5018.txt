<P>  President Clinton has snubbed Britain by turning down an invitation to its VE Day celebrations while agreeing to go to Russia's, The Times newspaper reported Monday. </P>
<P> It said Clinton surprised British Prime Minister John Major with the news during a 25-minute phone call Sunday. </P>
<P> The call was meant to sweeten relations that had turned sour after Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA's political wing Sinn Fein, was invited to the White House despite British protests. </P>
<P> Major's office declined to comment on the report. </P>
<P> ``The two leaders did touch briefly on VE Day in their conversation but agreed that announcements would be made in due course. We have nothing more to say,'' a spokesman said. </P>
<P> Vice-President Al Gore will represent Clinton in London, The Times said. Clinton would not go to Paris's festivities either. </P>
<P> Many of the anniversaries to mark half a century since events in World War II have turned into present-day political headaches with snubs, protests and boycotts showing that many old wounds are far from healed. </P>
<P> Major is to visit Washington on April 4. </P>
<P> The Times called the U.S. decision a snub which would plunge strained Anglo-American relations to a new low. But it said British and U.S. officials privately insisted it should not be seen as a slight, as it was a result of logistical problems. </P>
