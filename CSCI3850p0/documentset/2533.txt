<P>  Mediators seeking to head off violence over next month's inauguration of a ruling-party governor in the troubled southern state of Chiapas said Thursday they would step up their efforts for peace. </P>
<P> Government-appointed Peace Commissioner Jorge Madrazo and Roman Catholic Bishop Samuel Ruiz said in a statement that the delicate political situation in the southeastern state calls for an end to the smoldering conflict ``as soon as possible''. </P>
<P> Self-styled Zapatista guerrillas in Chiapas have threatened to resurrect their military campaign if ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) governor-elect Eduardo Robledo takes office Dec. 8. </P>
<P> Rumors circulated on the Mexican Stock Exchange Thursday about possible further attacks by the rebels in Chiapas, compounding a sharp loss caused mainly by selling of telecommunications giant Telmex. </P>
<P> There were no reports of more incidents in Chiapas, however. </P>
<P> Mexico's electoral authorities say Robledo won the state cleanly in Aug. 21 gubernatorial elections with just over 50 percent of the vote, but the Zapatistas have alleged widespread fraud. Robledo has vowed to take office on Dec 8. </P>
<P> The statement followed a meeting Wednesday between Madrazo and Ruiz in which they pledged to take immediate steps to improve the political climate in the state through further dialogue. </P>
