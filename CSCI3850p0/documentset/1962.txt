<P>  The National Taxpayers Union announced Wednesday it was filing an ethics charge against House Speaker Thomas Foley because he failed to enforce a rarely used law that docks the pay of members of Congress if they are absent. </P>
<P> Bruce Fein, a lawyer for the taxpayers union, said the law has been enforced only a few times since it was originally passed in 1856, most recently in 1914. </P>
<P> The group said it is time for a change and that Foley, a Washington Democrat facing a tough re-election fight in Spokane, must explain why he has not enforced the law. </P>
<P> ``I think Mr. Foley has a lot to answer for,'' David Keating, executive vice president of the taxpayers union, said at a news conference. </P>
<P> However the law puts the onus, not on the speaker, but on the sergeant of arms, who is elected by the full House, a congressional aide familiar with the law said. </P>
<P></P>
<P> ``The Secretary of the Senate and Sergeant at Arms of the House ... shall deduct from the monthly payments (or other periodic payments authorized by law) of each member or delegate the amount of his salary for each day that he has been absent from the Senate or House'' except for illness. </P>
<P> The taxpayers union contends the speaker is responsible because he must certify the salary accounts of the members. </P>
<P> But a congressional aide said those accounts are not tied to specific amounts of money or performance of duty, and merely show who is in Congress. </P>
<P> Keating said Foley himself is not guilty of absenteeism, but has failed to reduce the pay of those who were absent. </P>
<P> The complaint cites high absentee rates of three members, Texas Democrat Craig Washington, who was defeated in a primary, and two gubernatorial candidates, Kansas Democrat Jim Slattery and Indiana Republican Fred Grandy. </P>
<P> Foley was en route to his district to campaign and not available for comment. </P>
