<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Secretary of State Warren Christopher on Sunday accused incoming Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole of pursuing a war strategy in Bosnia. </P>
<P> ``I'm a long ways away to start an argument with a new majority leader,'' Christopher said in a television hookup from Budapest. But he swiftly added: ``I must say his (Dole's) three-point program is one which I profoundly disagree with.'' </P>
<P> Dole has called for a full withdrawal of United Nations peacekeepers, arming of the Bosnian Muslims and the bombing of Serb military positions in the former Yugoslav republic. </P>
<P> ``Essentially it's a war strategy,'' Christopher said on ABC television's ``This Week with David Brinkley'' show. ``I think we should be engaged here in a peace strategy, not a war strategy.'' </P>
<P> Christopher spoke from Hungary, site of a two-day summit of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. Bosnia is expected to dominate the summit, which opens Monday. </P>
<P> On Sunday, the United States said it had failed to make any headway with the Bosnian Serbs in weekend talks, while senior British and French officials launched a last-ditch diplomatic drive in Belgrade to end the war in Bosnia. Such diplomatic efforts, said Christopher, are the best option. </P>
<P> ``We're going to be pursuing that, using all the ways we can to try to negotiate a peaceful settlement,'' he said. ``Our first aim here is to prevent the spread of the war.'' </P>
<P> He said Dole's strategy could pull U.S. forces into a costly ground war in the Balkans, adding: ``I do not think American interests are sufficiently engaged in Bosnia in order for us to go to war over it.'' </P>
<P> But Dole, speaking on the same program, said the world was buckling before the Serbs and urged swift military action. </P>
<P> ``Everyone's in full retreat now ... trying to accommodate the Serbs,'' said the Kansas Republican, who takes over as Senate Majority Leader next year. </P>
<P> He said the current drive for a diplomatic solution was tantomount to appeasement, asking: ``Peace at what price?'' </P>
