<DATELINE>DRONKA, Egypt (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak flew Friday to disaster areas in southern Egypt, where floods and blazing fuel from a storage depot killed more than 500 people Wednesday. </P>
<P> He met local officials in the city of Assiut and then headed to the stricken village of Dronka, where local people are accusing the authorities of negligence at the fuel depot and delays in providing relief. </P>
<P> Presidential security sealed the village off and no reporters were allowed in after his arrival in Assiut. </P>
<P> Prime Minister Atef Sedki and five ministers visited the area Thursday but villagers complained early Friday that they had still not seen the compensation which he promised. </P>
<P> ``Nothing has come, just some blankets which arrived yesterday,'' said Mohamed Hussein, a salesman who lives in Dronka, 200 miles south of Cairo. </P>
<P> Two hundred displaced people spent the night in a tented encampment set up by the army but thousands of others slept in the street or with friends and relatives. </P>
<P> The government has played down the death toll and says it has done everything possible to help the victims. </P>
<P> Maj. Gen. Kamal Mandour, a civil defense officer from Cairo, told reporters in Dronka Friday that 260 people died in the fuel depot fire and the floods in the village. </P>
<P> But villagers disputed the figure. ``That's not true. Five thousand people died in Dronka,'' said Mohamed Ahmed, a farmer. </P>
<P> ``It's not true, not true,'' echoed other villagers. </P>
<P> Hospitals in the Assiut area say they have received more than 320 corpses from the village, where floods Wednesday morning overturned tanker wagons full of fuel which then ignited. A river of fire destroyed about 200 houses. </P>
<P> Mandour said the death toll might yet rise as rescuers search the devastated part of the village house by house. </P>
<P> Other corpses have not reached the hospitals and about 80 people have been killed in flash floods in other parts of southern Egypt, local officials said. </P>
<P> The latest discoveries in Dronka included 21 corpses from a mosque where they had tried to take shelter and a whole family of 15 which suffocated after climbing up to the fifth floor of the building next to their house. </P>
<P> Villagers buried 45 dead in a mass grave Thursday evening and Friday dozens of women in black sat against the cemetery wall weeping and wailing for their relatives. </P>
<P> At noon prayers across the country, congregations said special prayers for the victims of the disaster. </P>
<P> Local members of parliament said they were certain the death toll was more than 500 and local security sources have given successive figures which add up to 524. </P>
<P> The land around Dronka now looks like a World War I battleground, with blackened trees sticking out of a sea of mud. </P>
<P> One pool of fuel caught fire Friday morning as workers nearby went from house to house looking for bodies. </P>
<P> Flames leaped 30 feet into the air and it took 15 minutes to put the fire out with foam extinguishers. </P>
<P> One group of workers waded through pools of mud looking for the body of a seven-year-old girl believed to have drowned. </P>
<P> An elderly man, Abdelshafi Shaaban, arrived with a piece of burned human flesh wrapped in cloth and said it was all he could recover from the body of one of his grandsons. </P>
<P> He put it silently in the back of an ambulance and then told reporters he had lost his wife, his children and his grandchildren in the disaster. </P>
<P> In Cairo the opposition newspaper al-Wafd criticised the government for portraying the disaster as an act of God. </P>
<P> ``It is nonsense to blame fate for our own shortcomings and negligence,'' it said in a front-page editorial. </P>
<P> ``The state has a duty to prepare to deal with these natural disasters at any time and in any place,'' it added. </P>
<P> Military sources said two Saudi planes had arrived at an airbase outside Cairo with relief supplies for the people displaced by the fire and the floods. </P>
<P> Two Egyptian air force planes were flying to Assiut on Friday with food and blankets for them. </P>
