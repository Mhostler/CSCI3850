<P>  The Philippines has only slender power reserves as its summer gets under way and the private sector was urged on Tuesday to use its own generators to ease the load. </P>
<P> Raul Concepcion, head of a private-sector task force on power supply, said in a statement that private companies should use their own generators at peak periods. </P>
<P> ``Our power reserve today is very thin with barely 77 megawatts,'' he said in a statement. ``It appears that the month of April will be crucial.'' </P>
<P> Supplies will be affected because several power stations are due for maintenance, he said. </P>
<P> The Philippines has only just recovered in the past two years from a crippling power shortage that, at its worst, led to blackouts for up to 10 hours a day. </P>
