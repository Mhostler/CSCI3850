<P>  North Korea's official press predicted Sunday that the Korean peninsula would be reunified before the end of the century into a confederation consisting of separate governments. </P>
<P> ``Our people ... will certainly reunify the country in the 1990s, surmounting the difficulties and obstacles lying in the way of reunification,'' the newspapers Rodong Sinmun, Rodong Chongnyon and the military daily Josoninmingun said in a joint New Year editorial. </P>
<P> Reunification has long been a priority for the North, which started the Korean War in 1950 when it invaded the U.S.-backed Republic of Korea in an attempt to reunite the divided peninsula by force. </P>
<P> The editorial, run on the Korean Central News Agency and monitored in Tokyo, stated that reunification should be carried out according to a ``confederation formula'' based on one nation, one state, two systems and two governments. </P>
<P> ``All the Koreans in the north, the south and overseas must firmly unite and turn out as one in the struggle to build a pan-national unified state, a confederal state,'' it said. </P>
