<P>  A man dependent on a ventilator because of a degenerative muscle disease almost died when a utility company shut off electrical power to his home for being $8,000 in arrears, his doctor said Wednesday. </P>
<P> Artemus Johnson, 28, has been bedridden for two years with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy and needs a ventilator to breathe, his physician, Dr. Douglas Onorato, said. </P>
<P> ``It is a progressive, genetic disorder,'' Onorato said. ''His respiratory muscles are unable to raise his rib cage to get air into his lungs, so without a mechanical ventilator, Artemus can't breathe at all. Without breathing, you die.'' </P>
<P> The Connecticut Light & Power Co. cut off electricity to Johnson's home Tuesday morning. It was restored about 6 p.m., said a spokesman for Northeast Utilities, the parent company. </P>
<P> The spokesman said such shutoffs normally do not occur if a doctor informs the company by letter of a resident's illness and if reasonable efforts are made to pay the electric bill. </P>
<P> Johnson's cousin, Wayne Johnson, was present when power was shut off and when his cousin began choking he turned to the manual pump. But no matter how hard he squeezed, Johnson was unable to breathe. </P>
<P> ``He was scared,'' said Wayne Johnson. ``He kept saying the ambulance ain't coming fast enough. I was afraid for him because he started crying. He was blacking out.'' </P>
<P> Paramedics were able to stabilize Johnson when they arrived and he was taken to Hartford Hospital. Onorato said he returned home Tuesday night. He added that the electricity bill was probably unusually high because Johnson uses several electrical devices in addition to the ventilator. </P>
<P> Johnson's sister, Karen Johnson, said she had made arrangements with Northeast Utilities to begin paying them $100 a month. </P>
