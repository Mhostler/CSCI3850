<P>  New studies show vitamin C may help protect against emphysema and chronic bronchitis and vitamin E from foods may protect adults from asthma, the American Lung Association said Thursday. </P>
<P> It said the first study involved 2,633 adults in Nottingham, England, and confirmed and extended the findings of previous studies that suggested lung function or symptoms may be related to eating foods rich in vitamin C. </P>
<P> In the second study released Thursday, researchers at Harvard used information from 77,866 women to evaluate the link between diet and the incidence of asthma over a 10-year period. </P>
<P> ``It's still too early to make recommendations, except for a general recommendation that eating fresh fruits and vegetables, which are important sources of vitamin C and E, would clearly be beneficial,'' said Dr. Scott Weiss, a co-author of both studies. </P>
<P> They appear in the May issue of the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, which is published by the American Lung Association. The association says at least 14.2 million Americans are estimated to suffer from chronic pulmonary disease, the fourth-ranking cause of death. An estimated 11.7 million Americans suffer from asthma. </P>
<P> ``The most important thing you can do to prevent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is not to smoke,'' said Dr. Weiss, associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. ``But there may be some residual benefit from making sure you have an adequate intake of fresh fruit and vegetables.'' </P>
<P> In the Nottingham study, researchers found the average protective effect of both vitamins was greater in current and former smokers than in people who had never smoked, but the effect was not statistically significant. About half of those who took part had never smoked. </P>
<P> The second study showed it is possible that antioxidant vitamins may decrease airway inflammation and thereby decrease the severity of asthma or prevent asthma symptoms altogether. </P>
