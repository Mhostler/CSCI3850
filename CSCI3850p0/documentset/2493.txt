<P>  George W. Bush, eldest son of former President Bush, borrowed on his famous name and the lessons of his father's 1992 presidential defeat to unseat Texas' most popular governor in decades. </P>
<P> Overcoming detractors' claims that only his lineage made him a serious candidate, the Republican Bush, 48, swept Democratic Gov. Ann Richards from office Tuesday. </P>
<P> Bush became only the second Republican to be elected Texas governor since Reconstruction. </P>
<P> His younger brother, Jeb Bush, 41, lost in a tight Florida gubernatorial race with Democratic Gov. Lawton Chiles. </P>
<P> George W. Bush's triumph came a year to the day after he declared his candidacy and acknowledged he faced a ``very formidable'' challenge against the popular Richards. </P>
<P> The governor-elect has never held elective office, losing a 1978 congressional bid in Texas. </P>
<P> Although trailing Richards in early pre-election polls, he benefited from high name recognition because of his father -- an adopted Texan widely admired in the state -- and his role as a managing general partner of the Texas Rangers baseball club. </P>
<P> His relationship to the former president helped Bush fund an aggressive campaign and deterred serious challengers in last spring's GOP primary. </P>
<P> Bush voiced pride in his father, who along with his wife, popular former first lady Barbara Bush, campaigned for their two candidate sons. </P>
<P> But George W. was careful not to repeat the mistakes that sank his father's one-term presidency, such as the former president's broken ``read my lips'' pledge never to raise taxes. </P>
<P> ``That's why I'm not going to make political promises that I can't fulfill,'' Bush told ABC's ``Prime Time Live'' last week. </P>
<P> Bush also resisted personal attacks on Richards, despite her famous barb at the 1988 Democratic National Convention that his father, then a presidential candidate, was ``born with a silver foot in his mouth.'' </P>
<P> He focused instead on Richards' alleged policy failings, turning the other cheek as she attacked his business record, nicknamed him ``Shrub'' and referred to him once indirectly as ''a jerk.'' </P>
<P> Closely resembling his father in looks and mannerisms, Bush also followed in many of the former president's paths. </P>
<P> Born July 6, 1946 in New Haven, Conn., Bush was raised in Midland, Texas. He graduated from his father's alma mater, Yale University, before receiving a masters in business administration from Harvard University. </P>
<P> Like his father, he founded an oil company, Bush Exploration Co., which was later merged into Harken Energy Co. In 1989, Bush assembled an investor group that bought the Texas Rangers. </P>
<P> Bush also shares his father's moderate conservatism. He stressed the crime issue and personal responsibility. </P>
<P> He and his wife Laura live in Dallas with their 12-year-old twin daughters. </P>
