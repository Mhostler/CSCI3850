<P>  Five convicted murderers remained at large Thursday, three days after escaping from a high-security prison by digging a tunnel from the facility's chapel, prison officials said. </P>
<P> The men, immigrants from Cuba, were serving life prison terms for first-degree murder with no possibility of parole for 25 years. They are considered extremely dangerous. </P>
<P> A spokeswoman for the Glades Correctional Institute in southeast Florida said none of the five has been caught. A manhunt for the escapees began moments after the convicts cleared prison walls Monday evening, authorities said. </P>
<P> Six inmates originally fled Glades through a 25-foot tunnel around 6:15 p.m. EST, but one was captured immediately, officials said. </P>
<P> Their escape has brought fear to residents of this farming community of fewer than 20,000 people west of Palm Beach. Many said they were locking their doors and windows and keeping children close to home. </P>
<P> Police had hoped Wednesday afternoon that a Latin American driver picked up on a nearby highway was one of the prisoners. But the lead turned out to be false. The discovery of a piece of one convict's uniform also failed to yield a capture. </P>
