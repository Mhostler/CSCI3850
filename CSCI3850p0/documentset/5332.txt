<P>  Sudan's Islamic leaders rolled out the red carpet Thursday for Muslim fundamentalists from around the world as they launched a four-day conference aimed at rallying Muslims against perceived Western domination. </P>
<P> Delegates from over 80 countries, crammed into Khartoum's Friendship Hall, condemned Arab normalization of ties with Israel, attacked the United Nations as a Western tool and called on Muslims to heal their divisions. </P>
<P> Hassan al-Tourabi, believed to be the power behind Sudan's Islamic-backed military government, accused the West of trying to wipe out Muslim independence. </P>
<P> ``Islamists have no right to existence...only one culture is acceptable (to the West),'' Tourabi told the opening session of the third Popular Arab and Islamic Conference. </P>
<P> ``Fundamentalist Islam...political Islam...extremist Islam and terrorist Islam...should, some Westerners think, be provoked into conflicts,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``The international mechanism that is called the United Nations now functions incorrectly, and has become a weapon against Muslim countries,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``Our enemies think they will be able to annihilate Islam... but no people can eliminate the light of the sun,'' Mustafa Mashhour, deputy guide of Egypt's fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood, told the meeting on the banks of the Blue Nile. </P>
<P> Palestinian opponents of Yasser Arafat's peace deal with Israel rubbed shoulders with Brotherhood members inside the hall, as well as officials and religious movements from Iran, Bosnia, Chechnya and Algeria. </P>
<P> But few seemed to have sent high-level delegations and conference hosts declined to specify just who was present. </P>
<P> The first conference in 1991 was attended by the fiery Egyptian Sheikh Omar Abdul-Rahman, accused of involvement in the New York World Trade Center bombing. </P>
<P> Akbar Mohamad of the black-American Nation of Islam, blamed the United States for frightening some delegates away. </P>
<P> ``The United States is using the power of the dollar to divide the Muslim community. There are many Dr Tourabi invited to this conference but they made their excuses because they are victims of the U.S. propaganda machine,'' Mohamad said. </P>
