<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Justice Department Tuesday sued a Louisiana sheriff's office for allegedly refusing to consider women applying for the job of deputy sheriff, charging it with violating U.S. civil rights law. </P>
<P> The department said it filed a complaint in U.S. District Court in New Orleans, alleging that the Assumption Parish Sheriff's Department discriminated against women on the basis of sex. </P>
<P> The complaint says the sheriff's department refused to consider hiring April Jones Cola, a former applicant for the position of deputy sheriff, and also engaged in a pattern of discrimination against women in general. </P>
<P> The sheriff's department did hire a woman for the position in August, but only after the Justice Department completed its investigation. It was the first woman hired for the job since July 1976. </P>
<P> ``Invidious discrimination against women cannot be tolerated, especially in law enforcement,'' New Orleans' U.S. Attorney Eddie Jordan, Jr. said in a statement. </P>
<P> The Justice Department said it investigated Cola's complaint and in March 1994 notified the sheriff's department that its hiring practices discriminated against qualified female applicants. </P>
<P> It said it filed the complaint after negotiations to resolve the case broke down, but gave no further details. </P>
<P> The complaint seeks an order requiring the sheriff's department to stop its discriminatory practices, establish a recruitment program to attract qualified female applicants and provide job offers and monetary compensation for women who had been victims of the discriminatory practices. </P>
