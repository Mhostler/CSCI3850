<P>  Three young elephant cows were released Friday into South Africa's Knysna forests in a bid to save the world's southernmost elephant herd from extinction. </P>
<P> But scientists fear the Knysna animals, the only free roaming elephants in South Africa, are doomed to disappear because their forest haunt does not provide them with a rich enough diet. </P>
<P> Forest ecologist Armin Seydack said the forest did not have as many nutrients as savannah habitats and this could affect the elephants' ability to breed. </P>
<P> Knysna Deputy Mayor Kitto Erasmus, a former forest warden, said about 500 elephants were believed to have roamed the area in the last century before prospectors discovered the nearby Millwood gold deposits in the 1880s. </P>
<P> ``The gold ran out quickly, then they started shooting the elephants for ivory,'' Erasmus said. ``By the turn of the century, there were 15 or 20 left.'' </P>
<P> The population remained stable until the 1970s, when numbers dropped sharply until only four of the original elephants are known to remain today. </P>
<P> ``They would die out completely without fresh blood,'' Erasmus said. </P>
<P> Conservationists have campaigned since 1980 for the introduction of more animals, but until now the South African government has resisted on the grounds that a larger herd could pose dangers to humans. </P>
<P> The three released Friday were brought by truck from a dramatically different environment in the Kruger National Park in the Transvaal, where their mothers were shot dead in the annual elephant cull. </P>
<P> They hesitated for about 15 minutes at the open door of the truck, testing the strange forest air with their trunks, before bolting for the far side of their enclosure. </P>
<P> They will be kept behind electric fencing for about a month to adapt before they are released into the wider forest of giant hardwoods, some of them 800 years old. </P>
<P> Author Dalene Matthee, who has done more than anyone to publicize the elephants and whose novel ``Circles in the Forest'' is set in the gold rush period, told Reuters she felt sorry for the new elephants. </P>
<P> ``Something deep inside me rebels at the idea. They are such sensitive animals, and this is like a foreign country to them. The souls of those elephants will be unhappy every single day.'' </P>
<P> Zoologist Marion Garai, who will monitor the new elephants, said she too was concerned about how they would adapt. </P>
<P> ``This is not ideal elephant habitat,'' she said. ``But moving them here is better than having them culled.'' </P>
<P> She said it would take time for the elephants to become accustomed to being moved from thorn-tree savannah, and their ultra-low frequency communication rumbles would probably not carry as far in the forest. </P>
