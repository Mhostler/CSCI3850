<P>  Russian warplanes bombed the Chechen capital, Grozny, for several hours Tuesday, a day after pitched battles in the city's streets, the vice president of the neighboring region of Ingushetia said. </P>
<P> ``Grozny came under repeated bombardments from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m.,'' Boris Agapov said by telephone from the Ingush capital, Nazran, to the west of Grozny. The report could not immediately be confirmed. </P>
<P> Agapov said he based his information on reports from Russian parliamentarians leaving Grozny and from people living near the Chechen border. He said Chechen fighters appeared to be in full control of the center of Grozny. </P>
<P> ``Many Russian tanks have withdrawn to the perimeter of the city,'' he said. ``At least 100 Russian soldiers have been captured. Many do not have any idea what is happening or why they are there.'' </P>
<P> Russian government officials said they had no new information on the latest developments in Grozny. </P>
<P> Russian authorities said Monday they had lost several dozen armored vehicles but said Russian troops controlled much of Grozny after a New Year's Eve push into the city. </P>
