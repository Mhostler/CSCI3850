<P>  Cambodia's King Norodom Sihanouk, usually critical of the country's coalition government, praised it on Tuesday for reconstruction achievements in this impoverished southeast Asian country. </P>
<P> Sihanouk has seldom had a good word to say about the current government, led by his son Prince Norodom Ranariddh and former socialist government leader Hun Sen. </P>
<P> ``Over the past few months and especially since the year 1994 we've seen that our country has begun develop,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``There's real progress in all fields.'' </P>
<P> Sihanouk said he had observed big improvements in the nation's hospitals, schools and communications. </P>
<P> ``After more than two decades of war and the Pol Pot regime, we became very poor and once again an underdeveloped country,'' he said, accompanied by his wife Queen Monineath, Second Prime Minister Hun Sen and senior ministers. </P>
<P> ``So it is time for us to remake all our efforts aimed at rebuilding Cambodia.'' </P>
<P> At least one million Cambodians died under Pol Pot's brutal Khmer Rouge regime in the 1970s. </P>
<P> Looking fit struggling with cancer, Sihanouk, 72, made his comments during an inspection of a road repair project on the outskirts of the capital Phnom Penh. </P>
<P> Route 6A, on the west bank of the Mekong River, links Phnom Penh with central Kompong Thom and is undergoing a $30 million renovation by the Japanese government. </P>
<P> Japanese Ambassador Yukio Imagawa said his country was committed to helping rebuild Cambodia's overland trasport. </P>
<P> The road repairs will include construction of several new bridges destroyed during the country's long civil war. </P>
<P> Sihanouk expressed gratitude to Japan for continued support in rehabilitating the war-ravaged country. </P>
<P> ``I appreciate so much what they (Japan) have done (and) continue to do for the sake of modern Cambodia,'' he said. </P>
