<P>  At least six people were killed and 40 injured by bombs that exploded during an Indian Republic Day rally in disputed Kashmir, where Muslim militants are waging a bloody secessionist war, police said. </P>
<P> They said two soldiers, two paramilitary troopers and two policemen were killed by three blasts that rocked a stadium during a rally attended by some 15,000 people in Jammu, winter capital of Indian-ruled Kashmir. </P>
<P> The Press Trust of India put the number of dead at seven and quoted an official spokesman as saying that three senior civil servants were among the injured. </P>
<P> The agency quoted officials as saying the bombings were believed to be the work of separatist militants. </P>
<P> Some militant groups are fighting to join Muslim Pakistan, ruler of one-third of the Himalayan region which has been the cause of two of Islamabad's three wars with India since both became independent of Britain in 1947. </P>
<P> Others want a re-united and independent Kashmir. </P>
<P> Thursday's bombs went off as retired general K.V. Krishna Rao, governor of Jammu and Kashmir, largely Hindu India's only Muslim-majority state, was addressing the rally. </P>
<P> Domestic news agencies said said Rao escaped with bruises and regional army army commander L.T. Surinder Singh, who was with Rao on the platform, escaped unhurt. </P>
<P> They said the three bombs exploded over a span of 13 minutes both inside and outside the Maulana Azad stadium, causing panic among spectators. Hospital officials said some of the injured were hurt in a stampede from the stadium. </P>
<P> The secessionist rebellion in Kashmir is now in its fifth year and police and hospitals have reported more than 17,000 deaths. </P>
<P> India accuses Pakistan of training, arming and guiding the militants, charges Islamabad denies. It says Pakistan gives only moral and diplomatic support to the militants. </P>
