<P>  Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi put his government to the test Friday by calling a confidence vote to protect the controversial 1995 budget on which his credibility is pinned. </P>
<P> Giuliano Ferrara, minister for parliamentary relations, told the Chamber of Deputies that part of the budget bill, concerning a pardon for those guilty of breaching building regulations, would be subject to a confidence vote. </P>
<P> ``We have called a confidence vote to make sure the budget remains intact and safe,'' he said. </P>
<P> Parliamentary sources said the vote, which would compel Berlusconi to resign if he lost, would take place at 8 a.m. EST Monday. </P>
<P> The announcement came at a time of rising tensions in the center-right coalition, although its members rushed to declare they would back the government in the Chamber of Deputies, where Berlusconi's alliance has a 51-seat majority. </P>
<P> Unions say they expect 850,000 people to take part in a national protest in Rome Saturday against the budget, which would cut spending on pensions and health as part of a plan to reduce the 1995 deficit by $32 billion. </P>
<P> Successive governments have used confidence votes to get legislation through parliament. </P>
<P> But this was the first time Berlusconi, installed in May, had resorted to such a tactic and the leftist opposition immediately accused him of riding roughshod over parliament. </P>
<P> The confidence vote was called because some 250 amendments have been submitted on the building pardon, which aims to raise revenue by allowing Italians who have breached building regulations to wipe the slate clean by paying a fixed sum. </P>
<P> The government fears that discussion of the amendments would delay the budget's passage, making it impossible for both houses of parliament to meet a legal requirement to approve the bill by the end of the year. </P>
<P> The entire package is due to have passed through the Chamber of Deputies by Nov. 19 before moving to the Senate. </P>
