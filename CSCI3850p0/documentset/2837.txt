<P>  A British aid worker and four local workers have disappeared near a camp for Rwandan refugees after being led away by Zairean troops, Britain's Foreign Office said Saturday. </P>
<P> ``At some time on November 25 a convoy was stopped by Zairean troops. The fifth and last vehicle in the convoy contained a British aid worker and four local workers from the Lutheran World Federation,'' a spokesman said. </P>
<P> ``All five were taken from the vehicle and marched off into the bush,'' he said. ``We are making enquiries.'' </P>
<P> He said the incident happened near the Kitale refugee camp, home to hundreds of thousands of Rwandans. </P>
<P> The teeming Rwandan refugee camps of eastern Zaire have been gripped by fresh violence. </P>
<P> Aid officials said the Briton went missing during clashes between Zairean troops and camp inmates in which at least eight refugees were shot dead Friday. </P>
