<P>  Spilled beer led to threats of disqualification for world record holder Jackie Joyner-Kersee and angry words from her husband Tuesday on a bizarre second day of the heptathlon at the Goodwill Games. </P>
<P> A Games official accused the U.S. Olympic champion of putting beer on her javelins to gain a better grip, and through an interpreter, threatened to disqualify her. </P>
<P> But she tearfully told the official she had not used the javelins after they had been moistened by spectators spilling beer on the implements as they lay on the ground before her competition. </P>
<P> An angry confrontation ensued between Bob Kersee, her husband and coach, and field events referee Albert Kalin. </P>
<P> Only then did a shaken Joyner-Kersee continue, claiming the Goodwill Games gold medal with her lowest winning score ever, 6,606 points. </P>
<P> ``I'm not going to have Jackie Joyner-Kersee accused of cheating,'' Kersee forcefully told Kalin through an interpreter. ``Either he apologizes to Jackie or he disqualifies her.'' </P>
<P> Joyner-Kersee said the confusion began when officials brought her javelins on to the field after she had decided not to use them because the tips were wet. </P>
<P> She did not use the javelins in her warm-ups or in the competition, borrowing those of a fellow competitor. </P>
<P> ``But the official came up and through the interpreter said I was breaking the rules of the game and that I was out,'' Joyner-Kersee said. </P>
<P> ``After Bobby talked to the official he said I had broken the rules. He said he was just going to give me a warning and that it had better not happen again,'' Joyner-Kersee said. </P>
<P> ``I was so upset that I was shedding tears.'' </P>
<P> Former U.S. Olympian Jane Frederick, now a coach, said the incident was uncalled for. </P>
<P> ``It shook her up,'' said Frederick. ``It was improper to make that comment to her.'' </P>
