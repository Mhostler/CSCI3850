<P>  Russian nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky said Saturday he would send troops to liberate Cyprus from Turkish occupation if he won Russia's 1996 presidential election. </P>
<P> ``If I get elected and if the government of Cyprus asked me to send Russian troops, I would,'' Zhirinovsky said after arriving in the divided Mediterranean island on a three-day visit at the invitation of a Greek Cypriot businessman. </P>
<P> ``The Turkish occupation here contravenes the principles andresolutions of the United Nations,'' he told journalists at Larnaca airport. </P>
<P> Cyprus has been divided since 1974 following a Turkish invasion sparked by a short-lived coup in Nicosia engineered by a military junta then ruling Greece. </P>
<P> Turkey maintains more than 30,000 troops in the northern third of the island where Turkish Cypriots declared a breakaway state in 1983, recognized only by Turkey. </P>
