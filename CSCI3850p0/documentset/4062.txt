<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Yugoslavia said Monday it wants to close down the Josip Broz Tito memorial center, set up 13 years ago to honor the once-revered late president, who is now out of favor. </P>
<P> It was no longer needed, the government said, according to Tanjug news agency. The statement reflects changed times since Tito's autocratic, 35-year Communist rule kept the now-fractured Balkan federation together. </P>
<P> Only two republics, Serbia and Montenegro, are left in Yugoslavia after the secession of Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia and Slovenia. </P>
<P> Tanjug said the rump Yugoslavia government had put forward a bill to close the Museum of the Revolution of the Yugoslav Peoples and the memorial center, which contains Tito's grave. </P>
<P> Tito led communist partisans to victory in World War II and held Yugoslavia in an iron grip until he died in 1980. He kept the federation independent, defying Moscow and the West. </P>
<P> Official opinion has now turned against him as the federal state has been replaced by a stridently nationalist government in Belgrade. Many Serbs, who now control control Yugoslavia, also oppose perpetuating Tito's memory because he was a Croat. </P>
<P> Tanjug said the government had explained that ``the existence of the institutions, whose closing it had called for, was not in keeping with the Yugoslav constitution and that the need for their existence had ceased.'' </P>
<P> The government would take over all property, money, archives and objects of historical, cultural and artistic interest belonging to the memorial center and the museum. </P>
