<P>  Ki-Jana Carter rushed for three touchdowns, including two in a 1:52 span in the third quarter, as undefeated Penn State broke open a close game and beat Oregon 38-20 in the Rose Bowl Monday. </P>
<P> Second-ranked Penn State (12-0) completed its fifth undefeated and untied season under head coach Joe Paterno, but the win is not expected to be enough to claim a national title in the national polls. </P>
<P> The Nittany Lions likely saw their chance at a national championship end when top-ranked Nebraska defeated Miami 24-17 in the Orange Bowl on Sunday night. </P>
<P> It could be the fourth time that Penn State will have an unblemished season and yet not capture the national title. The Nittany Lions were undefeated in 1968, 1969 and 1973 and did not win the national championship in any of those seasons. </P>
<P> After Oregon's Danny O'Neil threw a 17-yard touchdown pass to Cristin McLemore with 4:54 left in third quarter to tie the score at 14-14, Penn State regained a seven-point lead when Carter scored on a 17-yard run with 3:53 left in the quarter. </P>
<P> The touchdown followed a 72-yard kickoff return by Ambrose Fletcher. </P>
<P> Safety Chuck Penzenik then intercepted a pass from O'Neil and returned it 44 yards to the 13, leading to a three-yard touchdown run by Carter. It was the second interception of the game for Penzenik, a junior making his first career start. </P>
<P> Brett Conway kicked a 43-yard field goal to increase the lead to 31-14. Penn State then took over on downs at the Oregon 13 and fullback Jon Witman scored on a nine-yard run to give Penn State its biggest lead at 38-14. </P>
<P> Carter had also run 83 yards for a touchdown on Penn State's first play from scrimmage, earning a 7-0 lead. </P>
<P> Penn State coach Joe Paterno became college football's all-time winningest bowl coach with his 16th victory. He and Bear Bryant had shared the record. </P>
<P> Paterno also became the first coach to win each of the traditional four major bowl games (Rose, Sugar, Orange and Cotton). </P>
<P> Penn State has won 17 straight games, the longest current streak in the nation. </P>
<P> Oregon (9-4) played in the Rose Bowl game for the first time since 1958. </P>
