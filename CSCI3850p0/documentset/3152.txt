<DATELINE>CASABLANCA, Morocco (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Disputes between Arab states on Monday dogged preparations for an Islamic summit in Morocco but a contented Bosnian representative said he expected the meeting to take a strong line on Bosnia, possibly endorsing military aid. </P>
<P> ``It (the current draft) is a strong document. It foresees taking several actions in all directions -- diplomatic, political and economic. I have no doubt it will meet with a very good response at the summit and help define a concrete and effective program of action,'' said Ambassador Nerkuz Arifhodzic. </P>
<P> Asked if it might include military support for the hard-pressed mainly Muslim government in Sarajevo, he said: ``I don't exclude that possibility. It's too early to speak of it. </P>
<P> ``Anyway it's not a threat of confrontation but rather a determination to help Bosnia-Herzegovina in its legitimate self-defense and to give it the right to resist.'' </P>
<P> Turkish President Suleyman Demirel said he would urge the Islamic summit to take action on Bosnia. </P>
<P> ``We are going to try to move the Islamic community to act so as not to abandon our Bosnian brothers in face of the seriously worsening situation,'' he said. </P>
<P> The OIC and the individual member states have supported the Bosnian government diplomatically, repeatedly criticizing the Western powers which dominate the U.N. operation in the Balkans, but they have not been able to do much to help the Bosnians on the battlefield. </P>
<P> The resolution they adopt is certain to include a call for an end to the arms embargo on the Bosnian government but few if any favor the OIC members defying the international community by trying to break the embargo unilaterally. </P>
<P> The wording of two resolutions on the Iraqi-Kuwaiti dispute and on the status of Jerusalem was resolved in time for the foreign ministers to resume a plenary session late Monday to finalize the agenda for the summit opening Tuesday. </P>
<P> Seventeen heads of state and government arrived in Casablanca Monday for the Organization of the Islamic Conference (IOC) summit, the 7th since the OIC's inception 25 years ago. </P>
<P> The foreign ministers adjourned a meeting Sunday after failing to agree wording on Jerusalem which would be acceptable to Jordan, which requested that they recognize its supervisory role over Islamic holy shrines in Jerusalem. </P>
<P> Farouk Kaddoumi, who is in charge of foreign relations in the Palestinian self-rule authority, told Reuters the resolution had been approved by a political committee without reference to the Jordanian role. </P>
<P> ``There was a question on the Jordanian role. There was only one suggestion to include this reference but that problem is now over,'' he said. </P>
<P> An earlier dispute on the wording of a resolution on the Iraqi-Kuwaiti conflict was also resolved. </P>
<P> At a political committee meeting Monday morning, the bitter memories of the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait and the Gulf War in 1991 came to the surface again, delegates said. </P>
<P> Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheik Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah told reporters that compromise language had been agreed but he ruled out reconciliation with Iraq for now. </P>
<P> ``I'd like you to keep away from the word reconciliation. Reconciliation comes after Iraq finishes implementing the U.N. Security Council resolutions and then anything can happen,'' Sheik Sabah said. </P>
<P> He said the text of the resolution stated that Iraq must comply with U.N. resolutions passed after Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait in August 1990 but also took into account Iraq's recent recognition of Kuwait within U.N.-defined borders. </P>
<P> ``All this has been set down basically to make this conference succeed but it doesn't go further,'' he said. </P>
<P> Iraq is lobbying the 52 Muslim states to call for an end to U.N. sanctions. Kuwait and its Gulf allies, usually the dominant force in the OIC, say Iraq has not yet met all its obligations under U.N. resolutions. </P>
