<P>  Democratic national chairman Christopher Dodd went out on a limb Wednesday and predicted that Texas Sen. Phil Gramm has the winning formula -- money, message and workers -- to be Republican presidential nominee in 1996. </P>
<P> ``Phil Gramm has got at least the needed elements at this juncture to prevail,'' the Connecticut senator said at a news conference. </P>
<P> ``He said it best -- the best friend you can have in this process, at this juncture, is ready cash,'' Dodd said of Gramm. </P>
<P> The relatively little-known Texas senator is becoming a political money magnet, and has set a record by raising more than $4 million in a single night. </P>
<P> So far, Gramm has banked over $16 million, including more than $3 million in projected federal matching funds, well over half his goal of raising at least $25 million for the 1996 race. </P>
<P> Gramm is running far behind the front-runner in the polls, Senate Republican leader Bob Dole, who will formally announce his candidacy next Monday in his home state of Kansas. </P>
<P> Dodd said Gramm is ``very focused,'' has ``workers and dollars and a message,'' and appeals to the activist conservatives who dominate the Republican party, choose the party nominee through delegate-selection contests, and who vote at the presidential nominating convention. </P>
<P> ``You've got to be able to have the dollars to carry through in this process,'' Dodd said. ``And you've got to have the people.'' </P>
<P> Straw polls among Republicans in several states have gone for Gramm, and Dodd said he thought that was significant. </P>
<P> ``Those are activists, those are people who show up at conventions and get out and do the work.'' </P>
<P> Gramm is one of five announced Republican candidates and four more, including Dole, are ready to announce their intentions. </P>
<P> Those running officially besides Gramm are former Tennessee governor Lamar Alexander, conservative commentator Pat Buchanan, Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter and Baltimore talk show host Alan Keyes. Expected to join them are Dole, Indiana Sen. Richard Lugar, California Gov. Pete Wilson and California Rep. Robert Dornan. </P>
<P> On the Democratic side, Dodd said he doubted anyone would emerge to challenge President Clinton for the party nomination. The only Democrat to move in that direction so far has been former Pennsylvania governor Robert Casey, who has formed a presidential exploratory committee -- usually the first step toward a run. </P>
