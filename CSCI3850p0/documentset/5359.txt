<P>  As a new poll Friday showed the solid second-place standing of the center-left alliance FREPASO, Argentine President Carlos Menem began lending his weight to the Radical Party in a bid to undermine FREPASO's strength. </P>
<P> ``Although the Radicals had fallen behind, I believe their campaign and country-wide organization will in the end place them second in the elections,'' said Menem, in defiance of recent pre-election polls which have put the Radicals a distant third ahead of the May elections. </P>
<P> An independent poll by the Center for Studies of the New Majority published Friday gave Menem, who changed the constitution a year ago to allow him to run for a second term, 43 percent of the vote, versus 28 percent for FREPASO's Octavio Bordon and 18 percent for Radical Horacio Massaccesi. </P>
<P> Menem needs at least 40 percent of the vote and a 10-point lead over his nearest rival to avoid going to a second round in the May 14 election. </P>
<P> Analysts agree Menem's best strategy lies in undermining the FREPASO, best achieved by giving the Radicals a leg-up. </P>
<P> Since FREPASO chose moderate senator and former provincial governor Bordon as its candidate in February, it has steadily gained ground thanks to desertions by disenchanted Peronists and Radicals, especially former Radical foreign minister and U.N. General Assembly head and envoy to Haiti, Dante Caputo. </P>
<P> Last Monday Menem challenged the Peronist party's rivals to in-depth debates by each party's technical teams to be conducted on the state television station ATC. </P>
<P> ``Usually, the one who's ahead doesn't want to debate. The ones who want to debate are the ones who are behind,'' said independent political analyst Rosendo Fraga. </P>
<P> ``But with this offer, Menem has challenged the FREPASO who's technical teams are not yet fully formed, to engage in debates they are not quite ready to hold,'' he said. </P>
<P> Fraga said the strategy was meant to put the Radicals at the center of the debate and marginalize the unprepared FREPASO, raising the Radicals' profile and curbing the growth of the loose center-left coalition. </P>
