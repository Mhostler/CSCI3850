<P>  Secretary of State Warren Christopher said an explosion in Haiti Thursday which killed five people and injured 40 showed that U.S. forces there were in a ''dangerous risk situation'' that was likely to continue for some time. </P>
<P> Christopher told reporters the U.S. contingent in Haiti, which Thursday climbed to 19,600 troops, would peak and then decline sharply. </P>
<P> The first troops from other countries in the U.S.-led multinational force would arrive in Haiti ``in the next few days,'' he added. </P>
<P> Commenting on the explosion that ripped through a cheering crowd of pro-democracy marchers in Port-au-Prince, Christopher said: ``We have long recognized that there are risks in this situation, that such incidents would occur. </P>
<P> ``This is a reminder that we're in a dangerous risk situation and will be for some time. That's why we have a rather overwhelming force of troops,'' he said after talks with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. </P>
<P> Most Haitians welcomed the U.S. force which arrived in Haiti September 19 to ensure the resignation of the military junta and prepare for the return of ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Christopher said. </P>
<P> ``We'll do everything we can to minimize the incidents but we did not ever think from the first that they could be reduced to zero, even with the most effective armed forces that there is in the world.'' </P>
<P> Asked why the number of U.S. troops, originally forecast at 15,000, had now reached almost 20,000, Christopher said the Pentagon wanted ``to make sure that we are in a position to secure the country. </P>
<P> ``You'll find that number will reach a peak and will scale down rather quickly, but I think we don't want to leave any question as to our ability to control the scene and to dominate the scene,'' he said. </P>
<P> Christopher said troops from other countries ``will be deployed within the next few days'' to help the Americans. </P>
<P> The United States says 27 other countries have agreed to contribute forces, many of them police units, to the first phase of the Haiti operation before a United Nations force takes over. But none have so far reached Haiti. </P>
