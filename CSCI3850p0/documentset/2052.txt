<DATELINE>TOKYO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Reclusive North Korean leader Kim Jong-il appeared in public Sunday for the first time since July 20 to attend a memorial service for his late father, President Kim Il-sung. </P>
<P> State television footage beamed to Tokyo showed Kim, 52, attending a mass rally in a huge square outside the Pyongyang assembly hall where the president's state funeral was held three months ago. </P>
<P> Standing at the center of a rostrum flanked by senior vice president and defense finister O Jin-u and Premier Kang Song-san, Kim seemed in much better health than he did on his last appearance, at funeral rites for his father, who died of a heart attack July 8. </P>
<P> At the time he looked sickly and listless, prompting speculation -- later fueled by his long absence from public view -- that he was either ill or caught up in a power struggle. </P>
<P> A Korean Central News Agency report Sunday seemed designed to set such rumors at rest. It quoted top figures in the ruling communist party and military high command as pledging loyalty to the younger Kim. </P>
<P> Ever since Kim Il-sung's sudden death July 8, North Korea's state media have heaped praise on his son, referring to him as uncontested leader. </P>
<P> But there has still been no official word on when the younger Kim would be formally named head of the ruling Korean Workers' (Communist) Party or as state president. </P>
<P> In face of rumors about his personal and political health, Pyongyang-watchers sought to cool speculation, saying his absence from public view was in keeping with traditional Korean practice which provides for a 100-day mourning period. </P>
<P> South Korea's Yonhap news agency, quoting a diplomatic source in Seoul, reported Saturday that the ruling party's central committee would approve Kim as party chief a day or two after Sunday's rally. </P>
<P> The source said his election to the state presidency would come later. </P>
<P> The chubby, bespectacled Kim Jong-il, named by his father two decades ago as his eventual successor, acquired a reputation for eccentricity, encouraged by his bouffant hair style and platform shoes. </P>
<P> Some Western intelligence sources also suspected him of being the mastermind behind a number of bloody attacks on South Korean and U.S. targets. </P>
<P> These included the 1983 bomb attack in Rangoon, Burma, which killed several members of the cabinet of visiting South Korean President Chun Doo Hwan, and the 1987 destruction of a South Korean airliner over the Andaman Sea which killed all 115 aboard. </P>
