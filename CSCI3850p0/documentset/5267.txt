<P>  Britain's ruling Conservatives were locked in battle with the BBC Tuesday after ministers accused the publicly financed broadcasting network of bias towards the opposition in its reporting. </P>
<P> The government, trailing more than 30 points behind the opposition Labor Party in opinion polls, says its ministers are being questioned too zealously and Labor attacks on them are given unfair prominence on the airwaves. </P>
<P> Opposition politicians and newspapers dismissed the complaints as the reaction of ministers facing the prospect of losing office at the next election, due in 1997. </P>
<P> The normally Conservative-supporting Daily Mail commented, ``Such blustery whingeing from assorted Secretaries of State is as self-defeating as it is preposterous.'' </P>
<P> Tuesday, Home Secretary Michael Howard pressed the attack, launched at the weekend by cabinet colleague Jonathan Aitken who accused top BBC presenter John Humphrys of ``partisan politics.'' </P>
<P> Howard said BBC radio had given in-depth coverage of figures produced by Labor about a doubling in the number of crimes since the Conservatives came to power in 1979. </P>
<P> But it only mentioned in passing, in its business news segment, announcements by two electricity companies, privatized by the government, of cuts in charges which would benefit millions of families. </P>
<P> ``The Labor Party's figures on crime are not new at all. There is nothing newsworthy about old figures,'' Howard told a news conference. </P>
<P> Under a royal charter of 1927, when the BBC was converted from a private company to a public body, news programs are required to be impartial. </P>
<P> In his attack on Humphrys, anchorman of the BBC's agenda-setting radio program ``Today,'' Treasury Chief Secretary Aitken accused him of sacrificing his image of impartiality by chairing a lobby against government cuts in education spending. </P>
<P> Other cabinet ministers supported Aitken, complaining that Humphrys and other interviewers did not give them time to answer questions. </P>
<P> Political observers recalled that Conservatives had in the past taken out their frustrations at poor opinion poll showings by attacking broadcasters. </P>
<P> In 1984, party chairman Norman Tebbit called BBC reporting of the U.S. bombing of Tripoli, which was backed by then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, as ``a mixture of news, views, speculation, error and uncritical Libyan propaganda.'' </P>
<P> Paddy Ashdown, leader of the minority Liberal Democratic Party, said if politicians were worried about bias in the media, they should complain privately rather than make public attacks. </P>
