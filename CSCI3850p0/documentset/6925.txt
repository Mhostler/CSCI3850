<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Kenny Rogers ran his consecutive scoreless innings streak to 33 as the Texas Rangers beat the Minnesota Twins 3-1 Saturday for their third straight win. </P>
<P> Rogers (5-2) gave up eight hits over seven-plus innings and won his fifth straight start, lowering his ERA to a league-leading 1.42. </P>
<P> Rogers, who walked one and struck out five, has not given up a run since May 6. His streak is three innings short of the club record of 36 set by Charlie Hough in 1983. </P>
<P> ``It's been going on for a little while, but when I get out in the game, I don't think about (the streak),'' Rogers said. ''The first thing on my mind is winning the ballgame.'' </P>
<P> Jeff Russell got his sixth save despite allowing Chuck Knoblauch's two-out RBI single in the ninth. </P>
<P> Eddie Guardado (0-3) surrendered one run on six hits over seven innings with four walks and two strikeouts. </P>
<P> In Oakland, Steve Ontiveros pitched a one-hit shutout and Ruben Sierra homered and scored two runs to lead the Athletics to a 3-0 victory over the New York Yankees. </P>
<P> Ontiveros (5-1) walked two and struck out seven in winning his fourth straight start for the Athletics, who have won four straight games and seven of their last eight. </P>
<P> The only hit for New York was a clean two-out single up the middle by Luis Polonia in the sixth. </P>
<P> ``I feel blessed to even experience a game like that,'' Ontiveros said. ``I had all five pitches working and I was just trying to go on instinct -- what would work on each pitch.'' </P>
<P> Andy Pettitte (0-1) surrendered three runs -- one earned -- on seven hits over 5 2/3 innings in losing his first major-league start for the Yankees, who dropped their fifth straight. New York has been outscored 35-6 during the skid. </P>
<P> In Detroit, Jason Bere and Roberto Hernandez combined on a three-hitter and Ron Karkovice homered for the game's only run as the Chicago White Sox blanked the Tigers 1-0. </P>
<P> Bere (1-3) won for the first time in six starts, allowing three hits with six walks and four strikeouts. Roberto Hernandez worked a perfect ninth for his seventh save. It was the first shutout for the White Sox this season. </P>
<P> Karkovice led off the fifth with his third homer of the season, off Felipe Lira (0-3). Lira allowed three hits in five innings and struck out six. </P>
<P> In Toronto, Al Leiter, Tony Castillo and Darren Hall combined on a four-hitter and Lance Parrish belted a three-run homer with two outs in the seventh inning to lead the Blue Jays to a 3-0 victory over the Cleveland Indians. </P>
<P> Toronto won for just the third time in its last 11 games. </P>
<P> Leiter (2-2) allowed four hits and walked three with seven strikeouts in 7 2/3 innings, extending his scoreless streak to 15 innings. </P>
<P> Parrish's homer was his 309th as a catcher, placing him in third place behind Carlton Fisk (376) and Johnny Bench (327) on the all-time list for home runs by catchers. </P>
<P> Manny Ramirez has hit in 11 straight games after notching two of Cleveland's six hits, raising his average to .406. Eddie Murray also had two hits and is hitting .356. </P>
<P> At California, knuckleballer Tim Wakefield allowed five hits over seven innings in his American League debut and Luis Alicea had three hits and three RBI to lead the Boston Red Sox to a 12-1 rout of the Angels. </P>
<P> Wakefield (1-0), a former Pittsburgh Pirates phenom, spent the 1994 season at Triple-A Buffalo. He was recalled Friday and gave up one run with two walks and four strikeouts for his first win since Sept. 30, 1993. </P>
<P> Alicea hit a two-run homer off Angels starter Mike Bielecki (2-1) in the top of the fourth. </P>
<P> Mo Vaughn added a three-run homer off reliever Mitch Williams in the sixth as Boston collected 13 hits. </P>
<P> In Seattle, Cal Ripken went 4-for-5 and Jeff Manto hit a three-run homer to highlight a five-run seventh inning and power the Baltimore Orioles to an 11-4 win over the Mariners. </P>
<P> Rafael Palmeiro singled, doubled, tripled and scored three runs for the Orioles, who won for just the second time in their last seven games. </P>
<P> Alan Mills (3-0) got the win with 3 1/3 scoreless innings in relief of Sid Fernandez. Bob Wells (1-3) was tagged for five runs on eight hits over 5 1/3 innings. </P>
<P> The scheduled game in Milwaukee between the Kansas City Royals and the Brewers was postponed due to rain. No reschedule date was announced. </P>
