<P>  A 25-year-old New Hampshire man has been arrested and indicted on federal charges that he burned a cross on the lawn of a black family, authorities said Monday. </P>
<P> ``Cross burning is rare in New Hampshire,'' First Assistant U.S. Attorney Peter Papps told Reuters. ``But one is one too many, and that's why we went ahead with the case.'' </P>
<P> According to the indictment, the accused, Russell Trimm, lived next door to the black family in the small, rural town of Litchfield. The cross burning took place on the night of Dec. 12, 1991. No one was hurt in the incident. </P>
<P> Trimm is charged with violating federal civil rights statutes including conspiracy to threaten and intimidate the Taylor family. </P>
<P> If convicted, he faces a maximum of 10 years in prison, a fine of $250,000, or both. He also faces an additional fine of $250,000 on a stolen firearms charge.  Two 22-year-olds, David LaCasse and Timothy Winslow of New Hampshire, pleaded guilty earlier this year for taking part in the burning. </P>
<P> Papps said It is doubtful that any are members of the Ku Klux Klan or any other organized group but an the investigation by the FBI and local and state authorities is continuing. </P>
