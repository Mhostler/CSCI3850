<P>  Prosecutors in two states were trying to determine Monday where to try a man accused of abducting a woman in California, murdering her at an unknown location and preserving her body in a freezer in Arizona. </P>
<P> Under Arizona law, if it cannot be determined where Denise Huber was murdered after she was kidnapped on a California freeway three years ago, the man accused of killing her, John Famalaro, would be tried in Arizona, a Yavapai County, Arizona, official told Reuters. </P>
<P> ``Under Arizona state law there is a presumption that where the victim is found, is where the killing took place, unless it can be determined that it occurred somewhere else,'' said Deputy District Attorney Tom Lindberg. </P>
<P> Huber, who was 23 at the time, went missing as she was driving to her Newport Beach, California, home after attending a June 3, 1991, rock concert in Los Angeles. Her car was found on a freeway with a flat tire. </P>
<P> Her battered, well preserved body was found in a rented freezer truck in the driveway of Famalaro's home in the Prescott suburb of Dewey in Wednesday. A power line ran from the house to the truck. </P>
<P> Famalaro, a painter and handyman, was arrested on suspicion of murder and theft and is being held on $250,000 bail. A preliminary hearing was scheduled in Prescott for July 22. </P>
<P> Police said the truck was rented from a Los Angeles-area company last January and was never returned. </P>
<P> Huber's father, Dennis, said from his Newport Beach home that he hoped Famalaro would be tried in Arizona, because ``I think their system of justice is a little better than ours.'' </P>
<P> ``California justice is slanted totally toward the criminal and not the victim,'' he said. </P>
