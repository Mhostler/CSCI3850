<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Sen. Sam Nunn, who could cast the pivotal vote, said Monday that he hoped to be able back the controversial balanced-budget amendment in a vote scheduled Tuesday. </P>
<P> But the Georgia Democrat strung out the suspense by reiterating his fear that the amendment, as proposed, could give the courts too much control over federal spending. </P>
<P> ``It is my hope I can vote for it,'' he said in an interview on the Cable News Network. ``But I do not think we want taxation without representation. And I don't think we should leave it ambiguous as to whether the courts can assert jurisdiction over this whole subject.'' </P>
<P> Nunn is one of five Senate Democrats who have not yet announced which way they will vote. Amendment supporters have 66 votes, one short of the two-thirds majority needed for passage, Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., said Sunday. </P>
<P> If the measure clears the Senate and is ratified by 38 of the 50 states, it would become part of the Constitution in 2002. The House approved it earlier this month as one of the centerpieces of the House Republicans' ``Contract with America'' campaign platform. </P>
<P> Nunn said he hoped Senate Republican leaders would approve a change that would bar federal courts from interpreting the law and thus making their own fiscal policy. </P>
<P> ``If we don't do that, we will be turning it over to the courts saying 'you decide what your role is','' he said. ``We could have courts mandating the raising of taxes... I don't think that's what the people want in this situation.''  But Nunn, pressed in the interview, repeatedly refused to say he would vote ``no'' unless his concern about the courts was incorporated into the measure. </P>
<P> President Clinton opposes the amendment, which would pose a unique challenge in a country that has not balanced its budget for more than three years in a row in 65 years. </P>
<P> The four other Democrats who have not disclosed how they will vote are John Breaux of Louisiana, Wendell Ford of Kentucky, and Kent Conrad and Byron Dorgan, both of North Dakota. </P>
<P> The amendment would require a three-fifths vote of all members of the House and Senate to permit an annual shortfall between income and spending or to increase the nation's credit line. </P>
<P> It would also require a majority of all members -- rather than those sitting -- to approve a tax increase. </P>
<P> Laura Tyson, head of the White House's National Economic Council, said the measure would fuel economic instability by handcuffing federal efforts to cushion recessions. </P>
<P> ``We should not delude the American people by putting a balanced budget amendment in place,'' Tyson said on CNN's ``Late Edition'' program Sunday. ``What it will do, is it will make the economy more unstable and it will give a whole lot of of power to the federal reserve to make the economy behave.'' </P>
