<DATELINE>SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Envoys of the United States and other powers whose peace plan for Bosnia has been stalled for months met government leaders in Sarajevo Tuesday and insisted the plan would not be changed to persuade the Serbs to sign up. </P>
<P> ``I know there have been rumors about changes in the plan -- those are not true,'' said Ambassador Charles Thomas, speaking for the five-nation contact group in which he is the U.S. representative. </P>
<P> ``We stick with the plan. We insist that the map be accepted and we believe that this is a viable plan to achieve peace in this part of the world.'' </P>
<P> International attempts to broker a political settlement to the war moved ahead last week after Serb forces invaded the U.N.-designated ``safe area'' of Bihac and positioned themselves to overrun the enclave completely. </P>
<P> Diplomats said Monday the contact group was prepared to offer new concessions to the Bosnian Serbs to get them to agree to their peace plan -- namely, the option of confederating with neighboring Serbia. </P>
<P> They said that Washington had reluctantly agreed in principle to the fresh incentives to the Serbs, providing certain conditions were met. </P>
<P> But they also said there would probably be no public announcements of what is on offer to the Serbs since this could embarrass a U.S. administration which is under heavy pressure domestically to do more to help the Muslims. </P>
<P> Asked to confirm the contact group was not trying to impose confederation on the Bosnian government, Thomas said: ``We are not going to impose anything on the parties.'' </P>
<P> Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic, an outspoken opponent of confederation, was the ranking government official to meet formally with the group in Sarajevo. </P>
<P> He said he was fully satisfied confederation was not on the contact group agenda, hidden or otherwise. </P>
<P> ``I was prepared to see this on the agenda and I asked them specifically and they said no,'' Ganic told reporters after his meeting with the group. </P>
<P> ``I told them if you are here for additional concessions the answer is no, no. That (would) mean the end of our nation. We'll fight by ourselves and with some friends from the world that might come to help us.'' </P>
<P> Britain, France and Russia, three members of the contact group, have openly discussed the practical merits of confederation for weeks. Germany and the United States, the other two members, are reportedly committed to the original plan on principle. </P>
<P> The Bosnian government, which holds only 30 percent of Bosnia's territory, rejects confederation as a prescription for partition. </P>
<P> The original contact group plan offered the government and separatist Serbs roughly equal shares of Bosnia inside a loose federation preserving the country's borders and sovreignty. </P>
<P> Bosnia's government accepted but the Serbs turned it down, demanding changes to the map and the right to confederation. </P>
