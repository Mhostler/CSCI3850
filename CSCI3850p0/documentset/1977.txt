<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  One of the alleged plotters in the assassination of a top Mexico ruling party official has told police that hardline lawmakers from the Senate and Chamber of Deputies may have been involved in the plot, deputy attorney general Mario Ruiz Massieu said Wednesday. </P>
<P> Fernando Rodriguez Gonzalez, who was arrested earlier this week, told police a group of lawmakers apparently opposed to political reform aims ``to regain the leadership positions in the country for those who have been displaced, without regard for the means they have to use,'' Ruiz, the dead man's brother, said in a statement carried on national television. </P>
<P> Francisco Ruiz Massieu, the secretary-general of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), was assassinated Sept. 28 outside a Mexico City hotel. </P>
<P> Investigators have accused a dozen people so far of involvement in the slaying and say they suspect the politician was ordered killed by PRI hardliners, possibly linked to drug traffickers, who oppose democratic reform of the ruling party and feel they are being squeezed out of power. </P>
<P> Many Mexicans also believe the killing was linked to the assassination in March of PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, who had also embraced reform of the long-ruling party to separate it from the Mexican state. </P>
<P> Rodriguez, the technical secretary of the Chamber of Deputies hydraulics works commission, said he did not know the names of most the lawmakers in the hardline groups. </P>
<P> Rodriguez said the Senate group was headed by Enrique Cardenas Gonzalez, who has denied any involvement in the Ruiz killing. </P>
<P> Rodriguez also told police that several other political figures were slated for assassination, including the PRI's former party president Fernando Ortiz Arana. </P>
<P> Ortiz was a candidate of hardliners in the PRI, which has ruled Mexico since 1929, to replace the slain Colosio as presidential candidate. </P>
<P> It is believed Ortiz was targeted because, like Ruiz, he may have been seen by some politicians as a bridge between hardliners and reformers within the PRI. </P>
<P> He lost out to Ernesto Zedillo, an economist closer to outgoing President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who went on to win August 21 elections and is due to take power Dec. 1. Zedillo has called for plans to reform the PRI to be completed by then. </P>
<P> The confessed gunman, Daniel Aguilar, told authorities that Munoz and Rodriguez organized the crime and other detainees have confirmed that version. The whereabouts of Munoz, also member of the Chamber of Deputies, is currently unknown. </P>
<P> Rodriguez said Ruiz was killed on the third attempt after two previous plots fell apart when people hired to carry out the assassination absconded with the money. </P>
