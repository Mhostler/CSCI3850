<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A House committee Monday voted to halt new federal regulations over the heated objections of Democrats who said it would endanger public health. </P>
<P> The measure, which would freeze a wide range of new government regulations from investigating the tobacco industry to releasing wolves, cleared the Government Reform and Oversight Committee on a 28-13 vote and was sent to the House floor. </P>
<P> ``Establishing a moratorium is an appropriate reaction to the federal regulatory factory that churns out too many expensive regulations,'' Committee Chairman Rep. William Clinger, R-Pa., said in a statement. </P>
<P> Clinger said the bill would ``provide a needed break from burdensome regulations for individuals and businesses alike,'' noting compliance with federal rules cost the private sector $430 billion a year. </P>
<P> The measure would be retroactive to Nov. 20 and would stop all new government regulations that affect the public -- or preparation of regulations -- until Dec. 31. </P>
<P> By then House Republicans hope to have changed the way the government makes its rules. </P>
<P> Democrats said the temporary measure threatened the health and safety of Americans, but Republicans say there were emergency exceptions for any life-threatening circumstances. </P>
<P> Nonetheless Democrats presented a series of amendments, which were rejected by the Republican-majority committee. </P>
<P> One amendment would have excepted the Environmental Protection Agency's attempts to control cryptosporidium in drinking water. The bacteria killed more than 100 people with weakened immune systems and sickened 400,000 others. </P>
<P> Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., argued that the amendment was unnecessary and any EPA work on the problem would be covered under a section that permitted risk assessment. </P>
<P> ``This is the second day I've seen the committee trying to repeal the germ theory of disease,'' said Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., a bacteriologist. </P>
<P> Shot back McIntosh: ``What we're dealing with is the germ theory of regulations ... it's not the case that life will stop if we don't have regulation.'' </P>
<P> The comment only provoked Slaughter. </P>
<P> ``Life will stop if you die,'' she said. ``You can have on your tombstone, 'Died of lack of regulation.''' </P>
<P> The amendment lost, 26-15. </P>
