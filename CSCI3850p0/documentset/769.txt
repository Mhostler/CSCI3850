<P>  Thousands fled the Woodstock '94 festival Sunday as heavy rains, high winds and thunderstorms turned the grounds into a sea of mud. </P>
<P> Exit roads quickly turned into parking lots jammed with stationary cars of fuming concertgoers anxious to escape their weekend of peace, love, music and mud. </P>
<P> A state police spokesman said there were no plans to declare a state of emergency but urged people to leave early and avoid expected heavy thunderstorms and high winds later in the day. ''This is a window of opportunity. It is going to come down fast and furious,'' he said. </P>
<P> Meanwhile, festival organizers admitted they had dramatically underestimated the crowd that attended Saturday's performance. Instead of the 250,000 figure they originally gave, more than 350,000 attended, they said, with as many as 150,000 getting in free. </P>
<P> They also said that two people had died at the festival of natural causes, 800 were taken to hospitals and another 5,000 were treated at medical tents. People who had crashed gates to get in were now crashing gates to get out. </P>
<P> ``It's like a big giant pigpen,'' said Toronto native Lisa Petrushak, 28, as she and eight friends marched out with their camping gear on their backs. </P>
<P> They were part of a long parade of muddied, disheveled backpackers who streamed over muddy hillsides to gates where buses waited to take them to parking lots miles away. </P>
<P> ``Next time we watch on pay-per-view,'' one angry woman told a man as they climbed down a hill, grabbing at branches to keep from falling, their backs laden with packs and tents. </P>
<P> Security guards, who have been criticized for laxity and even for not showing up for work, said they were happy to see the early departure of Generation X, the code name for Americans in their 20s. </P>
<P> ``Not enough of them are leaving; I am not holding up very well. I've been standing in the rain for two days,'' said one guard as he watched a wave of weary campers slosh through the mud, wiping the rain from their faces. </P>
<P> ``I feel great. I danced naked. It was worth it,'' said a woman named Chris as she left with her boyfriend for the long trip home to Virginia from the farm in Saugerties, some 100 miles north of New York. </P>
<P> Meanwhile on the north field of the concert grounds, others kept dancing despite the rain. The field looked half-empty compared to Saturday's crowd. </P>
<P> ``I don't care if it is a torrential downpour. I want to see 'Porno for Pyros,''' said one young Massachusetts man covered in a black garbage bag that he had turned into a makeshift raincoat. </P>
<P> The alternative rock group was one of several bands scheduled to close the three-day concert marking the 25th anniversary of the original Woodstock that became a milestone moment for the 60s generation. </P>
<P> The original Woodstock was also plagued by heavy rains and one man, John Peel of New Jersey, said, ``This is a little too close to 25 years ago. But I am sticking it out. I've had a blast.'' </P>
<P> Asked to name the highlight of the weekend, he said, ``This morning I had a clean toilet. I was the first one in.'' </P>
<P> During the heavy rains that pounded the field during the night, some rockers took refuge in an Amnesty International booth raising money for Rwanda relief. </P>
<P> ``Light a candle for Rwanda,'' a teenage volunteer asked the drenched visitors as they slipped and stumbled out of the rain. </P>
<P> Many people simply slept in the mud; some appeared to have passed out in drunken stupors, even though alcohol was officially banned. ``I didn't see any toe-tags so I assumed they were alive,'' said one man jokingly of the group of people he had just walked over. </P>
<P> Despite heavy advance planning, the event was hampered by disorganization. The security system fell apart as did the transportation system. The roads leading into the event had to be closed after parking lots filled up and the rain played havoc with the grounds. </P>
