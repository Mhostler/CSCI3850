<P>  Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic urged government forces to prepare for war when a countrywide truce expires in 17 days, but to give politicians a chance to secure peace first, a report said Thursday. </P>
<P> ``When we are negotiating on peace and a ceasefire, you should not prepare to hang your gun on the wall,'' Izetbegovic was quoted as saying in an interview with the Bosnian army's magazine Front Line. </P>
<P> ``The army must do its job, which is to prepare itself (for war) and we civilians must do ours, which is to try, without losing lives, to get for our people what they have a right to: a country and freedom.'' </P>
<P> The much-violated four-month cease-fire between Bosnian government and separatist Serb forces expires at the end of April. </P>
<P> The interview was reported by state news agency Oslobodjenje, which added: ``According to Izetbegovic the army must prepare for a continuation of the war after the cease-fire but it must allow politicians to try to reach a political end to the war first.'' </P>
