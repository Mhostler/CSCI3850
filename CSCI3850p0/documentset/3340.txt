<P>  Russia Tuesday successfully tested its first intercontinental ballistic missile entirely produced at home, the official Itar-Tass news agency said. </P>
<P> It said the TOPOL-M was the first missile manufactured and designed completely in Russia since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. </P>
<P> In the Soviet era, missiles were produced with the help of other republics, notably Ukraine, which provided rocket boosters. </P>
<P> The Interfax news agency said the TOPOL-M was test-fired from the Plesetsk testing ground in the Russian Arctic. </P>
<P> It said the missile would be deployed in silos and mobile ground complexes after five or six tests, but gave no details on the exact timetable. </P>
<P> The commander of Russia's Strategic Missile Forces, Igor Sergeyev, told Tass that the TOPOL-M fully conformed to the provisions of international arms reduction treaties. </P>
