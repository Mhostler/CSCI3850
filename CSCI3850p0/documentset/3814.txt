<P>  Former Secretary of Education Lamar Alexander took a step closer to entering the 1996 race for the presidency Tuesday by announcing the formation of his presidential campaign committee. </P>
<P> Alexander, a Republican, used a stop in the first primary state to mail the necessary paperwork to form the committee from a small post office in this suburban community. </P>
<P> He said he plans to formally declare his candidacy in the last week of February. </P>
<P> ``I'm here to send a message from New Hampshire to Washington that it's time to send responsibility out of Washington back where it belongs, to the states, communities and families and the private sector,'' Alexander, joined by his wife Honey, told reporters Tuesday outside the post office. </P>
<P> The former Tennessee Governor will run in a GOP field that is expected to include such political heavyweights as Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, Texas Senator Phil Gramm and former Vice President Dan Quayle. </P>
<P> Although less known among the general public than many of his primary rivals, GOP insiders say Alexander has built a strong grass roots political network on the state level. </P>
<P> In a 1994 interview with Reuters, Alexander compared himself to a ``country music singer who's been singing in every bar for 25 years and one day is suddenly discovered.'' </P>
<P> Alexander praised the Republicans' 'Contract With America' and the efforts of House Speaker Newt Gingrich, but said he would like Republicans to put more emphasis on cutting the deficit. </P>
<P> Alexander has promoted himself as a political outsider, advocating proposals that would dramatically reduce the scope of the federal government. </P>
<P> Alexander's proposals include dismantling large portions of the federal bureaucracy such as welfare and education and sending their functions back to the states. </P>
<P> He has called for cutting back Congress and relocating some government agencies such as the Agriculture and Interior Departments outside of the capital. </P>
