<DATELINE>PARIS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Prince Rainier of Monaco has denied reports that he would abdicate soon, saying he was grooming his son Prince Albert for the throne and that the transition must be gradual. </P>
<P> ``For the time being, there is no question (of abdication),'' Rainier said in an interview published Thursday. </P>
<P> Speculation that Rainier was preparing to step down after almost 46 years on the throne was fueled by a report in Paris-Match magazine in January. </P>
<P> The magazine said the palace in the tiny principality on the French Riviera had ordered new gold buttons engraved with Albert's initials for police uniforms, after 72-year-old Rainier underwent double heart bypass surgery in November. </P>
<P> ``Prince Albert is still developing his judgment, while actively taking part in government. But no date has been fixed. I do not want a brutal change. The transition must be a gradual one,'' Rainier told the conservative French daily Le Figaro. </P>
<P> Rainier said he was in good health and that he hoped to chair planned 1997 celebrations marking his Grimaldi family's 700 years of ruling Monaco. </P>
<P> French media have suggested that 36-year-old Albert's fondness for nightclubs and supermodels made him unsuitable for the throne. </P>
