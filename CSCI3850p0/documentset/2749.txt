<P> Clinton met NATO Secretary-General Willy Claes at the White House just after NATO unleashed its air power on the air base. </P>
<P> NATO has been ready to hit Serb forces in Croatia after the U.N. Security Council Saturday granted it new powers to strike targets outside Bosnia used by Serb nationalists for attacks on the Bihac area of Bosnia. </P>
