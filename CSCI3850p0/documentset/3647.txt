<DATELINE>MOSCOW (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Russian troops slowly pushing their way into the battered Chechen capital Grozny Monday shelled the central presidential palace from close range, a reporter for national Mayak radio said. </P>
<P> Officials in the neighboring republic of Ingushetia to the west said they had seen at least 75 heavy tanks passing through the region on their way to Chechnya early Monday morning. </P>
<P> The Mayak reporter said in a report from Grozny that smoke was billowing over the town and the sound of artillery shelling and gunfire was incessant. </P>
<P> ``Armored personnel carriers and tanks are, even as I speak, shelling the presidential palace directly from a distance of two or three blocks of houses,'' he said. </P>
<P> A correspondent for Interfax news agency in Grozny said Russian forces controlled two thirds of the city. </P>
<P> The presidential palace, headquarters of Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev and the symbol of the region's three-year revolt against Russian rule, has been severely damaged. </P>
<P> The Mayak reporter said fighting had continued during the night in Grozny, much of which has been destroyed since President Boris Yeltsin sent troops into the region on Dec. 11 to crush Chechnya's independence bid. </P>
<P> Reports Sunday spoke of two columns of Russian troops pushing block by block to within several hundred yards of the blackened palace -- a change in tactics from a disastrous New Year's Eve tank-led push on the city. </P>
<P> ``People who arrived from Grozny said tanks were destroying houses last night to force the defenders out,'' said a parliamentary spokesman in Ingushetia, speaking by telephone from the capital Nazran. </P>
<P> Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who has kept a low profile during the conflict, held a working meeting on Monday to discuss ways of regulating the situation in Chechnya, RIA news agency said. </P>
<P> Russian government statements said troops had ``blockaded'' the palace and said Dudayev had left Grozny last Friday for an unspecified destination in southern Chechnya. </P>
<P> The Russian advance, helped by artillery cover, appeared to be making headway, though at the price of heavy losses. </P>
<P> Outside Grozny, Interfax news agency said Chechen fighters had captured a unit of Russian paratroopers 18 miles southwest of the city and Russian commanders were threatening to bomb the area unless they were released. </P>
<P> Statements by various Russian officials, quoted by Interfax, put the death toll in the Chechen operation by late Friday at 256 servicemen and about 2,500 Chechen fighters. </P>
<P> Yeltsin allies continued to defend the operation, saying the Kremlin leader was upholding the country's fragile constitution. </P>
<P> ``The operation will be conducted to the end, with a positive outcome,'' Anatoly Dolgolaptyev, deputy chairman of the upper house of parliament, told NTV. ``The army has shown moral courage and is performing in worthy fashion.'' </P>
<P> But criticism of Yeltsin's actions is becoming blunter. </P>
<P> National television showed Russian soldiers' bodies uncollected on Grozny streets and played sombre music. </P>
<P> Author Anatoly Pristavkin said the action was a ``national tragedy. The house is on fire and there's no one to save it.'' </P>
<P> Yeltsin is also likely to come under fierce attack when the State Duma lower house of parliament meets to discuss the crisis Wednesday. Outspoken human rights commissioner Sergei Kovalyov is due to address the session. </P>
<P> France warned Moscow Monday the campaign risked setting back efforts to build new ties to Europe. </P>
<P> ``If the situation continues to deteriorate, if the repression continues and if human rights are again flouted, we will have other ways of responding,'' French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said. </P>
<P> ``Russia wants to join the Council of Europe, and there is also a partnership agreement between Russia and the European Union, which contains a clause on human rights,'' he said in an interview published in the French daily Liberation. </P>
<P> Vice President Al Gore said he had warned Yeltsin last month that military action would be a ``terrible mistake.'' </P>
