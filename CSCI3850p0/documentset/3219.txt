<P>  Talks between striking baseball players and major league club owners broke off with no agreement Wednesday, leaving the owners headed for Chicago where they are expected to impose work rules and a salary cap. </P>
<P> The owners of the 28 major league teams are scheduled to meet in Chicago Thursday and members of the management negotiating committee have said they will likely delcare an impasse in the labor negotiations and implement work rules. </P>
<P> In addition to imposing a salary cap -- the key issue that caused players to strike in August -- the owners are expected to eliminate salary arbitration and drastically alter free agency, if they implement work rules. </P>
<P> ``We will make a recommendation along the lines of implementation,'' said Boxton Red Sox executive John Harrington, chief negotiator for the owners. </P>
<P> ``We had some hope this morning that today would be productive,'' Harrington said after talks broke off Wednesday afternoon. </P>
<P> The owners, bowing to pressure from federal mediator William Usery, last week agreed to delay implementing their salary cap plan so negotiations could continue in the hope of breaking the deadlock. </P>
<P> At Usery's urging, the two sides held marathon meetings that went until well after midnight on Monday and Tuesday. Over the course of those talks, the union rejected the latest proposal by the owners and the owners turned down counter-proposals from the players. </P>
<P> ``Club owners and management are quite disappointed at leaving Rye Brook without an agreement,'' Harrington said. </P>
<P> ``The clubs have made every effor to settle this dispute with the players, nonetheless we remain deadlocked at this time on the central issue of cost control.'' </P>
<P> Union chief negotiator Donald Fehr said the players had been bargaining in good faith, ``unless bargaining in good faith is giving the owners everything they want.'' </P>
<P> ``No one can question that the players' moves were very substantial, consistent with what they believe of course, but designed to try and get this over with,'' Fehr said. </P>
<P> ``We'll just have to wait and see what they do in Chicago before we take any further steps,'' added Fehr. </P>
<P> ``We made four counter-proposals...and they didn't seem to want have any further discussion about it,'' said Fehr, who claimed that all the management proposals contained some form of salary cap. </P>
<P> If the owners go ahead with their threat to impose work rules, the union is expected to file an unfair labor practices charge with the National Labor Relations Board and seek an injunction. </P>
<P> Usery, who has helped negotiate ends to strikes by coal miners and National Football League players, said no matter what happens he still has much work to do. </P>
<P> ``I'm disappointed. I still have a dispute to mediate,'' Usery said. </P>
<P> ``This is a bump in the road. We ran out of time. Even if they implement we still have to mediate and bargain. It's the owners' right to implement, just as it was the players' right to strike.'' </P>
<P> The owners have said that if a new collective bargaining agreement was not in place in time for spring training, they would urge athletes to cross picket line and field replacement players for the 1995 season, if necessary. </P>
<P> Atlanta Braves ace pitcher Tom Glavine, a member of the union negotiating committee, summed up the players' feelings after talks broke down. </P>
<P> ``It's a disappointing day. We are sad and worried about what it does to the future of the game,'' Glavine said. </P>
<P> ``We are not about to sell our freedom at any price.'' </P>
