<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Former Vice President Dan Quayle said Sunday he will decide early next year whether to run for president in 1996. </P>
<P> Quayle said he would make a decision ``probably not before the first of the year, but not too long after that.'' </P>
<P> Asked if he could mount a credible challenge for the presidency after coming under so much fire during his tenure as vice president, Quayle said much would depend on the media. </P>
<P> ``If in fact I decide to run in 1996, you in the media will have to ... report what I have to say, you'll have to report my ideas, my vision for America -- and more importantly what the people think about my ideas,'' he told CNN's ``Late Edition.'' </P>
<P> But things would also be different, he noted, since he would be the number-one candidate on the ticket. </P>
<P> ``If I decide to run, it would be a lot different. I won't be number two, I won't have to be subservient to someone else,'' Quayle said. ``It won't be someone else's agenda; it'll be mine.'' </P>
<P> Quayle said he was outraged over crime and violence in America, as well as the ``break-down of the family.'' It was important to engage America's citizens in a dialogue, rather than expecting government to solve those problems, he said. </P>
<P> During the last presidential campaign, Quayle created a brouhaha when he suggested that a plot development in the hit television show ``Murphy Brown'' which involved the title character having a baby out of wedlock, was symptomatic of the declining morality of the nation. </P>
<P> The former vice president declined comment on a report in Newsweek magazine that then-President George Bush realized by June 1992 that he would have a better chance at a second term without Quayle on the ticket, but was too squeamish about ''pulling the trigger.'' </P>
<P> Monday Newsweek will publish excerpts from a new book, ''Quest for the Presidency 1992'', which said Bush felt Quayle had become the ``mouthpiece for the party's farther right'' and could cost him valuable votes. </P>
<P> ``George Bush and I had a very good working relationship. If I thought that I was hurting him, I would have stepped aside,'' Quayle said. ``I thought just the opposite, and think I proved that during the campaign.'' </P>
