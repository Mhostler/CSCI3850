<DATELINE>CALAPAN, Philippines (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The people of Mindoro buried their dead Wednesday, the day after an earthquake and tidal waves ravaged their central Philippine island and killed at least 62 people. </P>
<P> Many of the victims were buried in the municipal cemetery in Calapan, the provincial capital of Oriental Mindoro, which bore the brunt of the quake before dawn Tuesday. </P>
<P> Morticians in the town of 100,000 said they had to bury the victims quickly after they ran short of embalming fluid. </P>
<P> Among those buried were victims from Baco, a small town near Calapan and close to the epicenter of the quake, which measured 7.0 on the Richter scale. </P>
<P> Many of those killed were young children who drowned when their homes were hit by waves up to 50 feet high that followed the quake, officials said. </P>
<P> Rescue workers said they had found some children's bodies hanging from trees, thrown there by the force of the waves. </P>
<P> A Japanese academic, Professor Yuji Murata, who was trapped on Mindoro's Mount Halcon with two Filipino companions by landslides, was rescued early Wednesday. </P>
<P> Murata, a professor at Tokyo Nodei University, was picked up by a military helicopter from a tribal settlement about halfway up the 8,479-foot mountain. </P>
<P> More than 1,300 aftershocks followed the quake, 189 of them strong enough to rattle the nerves of people still in shock, seismologists said. The strongest measured 5.1 on the Richter scale. </P>
<P> Hundreds of people who lost their homes to the tidal waves that smashed ashore after the quake or were too nervous to stay inside, crowded into the grounds of Calapan's hospital for the night. </P>
<P> Inside the small hospital, the hallways were crowded with injured lying on the floor or anywhere there was room. </P>
<P> ``They are in the hospital hallways because there is no more space. The hospital is too small,'' said provincial health officer Dr Romeo Infantado. </P>
<P> The coastal town of Baco, swamped by the tidal waves that followed the tremor, was virtually deserted the day after the quake as survivors trudged toward Calapan with a few belongings. </P>
<P> The water had receded, but overturned trees, smashed wood and palm thatch houses and dark mud marked the passage of the tidal wave. </P>
<P> The road between the two towns was impassable to vehicles after being broken apart by gaping cracks, but the motorbikes with sidecars that act as taxis in much of the rural Philippines could still get through. </P>
<P> One driver, his head bandaged from the cuts he received when concrete blocks fell on him and his family as they slept, was ferrying people away from Baco. </P>
<P> ``I've got no money. I've got to continue my job,'' he said. </P>
<P> This was the worst earthquake to strike the Philippines since July 1990 when nearly 1,600 people died in the mountainous north of Luzon island, including more than 370 people in the resort of Baguio. </P>
<P> The quake on Mindoro, about 90 miles south of Manila, badly damaged at least 19 bridges, smashed roads and knocked out power and the water system. </P>
<P> Officials said a 74-megawatt power barge that provided electricity to Calapan had been swept up a river by the tidal wave after being torn from its moorings. </P>
<P> It was damaged and may have to be repaired before electricity can start to be restored to much of the island. </P>
