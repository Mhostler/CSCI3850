<P>  South Carolina police put out a nationwide all points bulletin late Wednesday for a man who forced a woman out of her car at gunpoint then drove off with her two small children, and said a reward may be forthcoming. </P>
<P> The Union County Sheriff's office said the Tuesday night carjacking occurred while the woman, Susan Smith, was stopped at a traffic light in Union, some 25 miles south of Spartanburg. The man entered the passenger side of her car with a handgun and told her to drive. </P>
<P> ``She proceeded to drive approximately five to six miles, where he told her to stop the car and get out,'' said Roger Gregory, captain at the sheriff's office. </P>
<P> The woman got out of the car and asked the man to let her get her 14-month-old and 3-year-old sons out of the back seat. </P>
<P> ``He said, 'I don't have time, I'm not going to hurt them,' and drove off and left her standing there,'' Rogers said Smith told police. </P>
<P> A spokesman for the sheriff's office said a reward had not yet been issued due to the short lapse of time. The carjacking occurred at about 9 p.m. EDT Tuesday and authorities said the reward could be issued once 36 hours had passed. </P>
<P> Announcement of a reward may come at a press conference at the sheriff's office 8 a.m. EDT Thursday. </P>
