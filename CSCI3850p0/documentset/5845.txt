<DATELINE>MANAMA, April 19 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Gulf Arab states promised on Wednesday to support measures taken by Bahrain to restore order following anti-government protests and said they were determined to fight extremism in the region. </P>
<P> Interior ministers from the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) held an extraordinary meeting in Manama until late on Tuesday to discuss the protests in the island state which Manama has blamed on a foreign-backed extremist group. </P>
<P> ``Gulf Cooperation Council states stand by Bahrain and fully support measures taken to maintain security and stability which is inseparable from the security of all GCC states,'' a statement read by GCC Secretary-General Sheikh Fahim al-Qassimi said. </P>
<P> ``The GCC states denounce the phenomenon of extremism and reject all acts...and are determined to fight this destructive phenomenon which is alien to Islam,'' it said. </P>
<P> The GCC alliance groups Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait. </P>
<P> Bahrain called for the meeting as part of efforts to confront anti-government protests which broke out on December 5 after the detention of a young Shi'ite cleric, Sheikh Ali Salman, who was later deported with three clerics. </P>
<P> Bahrain's Interior Minister Sheikh Mohammad Bin Khalifa al-Khalifa said violence and riots were carried out by ``extremist elements which are misled and backed from abroad to shake stability by violence, killing and damaging public and private institutions.'' </P>
<P> ``Extremist religious leaders are leading the events which are linked to external party organisations and backed by a foreign power,'' he said, without naming the party or power. </P>
<P> Diplomats say the Islamic Front for the Liberation of Bahrain, an exiled Shi'ite Moslem group, had been fanning dissent with leaflets sent to residents by fax from Beirut and London. </P>
<P> Arson attacks and riots have largely stopped in the past few days after police, backed by armoured vehicles, stepped up security in villages mainly west of the capital Manama although minor protests were reported in some schools this week. </P>
<P> At least 10 civilians and three policemen were killed and hundreds arrested during the months of unrest demanding the release of political prisoners and restoration of parliament, dissolved by the government in 1975. </P>
<P> ``We have met for hours...issues have been agreed upon and ... they would serve the security of the region,'' Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef Bin Abdul-Aziz told reporters. He added they decided on practical steps but gave no details. </P>
<P> ``I believe the statement is clear and indicates that our views were identical and that security of GCC states is inseparable,'' Prince Nayef said. </P>
