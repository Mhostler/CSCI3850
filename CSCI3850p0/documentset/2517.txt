<DATELINE>NEW YORK, (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The young woman who has accused rapper Tupac Shakur of sexually assaulting and sodomizing her in his hotel room last year was set up by the rap artist and his colleagues, the prosecutor said Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``Gang bang. That is what they did to her. They set her up and she never knew what hit her,'' said prosecutor Melissa Mourges, slamming the table in front of the jury box in Manhattan Supreme Court and pointing to Shakur on the first day of the trial. </P>
<P> Police have alleged that Shakur, 23, and his road manager, Charles Fuller, 24, of California, forcibly sodomized and sexually abused the 20-year-old woman in Shakur's 38th floor hotel suite in Manhattan last Nov. 18. </P>
<P> The two men also face weapons charges for possession of two guns found in the suite. A third man charged in the alleged attack, Ricardo Brown, 30, of Florida, does not face weapons charges. All three men have pleaded innocent. </P>
<P> In her opening statement, the prosecutor described what happened when three men burst in on the woman and Shakur while they were kissing in his hotel suite. </P>
<P> ``They held her, they stripped her of her underwear, they groped her, they terrorized her, they took turns sodomizing her and when it was over, they held her until she stopped crying,'' Mourges said. </P>
<P> ``These are my boys. What you do for me, you will do for them,'' the prosecutor said Shakur told the woman. </P>
<P> ``A hundred things happened to her at once,'' the prosecutor said as she next detailed in graphic sexual language how the men performed oral sex on the woman and fondled her buttocks as she cried hysterically. </P>
<P> ``I can't believe he did this. I thought Tupac liked me,'' the prosecutor quoted the woman as telling Fuller. </P>
<P> ``He likes you so much that he decided to share you with his friends. There are millions of girls in your shoes that wish they were you,'' Mourges quoted Fuller as telling her. </P>
<P> Shakur's Lawyer Michael Warren said the alleged victim was not credible. </P>
<P> He described in detail how the alleged victim got down on a nightclub floor four days before the alleged crime and performed oral sex on Shakur ``before everyone in the club.'' </P>
<P> The prosecutor also told the court that the alleged victim and Shakur had ``consensual sex'' on the same night, Nov. 14. The woman is expected to testify Thursday. </P>
