<P>  Austrian Alpine ski champion Anita Wachter has been sidelined for the rest of the season by a knee injury that required surgery and a torn ankle ligament. </P>
<P> Wachter, 27, underwent surgery on a torn ligament in her left knee Wednesday night in her home town of Schruns in western Austria. </P>
<P> ``It's a shame. I was in good shape and feeling good on my skis,'' Wachter told Reuters. </P>
<P> ``But I will be back next season,'' the 1993 world champion added. </P>
<P> Wachter suffered the injuries in a fall during slalom training in Obdach Wednesday. Her doctor, Christian Schenk, said she would be off her skis for up to eight weeks. </P>
<P> She is due to start physiotherpay Monday. </P>
<P> Last Saturday, Wachter produced two flawless runs to win a women's World Cup giant slalom in Are, Sweden. That came after victories last month in a super-giant slalom in Haus, Austria, and a giant slalom in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy. </P>
<P> ``Better to finish with a good feeling than a bad feeling,'' said the Austrian, who had started the season slowly. </P>
<P> Schenk said Wachter had torn the same knee ligament in March 1992, although in a different place. </P>
<P> He said Wednesday's knee surgery presented no complications, but the ankle injury -- which was not operated on -- could prove more of a problem. It was decided to give it more time. </P>
