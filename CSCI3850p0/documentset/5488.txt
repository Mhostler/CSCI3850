<P>  Lottery fever gripped Florida Wednesday as buyers snapped up tickets for a state lotto jackpot that stood at $81 million and could go higher by the time of the draw on Saturday. </P>
<P> Lottery players were buying up tickets at a rate of 8,700 per minute at noon Wednesday, Florida lottery spokesman Ed George said. </P>
<P> The grand prize has been building for a month. </P>
<P> ``There's no telling how high it will go. A couple of years ago we had a triple rollover that went to $86 million,'' George said. </P>
<P> The $81 million jackpot represented the fourth-largest lottery prize in the state's history. The largest, $106 million in 1990, was claimed by five winners. </P>
<P> Although Wednesday's ticket-buying rate was high, it was nowhere near the record. On the day of the draw for the $106 million jackpot five years ago, tickets were sold at a rate of 46,000 per minute. </P>
<P> If the jackpot is not won this week, the rollover grand prize could eclipse the national record of $118 million set by the California lottery in April 1991, George said. </P>
<P> ``It all depends, but it would start in the area of $100 million and it would probably set a new national record,'' he said. </P>
