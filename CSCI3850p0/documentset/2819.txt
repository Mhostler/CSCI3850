<P>  South Korea's opposition leader Lee Ki-taek said Friday he was quitting parliament to protest a prosecution decision not to charge two former presidents for staging a military coup in 1979. </P>
<P> But Lee said he would remain as the head of the main opposition Democratic Party. </P>
<P> Lee urged his parliamentary collegues to follow his example to bring pressure on President Kim Young-sam to prosecute his two immediate predecessors Chun Doo Hwan and Roh Tae-woo. </P>
<P> ``I want an early general election after the current National Assembly is dissolved,'' Lee told a news conference. </P>
<P> State prosecutors said last month ex-presidents Chun and Roh and 32 others had staged a military coup in 1979, but said they would not indict them for the sake of national unity. </P>
<P> Lee's Democratic Party has boycotted parliament for the past three weeks to back demands for their prosecution. </P>
