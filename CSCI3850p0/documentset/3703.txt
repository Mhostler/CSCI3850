<P>  A Kenyan business tycoon charged with stealing nearly $190 million was released Wednesday after managing to raise bail set two days earlier, court officials said. </P>
<P> Kamlesh Pattni is accused of stealing 8.5 billion shillings ($189 million) from the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK). He has been in custody since November and Monday a high court judge ordered him released on bail pending trial. </P>
<P> Bail was set at $222,000. Half of it was to be paid in cash by Pattni and the other half in the form of two Kenyan sureties, court officials said. </P>
<P> But up to Tuesday evening, the local billionaire of Asian origin remained in prison after he failed to gather the Kenyan sureties. </P>
<P> ``I have accepted the sureties tendered in court today (Wednesday). He has been released,'' the Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions, Bernard Chunga, told reporters. </P>
<P> According to the prosecution, Pattni committed the offenses between April and July 1993. He has been charged with former senior government officials who were already granted bail by a lower court. </P>
<P> Until his arrest last November in the case known as the Goldenberg scandal after Pattni's Goldenberg International company, the tycoon enjoyed close links with members of Kenya's political elite. </P>
<P> The Goldenberg case involved the alleged export of gold and diamonds, which were covered by government export rebates in foreign exchange. </P>
<P> It is believed to be the biggest fraud in Kenyan history. </P>
