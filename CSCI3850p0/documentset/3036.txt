<P>  Mexican peasant rebels threatened new violence in Chiapas Tuesday, saying they were no longer bound by an 11-month cease-fire because the government had refused to hand over power in the strife-torn state. </P>
<P> ``The Zapatista National Liberation Army considers itself free of its commitment to stick to the cease-fire,'' Subcomandante Marcos, a leader of the Zapatista National Liberation Army, told a news conference in a jungle clearing in the heart of rebel-held territory. </P>
<P> Marcos, surrounded by dozens of masked guerrillas, did not specify what military action the Zapatistas might take and admitted their military weakness. </P>
<P> But he said the government had broken the cease-fire by insisting that governor-elect Eduardo Robledo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) will take office Thursday despite opposition claims of fraud in the Chiapas state elections in August. </P>
<P> He said the Zapatistas ``recognized Robledo's swearing-in as the formal rupturing of the cease-fire by the federal government.'' </P>
<P> Marcos rejected President Ernesto Zedillo's offer of secret negotiations to end the conflict that erupted Jan. 1. He said Robledo's resignation and his replacement by defeated gubernatorial candidate Amado Avendano were pre-conditions for talks. </P>
<P> He launched a bitter attack on Zedillo and his government, which took office Thursday, and urged opposition leaders to force Zedillo's resignation with massive civil demonstrations across the country. </P>
<P> The Zapatistas launched their rebellion by taking over several cities in the southern state, but fighting ended when the government and rebels agreed to a cease-fire Jan. 12. </P>
<P> While he avoided giving details on the rebels' military plans, Marcos implied they would push unrest into Chiapas towns and villages where they have civilian support but which lie outside their formal zone of control in the mountainous jungle areas bordering Guatemala. </P>
<P> He said the army has the Zapatista zones surrounded and has moved troops into key positions restricting the rebel army's capacity to attack. </P>
<P> He said the Mexican army's position was clearly superior. </P>
<P> ``Unfortunately, we can do nothing in military or political terms,'' said Marcos. </P>
