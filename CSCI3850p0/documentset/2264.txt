<P>  Russia said Thursday that a major oil spill in the Arctic could greatly endanger the environment although there was no sign the leak had affected the Pechora River, which empties into the Barents Sea. </P>
<P> ``This is potentially a very dangerous accident for the environment,'' Alexander Shuval, press head of the Environment Ministry, told a news conference. </P>
<P> A team of Russian experts has flown to the area in the Komi ethnic republic. Shulman stuck to earlier Russian estimates, which put the amount of oil spilled there as 14,000 metric tons, or 98,000 barrels. </P>
<P> But U.S. experts say up to two million barrels of oil has leaked into the water table. American officials say the cause of the oil leak -- a ruptured pipeline -- has not yet been adequately repaired. </P>
<P> Itar-Tass news agency issued a long report Wednesday quoting local experts as saying ``a number of foreign and Russian media'' had ``overstated'' the scale of the disaster. </P>
<P> The Minister for Emergency Situations, Sergei Shoigu, said Wednesday the leak had already caused damage totalling $20.3 million. </P>
