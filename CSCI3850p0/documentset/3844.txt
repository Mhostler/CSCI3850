<P>  U.S. Ambassador to Tokyo Walter Mondale Thursday defended the competence of Japan's earthquake relief effort amid complaints that the authorities had been ill-prepared. </P>
<P> ``I defy anybody to look good with a tragedy like this which is a major national disaster,'' he said in an interview from Tokyo on the NBC ``Today'' program three days after the disastrous earthquake. </P>
<P> ``I mean I think it's easy to criticize. Its another thing to get everything you need right away on the ground when communications and everything else is interrupted. I think a little common sense here is in order,'' Mondale added. </P>
<P> Mondale said the United States, which has been flying in blankets and is sending a team of quake relief experts, was prepared to do more if Japan requested. </P>
<P> ``We have been talking to the Japanese government about a whole range of additional assistance that we're prepared to bring if they need it,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``Bear in mind one thing, the Japanese are good at this...we just want to come in and help them where they think we can be of special help,'' he said. </P>
