<P>  Peruvian troops backed by helicopter gunships Tuesday continued their assault on a border post held by Ecuador in a bloody 13-day border dispute, a Peruvian television network reported. </P>
<P> Ecuadoran forces had fired land-to-land missiles against Peruvian positions Monday, causing several casualties, the Panamericana network said from the war zone, refuting reports that Peru had recaptured the Tiwinza base. </P>
<P> ``The information from army personnel taking part in the operations indicates that the Tiwinza zone has not yet been totally recovered,'' its correspondent said by telephone from Santa Maria de Nieva, 540 miles northeast of Lima. </P>
<P> He said helicopter gunships were ``constantly'' arriving and leaving a nearby military base and the two countries had been fighting over the Tiwinza since Saturday. </P>
<P> After the attack by Ecuadoran missiles, several wounded Peruvian soldiers were taken out of the war zone for medical treatment, he added. </P>
<P> Ecuadoran President Sixto Duran Ballen late Monday denied television reports from Lima that Peruvian troops had fully recovered the Tiwinza base. </P>
<P> The fighting has taken place a few miles inside the Peruvian border on the Cenepa River where Ecuadoran forces have established a presence, Peruvian officials said. Ecuador said its troops were attacked inside their territory. </P>
<P> The disputed area is a 48-mile stretch of Amazon Jungle which was not demarcated in a treaty that resolved a 10-day border war in 1941. </P>
