<P>  The leader of the breakaway self-declared republic of Somaliland said Thursday his forces defeated rebel militiamen in the capital Hargeisa in two days of battles. </P>
<P> Residents said Hargeisa was relatively calm Thursday, but civilians were staying indoors because they feared an outbreak of more fighting with the rebels holding positions to the east. </P>
<P> Mohamed Ibrahim Egal, president of the republic carved out of northwest Somalia, told Reuters by telephone from Hargeisa that many more than 30 people had been killed and more than 100 were wounded. </P>
<P> He said the main hospital was overflowing with casualties. </P>
<P> ``Some of the terrorists are still in town but they are in hiding and there is no shooting today (Thursday),'' Egal said. </P>
<P> The battles pitted Egal's Habr Awal clan militiamen against militiamen allied to the region's former ruler Abdurahman Ahmed Ali ``Tur'' who were driven out of Hargeisa airport last month. </P>
<P> ``Yesterday and the day before there was fierce fighting in town with the terrorists hiding behind the civilian population and shooting indiscriminately at everybody. But my forces have defeated them,'' Egal said. </P>
<P> ``The toll is much higher than 30 killed and 100 wounded. </P>
<P> ``We don't have an exact count but the hospital is now full of wounded civilians. Out of the security forces only six were wounded and two killed. I don't know how many terrorists were killed,'' he added. </P>
<P> ``We have captured all their long-range artillery pieces and all their ordnance,'' said Egal, adding his forces would ``finish them once and for all'' instead of letting them escape again. </P>
<P> Residents said fighting started Tuesday when militiamen aboard a technical, a battlewagon mounted with a heavy weapon, opened fire on Hargeisa police station, wrecking part of it, and then moved on to the main market shooting indiscriminately. </P>
<P> They said Egal's forces had counterattacked and Wednesday drove almost all the attackers out of central Hargeisa. </P>
<P> Some 20 foreign relief workers from the United Nations and other agencies abandoned Hargeisa by road where fighting began. </P>
<P> Hundreds of terrified civilians fled on foot through the streets as clans duelled with mortars and anti-aircraft guns. </P>
<P> Northwest Somalia was devastated by a civil war that erupted in 1988 and spread to the southern capital Mogadishu, where rebels ousted dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in January 1991. </P>
<P> Egal said after being driven out of the airport last month the militiamen regrouped about 25 miles from Hargeisa before launching ``a terrorist raid'' on the capital Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``They were shooting at everybody and using people as shields,'' he said, his voice shaking with anger. </P>
<P> He last month vowed his forces would chase the militiamen from the airport to Ethiopia but they had failed to do so. </P>
<P> ``That is the biggest mistake they made -- my love for peace. I wish I had chased them to Ethiopia but I thought they would stay out and they didn't. We must finish them once and for all,'' he said. </P>
<P></P>
<P> ``We weren't fighting for international recognition. I am giving up on the international community. They could recognize us tomorrow or they can wait for another 10 years. I don't know. </P>
<P> ``We are making our plans without them and living our lives.'' </P>
<P> Ismail Buba, a spokesman in Mogadishu for ``Tur,'' a nickname which means ``The Hunchback,'' said Wednesday his militiamen had overrun Hargeisa and Egal had fled to the port of Berbera. Buba said 70 of Egal's troops were killed and 200 were captured. </P>
<P> Somaliland, a territory ruled by Britain from 1886 until after World War II, merged with the rest of Somalia at independence in 1960 and seceded four months after Barre's fall. </P>
<P> It escaped most of the clan feuding that hit the rest of Somalia and caused a 1992 famine in which 300,000 people died. </P>
<P> Politicking by Mogadishu warlord Mohamed Farah Aideed succeeded recently in peeling ``Tur'' away from the Somaliland leadership, prompting him to denounce its territorial integrity. </P>
