<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin suggested for the first time publicly Monday that Israeli troops might remain in Palestinian West Bank towns during its elections. </P>
<P> Under a historic peace deal, some two million Palestinians are due to hold elections in the West Bank, still occupied by Israel, and in Gaza and Jericho which have been both under Palestinian self-rule since May. </P>
<P> Rumors that Israel was insisting they vote under the barrels of Israeli guns had angered Palestinian leaders. Rabin's remarks, to Israel Radio, were his first in public to suggest such a move was under consideration. </P>
<P> ``We have yet to reach a clear answer and the clarifications will continue,'' he told Israel Radio on a flight to Tokyo from Oslo where he shared the Nobel Peace Prize with his foreign minister Shimon Peres and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat. </P>
<P> ``What we must decide ... is are we going at this stage to enter into negotiations on the whole arrangement, or are we going to find a solution to advance elections without the thing requiring the withdrawal from the population centers.'' </P>
<P> Rabin said this would be a temporary measure enabling elections to go ahead while ensuring Israeli security. Israeli spokesman Oded Ben-Ami told Reuters in Jerusalem that any arrangement would require the Palestinians' agreement. </P>
<P> ``Obviously everything must be by complete agreement,'' Ben-Ami said. Arafat and Peres arrived in Sweden Monday for talks aimed at resolving the dispute and teams from both sides will meet in Cairo Wednesday and Thursday. </P>
<P> Israel has handed over Jericho in the West Bank and most of the Gaza Strip to Arafat and turned over control in five spheres in the West Bank - education, health, taxation, tourism and welfare. </P>
<P> Problems remain implementing other parts of the deal. Elections were due to take place in July. </P>
<P> Under the Israeli-PLO peace accord sealed with a handshake 15 months ago, Israel must redeploy its West Bank troops by the eve of elections, ``guided by the principle that its military forces should be redeployed outside populated areas.'' </P>
<P> These would include Hebron, Jenin, Nablus, Ramallah and Tulkarm -- all West Bank towns and cities close to Jewish settlements. Rabin has been reluctant to redeploy in light of Muslim militant attacks that have killed scores of Israelis. </P>
<P> In Oslo over the weekend, Arafat accused Israel of delaying Palestinian elections. Rabin said he hoped elections could take place next year but called attacks by anti-peace Muslim groups ``the main obstacle.'' </P>
<P> In Tokyo Rabin told his Japanese counterpart that terrorism continued to pose a serious obstacle to lasting peace in the Middle East. </P>
<P> Rabin did not mention the election issue in his talks with Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama. </P>
