<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  So-called Hollywood Madam Heidi Fleiss, whose potential ``black book'' revelations sent a wave of near-panic through studio executive suites, was found guilty Friday of three counts of procuring women for prostitution but innocent of possessing cocaine for sale. </P>
<P> The jury of seven men and five women told Superior Court Judge Judith Champagne they could not agree on the remaining two charges of pandering, and the judge dismissed the panel. </P>
<P> Deputy District Attorney Alan Carter, who prosecuted Fleiss, told reporters after the verdict that under California law she would have to go to jail for a minimum of three years -- one year for each offense -- and could face as much as eight years and eight months in prison. </P>
<P> Fleiss was visibly upset by the verdicts, laying her head on the defense table as they were read out by the jury forewoman, and slamming her hands down on the table. </P>
<P> Her lead defense attorney, Anthony Brooklier, said Fleiss was ``disappointed'' with the verdicts. He said he would appeal the mandatory sentence of three years. </P>
<P> ``At some point somebody has to say this is a little ridiculous, that you have to go to jail for pandering. You don't have to go to jail for voluntary manslaughter. So at some point we'll be contesting this,'' Brooklier said. </P>
<P> The jury forewoman, Sheila Mitrowski, a Pacific Bell telephone company employee, on being informed by reporters of the minimum sentence, said, ``That's too much, way too much. You've got kids out on the street doing drugs. They get probation.'' </P>
<P> Champagne set a provisional sentencing date of Jan. 20 and released Fleiss on $75,000 bail until then. </P>
<P> The case gained worldwide publicity in anticipation of well-known names that might be revealed from Fleiss' much-heralded ``black book.'' But Champagne ordered the book sealed, saying it had nothing to do with the specific charges. </P>
<P> During his prosecution of Fleiss, Carter claimed the 28-year-old bespectacled daughter of a prominent Beverly Hills doctor ran a high-priced call girl ring catering to Hollywood's rich and famous. </P>
<P> The jury heard from four undercover detectives who posed as wealthy Japanese businessman, who said Fleiss had agreed to provide them with prostitutes and cocaine and that each call girl was to have received $1,500 for having sex with them. </P>
<P> The jury also saw several videotapes of the police sting operation, in which the women began undressing in front of undercover detectives before other officers burst into the luxury suite hired for the occasion at the Beverly Hilton Hotel and arrested them. </P>
<P> The panel also heard an audiotape of a telephone conversation between Fleiss and Beverly Hills detective Sammy Lee in which she repeatedly said that supplying girls and cocaine would be ``no problem.'' </P>
<P> Fleiss' lawyers claimed their client was entrapped by the police sting and that if Lee had not called her requesting girls and drugs, no crime would have taken place. </P>
<P> Under California law, a defendant can be found not guilty if the jury decides that person was induced by police into committing a crime he or she would not otherwise have committed. </P>
<P> In the most recent celebrated case in the 1980s, carmaker John DeLorean was found innocent of drug smuggling after a jury found he was ensnared in a police trap to do something totally alien to his nature. </P>
<P> In telephone conversations with Lee, however, Fleiss was heard boasting that she was ``the best in the business'' and had achieved what no one else had been able to do. </P>
<P> She was arrested in June, 1993, along with the four women she had recruited as prostitutes, following the police sting. </P>
<P> The jury took four-and-a-half days to reach its verdicts after hearing six days of testimony. </P>
<P> In addition to the entrapment defense, Fleiss' attorneys, Anthony Brooklier and Donald Marks, claimed that prostitution was a victimless crime largely tolerated in the United States and that police in Los Angeles made a point of targeting female prostitutes, while never prosecuting male customers. </P>
<P> The jury found Fleiss guilty of procuring three women, Kimberly Burch, Brandi McLaine and Peggy Schinke, to be prostitutes, but deadlocked on a fourth woman, Samantha Burdette, on two counts of pandering. </P>
<P> Burdette told the jury she was already a high-priced call girl who charged up to $10,000 for a ``date.'' </P>
<P> Fleiss and her father, Dr Paul Fleiss, have also been charged with laundering money from the lucrative call girl ring to hide the proceeds and are due in federal court in Los Angeles Jan. 27. Both have pleaded innocent to the charges. </P>
