<P>  Controversy has erupted over allegations in a new book that Canada's military spy agency eavesdropped on communications between the government of France and the province of Quebec during the mid-1970s. </P>
<P> The allegations are contained in the book ``Spyworld'' written by long-time Communications Security Establishment (CSE) communications officer Mike Frost and by a former press secretary to former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, Michel Gratton. </P>
<P> The book says that Canada asked Norway and probably two other Scandinavian countries if they could intercept communications between the province of Quebec and France in the mid-1970s. </P>
<P> The apparent aim was to find out what France and Quebec were saying to each other during a period when Quebec was ruled by a government advocating that the French-speaking province separate from Canada. </P>
<P> ``All I know is that they (Norway) kept doing it for us and we got a lot of stuff, mainly telexes,'' Frost said in the book, unveiled at a news conference Thursday. </P>
<P> The book also alleges that the Canadian embassy in Morocco used high-tech electronics to capture information sent between France and Canada about Quebec separation. </P>
<P> The leader of a party which advocates Quebec separation in the Canadian Parliament, Lucien Bouchard, demanded on Thursday that the Canadian government give assurances the Defense Department's intelligence agency never spied on politicians from Quebec. </P>
<P> Deputy Prime Minister Sheila Copps defended the military intelligence agency. ``The activities of the CSE (defense spy agency) are in no way directed against Canadians, including those in public life,'' Copps told Parliament. </P>
<P> But the newly-elected separatist government of Quebec promised to investigate the allegations and said if they check out ``it would be a very serious offense.'' </P>
<P> ``I think this puts Canadian democracy in question. It's unacceptable,'' Louise Beaudoin, Quebec's intergovernmental affairs minister, told the Canadian Press news agency Thursday. </P>
<P> A new Parti Quebecois government was elected in Quebec in September and has vowed to hold a referendum next year on whether the province should separate from Canada. </P>
<P> The Parti Quebecois also held power in Quebec during the period when the alleged spying took place. </P>
<P> The book also claims the spy agency had a special section devoted to what it called the ``French problem.'' </P>
<P> Frost left the agency, under the control of Canada's Department of Defense, in 1990 after working there for 19 years. </P>
