<P>  Colin Ferguson, convicted of killing six people in a shooting spree on a commuter train, asked a judge Monday to throw out his convictions because he did not have time to build a defense while acting as his own lawyer. </P>
<P> Ferguson, wearing a dark blue suit and shackles around his waist and wrists, gave a rambling 1 3/8- hour list of complaints before Nassau County Court Judge Donald Belfi. </P>
<P> Belfi denied Ferguson's request. </P>
<P> Ferguson, 37, was convicted last month of killing six people and wounding 19 others on an evening rush-hour Long Island Rail Road train on Dec. 7, 1993. </P>
<P> After a bizarre trial in which he acted as his own attorney, he was found guilty of six counts of second-degree murder, 19 counts of attempted murder and other charges. </P>
<P> On Monday, Ferguson also introduced a motion claiming two of the victims were not actually on the train, arguing one of them claimed to be a victim to cover up that he was shot elsewhere. </P>
<P> Prosecutor George Peck refuted everything Ferguson said and told the judge Ferguson blamed everyone else for his problems. </P>
<P> ``This is, basically, vintage Mr. Ferguson and I ask you to deny the motion,'' he said. </P>
<P> Ferguson complained he had only a month to assemble his defense and that was not enough time to deal with the 93-count indictment. He said he sought delays that were not granted and did not have sufficient access to a law library. </P>
<P> During the trial, Ferguson claimed he did not shoot anyone. He said he fell asleep on the train and a white man took a weapon from his bag and started to shoot. He also accused prosecutors of framing him because he is black. </P>
<P> The murder convictions carry a possible prison term of 25 years to life. Prosecutors said Monday they would seek consecutive sentences. Because of a state cap, the maximum Ferguson could receive is 200 years in prison, Peck said. </P>
<P> Beginning Tuesday, about 20 people -- survivors, others on the train and family members of those killed -- will appear in court to try to convey how the shooting affected their lives. </P>
<P> The statements are expected to take two days. </P>
<P> ``Hopefully this will be the end of having his face in my mind,'' said Carolyn McCarthy, whose husband was killed and whose son was left partially paralyzed in the shooting. </P>
<P> Ferguson on Monday also asked to be placed in solitary confinement. ``If I am to spend 50 years in jail, I wish to spend 50 years in total isolation,'' he said. </P>
