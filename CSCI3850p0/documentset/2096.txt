<P>  State prison officials Tuesday were trying to determine how four inmates had time to saw through bars on death row during an abortive prison break.  After the failed escape at Indiana State Prison, the same institution where members of John Dillinger's gang once shot their way out, security was tight. </P>
<P> Members of the breakout group were all captured inside the prison Monday. </P>
<P> With prisoners confined to their cells by a ``lockdown'' Tuesday, officials were interviewing all personnel who previously had come into contact with inmates in the cellblock for the condemned. </P>
<P> A prison official said it appeared the four had used hacksaw blades to saw off bars at the bottom of their cell doors and wriggled out underneath. He said it was not known how the sawing, which would have taken some time, went unnoticed. </P>
<P> The four men who made their attempt in the early morning hours were moved to a maximum control facility in nearby Westville with a fifth death row inmate who correction officers subdued inside his cell with tear gas. </P>
<P> The names of the five were not released. </P>
<P> How they managed to saw through bars and construct home-made weapons was a mystery, said Pam Patterson, spokeswoman for the Indiana Department of Corrections. </P>
<P> Even though they broke loose inside their chances of escaping from the 19th Century prison, whose 40-foot concrete walls and brick buildings were awash with floodlights, were rated as virtually impossible. </P>
<P> The four got as far as a caged-in recreation area when they surrendered after exchanging shots with a tower guard, using a home-made zip gun, a contrivance that uses a pipe for a gun barrel and uses a rubber band or spring to snap the firing pin. </P>
<P> Even if they had broken out of the recreation area, their chances of getting over the walls 35 feet away, were remote, according to people familiar with the prison. </P>
<P> The prison, built in 1860, has apparently never had an escape over the walls, one Michigan City resident said. It was the scene, however, of a 1930s shootout in which members of the bank-robbing Dillinger gang made a break. </P>
<P> The 43 other inmates on the prison's death row were apparently not involved in the escape attempt, although a thorough investigation was under way to determine the extent of the plot, officials said. </P>
