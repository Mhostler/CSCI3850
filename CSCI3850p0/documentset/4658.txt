<P>  The United States strongly endorsed the START-2 nuclear arms reduction treaty with Russia Wednesday, saying it would be good for both countries. </P>
<P> ``It will be good for the United States and Russia to have dramatically fewer nuclear weapons,'' Defense Secretary William Perry told a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. </P>
<P> ``The other members of the Joint Chiefs and I have no reservations about the START-2 treaty,'' the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Gen. John Shalikashvili, added. </P>
<P> Under the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, the United States and Russia agree to cut their nuclear arsenals by about two-thirds from pre-treaty levels by the year 2003, leaving both countries with 3,500 or fewer nuclear warheads. </P>
<P> Perry and Shalikashvili said that would leave the United States with a strong nuclear deterrent against any likely threat even if Russia returns to a totalitarian government. </P>
<P> They said the United States would maintain a nuclear attack force of 450-500 Minuteman missiles, 66 B-52 and 20 B-2 bombers and 14 Trident submarines. </P>
<P> Both the Senate and the Russian parliament must ratify the treaty before it can take effect. </P>
<P> Shalikashvili said the treaty went beyond the START-1 agreement by eliminating multiple warhead and first strike long-range missiles and had strong verification procedures. </P>
<P> ``I am confident START-2 can be effectively verified,'' he told the senators. </P>
<P> Perry said most of the goals of the START-1 treaty had been met with the deactivation of over 3,900 warheads, 290 missiles and over 230 bombers. </P>
<P> He said several other nations had or were developing nuclear weapons but none was as great a threat as Russia. </P>
<P> ``We are moving from an era of arms control negotiated between adversaries to cooperative threat reduction among partners. START-2 points the way to this new era while serving as a hedge against the failure of our hopes,'' Perry said in a statement to the committee. </P>
<P> President Clinton, in a foreign policy speech to be given Wednesday night, will strongly call for an unconditional extension of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. </P>
<P> The NPT, which took effect in 1970, commits non-nuclear states to refrain from acquiring or producing nuclear weapons. </P>
