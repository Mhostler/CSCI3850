<P>  Robed Ku Klux Klansmen plan to demonstrate at abortion clinics in Pensacola within the next month, a spokesman for the group said Saturday. </P>
<P> The group plans to picket against abortion and the use of federal marshals to guard the clinics.  ``I really see no purpose it (using marshals) serves except to intimidate,'' said John Baumgardner, a Klan member and former leader, or grand dragon, of the Invisible Empire of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. No date was set for the Pensacola protest. </P>
<P> The Klan participated in anti-abortion protest at an abortion clinic in Melbourne, in central Florida, Saturday. </P>
<P> A single patient attending a routine gynecological appointment at the Aware Woman Center for Choice had to pass 8 hooded members of the Ku Klux Klan among a crowd outside the facility. </P>
<P> Also on hand were one skinhead with a confederate flag, several anti-abortion protestors carrying rosaries and a lifesize statue of the Virgin Mary, a contingent of marshals and officers from the Melbourne police department. </P>
<P> ``We've got everyone out here but Greenpeace,'' said Phyllis Erwin, Aware Woman's clinic defense coordinator. </P>
<P> Erwin said she had sent her volunteer patient escorts home Saturday because abortions were not scheduled and the anti- abortion protestors were controlled by police. </P>
<P> Operation Rescue had asked its members not to picket in Melbourne Saturday because of the Klan's plan, so there were fewer anti-abortion protestors than usual. </P>
<P> Clinic workers said the protest, which began at 11:00 a.m. EDT was peaceful. </P>
<P> Marshals were assigned to guard clinics where abortions are performed after Dr. John Britton, 69, and his escort, James Barrett, 74, were killed by shotgun blasts July 29 outside The Ladies Center in Pensacola. </P>
<P> Klan members in Melbourne Saturday told reporters they were not there to further white supremacy. But J.D. Alder, an advisor to the United Klans of Florida involved in the Melbourne plans had told Reuters Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``I am selectively opposed to abortion. I don't care if blacks and Jews have abortions.'' </P>
