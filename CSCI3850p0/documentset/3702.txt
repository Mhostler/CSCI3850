<DATELINE>KHYBER PASS, Pakistan (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Pakistani tribesmen dancing in honor of Defense Secretary William Perry in the Khyber Pass Wednesday tested his bodyguards' nerves by firing live rounds in the air without warning, witnesses said. </P>
<P> Perry, on a two-day visit to Pakistan, was watching a display of tribal dancing after lunch at the Khyber Rifles regimental mess near the rugged Afghan border. </P>
<P> The troupe of a dozen Khattak tribesmen momentarily stunned his security escort by unleashing rhythmic volleys from G-3 assault rifles in time with the music. </P>
<P> ``This is a security nightmare,'' one U.S. official muttered, as Perry smiled and politely applauded the performance. </P>
