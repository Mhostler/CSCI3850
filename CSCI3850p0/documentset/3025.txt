<P>  Republicans preparing to take over the Senate signalled likely efforts to roll back government regulations opposed by business and others, announcing that a working group was being set up to study regulation reform. </P>
<P> ``We would like to make sure that the benefits (of regulations) exceed the cost -- that will be a high priority,'' Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., told reporters. </P>
<P> He mentioned labor and environmental regulations as among those that needed examination, and said that Republicans had been ``having a hard time with Democrats in the past getting some kind of cost-benefit analysis.'' </P>
<P> Republicans campaigned for the Nov. 8 elections, in which they won both house of Congress, on a platform of smaller, less-intrusive government. </P>
<P> The working group on regulation reform will be one of seven on congressional reorganization and legislative priorities that will make reommendations to Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas. </P>
<P> Nickles did not say who would serve in the regulatory reform group, but said there was a need to find out the cost of regulations. </P>
<P> ``Some regulations might cost billions of dollars but have little health impact,'' he said. </P>
<P> He said environmental, labor and health regulations had enormous impact, and although the goals were not objectionable the cost was often unreaonable. </P>
<P> He said senators were looking at the possibility of the Congressional Budget Office examining certain regulations to see if they were cost-effective. </P>
