<P>  Requiring welfare beneficiaries to move quickly to find jobs -- a key element of the House-passed welfare reform bill -- will do nothing to address the problem of illegitimacy that is fueling poverty in the United States, a controversial academic said Thursday. </P>
<P> At a Senate Finance Committee hearing, Charles Murray of the American Enterprise Institute said broad social change was needed to combat illegitimacy and welfare dependence. ``If Congress is going to pin its hopes on a jobs program, it's a triumph of hope over experience,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``The debate about jobs is peripheral firstly because putting welfare mothers to work does nothing to reduce illegitimacy and the problems it causes. The only way a job is going to affect illegitimacy is if the work requirement is so harsh and unattractive that it deters pregnancy,'' he said. </P>
<P> Murray has called for scrapping the welfare system and has linked welfare to illegitimacy. </P>
<P> Richard Nathan of the State Univeristy of New York told the committee jobs programs would not cut out of wedlock births, but he said single poor parents under 22 should be in work programs. </P>
<P> The committee has been holding hearings on welfare in an effort to put together a reform bill. The House has passed legislation to give states control of more than 40 federal welfare programs, cutting about $66 billion over five years. </P>
<P> The House bill would require beneficiaries to work after two years and limit welfare benefits to five years. It would deny federal cash benefits to unwed teen-agers under 18 and bar additional aid to women who have more children on welfare. </P>
<P> Senate Finance Committee Chairman Bob Packwood, R-Ore., said he had not decided on the final shape of any welfare reform bill. Packwood favors giving states control of Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the main federal cash welfare program, as well as Food Stamps. </P>
<P> ``I'm intrigued by what Dr. Murray said about jobs aren't the problem. ... it (reducing illegitimacy) should be a goal, whether or not jobs should also be a goal, I don't know,'' Packwood told reporters. </P>
<P> Instead of setting tough requirements states would have to follow, Packwood suggested the Senate might set broad goals such as reducing out of wedlock birth rates. But during the hearing, a bipartisan group of senators expressed concerns about the House bill and offered a host of alternatives, most including work and other requirements. </P>
