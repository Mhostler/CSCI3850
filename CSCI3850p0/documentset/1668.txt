<P>  Taiwan's China Airlines said Thursday that the captain of an airliner that crashed in Japan last April, killing 264 people, had not been drinking alcohol during the flight. </P>
<P> A Japanese survivor of the crash said in Tokyo Wednesday that he had seen the captain, who died in the crash, and two crew members passing around a cup of Chinese liquor with passengers who appeared to be acquaintances about 40 minutes after the plane took off, Japan's Kyodo news agency reported. </P>
<P> ``To accuse the dead because they can't answer back is against the Japanese spirit of respect for the dead,'' China Airlines spokesman Lodge Lo said by telephone. ``It's totally groundless.'' </P>
<P> ``After a plane takes off, the cockpit door is always closed,'' he said. </P>
<P> He said an autopsy, performed in Japan, on the captain's body had found nothing to confirm that he had been drinking while on duty. </P>
