<DATELINE>MADRID (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Spain raised the stakes in the worsening fishing dispute with Canada Tuesday when boat owners ordered a resumption of fishing off Newfoundland and Madrid demanded visas for Canadian tourists. </P>
<P> ``We have told the captains not to wait a minute more, to put out their nets and resume fishing,'' Jose Suarez Llanos of the Vigo ship owners cooperative told state radio. </P>
<P> Some 17 Spanish ships in the disputed North Atlantic area suspended fishing after Canadian patrol boats fired across the bows of the Spanish vessel Estai and seized it last Thursday. </P>
<P> The Canadians charged captain of the Estai, which was trawling for Greenland halibut in international waters off Newfoundland, with illegal fishing. </P>
<P> Canada says European fishing of the relatively rare Greenland halibut, a kind of turbot, is endangering already dangerously low stocks in the area. </P>
<P> The incident has caused a major dispute between Canada and Spain, which is backed by the European Union (EU). The EU on Tuesday gave Canada until Wednesday to free the Estai. </P>
<P> Suarez Llanos said the decision to resume fishing was taken at an assembly of the ship owners association in Vigo, home port of the Estai. </P>
<P> ``We have the support of the EU and the Spanish government and, although we are still waiting for word from the government on guarantees of protection for our ships, we have decided not to wait another minute before ending this forced fishing embargo,'' he said. </P>
<P> On the diplmatic front, Spain confirmed Tuesday that it was reintroducing visas for Canadian tourists in retaliation for the seizure of the Estai. </P>
<P> The measure had already been mooted Monday by Foreign Minister Javier Solana as one of Spain's options. </P>
<P> ``We have decided to impose this,'' a Foreign Ministry spokesman said. He added that legal steps to reintroduce visa requirements for Canadians, which had long been lifted, would take at least three or four days to complete. </P>
<P> Solana has conceded that the dispute could ultimately cause a break in diplomatic ties between Madrid and Ottawa if Canada refuses to release the Estai without conditions. </P>
<P> He told a news conference Monday that Spain was halting all official visits with Canada and was considering freezing existing cooperation agreements. Madrid was also preparing paperwork for a complaint to the World Court in the Hague. </P>
<P> In Strasbourg Tuesday Solana expressed satisfaction with the ``understanding and active solidarity'' Spain was receiving from the EU over the dispute. </P>
<P> He was later due to meet EU Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan and Fisheries Commissioner Emma Bonino. </P>
<P> Bonino said earlier that the EU was prepared to open talks with Canada if the Estai and its crew were released. </P>
<P> Brittan declined to comment on whether the EU would impose sanctions if Canada did not release the Estai. ``I am interested in de-escalating this thing and not escalating it,'' he said. </P>
<P> A Spanish Agriculture and Fisheries Ministry spokesman rejected a Canadian charge that Spanish vessels were catching immature, undersize fish and threatening depleted stocks. </P>
<P> The North Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) had not yet set a minimum size for Greenland halibut, the spokesman said. </P>
<P> ``It has not been sufficiently studied and we still do not know when it reaches sexual maturity,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``They cannot make accusations of catching undersize fish. It's absurd.'' </P>
<P> The owner of the Estai told Spanish state radio the boat had strictly followed Spanish and EU regulations in the North Atlantic. </P>
