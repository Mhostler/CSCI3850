<DATELINE>BEIJING, April 11 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Chen Yun, one of China's leading veteran hardliners, backed military suppression of the 1989 democracy movement and differed strongly with paramount leader Deng Xiaoping over his sweeping Western-style reforms. </P>
<P> The gaunt and frail-looking man, who died in a Beijing hospital on Monday aged 90, was second only to Deng in the hierarchy of elderly revolutionaries who have played a major role behind the scenes in ruling China in recent years. </P>
<P> Chen was a close associate of Deng but challenged many of his policies, particularly on economic change. His death removes a focus on which opposition to Deng could coalesce. </P>
<P> While Deng encouraged innovation and the growth of private enterprise, Chen is famed for describing China's socialist market economy as a bird in the cage of central control. </P>
<P> Some of Chen's main tenets were strong central economic planning, strict adherence to Marxist ideology and the use of executions as a deterrent. </P>
<P> Though shunted by Deng out of the Communist Party Central Committee into semi-retirement in 1987 and suffering from crippling health, Chen wielded authority well into his 80s. </P>
<P> Remarks he had published in the Communist Party newspaper People's Daily in April 1990, in which he referred to Deng's mortality, were seen by some analysts as renewed criticism. </P>
<P> A recluse, Chen rarely appeared in public. He was last seen greeting Soviet guests at celebrations of China's October 1 National Day in 1989. </P>
<P> Behind the scenes he worked with Deng to design China's sweeping market-oriented economic reforms and later masterminded the government's austerity programme, launched in late 1988, to curb runaway inflation. </P>
<P> As chairman of the Communist Party's Central Advisory Commission, Chen made a dramatic appearance on state televison on May 26, 1989 during mass pro-democracy demonstrations. </P>
<P> ``We must expose the plot hatched in secret by a very small number of people. We must struggle against them and never yield to them,'' Chen was quoted as saying. </P>
<P> Taking a line he had espoused for years, Chen blamed the protests then sweeping China on a relaxation of communist education and a weakening of the party's ideological work. </P>
<P> ``If we do not suppress this chaos started by a small number of people then China will never enjoy peaceful days,'' he said. ``We believe the party and the army have ways and the ability to control the chaos.'' </P>
<P> A week later troops backed by tanks and armoured carriers smashed through central Peking and cleared Tiananmen Square of thousands of demonstrators, with heavy loss of civilian life. </P>
<P> In 1985, discord between Chen and Deng broke the surface at a national party conference. Chen said he supported Deng's reforms, aimed at inducing people to work hard to get rich, but launched a scathing attack on excesses spawned by the reforms, including corruption and foreign influences. </P>
<P> Chen was appointed head of the advisory commission in 1987 in a move by Deng to ease many veteran revolutionaries out of the limelight by offering them a sinecure. </P>
<P> But when it came to the means of suppression, Chen and Deng were as one -- as illustrated in an official account of a speech by Deng in 1986 on tackling a growing wave of crime. </P>
<P> ``Generally speaking, the problem now is that we are too soft on criminals. As a matter of fact, execution is one of the indispensable means of education,'' said Deng. </P>
<P> At this point, ``Comrade Chen Yun again intervened here to say that executing one could serve as a warning to a hundred.'' </P>
<P> Chen was born Liao Chengyun in Shanghai in 1905, making him about a year younger than Deng. He had a sketchy education and became a typesetter and trade unionist before joining the Communist Party in 1925, four years after its foundation. </P>
<P> Little is known about his private life. His wife Yu Ruomu is a doctor, one son Chen Yuan is central bank deputy governor and a daughter runs a venture capital company. He is believed to have other children. </P>
