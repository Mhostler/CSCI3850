<P>  President Boris Yeltsin said Saturday he would sign a much-delayed friendship treaty with Ukraine only after it solved a dispute with its autonomous region of Crimea, dominated by ethnic Russians. </P>
<P> ``It will be correct to sign major political documents between Russia and Ukraine only after we are convinced that the relations between Simferopol and Kiev do not infringe the interests of the Crimeans,'' Yeltsin told Itar-Tass news agency. </P>
<P> ``Russians form the majority of the population in the Republic of Crimea, which is part of Ukraine. Russia has considerable interests in Crimea,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``That is why we are not indifferent to the fate of Crimea. The president and the government want the problems in relations between the authorities in Simferopol and Kiev to be settled through political dialog, without pressure and with respect for the will of the Crimeans.'' </P>
<P> Yeltsin's comments on Crimea, made during a vacation in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, were his first since Ukrainian authorities launched a crackdown on what they regard as pro-Russian separatism in the peninsula. </P>
<P> Yeltsin's ministers, their hands tied by Moscow's bloody incursion into Russia's separatist region of Chechnya, have previously said the problem is an internal Ukrainian affair. </P>
<P> Russian nationalists inside and outside parliament have been pressing Yeltsin to step in to help Crimea. </P>
<P> The Kremlin leader's visit to Ukraine to sign the friendship treaty has been repeatedly postponed since last September, mostly because of differences over the division of the ex-Soviet Black Sea fleet based in Crimea. </P>
<P> The latest date proposed was the end of April and Acting Prime Minister Yevhen Marchuk, who heads Ukraine's delegation in talks with Russia, had intended to go to Moscow next week to iron out details for signing the treaty. </P>
<P> Yeltsin's comments cast a shadow over the visit. </P>
<P> Ukraine's parliament last month outlawed Crimea's constitution and eliminated the post of regional president. </P>
<P> President Leonid Kuchma then made the government of the Black Sea peninsula directly responsible to Kiev, virtually wiping out the autonony extended by Ukraine to Crimea in 1992. </P>
<P> Two-thirds of Crimea's 2.7 million residents are ethnic Russians. Authority over the region was transferred from Russia to Ukraine by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev in 1954. </P>
<P> Ukrainian officials dismissed Yeltsin's comments. </P>
<P> ``Ukraine's policy on Crimea is absolutely clear. Crimea is an internal matter for Ukraine. Therefore there are no issues in dispute over Crimea between Russia and Ukraine,'' Mykhailo Doroshenko, Kuchma's press secretary, told Reuters. </P>
<P> ``It is absolutely untrue to say Ukraine is putting pressure on Crimea. Ukraine is helping Crimea as much as possible and will continue to do so. This includes financial subsidies for Crimea, which impose a heavy burden on the Ukrainian budget.'' </P>
<P> Russia's lower house of parliament, the State Duma, invited Crimea's parliamentary chairman, Sergei Tsekov, to address the chamber Friday, incurring the anger of Ukrainian deputies. </P>
<P> Tsekov told reporters afterwards that the conflict between Kiev and Crimea could not be solved without Russian help. He had previously urged Russia to hold back on signing the friendship pact pending resolution of the dispute. </P>
<P> ``We have so far done our best to cope with the crisis ourselves, and we failed,'' he said. ``Now we believe there is no way to solve the Crimean problem without Russia.'' </P>
