<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  An Indian woman has been sentenced to death for burning her daughter-in-law alive because of an insufficient dowry, newspapers reported Saturday. </P>
<P> ``The person who perpetrates a barbaric crime without any human consideration must be given the extreme penalty,'' the newspapers quoted Judge Dinesh Dayal as saying when he sentenced the woman Friday. </P>
<P> The woman, named as Chandravati, was accused of killing her 20-year-old daughter-in-law by pouring kerosene over her and setting her alight six years ago. </P>
<P> Chandravati claimed the daughter-in-law died in an accident in the kitchen, where, as in many Indian homes, cooking was done on kerosene stoves. </P>
<P> Scores of such deaths are reported each year in India, where demanding dowries is officially illegal but widely practiced. </P>
