<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The federal government is already studying why commuter airlines like the American Eagle flight that crashed near Chicago Monday go down twice as often as major carriers, and hopes to issue a report soon, a spokeswoman said late Monday. </P>
<P> National Transportation Safety Board spokeswoman Charlotte Casey said the panel was nearing completion on the report, which was launched in April after two crashes in Columbus, Ohio and Hibbing, Minn., last winter. </P>
<P> In 1993, federal statistics showed that commuter airlines had 0.509 accidents for every 100,000 departures, compared with the accident rate among major airlines of 0.297. </P>
<P> All 68 passengers and crew were believed killed Monday in the latest commuter airline crash, when a flight by American Eagle, the commuter affiliate of American Airlines went down in a gusty rainstorm over Indiana. </P>
<P> The NTSB probe has already turned up some disturbing evidence, including comments at a June hearing from a pilots' union official from American Eagle who said flight schedules were now so demanding that some pilots were falling asleep at the controls. </P>
<P> Michael Santaniello, Allied Pilots Association chairman at the commuter affiliate, said pilots were flying fatigued for fear of losing their jobs and some were ``literally falling asleep at the controls.'' </P>
<P> Santaniello told a hearing on commuter airline safety held by the NTSB in Atlanta in June: ``Pilots, through fear of losing their jobs, are flyong aircraft fatigued. </P>
<P> ``Basically if you call in fatigued, you have to report to the manager's office with union representation. There is such a hostile attitude towards this fatique issue that pilots are literally falling asleep at their controls.'' </P>
<P> Casey said NTSB Chairman Jim Hall and a team of investigators left Washington for Indiana late Monday, but she had no information yet on the probable cause of the accident. </P>
<P> Although commuter carriers use large airplanes that have to be flown under the same rules that apply to the big carriers, about 70 percent of the nation's regional airline fleet is composed of smaller planes subject to less stringent rules. </P>
<P> Some observers believe the laxer rules for smaller planes are the reason commuter airlines have a higher accident rate.  American Eagle spokesman Tim Smith told CNN's ``Larry King Live'' that the plane that crashed Monday was a twin-engine ATR 72 turboprop operating as American Eagle Flight 4184. </P>
<P> But he said his airline voluntarily operated its entire fleet according to the regulations that applied to the larger aircraft. </P>
<P> ``We operate the entire American Eagle fleet of 271 aircraft on...the same operating and safety standards as any other large jet airline, like American Airlines,'' Smith said. </P>
<P></P>
<P> ``The point of this is that economics is determining the level of safety,'' he said. </P>
<P> Regional airlines carried more than 50 million passengers last year -- about 10 percent of all airline passengers -- and are continuing to grow rapidly and seize market share by providing a low-cost alternative to major airlines. </P>
<P> The FAA has predicted that by 2005, the number of commuter passengers will reach 105 million. </P>
<P> Yet federal regulations governing these smaller airlines have not kept up. For instance, airports used by commuters often don't have the same navigation of safety equipment as those passenger jets use. </P>
<P> Smaller planes also don't have the same technology as the bigger planes, and they frequently travel at lower altitudes where they are more vulnerable to adverse weather, like the storm that ripped through the Midwest Monday. </P>
