<P>  The White House Sunday stressed President Clinton's enthusiastic support for his embattled nominee for surgeon general as Vice President Al Gore headed to Nashville to underscore the administration's commitment. </P>
<P> White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta, on the NBC progam ''Meet the Press,'' urged the Senate to weigh the 38-year medical career of the nominee, Dr. Henry Foster, and not just the politically sensitive issue of his abortion record. </P>
<P> ``So, the president enthusiastically and whole-heartedly supports Dr. Henry Foster?'' he was asked. </P>
<P> ``That's correct, and we will fight for his nomination,'' Panetta replied. </P>
<P> The White House announced late Sunday that Gore would join Foster for a meeting with participants and graduates of his ``I Have a Future'' program to combat teen-age pregnancy. </P>
<P> Administration officials said the hastily arranged visit was aimed at highlighting Foster's much-recognized work to prevent teen-age pregnancy and shift the spotlight away from his involvement in abortions and hysterectomies for mentally disabled women. </P>
<P> Asked whether the White House would let Foster withdraw if he volunteered to do so, Panetta replied that based on a recent conversation with the nominee: ``He's in this to the end. He wants to fight for this nomination.'' </P>
<P> Panetta said the disclosure Saturday that Foster had been involved in sterilization of mentally retarded women in the 1970s had in no way changed Clinton's support for him. </P>
<P> ``This was something that was accepted practice at the time that he wrote the articles involved with that issue. As a result of finding new medication, new drugs, that practice has changed, and Dr. Foster's views have changed as well,'' Panetta said. </P>
<P> Foster wrote in the January 1976 issue of the Southern Medical Journal that ``I have begun to use hysterectomy in patients with severe mental retardation.'' Hysterectomy involves removal of the uterus, preventing pregnancy. </P>
<P> Foster, a 61-year-old obstetrician and gynecologist, was chosen by Clinton to be the top U.S. health officer Feb. 2. After first saying he had performed ``fewer than a dozen'' abortions, Foster, acting director of Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tenn., corrected his record to state that he had performed 39 and supervised a drug trial in which 55 more pregnancies were terminated. </P>
<P> The disclosure of the additional abortions and his initial failure to report them irked both Republicans and Democrats, throwing into doubt whether he could win Senate confirmation. </P>
<P> Sen. Phil Gramm, an anti-abortion Republican from Texas who is seeking his party's nomination for the 1996 White House race, predicted Foster would fail to be confirmed. </P>
<P> ``I think that there's too much dispute about his record,'' he said on the ABC progam ``This Week with David Brinkley.'' </P>
<P> ``I think that in the wake of Dr. Elders that it's been too divisive a position and I think people are ready for a 'Dr. Welby, M.D.' who can work with every element of American society.''  Joycelyn Elders, Clinton's first surgeon general, was forced to resign in December after capping a string of controversial remarks with the suggestion that schools might teach about masturbation as one way of working against out-of-wedlock pregnancies. </P>
<P> Marcus Welby, M.D., was the name of a 1970s television series starring Robert Young as a kindly general practitioner whose caring brand of medicine competed with modern medical specialization. </P>
<P> A number of Democrats, including Joseph Biden of Delaware and Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, have complained publicly about the White House's failure to fully explore Foster's career and the role abortion played in it. </P>
<P> Biden suggested Friday the nomination of anyone involved with abortion was a ``political blunder in the extreme.'' He railed at being sucked into a debate over abortion when, he said, lawmakers had more important matters before them. </P>
<P> Panetta was unapologetic about having forced the Senate to deal with abortion, which perhaps a quarter of the electorate opposes on moral and legal grounds even though the procedure has been legal in the United States for 22 years. </P>
<P> ``God forbid that we ought to make senators uncomfortable about dealing with issues like this,'' Panetta said. ``Dealing with teen-age pregnancies is a controversial issue. So what? That's what the name of the game is all about.''  Panetta admitted unspecified staff mistakes in the nomination process, blaming them on investigations overlap by the Department of Health and Human Services and the White House. </P>
<P> ``There's no question we could have served the president better in the process,'' he said. ``And it's not going to happen again, I can assure you.'' </P>
