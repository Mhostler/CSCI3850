<P>  Actor and playwright Michael Vincent Gazzo, best known for his role as a Mafia lieutenant in the film ``The Godfather, Part II,'' has died from complications of a stroke, a family spokeswoman said. Gazzo was 71. </P>
<P> The spokeswoman said Saturday that Gazzo, who was nominated for an Academy Award for his portrayal of Frank Pentangeli in the 1974 movie, died in a Los Angeles hospital Feb. 14. </P>
<P> Gazzo first made his name as a playwright on Broadway with ''Hatful of Rain,'' a story of drug addiction tearing a family apart that shocked audiences in the 1950s and was praised by the New York Times as ``a forthright statement of things that are horrifying and true.'' </P>
<P> He began his movie-acting career in 1954 with a part in ``On the Waterfront,'' starring Marlon Brando, that established him as one of Hollywood's quintessential ``bad guy'' character actors. </P>
<P> He once said that over his career he was killed about 20 times in mob films. </P>
<P> One of those times was in ``The Godfather, Part II,'' when he portrayed a Mafioso who committed suicide rather than testify against his mob associates. </P>
<P> It was one of the few occasions when three actors from the same film were nominated for the best supporting actor Oscar, Gazzo, Robert DeNiro and Lee Strasberg. DeNiro won. </P>
<P> Gazzo's other movies included ``The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight,'' ``The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh'' and ``Back Roads.'' </P>
