<P>  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said Monday that France would not join in a possible invasion of Haiti and was uneasy about an expanded U.N. peacekeeping operation that might follow. </P>
<P> Washington has left open the option of an invasion and is urging the U.N. to mount a peacekeeping operation of perhaps 10,000 troops after the country's military leaders either step down or are removed from power. </P>
<P> An initial report on such a U.N. force is expected Friday from Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. Any Security Council approval would not be due until the end of the month, then leaving Washington the choice of whether to intervene. </P>
<P> But Juppe, in answer to questions, said he was against any unilateral intervention without U.N. approval. ``It is not possible, you need a mandate of the United Nations,'' he said. </P>
<P> Asked if France would favor a U.S. invasion, he would not comment. </P>
<P> He said he was in favor of a mission to enforce the United Nations in Haiti but noted there was no proposal yet from Boutros-Ghali on its shape and that France would probably not participate in that either. </P>
<P> France ``doesn't want to participate in another force,'' he said and noted the original abortive U.N. force was mainly to train the police ``and we want to stick to this objective.'' </P>
<P> Juppe spoke before an announcement that the military had ordered all international human rights observers out of Haiti. He was in New York to brief the Security Council on Rwanda. </P>
<P> French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, who addressed the Security Council on Rwanda Monday, was asked in a press conference if France would accept some Haitian refugees in Caribbean French territories such as Guadeloupe or Martinique. </P>
<P> He said France would not and chided the United States for the refugee problem, without mentioning it by name. </P>
<P> ``I was in that area less than a month ago and I didn't get the impression that the place was that empty,'' he replied. </P>
<P> He said that the islands already had many refugees and the result is a ``very very large figure for unemployment.'' </P>
<P> ``So our feeling is that if everyone in the region did as much as France does, the problem you've mentioned really wouldn't exist,'' he added. </P>
