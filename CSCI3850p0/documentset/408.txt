<P>  Brazil supports a U.S.- sponsored Security Council resolution on a multinational peacekeeping force in Haiti, U.S. Undersecretary of State Peter Tarnoff said Tuesday. </P>
<P> After a one-hour meeting with Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, Tarnoff told reporters Brazil had agreed with Washington on the need for a resolution ``that will put the coup leaders in Haiti on notice that the international community is losing patience and it is necessary for them to depart as soon as possible.''  He said Amorim showed ``a good spirit of understanding and cooperation'' about the resolution. </P>
<P> Tarnoff is visiting Argentina and Brazil, both Security Council members, to assure passage of the resolution, a draft of which was distributed to council members Monday. </P>
<P> It calls for a U.S.-led multinational force to use ``all necessary means'' to restore the ``legitimate authorities in Haiti and establish and maintain a secure and stable environment.'' </P>
<P> The Haitian military overthrew democratically-elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in September 1991. </P>
<P> Although Brazil has agreed to take part in the 6,000-strong multinational force, proposed by the United States, it has repeatedly said it will not support any unilateral effort by the United States to replace Haiti's military rulers. </P>
<P> Tarnoff said the United States hoped the U.N. resolution would be passed by Friday.  Tarnoff arrived from Buenos Aires late Monday and leaves for Washington Tuesday night. He did not describe his talks with Argentine officials. </P>
