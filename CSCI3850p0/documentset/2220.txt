<P>  When your cat needs a nip, or your pooch prefers Perrier, The Original Pet Drink Company may have the product for you. </P>
<P> The Ft. Lauderdale-based, privately held company is marketing a series of flavored bottled waters made specially for the nation's 115 million companion dogs and cats, as a healthy alternative to tap water. </P>
<P> Thirsty Dog -- ``tastes a bit like beef bullion with a hint of sweetness'' -- and Thirsty Cat -- ``a bit like salmon in a butter sauce'' -- are now available in about 2,000 stores in 27 states, the company says. </P>
<P> The pet drinks are made of filtered, slightly carbonated water and contain nine essential vitamins and minerals, according to company president Marc Duke. </P>
<P> ``Fifteen percent of all pet owners do not give their pets tap water to drink,'' Duke told Reuters. </P>
<P> ``As they become health and food conscious for themselves, they're becoming more conscious about what they give their pets to eat and drink,'' he said. </P>
<P> Some animal experts say bottled water is a good idea -- but flavored water might be going a little too far. </P>
<P> ``I don't drink tap water myself. I would never feed it to my pets,'' said Miami veterinarian Karen Rabin. ``But I wouldn't advise flavored water.'' </P>
<P> Nonetheless, the product is a hit after seven weeks on the market, Duke said. The company is shipping 175,000 bottles per week, with a suggested retail price of $1.79 per bottle. </P>
<P> ``We have a 96 percent acceptance rate among dogs, and 70 percent among cats, who are notoriously finicky,'' he said. </P>
<P> The company soon will expand its line, with chicken-flavored and milk-flavored drinks due out within weeks, followed by specialty drinks for puppies and kittens, for ``mature'' dogs and cats, and diet formulas for ``the dog that wants to be svelte,'' Duke said. </P>
<P> The Original Pet Drink Company even has a spokesdog -- Murray, from the popular television show ``Mad About You.'' </P>
