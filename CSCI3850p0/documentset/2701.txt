<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Clinton administration has provided Congress with plans for ending the arms embargo on Bosnia unilaterally and providing up to $5 billion worth of military aid, while warning of the ``serious implications'' this would have, a Pentagon spokesman said Friday. </P>
<P> Disclosure of the proposals added a further twist to a dispute between Washington and its European allies over whether to maintain a non-partisan approach to securing peace in Bosnia or side with Bosnia's Muslims as urged by Congress. </P>
<P> Congress called for the options, described by the spokesman as ``only notional,'' in September when it mandated President Clinton to prepare to unilaterally lift the embargo if certain conditions were not met. </P>
<P> The spokesman said the options ranged in cost from between less than $400 million to $5 billion. They involved training for Bosnian government forces as well as equipment. He gave no further details of the options, which were made available to members of Congress this week for discussion. </P>
<P> But he stressed the move was not an initiative of the administration and that it was being accompanied by a warning about the political and military implications of the United States acting alone. </P>
<P> ``We're not just presenting these plans, but (doing so) in a manner carefully, pointedly, pointing out the serious implications if they are implemented,'' said a Pentagon spokesman, who asked not to be named. </P>
<P> ABC News said one option involved providing tanks, artillery and years of training and the other was restricted to anti-tank and anti-artillery weapons and shorter training. </P>
<P> Clinton argues that a unilateral lifting of the ban could damage relations with allies who have peacekeeping forces on the ground in Bosnia and could undermine efforts to sustain international embargos elsewhere, like Iraq. </P>
<P> The United States last week ended its participation in the international operation to implement the embargo on the Bosnian Muslims, drawing criticism from France and Britain. </P>
<P> British, French and Russian foreign ministers meeting in Paris Friday urged the United States to stick with non-partisan allied peace efforts and expressed fears of a military flare-up after the U.S. end to imposing the embargo. </P>
<P> ``I think we all share the worry of a military development and I think we all reject the military solution,'' Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev told reporters in Paris.  In Washington NATO Secretary-General Willy Claes acknowledged the pressures on Clinton to take a pro-Muslim stance. ``I know that many people, especially in the United States but also in Europe ... (want) engagement on the side of the Muslims, not a studied neutrality toward aggressor and victim alike,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``I am not underestimating the importance of the political debate,'' Claes told the North Atlantic Assembly annual meeting. ``But please, let us not exaggerate,'' he said. ``There are other things than the arms embargo in Bosnia.'' </P>
<P> But Claes said later that if the United States goes further than it has and actually breaks the U.N. arms embargo, ``well, at that moment indeed we will face serious difficulties.'' </P>
<P> ``What I fear is a serious clash, even a split, in the alliance and sorry -- I am a little ... brutal, but NATO is much more than Bosnia,'' Claes said in a CNN interview. </P>
<P> Largely because of pressure from Congress, the Clinton administration is trying to persuade a reluctant U.N. Security Council to end the embargo multilaterally early next year. </P>
<P> In legislation passed by Congress in September, Clinton was obliged to act if the Bosnian Serbs failed to accept a peace plan to end the Bosnian war and if the United Nations did not lift the embargo on the Muslims multilaterally. </P>
<P> Clinton has already taken the first step Congress required -- ending U.S. participation in enforcing the embargo -- and is now fulfilling the other two -- providing proposals for military help and the mechanics of ending the embargo. </P>
<P> The Pentagon denied European media reports this week that it was already giving military help to the Bosnian government.  Republican leaders, who are taking over Congress from Clinton's Democrats following this month's mid-term elections, repeated their support for lifting the embargo to help the Muslims, but opposed U.S. money being spent on military aid. </P>
<P> ``Bosnia is largely a European problem. The Germans and the French and the British and the Italians are more than wealthy enough to provide the overwhelming bulk of the aid,'' said Newt Gingrich, set to become speaker of the House of Representatives. </P>
