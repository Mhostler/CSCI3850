<P>  The cash-strapped town of Arvin, in California's San Joaquin Valley, could be forced to file for bankruptcy if it can't reach a settlement with a group of its debtholders, a city official said Thursday. </P>
<P> ``There is no doubt that that is what we will do if we don't settle,'' Arvin City Manager Thomas Payne said. </P>
<P> The town of 10,573 residents, near the city of Bakersfield, defaulted in March on $7.945 million in debt issued in 1988 to build an 18-hole golf course, according to Payne. </P>
<P> Arvin owes certificate holders $694,482 this year and is expected to default on next February's $670,000 payment, Payne said. Arvin's expected $1.3 million fiscal 1995 general fund budget is too small to meet these debt payments, Payne added. </P>
<P> ``There is no surplus. There is no gravy. There is no place to cut,'' Payne said. ``If we were to shut down all general fund operations, there still would not be enough money.'' </P>
<P> The town cannot afford a tax hike to pay debt service. </P>
<P> ``We have 40 percent unemployment. We have one of the lowest per-capita income rates in the country,'' Payne said. </P>
<P> The golf course lost nearly $100,000 in 1992 and $47,000 in 1993 and is expected to lose $33,000 this year, Payne said. </P>
<P> The town already owes millions of dollars to holders of two other Arvin bond issues. There have been only six municipal bankruptcies in California since 1978. </P>
