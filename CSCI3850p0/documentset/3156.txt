<P>  The new incoming House Republican majority leader, Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, said Monday he expects the Republican tax cut plan to total $177 billion over five years. </P>
<P> ``I think the overall tax reduction will be something in around the neighborhood of $177 billion over five years,'' Armey said on CNN. </P>
<P> ``We, of course, will pay for that with our welfare reform package,'' and spending cuts, he added. </P>
<P> Armey said he would like to have the tax cut plan on President Clinton's desk within the first 100 days of Congress and said he would be glad to deal with the Democratic president. </P>
<P> Clinton also is considering renewing his middle income tax cut proposal that was set aside last year for deficit reduction. </P>
<P> Tax reduction is a feature of the new Republican House majority's ``Contract with America'' plan of tax and spending cuts when they take over for the first time in 40 years. </P>
<P> Part of the Republican tax cut proposal is a $500 a child tax credit for families. </P>
