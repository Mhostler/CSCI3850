<P> Iraq had long claimed Kuwait as its 19th province and recognition of it as a sovereign state is one of the terms Baghdad had accepted in the 1991 ceasefire signed after a U.S.-led coaliton forced Iraqi troops from Kuwait. </P>
<P> It was also an important step for Iraq to win U.N. Security Council permission to resume exports of oil and help its economy crippled by four years of trade sanctions. </P>
<P> President Bill Clinton rushed thousands of U.S. troops to the Kuwait border with Iraq last month after Iraq moved tens of thousands of troops to the border region. </P>
<P> Myers said that Iraq must cease ``permanently threatening Kuwait.'' </P>
