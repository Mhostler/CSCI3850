<P>  Iraq, in a move apparently linked to anger over United Nations terms for resuming oil sales, Wednesday snubbed a U.N. commission on reparations for victims of its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. </P>
<P> But there were conflicting official versions in Geneva and the Iraqi capital on why Iraq decided to stay away from a two-day meeting of the world body's Compensation Commission called to discuss claims by Egypt. </P>
<P> In Baghdad, the Iraqi news agency INA quoted a foreign ministry spokesman as saying its diplomats would not take part in the discussions because the issue did not fall within the Commission's mandate. </P>
<P> In Geneva, a statement from the Commission said Iraq had explained the move by asserting that it had been given insufficient time to prepare for the hearing before a three-member legal panel. </P>
<P> The panel, which met despite Iraq's absence, is examining a claim that Iraqi banks kept some $500 million earned by Egyptian workers in Iraq before Baghdad sent forces into Kuwait in an operation condemned by Cairo. </P>
<P> Egypt's ambassador to the United Nations European headquarters in Geneva told reporters after the first hearing that Cairo believed it had a good case. ``There is evidence that Iraq did not transfer this money,'' he declared. </P>
<P> But in Baghdad INA quoted the foreign ministry spokesman as denying that Iraqi banks had frozen the accounts of any of the 2 million Egyptian workers who were employed in the country before the Gulf crisis of 1990-91. </P>
<P> The spokesman, according to INA, said payment was still under discussion between the two countries and had nothing to do with Gulf War reparations. </P>
<P> ``This issue does not fall, under any circumstances, within the speciality of the U.N. reparations (compensation) committee (commission),'' he was quoted as saying. </P>
<P> Although Baghdad had earlier promised to transfer the money involved, it could not now do so because of U.N. sanctions imposed over the invasion of Kuwait, the official added. </P>
<P> In Geneva, a statement from the Commission said although Baghdad boycotted the meeting it had submitted its views on the Egyptian claim in writing and these had been recorded in place of an oral statement during the hearing. </P>
<P> A member of the Egyptian delegation to the meeting, assistant deputy foreign minister Gillan Allam, told reporters she regretted Iraq had not been there but that the panel could take binding decisions without them. </P>
<P> She said a conclusion was unlikely before July, although the Egyptian delegation would return Thursday to answer questions from the panel, headed by German Karl-Heinz Boecksteigel. </P>
<P> As the hearing was under way, some 10,000 people demonstrated in Baghdad in support of rejection of a U.N. plan allowing Iraq to sell limited amounts of oil -- one third of the proceeds of which would go to the Commission. </P>
<P> The plan, already condemned by the Iraqi cabinet under President Saddam Hussein as a ``dangerous violation'' of the country's sovereignty, would allow sale of up to $2 billion of oil over 180 days to raise funds to buy food and medicines. </P>
