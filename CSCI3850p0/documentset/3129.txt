<DATELINE>NIZHNY-NAUR, Russia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Russian army snipers took up positions kneeling behind trees and other soldiers brandished machine guns as an armored column rolled across rebel Chechnya Sunday. </P>
<P> ``Stay away, we've been shot at,'' an angry officer yelled at journalists as a convoy of armored cars, tanks and field trucks poured across this tiny settlement 45 miles northeast of the breakaway region's capital Grozny. </P>
<P> The Kremlin sent troops into Chechnya Sunday to end an escalating conflict that pits separatist President Dzhokhar Dudayev, who declared the region independent in 1991, against a Moscow-backed opposition grouping trying to topple him. </P>
<P> For weeks, leading liberals in Moscow have been urging President Boris Yeltsin not to allow Russia to be sucked into a war in the Caucasus, fearing an ``Afghanistan on home soil.'' </P>
<P> Commanders in the field echoed similar concerns. </P>
<P> ``There'll be serious resistance. There will be much blood shed on both sides,'' said Yevgeny Yegorov, a Russian officer in Nizhny-Naur. ``We should have done this three years ago.'' </P>
<P> Villagers watched in awe and animals scattered from under tank treads as the convoy, which included new T-80 and T-82 tanks, rumbled through the muddy streets of Nizhny-Naur. </P>
<P> There were at least 400 vehicles including personnel carriers and tanks. There were anti-aircraft weapons, mine-clearing and bridge-building equipment, even light patrol boats for river transport mounted on top of army trucks. </P>
<P> A confused villager said: ``I don't know what's going on. I'm not a politician. But they've scared our women and kids.'' </P>
<P> Russian soldiers checked houses for weapons as they moved on. There was no violence but a lot of tension among the troops. </P>
<P> An Interior Ministry soldier annoyed by the presence of a group of Western reporters fired a warning shot into the air. </P>
<P> Troops later threw a smoke bomb at the correspondents, forced them against a wall and confiscated their film and cameras. </P>
<P> Several Mi-8 attack helicopters buzzed overhead. A Su-25 fighter bomber screamed over the village before disappearing in the direction of Grozny. </P>
<P> Soon after, a column of thick black smoke rose in the distance. Flames could be seen across a windswept plain although it was not clear what had caused the fire. </P>
<P> The troops made their way slowly across the landlocked mountainous republic toward Grozny. </P>
<P> This was one of three columns announced earlier by Russian officials. Two others were said to be moving from Dagestan in the east and Ingushetia in the west. </P>
<P> Officials in Moscow said the troops had no intention of storming Grozny, suggesting the forces might simply encircle the capital and, by throttling Dudayev's government, ultimately make his claim of sovereignty untenable. </P>
<P> Near Grozny, dozens of cars packed with women and children were fleeing the city of 400,000 people, which has been expecting a Russian invasion since an opposition attempt to take the capital failed late in November. </P>
<P> A defiant Dudayev told Interfax news agency in Grozny: ``We will defend ourselves.'' </P>
<P> But on the icy streets of Grozny -- the word means ``terrible'' in Russian -- there were few signs of active defense preparations. </P>
<P> Several trucks ferried armed volunteers through the snow-covered streets. On a windy road leading out of Grozny stood a lone Chechen armed with a Kalashnikov rifle. </P>
<P> Chechnya's Foreign Minister, Shamsedin Yusef, told reporters: ``They cannot kill every Chechen. There are more than one million of us and every one of us will fight.'' </P>
