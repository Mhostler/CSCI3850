<P>  Austrian police said Tuesday a bomb that seriously wounded a man in a racially motivated attack Monday was similar to a device that killed four gypsies over the weekend. </P>
<P> Cornelia Zoppoth, spokeswoman for the Interior Ministry, said construction of the two bombs, which exploded in the eastern state of Burgenland, was similar and investigators were assuming that the attacks were carried out by the same assailants. </P>
<P> ``Both were pipebombs and appear to have been constructed the same way,'' Zoppoth told Reuters. ``The ignition devices also appear to have functioned in a similar manner.'' </P>
<P> She said a chemical analysis of the bombs would be completed by the end of the week. </P>
<P> ``There are many parallels to the two attacks,'' Zoppoth said, adding that police were working along the lines that the bombings were linked. </P>
<P> Monday's explosion in the town of Stinatz, aimed at a large Croatian immigrant community, occurred in the same region of Burgenland where the four gypsies were killed Saturday night as they tried to remove a racist sign. </P>
