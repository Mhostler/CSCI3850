<P>  American researchers reported Wednesday they had found a new way of using lasers in surgery that is more efficient and causes less damage than current methods. </P>
<P> Conventional lasers damage nearby tissue -- although much less than a surgeon's knife does. </P>
<P> But in a report in the science journal Nature, doctors at Vanderbilt University in Nashville said they found a way to cut down that damage even more by using a newly developed free-electron laser. </P>
<P> This laser can be more accurately tuned than a conventional laser. The doctors targeted the laser to break down bonds between proteins in tissue, rather than bonds in the water in tissue, and said this allowed more accuracy. </P>
<P> The team, headed by Glenn Edwards of Vanderbilt's physics department, said their process seemed to melt tissue, while conventional laser treatment caused the water in tissue to explode, thus damaging other cells. </P>
<P> ``We report here that targeting free-electron radiation to the amide II band of proteins leads to tissue ablation (cutting) characterized by minimal collateral damage while maintaining a substantial ablation rate,'' they wrote. </P>
<P> They tested their method on eye tissue but said it could be used for a variety of purposes. Lasers are widely used in eye surgery, where pinpoint accuracy is vital. </P>
