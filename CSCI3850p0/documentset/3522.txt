<DATELINE>MANILA, Phililppines (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Fireworks and gunshots claimed 16 lives and injured more than 800 as the Philippines greeted the New Year with customary exuberance, officials said Sunday. </P>
<P> Over 500 people were hurt by firecrackers in metropolitran Manila alone and another 300 were injured across the country. Most suffered only minor injuries. </P>
<P> The toll far outstripped that for last year's celebrations, when eight died and about 350 were hurt. </P>
<P> At the height of the revelry, just after midnight, a pall of gunpowder smoke hung over the capital. </P>
<P> A boy who carelessly threw a firecracker was being blamed for a blaze which destroyed a public market and bank at Calamba, south of Manila. </P>
<P> Firefighters retrieved seven bodies from the smouldering ruins, and three people still missing hours after the blaze were presumed dead. Damage was estimated at over $1 million. </P>
<P> A fire in Manila killed two people while three died in a blaze in the central city of Bacolod. A man committed suicide by drinking distilled yellow phosphorus, a chemical used in making fireworks. </P>
<P> Despite the large number of fire casualties, hospital emergency staff said they were encouraged by a fall in the number of gunshot victims in Sunday's New Year festivities. </P>
<P> While almost 100 people were hit by stray bullets during the 1994 celebrations, this year's figure barely topped 30. </P>
