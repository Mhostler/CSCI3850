<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The judge presiding over the double murder trial of football legend O.J. Simpson said in a letter released Wednesday that he intended to sequester the jury immediately after the panel has been selected. </P>
<P> Superior Court Judge Lance Ito, in a letter to executives of three television programs, asked them not to air their interviews with author Faye Resnick, whose explosive book on murder victim Nicole Brown Simpson prompted him to halt jury selection Tuesday, ``until after the jury in this case has been selected and sequestered.'' </P>
<P> Members of a sequestered jury generally live in a hotel with no contact with the outside world, apart from court personnel, for the duration of a trial. </P>
<P> Executives at two of the television programs said they planned to air their show on the book as planned. </P>
<P> Because of Simpson's celebrity status as an athlete, broadcaster, actor and TV pitchman, Ito has had to wrestle with the problem of saturation publicity since he took charge of the case in July. </P>
<P> Simpson, a member of the Football Hall of Fame and one of the best-liked and revered blacks in the nation, has pleaded innocent to murdering his ex-wife, Nicole, 35, and her friend, Ronald Goldman, 25. </P>
<P> They were stabbed and slashed to death June 12 outside Nicole Brown Simpson's luxury townhouse in the upscale Brentwood section of Los Angeles. </P>
<P> In her book, ``Nicole Brown Simpson: The Private Diary of a Life Interrupted,'' Resnick, a close friend of hers, says Simpson threatened to kill his ex-wife, that she urged her friend to flee the country before Simpson carried out his threat, and that Nicole Brown Simpson had an affair in 1992 with Simpson's friend and fellow running back, Marcus Allen. </P>
<P> Allen has not commented on the book, which Resnick says is based on a diary she kept at the time and which went on sale Tuesday. </P>
<P> Ito took the unusual step of faxing a one-page letter Tuesday to Eric Ober, president of CBS Television News, talk show host Larry King of Cable News Network and Maury Povich, who has a popular syndicated talk show, the details of which were made public by the judge Wednesday. </P>
<P> In his letter, Ito wrote that the jury selection process was ``made difficult by the unprecedented news media coverage.'' </P>
<P> ``The interview of Ms. Resnick, no matter what its content, will serve only to fan the already raging fires of adverse publicity and further jeopardize the parties' right to a fair trial.'' </P>
<P> Ito said in the letter that while he understood and supported the ``sanctity of the First Amendment'' right to a free press, the court also had an obligation to protect the Sixth Amendment to a fair trial before an impartial jury. </P>
<P> ``I hope you will find it in your conscience, corporate and otherwise, to cooperate with this request and delay this program's broadcast until after the jury in this case has been selected and sequestered.'' </P>
<P> CBS, in a statement, said Resnick's interview with Connie Chung would be aired as planned Thursday night, while Povich said he was faxing a reply to Ito in which he would say he will air his interview, complete with questions from the audience, as planned, Friday afternoon. </P>
<P> Povich said he would tell the judge he felt that airing the interview would have no detrimental effect on jury selection in view of what has already been broadcast on the case. </P>
<P> King, whose interview is set to air next Wednesday, said the matter was out of his hands. A CNN spokesman said Ito's letter was being reviewed by network executives. </P>
<P> Ito was huddled with defense and prosecution attorneys most of Wednesday, trying to decide how to handle the latest crisis in the case. </P>
<P> The selection of a jury of 12 men and women plus eight alternates from a pool of about 300 was scheduled to resume Thursday after being put on hold by Ito for 48 hours. </P>
