<P> ``There has been historic assessment that Kim Il-sung is responsible for unfortunate incidents such as the consolidation of national division and the fratricidal war in the Korean peninsula,'' Lee told a Cabinet meeting. </P>
<P> Lee's remarks mark the first South Korean government criticism of the Stalinist leader since his death July 8. </P>
<P> Seoul has refrained from making any move that could provoke North Korea since President Kim Young-sam said he still wanted to hold a summit meeting with Pyongyang despite Kim's death. </P>
<P> Lee repeated that the principle for the Korean summit agreed upon late last month between North and South Korea remained valid. ``The government will consistently maintain its policy that South-North relations should be improved peacefully through dialogue,'' he said. </P>
<P> In the past week, students in Seoul and provincial areas have staged sometimes violent protests demanding they be allowed to go to North Korea to attend Kim's funeral. </P>
