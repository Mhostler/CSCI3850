<P>  Delegates to a meeting of the world's largest conservation treaty Thursday rejected a bid to regulate trade in American mahogany, a prized tropical timber cut primarily from the forests of Brazil and Bolivia. </P>
<P> A proposal by the Netherlands to list the timber on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) failed narrowly in a secret ballot to achieve the necessary two-thirds vote. </P>
<P> International trade in species listed on Appendix II is regulated; trade in those on Appendix I is banned. </P>
<P> Conservation groups -- which had fought hard to have American mahogany listed -- expressed disappointment at the rejection. </P>
<P> ``This is a declining species, heavily exploited for international trade,'' said Simon Lyster, an official with the World Wildlife Fund. ``This is a species that should be protected.'' </P>
<P> Lyster said strong lobbying from the timber industry swayed convention delegates. </P>
<P> ``There's too much money at stake,'' he said. </P>
<P> The United States and the United Kingdom are the major buyers of American mahogany. </P>
