<P>  Rare pink dolphins threatened by construction of Hong Kong's new airport will get a marine sanctuary, but a fuel depot in the middle of their feeding area will go ahead, the government said on Thursday. </P>
<P> Construction of the air fuel depot was approved on condition it was built as quickly as possible and the environmental impact minimised, it said in a statement. </P>
<P> But environmentalists remained worried that the sanctuary would not be set up quickly enough to save the bubblegum pink, grey and white dolphins from extinction. </P>
<P> A spokesman for the Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF) in Hong Kong said other steps had to be taken to lessen the impact of construction on dolphins, like holding off work on the depot unless they were well out of the way. </P>
<P> The dolphins, which swim and feed in some of the world's busiest and most polluted shipping lanes, are thought to be a sub-species of the Chinese white dolphin, although some experts have suggested they are a different species. </P>
<P> They once thrived in the waters around Chek Lap Kok island, site of the new airport, but the whole island was blasted apart and tipped into the sea to make land for the airport. </P>
<P> The dolphins have dwindled to less than 100 from four times that number a few years ago. </P>
<P> The aviation fuel depot is to be built on Sha Chau island near Chek Lap Kok. </P>
<P> The government commissioned a study into the dolphins, which have been found only in Hong Kong, when it realised the vast reclamation works for the airport threatened their existence. </P>
