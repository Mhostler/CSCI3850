<P>  A Swiss lawyer and an international team of journalists Monday launched Geneva's first English-language daily newspaper since the late 19th century, aiming to tap the region's growing foreign community. </P>
<P> The Geneva Post, a 12-page broadsheet in the style of many leading newspapers in the United States and Britain, will appear from Monday to Friday. It is billed by founder and publisher Jacques Werner as a ``local daily with a world outlook.'' </P>
<P> In a statement of editorial principles, Werner said the newspaper would stand ``for liberal democracy and the free market'' and aim ``to reflect the best of Geneva's traditions of internationalism and open-mindedness, of tolerance and high ethical values.'' </P>
<P> The editor of the Post, printed in France and aiming for a readership of around 15,000, is Harvey Morris, previously foreign editor of the British newspaper the Independent. </P>
<P> Werner, who has put around $4.4 million into the project, says he is confident his apparently risky plunge into the Swiss newspaper business -- which saw the collapse in Geneva this year of the 100-year-old La Suisse -- would succeed. </P>
<P> Morris told Reuters in an interview there was a potential readership of around 40,000 in western Switzerland and nearby France, including many native French-speakers. ``But we are realists, and we will be delighted with 15,000,'' he added. </P>
<P> Morris said the newspaper was not directly aiming to take readers away from other English-language newspapers sold in Geneva, like the Paris-based International Herald-Tribune and the international edition of Britain's the Guardian. </P>
<P> ``Experience when we launched the Independent (in 1987) shows that we increased the market for quality newspapers,'' he said. </P>
<P> The last English-language daily in Geneva was founded by a U.S. Civil War colonel in the 1870s but was quickly converted into the French-language Tribune de Geneve -- one of the region's major newspapers today. </P>
