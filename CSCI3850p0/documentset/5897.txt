<P>  J. Peter Grace, a shipping heir who led his family company for half a century before agreeing to step down under shareholder pressure, died of cancer at the age of 81, W.R. Grace & Co. said Thursday. </P>
<P> Grace died Wednesday night at St. Vincent's Hospital in New York. The executive, known as a leading opponent of U.S. government waste, died as the company his grandfather founded struggled with the worst boardroom chaos in its history. </P>
<P> On March 17, following the sudden March 2 resignation of popular chief executive J.P. Bolduc, his one-time protege and hand-picked successor, Grace announced he would not stand for re-election to the company's board at its May 10 annual meeting and would have no responsibility for company affairs. </P>
<P> He had been the firm's chairman since 1981 and served as chief executive from 1945 to 1992, relocating the company from New York to Boca Raton, where he lived, in 1991. </P>
<P> The company was founded in 1854 by William Russell Grace, who had fled Ireland's potato famine and later served two terms as mayor of New York City. </P>
<P> Since Bolduc's resignation, the firm has been rocked by allegations of huge perquisites paid to Grace family members and of sexual harassment by Bolduc, which he has denied. </P>
<P> Born in Manhasset, N.Y., on May 25, 1913, Grace was raised in a Long Island mansion with 62 servants. A graduate of Yale, he joined the family firm in 1936 and guided W.R. Grace & Co. from an ailing Latin American trading and shipping company into a world leader in chemicals and health care products. </P>
<P> An outspoken conservative, he was an adviser to Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy and Reagan. President Reagan appointed him chairman of the President's Private Sector Survey on Cost Control in the Federal Government -- known as the Grace Commission -- which sought out inefficiency, waste and mismanagement in the federal government. </P>
<P> The commission produced a report outlining 2,478 recommendations to save $424.4 billion in three years. </P>
<P> Grace, who declared that ``the government is run horribly,'' won few friends in Congress but ultimately some of his recommendations became law. </P>
<P> Grace also was known for his temper. He apologized for a 1982 comment that food stamps were ``basically a Puerto Rican program.'' He apologized again a few years later after calling the former New York governor ``Cuomo the homo.'' </P>
<P> Grace also was a leading supporter of Catholic charities and other causes, donating millions each year. He is survived by his wife, nine children -- four daughters and five sons -- and 20 grandchildren. </P>
