<P>  A pipeline spilled about 10 tons of diesel fuel into a village pond in Russia's southern Urals region, which could pollute a river, the civil defense ministry said Thursday. </P>
<P> The spill, the latest in a series of Russian pipeline accidents, occurred Tuesday night on the Ufa-Petropavlovsk line, a ministry spokeswoman said. </P>
<P> The pipeline is used to transport refined oil products from the major refinery center of Ufa, capital of the republic of Bashkortostan. </P>
<P> ``Five preventive barriers have been set up to prevent diesel fuel from getting into the Ufa River,'' the spokeswoman said. </P>
<P> She said local control posts had not detected any diesel fuel in the river and cleanup operations had started. </P>
<P> The poor state of Russia's pipeline system has been highlighted in the past year by major accidents in the far north Komi region and in the Irkutsk region of eastern Siberia. </P>
<P> ``It is a constant problem. We have very bad pipelines -- old, leaking, not repaired for a long time,'' the spokeswoman said. ``It's a great tragedy. They should be replaced, not repaired. Repairs just lead to further ruptures.'' </P>
<P> Leading Russian environment official Alexei Yablokov estimates three million tonnes of oil are spilled in about 700 major leaks a year. </P>
<P> Last year, attention focused on the far north Komi republic where a series of leaks spilled between 90,000 and 120,000 metric tons, according to the Environment Ministry. This was more than twice as much as Alaska's 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster. </P>
<P> The World Bank has extended a credit of about $100 million to clean up the Komi spill, but it may be too late to stop some of the oil from seeping into rivers with the spring thaw. </P>
<P> Last month's rupture to the trans-Siberia pipeline in the Irkutsk region spilled about 3,500 tons of oil, much of it over a frozen river that flows into a major reservoir. </P>
<P> The civil defense ministry spokeswoman said work was continuing to clean up this spill. </P>
<P> Since the day of the accident, 5,359 metric tons of oil-polluted soil had been removed and special filters set up to collect the oil when the thaw takes place, she said. </P>
