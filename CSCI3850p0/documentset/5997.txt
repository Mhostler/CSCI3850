<P>  The United States and Bosnia Monday complimented a U.N. criminal tribunal for naming key Bosnian Serb leaders as suspects in future war crimes procedings. </P>
<P> ``I just wanted to say how very pleased we were about the announcement that came out of the Hague today,'' U.S. ambassador Madeleine Albright told reporters. </P>
<P> The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, based in The Hague, said Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic, army commander Gen. Ratko Mladic, and former secret police chief Mico Stanisic were being investigated as war crimes suspects. </P>
<P> Albright had particular praise for the chief prosecutor, Richard Goldstone, a former South African judge. </P>
<P> ``We consider this a clear sign about what a very good and tough prosecutor Justice Goldstone is turning out to be and that it is appropriate for him to have taken this step as a beginning in his process of dealing with some of the most serious allegations made about the situation in the former Yugoslavia,'' she said. </P>
<P> Asked whether U.S. officials as part of the five-nation ''contact group'' trying to devise a Bosnian peace plan would resume any talks with Karadzic and others, she replied, ``The procedures that have been involved in talking to them will have to be determined in Washington.'' </P>
<P> Bosnian Serb officials have already alleged that the tribunal's decision was due to U.S. pressure and indicated it would do nothing to improve relations with the outside world. </P>
<P> Goldstone wants the tribunal to ask Bosnia-Herzegovina to suspend its own legal proceedings against Karadzic and hand the case over to the tribunal, a procedure known as deferral. </P>
<P> Bosnia's U.N. ambassador, Muhamed Sacirbey, said the Sarajevo government ``welcomed these steps and will favorably consider cooperation with the Hague authorities regarding the indictment.'' </P>
<P> But he also inserted a note of scepticism, asking ``if this is something we can really believe in and if Judge Goldstone will carry through with his promises.'' </P>
<P> While the contact group has not spoken to Karadzic lately, United Nations officials have negotiated with him. </P>
<P> Chief U.N. spokesman Joe Sills said these talks would continue ``because they are one of the parties to the situation and we absolutely have to deal with them.'' </P>
