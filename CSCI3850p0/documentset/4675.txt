<P>  A key Republican senator has accused Secretary of State Warren Christopher of misleading Congress about Pyongyang's compliance with the U.S.-North Korean nuclear agreement, the Washington Post reported Thursday. </P>
<P> The paper said Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and chairman of the appropriations subcommittee on foreign affairs, warned Christopher in a letter that congressional doubts about his candor could jeopardize funding for the agreement. </P>
<P> In the letter, McConnell said ``prospects for support for this agreement are based on assumptions of candor and cooperation. I continue to be very concerned about both.'' </P>
<P> The letter said Christopher was less than candid when he told the Senate that North Korea was in full compliance because U.S. officials knew at the time of improper diversion of U.S.-provided heavy fuel oil. </P>
<P> But department officials said McConnell and other senators who have expressed similar concerns knew Christopher went as far as he could without breaching secrecy. </P>
<P> Christopher responded quickly, dashing off a letter to McConnell with a personal handwritten note and making a fence-mending phone call, the paper said. </P>
<P> ``My comments to the Congress reflect the administration's overall assessment'' of North Korean compliance, he wrote in the letter, adding in a personal note, ``Mitch, I know you agree that the North Korean accord is important and I want to work with you closely and personally on this.'' </P>
<P> The accord requires North Korea to abandon efforts to develop nuclear weapons in exchange for U.SS help in acquiring two new nuclear power plants to generate electricity. </P>
<P> The accord does not require approval by Congress, but Congress must authorize the outlays required for the nuclear plants. </P>
<P> U.S. intelligence detected that North Korea diverted a small amount of the $4.5 million of bunker fuel for industrial use, although it was intended for heating and electricity production.'' </P>
