<DATELINE>TALLINN, Estonia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P> (Includes material from LITHUANIA-RUSSIA story filed earlier Wednesday)  The Baltic state of Estonia Wednesday condemned Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev's warning that the Kremlin may use force to protect the rights of ethnic Russians living in other former Soviet republics. </P>
<P> ``Threatening the use of force against sovereign states is not in accordance with international standards of behavior,'' the Estonian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. </P>
<P> Kozyrev was quoted by Interfax new agency Tuesday as saying: ``There may be cases when the use of direct military force will be needed to defend our compatriots abroad.'' </P>
<P> More than 20 million ethnic Russians live outside post- Soviet Russia, either in the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania and in the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) grouping all other ex-Soviet republics. </P>
<P> Kozyrev singled out tiny Estonia and Latvia for his sharpest criticism, saying they alone had used legislation to push local Russians out. Hundreds of thousands of Soviet Russians settled in the area after Moscow took over the region in World War II. </P>
<P> The foreign minister's remarks were in line with a shift by the Kremlin, spearheaded by President Boris Yeltsin, towards an assertive nationalism which has replaced an earlier emphasis on general human values. </P>
<P> Moscow justified sending its army into rebel Chechnya in December, in what later proved a disastrously bloody and long-drawn-out incursion, with a similar warning that it had to protect the rights of local Russians. </P>
<P> The Estonian statement pointed out caustically that Kozyrev's latest warning came at a time when Russia ``has already killed tens of thousands of civilians in Chechnya.'' </P>
<P> It said Estonia was still waiting for an explanation of Kozyrev's speech, adding that Russia's Foreign Ministry had so far ``avoided'' responding to its request for clarification. </P>
<P> Earlier Wednesday, Lithuania's Deputy Foreign Minister Albinas Januska said Moscow's ambassador had told him there was nothing for his country to worry about in Kozyrev's speech. </P>
<P> ``He promised to give an official explanation in the near future, and he said that Mr Kozyrev's statements did not apply to Lithuania,'' Januska told Reuters. </P>
<P> After independence in 1991, all three Baltic countries regulated the status of their big Russian minorities. </P>
<P> Lithuania, with the smallest proportion of ethnic Russians (under 15 percent), is the least scared of being engulfed by its vocal minority and has the most liberal citizenship laws. </P>
<P> Estonia and Latvia, with between 30 and 50 percent of their populations composed of ethnic Russians, Belarussians or Ukrainians, have imposed stricter citizenship rules and both have tangled with Moscow over language and terms of residence. </P>
