<P>  President Clinton needs to make a better case to Congress if he wants to save the administration's financial rescue plan for Mexico from legislative defeat, Sen. Sam Nunn said Sunday. </P>
<P> ``The president and his team of people have to convince the Congress of what will happen if we don't do it,'' the Georgia Democrat said on NBC television's ``Meet the Press.'' ``I think there has to be a better case made on the substance.'' </P>
<P> Nunn said he was ``open to persuasion'' but that the measure to provide $40 billion in loan guarantees to Mexico faced a tough fight in Congress. </P>
<P> ``It's not going to be popular. Anyone voting for it is going to have to hold their nose because this is not what the public wants out there -- but neither does the public want a financial debacle south of our border with tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of immigrants coming across the borders,'' he said. </P>
<P> Republican Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, an outspoken critic of the president who hopes to run against him in the 1996 presidential election, predicted the measure would fail because Clinton had not presented a coherent plan. </P>
<P> ``We're seeing a real failure of presidential leadership and I think a lot of people are going to lose their jobs,'' Gramm said on the show. </P>
<P> The two senators echoed the gloomy assessments voiced on Capitol Hill last last week. </P>
<P> House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Friday the administration had not done enough to sell the plan to the American people -- despite an all-out drive for congressional support by Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan. </P>
<P> Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a senior member of the Foreign Relations Committee, estimated that less then a third of the members of either the House or Senate backed the plan, the administration's first major foreign policy proposal to go to the new Republican-led Congress. </P>
