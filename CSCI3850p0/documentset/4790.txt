<P>  Singer John Denver, who crashed his Porsche into a tree last summer, has won a dissmissal of drunk driving charges that resulted from the incident.  But the prosecutor said he will appeal because the decision puts other drunk driving cases in jeopardy. </P>
<P> A Pitkin County judge Tuesday dropped charges against Denver because the singer had already appeared at license-revocation hearing last year in connection with the same accident. </P>
<P> Walter Gerash, a well known criminal defense attorney, successfully argued that a court hearing would constitute double jeopardy. Denver did not lose his license at the revocation hearing before Motor Vehicles Division officials because of a technicality. </P>
<P> Had he been convicted Denver risked jail time because he previously pleaded guilty to a charge of being impaired by alcohol in 1993 when he was not represented by an attorney. </P>
<P> Gerash said Denver has not had a drink since August. </P>
