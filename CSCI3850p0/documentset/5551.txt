<P>  An inquiry into the hanging of a Filipina maid in Singapore has recommended the prosecution of seven Philippine diplomats and labor officials for dereliction of duty, a senior official said on Friday. </P>
<P> The panel submitted its findings to President Fidel Ramos on Thursday and left it to him to announce its recommendations to the public. Ramos said he would announce his decision on the case within days. </P>
<P> The others include Elizabeth Buensuceso, consul-general in Singapore when Contemplacion was first charged for double murders in 1991, and consular and labor officials and personnel. </P>
<P> The head of the panel, retired Supreme Court justice Emilio Gancayco, also told President Ramos that Foreign Secretary Roberto Romulo and Labor Secretary Nieves Confesor had become ``ineffective'' after the public outrage over the hanging, the official said. </P>
<P> Ramos earlier threatened to sever ties with Singapore over the maid furor but the Gancayco Commission said it did not recommend breaking ties with its Asian ally. </P>
<P> Contemplacion, a 42-year-old mother of four, died on the gallows in Changi Prison after she confessed to killing another Filipina maid and a Singaporean boy. </P>
<P> Her execution outraged many Filipinos who believe she was a victim of a frameup. </P>
<P> One hundred workers from the Philippines were due to leave Singapore aboard a Philippine air force plane on Friday, the second airlift by Manila following the hanging of the maid. </P>
<P> A C-130 aircraft has been sent by the Philippine government to pick up any of its citizens who wished to return home. </P>
<P> A senior Philippine Embassy official told Reuters in Singapore about 100 were due to board the aircraft for Manila late on Friday. She gave no other details. </P>
<P> Several Filipina maids , among a number at the embassy compound Friday waiting to go to the airport for the flight, said the hanging was not the reason they were leaving Singapore. </P>
<P> ``I am leaving because my father asked me to continue my studies,'' one Filipina, who said she worked as a maid, told Reuters as she arrived at the embassy lugging her belongings, including some toys. </P>
<P> Domestic worker Maria Brenda, 20, said she was leaving as she could no longer cope with the workload. </P>
<P> ``I couldn't cope with the work anymore, I have lost weight,'' she said. Brenda, who has been in Singapore for 15 months, also said she hoped to resume her college education. </P>
<P> Another maid, who is extending her contract here, said some of them had problems with the employers or their recruiting agencies and were taking advantage of the opportunity to leave. </P>
