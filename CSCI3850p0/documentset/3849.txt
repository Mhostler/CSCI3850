<P>  The number of Americans known to have been killed in Tuesday's earthquake in Japan has risen to two, the State Department said Thursday. </P>
<P> The first was named Wednesday as Voni Lynn Wong, a teacher from California. State Department spokswoman Christine Shelly declined to name the second, saying formalities of notifying the family had not been completed. </P>
<P> She said it was not Nana Demasio of Manhattan, named in a New York Times report Thursday. He was Ghanaian, she said. </P>
<P> With the death toll still mounting, at least 4,000 people were killed in the earthquake which devastated the Japanese city of Kobe. </P>
<P> U.S. diplomats were trying to locate the several thousand-strong U.S. community in the area, and some Americans who had been made homeless were found shelter in the U.S. consulate there, which was only lightly damaged in the quake. </P>
<P> Shelly said an emergency State Department telephone number in Washington -- (202) 647-0900 -- to provide information about private American citizens in Japan had received over 6,000 calls, more than half of them seeking direct assistance. </P>
<P> The Pentagon has agreed to send 57,000 blankets to Japan and U.S. ambassador to Tokyo Walter Mondale has donated a $25,000 discretionary fund for emergencies to the Japanese Red Cross, Shelly said. </P>
<P> Japan has also agreed to a visit by a team of U.S. experts headed by Richard Witt, national director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). No date has yet been set. </P>
