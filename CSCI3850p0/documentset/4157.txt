<P>  Gunmen killed an Israeli security guard Monday in the Palestinian-ruled Gaza Strip, riddling with bullets the car in which he was escorting Israeli gasoline tankers, witnesses said. </P>
<P> The gunmen, who seriously wounded a second Israeli guard, managed to elude the guards and armed Palestinian Authority security men escorting the two tankers on their daily rounds in the Gaza Strip delivering gasoline, Israel Radio said. </P>
<P> The radio said the attackers opened fire with automatic guns inside the Palestinian-ruled strip north of Nahal Oz checkpoint between Gaza and Israel. A third Israeli, thought to have been hurt, escaped unharmed. </P>
<P> The Palestinian security men opened fire on the gunmen but the assailants fled in a vehicle to an adjacent orchard, witnesses said. Israeli and Palestinian security officials who arrived on the scene were jointly investigating the attack. </P>
<P> Gaza is a hotbed of Muslim groups opposed to PLO leader Yasser Arafat's 17-month-old peace deal with Israel and has remained a flashpoint of Arab-Israeli violence since its handover by Israel to Palestinian self-rule in May. </P>
<P> PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat is under intense Israeli pressure to curb Muslim attacks against Israelis before Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin will move ahead with the expansion of self-rule as required under the peace deal. </P>
<P> Arafat said gunmen who killed the Israeli security guard on Monday were trying to destroy Middle East peace moves. </P>
<P> ``They want to squeeze the Palestinian people in the corner and to destroy the peace process. They are playing dirty work against their people, against the Palestinian people and against the peace process,'' Arafat told reporters. </P>
<P> Two Islamic suicide bombers from Gaza last month killed 21 Israelis, mostly soldiers, in central Israel prompting Rabin's government to tighten a closure on the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. </P>
