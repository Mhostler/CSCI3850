<DATELINE>MOMBASA, Kenya (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A U.S. Navy warship carrying marines and combat helicopters docked in Kenya's port of Mombasa Thursday ahead of the operation to evacuate United Nations forces from neighbouring Somalia. </P>
<P> The helicopter carrier Walter S. Diehl, which arrived in Kenya's coastal resort city after dawn, will take part in the six-nation task force sailing to Somalia's chaotic port of Mogadishu. </P>
<P> U.S. Airforce and Navy personnel have been flying into Mombasa's airport for days -- but spokesmen are being tightlipped on details of the operation. </P>
<P> Some 18 ships from the U.S., Britain, France, Italy, Malaysia and Pakistan are set to gather toward the end of the month to extract some 8,000 United Nations troops who have now retreated to Mogadishu's sea port and airfield. </P>
<P> U.S. marines are set to land in the last perilous few days of the evacuation, which should be completed by March 31, to set up a defensive perimeter as contingents from Egypt, Pakistan and Bangladesh leave. </P>
<P> The U.S. led a U.N. coalition into the country in December 1992 to save the Somalis from famine and civil war. </P>
<P> Also on hand for the evacuation are several ``Spectre'' AC-130 gunships, large propellor planes armed with an array of weaponry. </P>
<P> The planes were used to bomb districts of Mogadishu controlled by faction leader Mohamed Farah Aideed in 1993, who was being hunted by the United Nations at the time. </P>
<P> Aideed was never caught, U.S. troops pulled out after losing dozens of their own soldiers in street battles and the $1.5 billion-a-year United Nations mission to restore peace and government to the country failed. </P>
<P> Many feared the Somali militias would attack and loot the U.N. forces wholesale as they withdrew. There has been a steady stream of attacks and thefts, but nothing on a large scale. </P>
<P> Wednesday U.N. troops finally abandoned their old headquarters compound in downtown Mogadishu and withdrew to the seaside airport. </P>
<P> Packs of looters moved into the complex, on which the U.N. lavished $160 million, looting everything that could be carried off -- including window frames, light fittings and the electrical cables that ran under the sand. </P>
