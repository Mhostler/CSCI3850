<P>  The idea that the U.S. trade deficit with Japan is too high is due largely to misunderstandings between the two countries, Japanese ambassador to the United Nations Hisashi Owada said Thursday. </P>
<P> ``The people of our two societies don't understand each other well, which gives rise to misunderstanding and mistrust,'' Owada said in Seattle at a dinner sponsored by the Japan-America Society. </P>
<P> American misconceptions about Japanese society undermine the world's most significant international relationship, he said. </P>
<P> For example, he said, the average Japanese spends significantly more on American products and services than vice versa. It is actually the far larger U.S. population that is responsible for Japan's big trade surplus, despite ``the image that Japan is closing markets,'' Owada said. </P>
<P> But Japan must share the blame for trade friction between the two countries, Owada said, conceding that the country's long history of isolation and its paternalistic culture have caused problems in international relations. </P>
<P> He noted that Japan's meddlesome bureaucracy and complex system of transportation and distribution create difficulties for foreign trade partners. </P>
<P> Owada said cooperation on areas of common concern and stronger cultural ties are crucial to improving the relationship between the United States and Japan, which he said is critical to the political and economic well-being of Asia and much of the world in the 21st century. </P>
