<P>  Four Slovaks were caught Wednesday trying to smuggle 26.5 ounces of uranium-235 across the border into Hungary, a Slovak interior ministry official said Thursday. </P>
<P> The radioactive material was concealed in a lead box in the back seat of a car and was seized in the south-central town of Slovenske Nove Mesto, Jaroslava Ivor, an investigator in the Slovak interior ministry, told Reuters Thursday. </P>
<P> Three Slovak men and one Slovak woman were in the car at the time of the arrest, she said. </P>
<P> Since May German authorities have made five seizures of radioactive material, much of it believed to originate in the former Soviet Union. </P>
<P> The seizures have prompted fears that criminals are taking advantage of lax security at installations in the former Soviet Union to smuggle out dangerous nuclear material, perhaps for terrorist purposes. </P>
<P> Moscow officially denies that its security is lax and says there is no proof any of the seized material comes from Russia. </P>
<P> Russia's Interfax news agency reported early this month that police had arrested thieves in the city of Glazov trying to dispose of 220 pounds of low-grade uranium -- the biggest cache of radioactive material reported in the recent spate of smuggling cases. </P>
