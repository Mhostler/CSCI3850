<P>  French President Francois Mitterrand praised democracy and dialogue as the best guarantors of peace Tuesday in a barely veiled message to his Russian hosts about Chechnya at Moscow ceremonies marking the end of World War II.  ``Only democracy -- the accession of all people to the choice of their destiny -- can safeguard liberty and peace,'' the outgoing French head of state said in a speech. </P>
<P> ``There are still certain spots in the world, especially in Europe, where battles could be avoided if only dialogue was preferred,'' Mitterrand said. </P>
<P> Earlier, in a gesture intended to show displeasure over Moscow's drawn-out and brutal conflict with Chechen separatists, Mitterrand and other Western leaders had stayed away from a Russian military parade commemorating the 50th anniversary of the war's end. </P>
<P> Mitterrand's visit to Moscow was his last foreign trip as president. After two seven-year terms, he is to hand over power to his newly elected successor Jacques Chirac before the end of next week. </P>
<P> In his remarks, delivered at the start of an official dinner in front of Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Mitterrand never mentioned the Chechen conflict by name. </P>
<P> Earlier in the day, Mitterrand's wife Danielle invited several mothers of Russian soldiers sent to fight in Chechnya to meet her at the French embassy. </P>
<P> She also held talks with Sergui Kovalev, president of Yeltsin's Committee on Human Rights. </P>
<P> Mitterrand called on those present at the dinner to choose ``life over death, control their passions, and understand that the best path for the common good is to ensure the lives and independence of our sons.'' </P>
<P> He also hailed the courage of all soldiers in World War II, whatever side they fought on. </P>
<P> ``I never considered that the German soldiers were our enemies,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``One had to go into battle because that was the system... How can one distinguish between the courage of the German soldier and that of the Russian soldier, both of whom had to take part in terrible battles, each on behalf of his land?'' </P>
<P> ``Don't ask a soldier to analyse his actions. To him, his duty is obvious and he undertakes it just as we have done,'' Mitterrand said. </P>
