<DATELINE>FORT BENNING, Ga.(Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Five Army officers were suspended from their duties Tuesday as part of the military investigation into the deaths of four elite Rangers during water training exercises, officials said. </P>
<P> Maj. Gen. John Hendrix, commander of Fort Benning, said some or all of the five officers could be relieved of duty if the investigation finds they were responsible for the deaths. </P>
<P> The suspended officers were not identified by name, but include the battalion's commander, a company commander and three non-commissioned officer instructors, the army said. </P>
<P> Three weeks ago, four members of the Army Rangers training program died of hypothermia after wading through chest-deep water in a chilly stream near Eglin Air Force Base in northern Florida. Four others were taken to hospital for treatment. </P>
<P> At the time of the accident, the soldiers were in the final days of training for assignment to the Army's Ranger unit, a crack force that is deployed worldwide to assist in difficult military operations. </P>
