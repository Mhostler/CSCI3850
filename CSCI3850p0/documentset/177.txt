<P>  Dogs and cats can earn free bonus flights under Carnival Air Lines' new frequent flyer program for pets. </P>
<P> ``They must go in the cargo hold, and they don't get free drinks,'' airline spokesman Gabriel Gabor said Monday. </P>
<P> Human passengers were already eligible for a free round-trip ticket when they completed 10 round trips on Carnival Air. The Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based carrier extended the deal bonus to pets last week. </P>
<P> Pets must be accompanied by their owners, who must also be enrolled in Carnival Air's frequent flyer program. </P>
<P> But as with many airline special offers, there are restrictions: exotic animals need not apply. </P>
<P> ``As far as I know, it's only dogs and cats,'' Gabor said. </P>
<P> Carnival does not keep track of how many pets it carries, but it flew 1.1 million human passengers last year. Many of them paid $35 and up each way to tote their dogs and cats along, Gabor said. </P>
<P> Carnival Air Chairman Reuven Wertheim said he believes his company has the only pet frequent flyer program. </P>
<P> The carrier operates 19 aircraft with scheduled service between Florida and the Northeast, the Caribbean and Los Angeles. </P>
