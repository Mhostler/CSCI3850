<P>  Prime Minister John Major was on the brink Thursday of abandoning plans to sell Britain's post office in the clearest signal yet that public enthusiasm for privatization is flagging after 15 years of Conservative rule. </P>
<P> The cabinet was expected to drop the $730 million privatization after a hard core of rebel Conservative members of parliament warned Trade Secretary Michael Heseltine Wednesday they would not support the plan. </P>
<P> The rebels number between 12 and 20, enough to overturn Major's slender 14-seat majority in the House of Commons. </P>
<P> ``We gave him a fair hearing, but we said ``No, we are sticking to our guns','' Conservative MP Nicholas Winterton said. </P>
<P> A climbdown would be a humiliating defeat for Heseltine, the man who helped bring down former premier Margaret Thatcher in 1991 and has staked enormous political capital on the sell-off. </P>
<P> ``Last Post for Tarzan?'' ran the front-page headline in Thursday's Daily Mail, which speculated that Heseltine -- who won his nickname for his fiery behavior in parliament -- might decide to withdraw from front-line politics. </P>
<P> Scrapping the sell-off would be less of an embarrassment for Major, who has been more lukewarm about the plan and clearly stated his preference last month for a period of legislative calm to restore public confidence in his unpopular government. </P>
