<P>  Actor Michael Douglas said he saved his marriage by conquering alcohol abuse but he denied reports that he had also been treated for sexual addiction. </P>
<P> ``I knew I was drinking too much. It was 25 f+++ing years of work, pressure, knocking it back,'' the star of ``Fatal Attraction'' and ``Wall Street'' said in an interview with Vanity Fair magazine published in London Monday. </P>
<P> ``A crisis situation forced me to take responsibility for my behavior,'' he said. </P>
<P> But he forcefully denied press speculation that he was also treated for sexual addiction when admitted to an American clinic, saying: ``There was a lot of tabloid journalism about my supposed sex addiction. Bullshit, it's all bullshit. That was a good story but not the issue for me. </P>
<P> ``I mean, come on, I never pretended to be a saint. But give me a break. I can't believe that people are are so titillated by this made-up stuff.'' </P>
<P> Douglas said the treatment he had received at an Arizona clinic helped him re-evaluate his relationship with his wife Diandra and his famous father, actor Kirk Douglas. </P>
<P> ``The last two years have been really good. I chose not to work, to spend some time with my family,'' he said. </P>
