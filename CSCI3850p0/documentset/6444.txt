<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Overriding administration protests, a House committee Wednesday voted to abolish the agency that runs the U.S. foreign aid program and merge it with the State Department. </P>
<P> The International Relations Committee approved a measure that would also fold into the State Department the U.S. Information Agency (USIA) and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. The administration would have to submit a consolidation plan to Congress by next March 1. </P>
<P> The worldwide Voice of America radio system is part of USIA. </P>
<P> The radical reorganization, part of a Republican-drafted wide-ranging foreign affairs bill that makes heavy cuts in foreign aid, was approved on a party line vote of 22-17, with all the Democrats voting against. </P>
<P> A similar consolidation has been proposed in the Senate by Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C. </P>
<P> Republicans said the merger would result in savings of up to $3 billion over five years by cutting high-level staff and eliminating overlapping jobs. </P>
<P> ``We simply cannot afford a multitude of agencies, each with its own agenda,'' said Chairman Ben Gilman, R-N.Y. </P>
<P> But Rep Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., said the bill would create a huge new State Department bureaucracy and do nothing to enhance U.S. security or improve U.S. foreign policy. </P>
<P> ``I do not understand what it is that this bill is designed to fix,'' Hamilton said. </P>
<P> The committee begins debate on the rest of the bill Thursday. Republicans are proposing a $1.1 billion cut from current year spending of $20 billion for foreign affairs, including big cuts in foreign aid. </P>
<P> The administration had asked for a total of $21.2 billion for the 1996 financial year starting October 1. Secretary of State Warren Christopher called it a ``rock bottom'' budget but further cuts may be proposed during consideration of the bill. </P>
<P> Foreign aid is also on the chopping block in long-range budget plans released by the Republican chairmen of the House and Senate Budget Committees. </P>
<P> A group of House Democrats, including three members of the International Relations Committee, attacked the cuts, blaming them on congressional ``isolationists.'' </P>
