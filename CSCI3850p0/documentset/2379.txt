<P>  Hopes that the mysterious carjacking disappearance of two young boys might finally be solved were dashed Wednesday when a promising lead in the eight-day-old case turned out to be a false alarm. </P>
<P> Later in the day, local investigators searched the home of Susan Smith, the mother of Michael and Alex, aged 3 years and 14 months, respectively, according to NBC's ``Dateline'' program. </P>
<P> Union County Sheriff Howard Wells told reporters early in the morning that he had received a call regarding an out-of-state tip about the whereabouts of Michael and Alex Smith, aged 3 years and 14 months, respectively, who had been missing since Oct. 25. </P>
<P> ``This is probably the most exciting or promising thing that I have had so far,'' he said. </P>
<P> But after investigation, Wells found that the tip involved a child dropped off in Washington state that fit a description of one of the missing boys, but he was not one of the boys. </P>
<P> ``Our hearts soared for a while that we were close to recovering the children in this case. That did not happen,'' Wells said. </P>
<P> After Wells spoke, the boys' parents, Susan and David Smith, met with reporters and tearfully asked people to pray that their sons will be returned to them. </P>
<P> ``Our lives have been torn apart by this tragic event,'' Susan Smith, 23, said. ``I can't express how much they are wanted back home, how much we love them, we miss them. They are our hearts.'' </P>
<P> The whereabouts of the two young boys have been a mystery since Oct. 25, when Mrs. Smith said a man forced her at gunpoint to drive to the outskirts of town, forced her out of her car and drove off with the children still in the back seat. </P>
<P> Investigators have searched woods, fields and water in and around this rural town and tracked down hundreds of fruitless leads from about the country about the possible whereabouts of the boys, the stolen car, and the suspect. </P>
<P> On Wednesday they apparently shifted their attention onto the mother of the children, according to NBC, which said its reporter watched a team of four local investigators take photographs, dust for fingerprints and inspect Smith's crawlspace for nearly three hours. </P>
<P> NBC also said there were some inconsistencies in the story Susan Smith and of Mitchell Sinclair, the friend she said she was going to visit the night the children were kidnapped. </P>
<P> It said Sinclair was not even home that evening. </P>
<P> NBC also reported that investigators were stopping and questioning drivers at the site of the carjacking and the site where Smith was ordered to get out of her car. </P>
