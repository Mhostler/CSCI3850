<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici Wednesday abruptly delayed a meeting to write a balanced budget after Republicans on his committee expressed concerns about making deep cuts in the growth of Medicare spending. </P>
<P> The meeting set for Thursday was reset for May 8 -- an 11-day delay. </P>
<P> ``There's just too much strain to do it under the gun,'' Domenici told reporters outside the Senate chamber, but he expressed confidence the budget would pass his committee. </P>
<P> ``We'll have the votes and we'll pass this resolution'' once his members know more, the New Mexico Republican said. </P>
<P> Congressional Republicans have made balancing the budget by 2002 a top political and economic priority but have rejected raising taxes or cutting the military to do so. In fact, many demand that taxes be cut. </P>
<P> For example, budget committee member Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said Wednesday he will not vote for a budget unless it contained tax cuts. </P>
<P> That means that Medicare for the elderly and Medicaid for the poor -- the fastest growing and most costly parts of the budget -- must be reined in drastically. </P>
<P> A trustees' report released earlier this month detailed Medicare's problems and warned again that the program would run out of money early in the next century unless it were fixed. </P>
<P> ``Many (members of the committee) have not read the trustees' report, many don't know what they say about fixing it,'' Domenici said. ``That's very important.'' </P>
<P> A committee aide said hearings may be held next week to examine the report, with the hope that Medicare's problems can be fixed for the next 25 years. </P>
<P> Domenici wants to cut the growth of Medicare from 10 percent to 7 percent annually, saving $250 billion over seven years. He has also proposed to other Republicans cuts of $160 billion for Medicaid for the poor. </P>
<P> Senate Finance Committee Chairman Bob Packwood, R-Ore., called such cuts ``doable,'' but said he did not know how politically acceptable they would be. </P>
<P> Senior citizens groups, which proved their muscle by getting Social Security placed off-limits to budget cutters, will be watching carefully. </P>
