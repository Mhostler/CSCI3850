<DATELINE>TIRANA (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A court deadline to former Albanian political prisoners to end a six-day-old hunger strike passed without incident Thursday, but witnesses reported the situation was tense. </P>
<P> A Tirana court ordered 100 former political prisoners in Tirana to end their fast by 6 p.m. local time or face police eviction from the Tirana headquarters of the Association of Former Political Prisoners. </P>
<P> ``We shall not stop and will not leave voluntarily,'' strike leader Kurt Kola declared after receiving the order, which was issued in the presence of journalists. </P>
<P> Azem Hajdari, who led the student revolt which sparked Albania's democratic revolution in 1991, joined the hunger strikers and said he would be the first to oppose any police action. </P>
<P> ``I have my parliamentary immunity and I shall be the first to face the police,'' said Hajdari, now a member of parliament for the ruling Democratic Party. ``If they want to use force they will have to use it first against me.'' </P>
<P> An estimated 2,500 former political prisoners are now on hunger strike across Albania to back demands for compensation worth millions of dollars for wrongs they suffered under the former Stalinist regime. </P>
<P> ``Instead of expressing sympathy for the plight of these people, political leaders are starting a witchhunt against them,'' Hajdari told reporters . </P>
<P> Strike committee members said the order to stop the strike applied only to the 100 in Tirana although they expected similar orders to be issued throughout the country. </P>
<P> The government says it does not have the money to meet the strikers' demands and has accused their leadership of being right-wingers out to destabilize Albania's fragile democracy. </P>
<P> Several hundred sympathizers stood outside the association's headquarters opposite the parliament building, but only about a dozen policemen were visible. </P>
<P> ``If they come in and beat us up it will really be nothing new for us,'' two elderly hunger strikers, visibly exhausted from lack of food and the sweltering heat, told Reuters. </P>
