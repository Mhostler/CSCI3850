<P> Debre said that if violence again erupted between rival Hutu and Tutsi factions, he could not rule out international military intervention although he opposed that option. </P>
<P> He said the United States and France's EU partners had erred in threatening an intervention while refusing to commit their own soldiers to such a force. </P>
<P> The international community must urgently provide food aid and reconstruction help to Burundi to stave off new ethnic fighting, he said. </P>
<P> He also called on Burundi's African neighbours to stop allowing arms into refugee camps where two million displaced people were living in unhealthy conditions without food. </P>
