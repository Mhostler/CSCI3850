<P> As Constant left the news conference in a downtown Port-au-Prince square, Aristide supporters shouted ``assassin'' and smashed a window of his jeep, spraying his face with broken glass, a Reuter photographer said. </P>
<P> ``If President Aristide returns, he will have the support of the FRAPH in a constructive opposition,'' Constant told reporters. ``But if I find myself in disagreement with him, I pledge to work as a member of a loyal opposition.'' </P>
<P> Constant's change of heart came one day after U.S. troops, in Haiti to prepare for the return of Aristide's elected government, raided FRAPH headquarters in Port-au-Prince and Cap-Haitien, arresting at least 115 people and seizing documents and guns. </P>
<P> Aides to President Aristide said Constant was a murderer and leader of a terrorist organization and should be placed under arrest. They said it was a disgrace that American forces had allowed him a platform to speak from in the center of the capital protected by U.S. soldiers. </P>
