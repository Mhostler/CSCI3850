<P>  Xenon, an inert and harmless gas, could provide a new and better way to look inside the body's organs, researchers reported Thursday. </P>
<P> Writing in the science journal Nature, they said they had magnetically polarized xenon and used it for improved Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of mouse lungs. </P>
<P> ``Here we show that xenon gas can be used for high-resolution MRI,'' Arnold Wishnia and colleagues at the State University of New York wrote. </P>
<P> ``By introducing the hyperpolarized xenon into mouse lungs we have obtained images of the lung gas space with a speed and resolution better that those available from (regular) MRI or emission tomography,'' they wrote. </P>
<P> Regular MRI, considered superior to and safer than X-rays for many uses, uses water molecules and it cannot make images of the spaces between tissue. </P>
<P> The new method shows the spaces in the lungs -- important in an organ that fills up with air. The report said it could also be used to look at other organs. </P>
<P> ``As xenon (a safe general anaesthetic) is rapidly and safely transferred from the lungs to blood and thence to other tissues ... images of the circulatory system, the brain and other vital organs can also be obtained,'' it said. </P>
