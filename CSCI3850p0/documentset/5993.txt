<DATELINE>LONDON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Britain said Monday it would hold ministerial talks with the IRA's political wing in one of the biggest breakthroughs so far in Northern Ireland's tortuous peace process. </P>
<P> The move came after Sinn Fein agreed to discuss dismantling Irish Republican Army arms stockpiles, the government said in a statement. </P>
<P> On Sunday the IRA's political wing threatened to launch street demonstrations to protest London's refusal to give it equal treatment with other mainstream parties in British-ruled Northern Ireland by including it in peace talks. </P>
<P> Although Northern Ireland's fragile peace is intact, political momentum involving Britain and Sinn Fein has become bogged down since September when the IRA declared a truce in its 25-year-old war against British rule. </P>
<P> ``Following intensive exchanges with Sinn Fein, the government believes that a sufficient basis now exists for the entry of ministers into the exploratory dialogue with Sinn Fein,'' the government statement said. </P>
<P> ``The government has therefore proposed that a meeting should be held on this basis as soon as it can be arranged, at which the Minister of State, Michael Ancram, would lead the government team,'' it said. </P>
<P> The statement said that in intensive communications in recent weeks, Sinn Fein had agreed to discuss in a serious and constructive manner any issue which the government wished to raise, including scrapping arms caches. </P>
<P> Britain is holding exploratory talks with politicial allies of pro-British Protestant guerrillas, who called a truce in October, but had refused to approve similar ministerial talks with Sinn Fein, saying the IRA's determination to hold onto its arms was an obstacle. </P>
<P> Sinn Fein leaders, who insist disarmament discussions must also cover the British army's weaponry, charged that Britain has contrived the stalemate to slow down the peace process. Britain described that claim as unfounded. </P>
<P> Last week Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said his negotiators had exhausted their diplomatic skills in trying to end an impasse about when Britain would agree to send in a minister for bilateral discussions. </P>
<P> He also warned Britain against a ``twin track'' policy of engaging Sinn Fein in exploratory dialogue while excluding it from wider talks that Britain plans with other Northern Ireland mainstream parties about new political structures. </P>
<P> There was no immediate reaction from Sinn Fein to Monday's statement from the British government. Earlier, Sinn Fein officials said the group had received a fax from the government but refused to divulge its contents. </P>
