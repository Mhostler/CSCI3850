<P> ``Iraq announced today that it will pull back its troops from the Kuwait border,'' Clinton said in a televised address from the Oval Office. ``But we are interested in facts, not promises, in deeds, not words, and we have not yet seen evidence that Iraq's troops are in fact pulling back. We will be watching closely to see that they do so. </P>
<P> ``Our policy is clear: we will not allow Iraq to threaten its neighbors or to intimidate the United Nations as it ensures that Iraq never again possesses weapons of mass destruction. Moreover, the (U.N.) sanctions will be maintained until Iraq complies with all relevant U.N. resolutions,'' he said, referring to sanctions imposed after a U.S.-led coalition defeated Iraq in the 1991 Gulf War. </P>
<P> Clinton said Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had proved repeatedly that ``he cannot be trusted'' and that the buildup of U.S. defensive forces in Kuwait and the nearby Gulf area would proceed until the United States had proof Iraq had no intention of repeating its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. </P>
<P> ``Today I have ordered the additional deployment of more than 350 Air Force aircraft to the region,'' he said. ``We will not allow Saddam Hussein to defy the will of the United States and the international community.'' The air power deployment came atop the dispatch of an aircraft carrier and about 28,000 ground troops to the region. </P>
