<P>  Iran has nothing to lose from the U.S.-imposed trade ban because it is not dependent on the United States, a senior Iranian diplomat said Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``After the revolution, we completely lost dependency on the United States,'' Alaeddin Borujerdi, deputy foreign minister for Asia and Oceania, told a news conference in Tokyo. </P>
<P> The Iranian oil industry now had enough experience to drill oil on its own and non-American companies were not discouraged by the U.S. ban, he said. </P>
<P> ``We believe that it is only the American companies that will lose from Mr. Clinton's ban,'' he added. </P>
<P> Borujerdi said soon after the trade ban was declared, the Iranian government received numerous requests and applications from various non-U.S. oil firms to do business. </P>
<P> ``Officials of the Ministry of Petroleum are now negotiating for the best choice,'' he said. </P>
<P> On May 8, President Clinton signed an executive order barring U.S. companies and their subsidiaries from trading and investing in Iran. </P>
<P> The ban will mainly affect oil purchases by U.S. oil companies, which lift more than $4 billion worth of crude oil each year. </P>
<P> When asked if any Japanese companies had made business proposals, Borujerdi said no specific company names could be given but the door to Japan has always been open. </P>
<P> U.S. Ambassador Walter Mondale formally requested that Japan comply with the ban, but the Japanese government only promised to study the matter. </P>
