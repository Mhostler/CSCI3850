<P>  A U.S. Air Force general has been relieved as commander of allied forces protecting Kurds in northern Iraq after the accidental downing of h the April 14 tragedy, in which 26 people were killed. </P>
<P> ``He was relieved as commander of the Combined Joint Task Force'' based at Incirlik, Turkey, said Air Force Major Tom LaRock, a Pentagon spokesman. </P>
<P> ``His removal was an administrative action and did not constitute disciplinary action or relief for cause,'' said LaRock. </P>
<P> In a critical report, the Pentagon admitted Wednesday that a series of human blunders caused the April downing of the two U.S. Army helicopters by two American F-15C fighter jets over northern Iraq. </P>
<P> Citing major breakdowns in communication, the probe concluded that the pilots of two jets who shot down the helicopters, and the crew of a U.S. AWACS (Airborne Warning and Control System) plane monitoring flights in the area, had committed a series of blunders. </P>
<P> Pilkington, a 26-year Air Force veteran, was in charge of U.S. and allied forces protecting minority Kurds in northern Iraq from Iraqi attack at the time of the incident. He has returned to his previous post as commander of a U.S. fighter wing in Germany. </P>
<P> Defense officials said the relief order was made by Army General Alfred Joulwan, commander of U.S. military forces in Europe and Supreme Allied Commander of NATO forces in Europe, based in Belgium. </P>
<P> The officials noted that the commander of the joint task force normally holds the job on a temporary basis averaging about six months and that Pilkington had been in the position for nearly 11 months when he was replaced by Air Force Brigadier General Roger Carleton last month. </P>
<P> One official noted that Pilkington had been ``read his (legal) rights'' during the Pentagon inm as Iraqi helicopters, which are forbidden by the United States and allied nations from flying over northern Iraq. </P>
<P> The Air Force announced thursday that it had directed all senior commanders to analyze operations and training procese from Air Force Secretary Sheila Widnall and Air Force Chief of Staff General Merrill McPeak. </P>
