<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Mo Vaughn and John Valentin each hit grand slams for the Red Sox, but one would have been more than enough as Boston blanked the New York Yankees 8-0 Tuesday. </P>
<P> Valentin and Vaughn connected in consecutive innings. Valentin's bases clearing blast came off starter and loser Sterling Hitchcock in the third inning. </P>
<P> ``I was just trying to get a fly ball,'' said Valentin.'' I was looking for a fastball and jumped on it.'' </P>
<P> Vaughn's blast came off Brian Boehringer as Boston became the 42nd team to have two grand slams in one game. </P>
<P> Red Sox starter Vaughn Eshelman pitched six scoreless innings, giving up just three hits to collect the win in his major league debut. Joel Johnston worked two hitless innings and Ken Ryan pitched the ninth. </P>
<P> At Toronto, Roberto Alomar hit a leadoff home run in the ninth inning off Isidro Marquez to lift the Blue Jays to a 9-8 comeback victory over Chicago. </P>
<P> Alomar had three hits for the two-time World Series champion Blue Jays. </P>
<P> Toronto trailed 8-5 in the eighth before rallying to tie the game on RBI singles from Devon White, Paul Molitor and Joe Carter. </P>
<P> At Minneapolis, Phil Hiatt and Pat Borders hit home runs in a three-run second inning to lead Kansas City to a 4-3 win over the Minnesota Twins. </P>
<P> Hiatt led off the outburst with his first home run. After Greg Gagne singled, Borders blasted his first round tripper of the season. </P>
<P> Royals starter Mark Gubicza got the win, going six innings, giving up one run on four hits. </P>
<P> The Twins rallied for two runs in the ninth off Jeff Montgomery, but the Royals closer held on for the save. </P>
<P> At Texas, Tino Martinez and Rich Amaral had two-run singles to power an eight-run outburst in the eighth inning as Seattle bombed the Rangers 15-3. </P>
<P> The Mariners outburst came after their ace Randy Johnson had left after six innings, trailing 1-0 despite striking out eight. </P>
<P> Joey Cora and Jay Buhner each had three RBI as the Mariners won for the fifth time in six game. </P>
<P> In Detroit, Jim Thome and Paul Sorrento each blasted three-run homers to power Cleveland to an 11-1 victory over the Tigers, spoiling their home opener. </P>
<P> The Indians ammassed 15 hits, including a solo home run by Manny Ramirez and a two-run shot by Carlos Baerga. Eddie Murray was a perfect 3-for-3. </P>
<P> Dennis Martinez cruised to the win, giving up just one run on seven hits,three walks and six strikeouts in seven innings. </P>
<P> The game was marred by approximately 20 fans running on the field at different times. </P>
<P> ``I spent more time looking over my shoulder than concentrating on the game,'' said Cleveland's Kenny Lofton. </P>
<P> Stewart (1-1) pitched six shutout innings, allowing three hits and one walk. Rick Honeycutt, Jim Corsi, and Dave Leiper held the lead until Dennis Eckersley pitched the ninth for his first save of the season. </P>
<P> Berroa hit an opposite-field homer to right field on the first pitch he saw from California starter and loser Chuck Finley, scoring Mark McGwire, who led off with a walk. </P>
