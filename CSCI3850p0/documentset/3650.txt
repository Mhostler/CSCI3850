<DATELINE>EREZ, Gaza Strip (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres began talks on salvaging their peace deal Monday at the edge of the Palestinian self-rule enclave of Gaza. </P>
<P> In Cairo, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators resumed talks on long-delayed Palestinian elections. </P>
<P> Several hours earlier, a bomb exploded on a donkey cart as an Israeli bus passed in the central Gaza Strip. </P>
<P> No one was hurt on the bus but Israeli troops put the cart's wounded driver under custody while he received medical treatment, Israeli security sources said. </P>
<P> Drawn-out talks have delayed the next stages of the Israel-PLO accord -- Palestinian elections, Israeli troop redeployment in still-occupied areas of the West Bank and extending self-rule to all of the West Bank. </P>
<P> Palestinian self-rule began in most of Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho when Israel handed them over in May. </P>
<P> Palestinians have accused Israel of purposely dragging out talks on further implementation of the peace deal. </P>
<P> Israel, in light of guerrilla attacks that have killed scores of Israelis since the peace deal was signed in late 1993, has expressed reservations at redeploying troops away from Arab West Bank population centres before the Palestinian poll. </P>
<P> Unlike in Gaza, where most Jewish settlements are in a bloc, Jewish settlements dot the West Bank. In the town of Hebron, 400 Israeli settlers live amidst 100,000 Palestinians. </P>
<P> Palestinians say settlements could torpedo peace moves. </P>
<P> Arafat has met Peres and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin to try to push the beleaguered peace deal forward. The three received the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize for the peace accord. </P>
<P> Peres and Arafat last met in Gaza City on Dec. 21. </P>
<P> A senior Palestinian negotiator said last Thursday Arafat and Rabin would meet within two weeks to discuss guidelines for an Israeli redeployment in the occupied West Bank. </P>
<P> But Israeli media reports said Rabin was reluctant to meet Arafat until lower-level negotiators made more progress on implementing the next stages of the self-rule accord. </P>
