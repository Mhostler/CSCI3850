<DATELINE>MELBOURNE, March 21 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Australian police are hunting a man who breaks into homes and tickles children's feet. </P>
<P> Senior Detective Karen Broad told Reuters the tickling burglar has struck 18 times since October 1990, breaking into houses in the area around Bendigo in the state of Victoria. </P>
<P> ``He only ever enters through unlocked windows or doors and has never said anything to any of the children and never stolen anything,'' Broad said on Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``He just sneaks in and tickles the feet of young children, mainly boys.'' </P>
<P> She said the latest incident happened on Sunday night when a 13-year-old boy woke up at 3.30 a.m. to find a man, aged between 18 and 30, playing with his toes. </P>
<P> ``All we know is the guy obviously has a problem,'' Broad said. ``It is quite disturbing for the children and some of them are having counselling,'' she said. </P>
