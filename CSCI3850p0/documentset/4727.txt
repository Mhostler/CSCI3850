<P>  Minutes after setting a second indoor 400 meters world record in three weeks for his 40th consecutive victory, American track star Michael Johnson traded a triumphant smile for trademark nonchalance at the USA Indoor Track and Field Championships. </P>
<P> Johnson blew away the field in the 400 final Saturday to claim victory in a world record time of 44.63 seconds. </P>
<P> But after taking a victory lap before a wildly cheering crowd at the indoor Grand Prix season finale at the GeorgiaDome, Johnson shrugged off his feat and acted as if he was just killing time between outdoor meets. </P>
<P> ``Running the indoor season is a help but not something I need,'' he told reporters. </P>
<P> ``Basically, it helps break up the monotony of training,'' he added in a typically cool manner. </P>
<P> As a way of dealing with his winter boredom, the 27-year old Texan has buried his competitors on the indoor circuit this year. </P>
<P> Johnson, who was all alone from start to finish with his sizzling 44.63 on Atlanta's rubberized track Saturday, may have been the only person in the GeorgiaDome not impressed with his feat. </P>
<P> ``Anything I've done indoors hasn't brought any new revelations for me,'' he said. </P>
<P> The outdoor season clearly holds the prestige for Johnson, who has recorded 26 of his 40 consecutive 400 meter wins in the outdoor arena. </P>
<P> Johnson, who has not lost a 400 meter race since February of 1990, does not even plan to compete in next week's world indoor championships in Barcelona. </P>
<P> Instead, he said he will spend the next six or seven weeks back home in Texas, where he will be training for a run at Butch Reynolds' long standing outdoor 400 record of 43.29. </P>
<P> ``I'm very confident about what I can do outdoors,'' he said, ``and I think a 43-flat is possible for me.'' </P>
