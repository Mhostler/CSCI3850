<P>  President Alberto Fujimori, who is running for re-election, said Sunday he would be the best choice to carry out policies he created and re-iterated he would not suspend any of his governing duties throughout the campaign. </P>
<P> In a television interview, Fujimori said his opponents for next April's presidential elections were proposing ``Fujimorism without Fujimori,'' which was a clear indication of the success of his four-year-old government. </P>
<P> ``As a candidate, I am convinced that Fujimorism with Fujimori is the best alternative,'' he said. ``I am one alternative and a good measure of the democracy which exists here is that the people have so many alternatives from which to choose.'' </P>
<P> Twenty-seven candidates have signed on to run for president, but several, including perhaps Fujimori's estranged wife Susana Higuchi, are expected to be eliminated this week for lack of petition signatures, sources close to the electoral board said. </P>
<P> The interview did not touch upon the topic of Higuchi's rival candidacy nor their marital relationship. </P>
<P> Asked about the advantages he had over other candidates as an incumbent, Fujimori said he would keep his activities as president and candidate separate, although he did not say how he planned to do it. </P>
<P> Last weekend, Fujimori chose a ceremony in which he inaugurated a school in a poor Lima shantytown to announce his intention to run for a second term. </P>
<P> In the interview Sunday, Fujimori again rejected calls that he should step down from his post in order to run for re-election, allowed in Peru since the approval of constitution in late 1993. </P>
<P> ``Who better knows these successful policies, which have made Peru a respectable country after truly difficult times, than their very author,'' he said. ``We cannot stop this program now.'' </P>
<P> In a related development, a poll published Sunday showed Fujimori leading his nearest rival, former U.N. chief Javier Perez de Cuellar by almost 20 percentage points. </P>
<P> A poll by Imasen polling firm showed that of 455 people asked shortly after the deadline for registration of candidates about which candidate they would prefer, Fujimori obtained 45.6 percent, while Perez de Cuellar obtained 26.1 percent. </P>
