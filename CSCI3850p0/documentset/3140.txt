<P>  A former French presidential aide who was being investigated in a wiretapping scandal has committed suicide, a police spokesman said Monday. </P>
<P> The dead man, Pierre-Yves Guezou, a retired officer in the paramilitary Gendarmerie police, was one of five former aides to President Francois Mitterrand suspected of tapping telephones. </P>
<P> ``We can confirm that retired Gendarmerie Captain Guezou was found dead at his home in the Paris suburb of Noisy-le-Grand. It was apparently suicide,'' a spokesman for the Gendarmerie told Reuters. </P>
<P> Investigating magistrate Jean-Paul Valat had formally placed Guezou and four others, including Gilles Menage, a former senior aide to Mitterrand, under investigation for illegal wiretaps dating back to mid-1980s and apparently ordered from the Elysee presidential palace. </P>
<P> They were suspected of invasion of privacy in connection with the tapping of telephones of journalists, politicians and actress Carole Bouquet by the palace's anti-terrorist unit between 1983 and 1986, officials said. </P>
<P> Menage, who was head of Mitterrand's private presidential office until 1992, is now president of state-owned Electricite de France. </P>
<P> Also placed under investigation in the affair were Christian Prouteau, former chief of the presidential palace anti-terrorist unit, and three ex-members of the unit -- Guezou, Gendarmerie General Jean-Louis Esquivie and former police chief Pierre-Yves Gilleron. </P>
