<P>  North Korea's official media Thursday attacked what it called moves by Japan to revise its constitution and seek membership of the United Nations Security Council. </P>
<P> ``In actuality, Japan is removing one stumbling block after another in the way of her overseas military aggression, having made all preparations for it,'' said the Rodung Shimbun. </P>
<P> ``The constitutional revision means the removal of the last stumbling block.'' </P>
<P> The paper, the official mouthpiece of North Korea's ruling Workers Party, said Japan was seeking ``global domination as a political and military power by taking a permanent seat of the Security Council.'' </P>
<P> On Wednesday, the same newspaper accused Tokyo of ``trying to become a permanent member by abusing the growing demand of the international community for the democratization of the United Nations and for the reform of its Security Council.'' </P>
<P> Foreign Minister Yohei Kono, in a speech at the U.N. General Assembly in September, formally announced that Japan is seeking a permanent seat on an expanded and reformed council. </P>
<P> Tokyo has made no formal moves to rewrite the war-renouncing Constitution drafted by U.S. occupation forces in the aftermath of World War II. </P>
<P> But the taboo against discussing constitutional revisions is fast disappearing amid Japan's political changes -- so much so that the Yomiuri Shimbun, the country's leading daily, on Thursday published its own revisied constitution plan. </P>
<P> Koreans, colonized by Japan from 1910-45, remain accutely sensitive to any sign that Japan is asserting itself politically and militarily. </P>
<P> Although South Korea normalized diplomatic ties with Japan in 1965 and appears understanding, if wary, about Japan's global ambitions, North Korea's Stalinist regime has no ties with Tokyo and remains unremittingly hostile. </P>
