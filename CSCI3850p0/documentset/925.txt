<P>  Official Cuban media scorned new moves by Washington to step up pressure on President Fidel Castro, but Cubans continued to set off in flimsy rafts and other small vessels from beaches east of Havana Sunday. </P>
<P> There was as yet no comment from government officials on steps announced Saturday by President Clinton. </P>
<P> But the Cuban news agency Prensa Latina, often viewed as a reflection of official thinking, issued several articles condemning measures that include stopping cash remittances from relatives to Cuba, limiting flights from Miami to Havana and increasing U.S. broadcasts to Cuba. </P>
<P> ``The punitive measures against Cuba, announced by the United States ... contradict the genuine international consensus favoring an end to pressures and the blockade against the island,'' one Prensa Latina article said, referring to Washington's 28-year-old economic embargo. </P>
<P> ``The path chosen by Clinton to respond to the current crisis clashes with opinions expressed publicly on many occasions, and after recent developments, by international public opinion and the governments of many nations,'' the agency said. </P>
<P> The moves are aimed at pressing Castro into reform and also punishing him for what Washington views as Cuba's attempt to provoke a mass exodus of Cubans to the United States. </P>
<P> They are bound to hurt communist-ruled Cuba's embattled economy, and also strike at key areas of irritation for Havana, such as the radio broadcasts against Castro and charges of human rights abuses on the Caribbean island. </P>
<P> The halt of cash remittances -- relations were allowed to send up to $300 every three months per household to Cuba -- will affect not just the overall economy, squeezed for hard currency, but some Cubans in the privileged position of receiving dollars up until now. </P>
<P> In Cuba, even a few dollars can make all the difference between hardship and being able to obtain items such as soap and cooking oil. Such goods are rationed and very scarce when sold for pesos, the national currency, but are freely available in hard currency stores. </P>
<P> However, as one Havana resident pointed out Sunday, some of the dollar flow to Cuba has been illicit and that is likely to continue. Some Cuban Americans travel to Cuba on visits with thousands of dollars stashed away in their clothing for distribution among relatives and friends. </P>
<P> Clinton's move to stem a flow of emigrants that has hit the highest levels since the Mariel boatlift of 1980 -- when some 125,000 Cubans arrived in Florida in a matter of months -- has meanwhile so far failed to deter rafters. </P>
<P> The U.S. Coast Guard said it had picked up more than 4,800 people this month, more than 800 on Saturday. </P>
<P> Under Washington's change of policy, Cubans picked up are now being sent to the U.S. Navy Base at Guantanamo Bay on the southeast tip of Cuba, rather than automatically qualifying for asylum. </P>
<P> On Sunday from places such as Cojimar, 15 km east of Havana, dozens of people bobbed slowly off toward Florida in rafts made from inner tubes and wood. </P>
<P> Rafters seemed unconcerned about the prospect of going to the base at Guantanamo Bay. One woman, who slept the night on Cojimar beach in the vague hope of hitching a ride on a raft, knew nothing about the policy change. </P>
<P> But asked about what she thought of going to the base, she said: ``It doesn't matter, so long as it's not here.'' </P>
<P> Most people say they are departing because they are weary of economic hardship and worry about the future. </P>
<P> The flood of Cuban boat people began soon after Castro, angered by a spate of hijackings of state-owned vessels toward the United States, warned two weeks ago he would stop putting obstacles in the way of Cubans leaving the island by boat, or of their relatives coming to pick them up, if Washington did not change its immigration policy toward Cubans. </P>
<P> The United States quickly thwarted any attempt by Cuban Americans coming over to pick people up. But with Cuban authorities turning a blind eye to people setting out to sea, so long as it was in their own vessel, the number of rafters surged. </P>
<P> Setting out in a raft used to be a clandestine activity. In recent days, it has become a public spectacle in places like Cojimar, with people making their rafts on the beach, usually surrounded by a small crowd, and being waved goodbye as they set off. </P>
<P> But Cuba has rejected Washington's charge that it is encouraging the perilous journeys over the Straits of Florida, saying the root cause is the longstanding economic embargo and hostile propaganda from the United States. </P>
