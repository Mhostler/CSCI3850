<P>  Officials from the Dominican Republic said Tuesday they had reached an agreement allowing an international force to patrol the country's border to prevent smuggling of fuel and other goods into Haiti. </P>
<P> U.S. and Dominican officials said the mission will include more than 80 civilian and military personnel from the United States, Canada, Argentina and Brazil, expected to arrive within the next two weeks. </P>
<P> Brazil's foreign ministry later denied that it would help man the patrol, however. </P>
<P> In Washington, the Defense Department said it will supply six UH-1H Huey helicopters to be flown by Dominican Republic pilots for the border operation. </P>
<P> It will also send the Dominican Republic 50 trucks, 45 motorcycles, six inflatable boats and 106 radios for the border operation, the department said. </P>
<P> Pentagon spokesman Dennis Boxx said the international force will not stop the smugglers, but rather report them to Dominican Republic border authorities who are to stop them. </P>
<P> Smuggling of fuel across the nations' border is considered a major reason for the failure of a U.N. economic embargo to force the ouster of Haiti's military leaders. </P>
<P> Any monitoring effort would still leave open hundreds of miles of mountainous frontier between the neighboring countries, which share the island of Hispaniola. </P>
<P> ``Everybody knows there's a lot of (fuel) supply coming across the border,'' said Stanley Schrager, spokesman for the U.S. embassy in Port-au-Prince. </P>
<P> As they have each day, Haitian men, women and children jostled in street markets Tuesday to sell plastic jugs of gasoline poured from makeshift funnels reading ``USA''. The homemade funnels are made from vegetable oil tins used in U.S.-government sponsored food programs. </P>
<P> The price of gasoline is currently about $7 U.SS per gallon. It sold at a fraction of that cost before the trade ban. </P>
<P> Hundreds of Haitians have fled across the Dominican border to escape political turmoil in their homeland. </P>
<P> The agreement, signed Monday, came as final results of the Dominican Republic's spring presidential elections, which have been tainted by allegations of fraud, were reported. </P>
<P> The nation's Central Election Board announced Tuesday afternoon that incumbent president Joaquin Balaguer, 87, had been reelected by less than one percent of about three million votes cast. </P>
<P> Balaguer, who is blind, was seeking a seventh non-consecutive term. </P>
<P> The opposition Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD), led by presidential candidate Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, 57, has called for new elections. The PRD alleged that thousands of its members could not cast their ballots because their names had been removed from the election rolls. </P>
<P> The Dominican elections have been subject to international scrutiny because of the country's proximity to Haiti. </P>
