<P>  Three shells, apparently fired by Bosnian Serb forces, slammed into an area near the Adriatic port of Dubrovnik Tuesday local police said. </P>
<P> ``Three shells hit Zupa Dubrovacka at 12:15 p.m. but no one was hurt and damage is only slight,'' police spokesman Zlatko Kuretic told Reuters. ``The shells were fired from Serb positions,'' he said. </P>
<P> Zupa is a coastal strip south of Dubrovnik, a medieval town known as the ``Jewel of the Adriatic.'' </P>
<P> A local radio reporter contacted by telephone said the shells landed some 10 miles from the port. Serb forces in Bosnia have occasionally shelled the Dubrovnik area from positions some 15 miles distant. </P>
<P> Last week the Serbs fired artillery rounds at Dubrovnik airport in retaliation for a Croatian government offensive on a rebel Serb-held enclave in central Croatia. </P>
