<P>  It rained, the security guards and organizers were confused, but diehard fans kept coming to Eurowoodstock -- Hungary's tribute to Woodstock. </P>
<P> The reunion festival seemed set to start off much like the legendary rock concert in the United States 25 years ago that it commemorated. </P>
<P> ``We're not going to go home just because of a little rain,'' said a teen-age girl who gave her name only as Szilvi ``The Meatball' as she and three friends shivered in the downpour. </P>
<P> Szilvi, from Dunaujvaros in central Hungary, was among dozens of people setting up tents on this island in the River Danube that is the site for the weeklong festival which began late Thursday night. </P>
<P> The concert was scheduled to feature several of the original Woodstock performers, including Alvin Lee and the former Jefferson Airplane, now called Jefferson Starship. Jethro Tull and the late Frank Zappa's band Mothers of Invention, renamed Grandmothers of Invention, was also billed to appear. </P>
<P> Organizers said they expected some 150,000 people to attend the festival. Late Thursday night, it was too early to tell if that projection was likely to be met. </P>
<P> However, fans were forced to stand in a long line near the narrow bridge leading to the island as organizers seemed unable to cope with the crowds. </P>
<P> ``That's the real music,'' said Viktor Jakobi, who works at a Budapest luxury hotel, talking of 60s rock band Jethro Tull. ``This music of today is not the real stuff.'' </P>
<P> But the overwhelmingly youthful crowd was not unanimous in their admiration of performers who were probably older than their parents. </P>
<P> ``Yuk!'' Szilvi ``the Meatball' said when asked about the original Woodstock bands, adding that she had come to hear Hungarian musicians, who were also billed to perform. </P>
<P> Eurowoodstock opened a few days after Woodstock '94, a weekend reunion in New York State, came to an end. Tickets to the Hungarian event, at 300 forints ($2.80) for a day and 1,800 forints ($16.80) for a week, were a bargain compared to the $135 charged at the U.S. event. </P>
<P> Both events commemorated the 1969 festival that has come to symbolize the rock revolution, a beacon for a whole generation. </P>
<P> The original Woodstock, Woodstock '94 and Eurowoodstock all experienced torrential rains, but they failed to dampen fan spirits. </P>
