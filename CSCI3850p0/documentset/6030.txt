<P>  The number of missing and possibly trapped in the rubble left by a truck bomb explosion is rising and could go higher than 200, a city official said Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``I don't know the exact number,'' Ray Blakeney of the Oklahoma City medical examiner's office said. ``We still are thinking there is probably in the area of 200 missing. But we are still getting reports in so it can vary.'' </P>
