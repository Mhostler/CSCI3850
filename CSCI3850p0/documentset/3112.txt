<P>  Baseball negotiators gathered here Friday as owners examined a new contract proposal from players ahead of the resumption of talks on Saturday. </P>
<P> John Harrington, the Boston Red Sox chief executive officer and head of the owners' negotiating committee, offered grounds for some hope of settling the dispute in which the players went on strike on Aug. 12 and the owners cancelled the rest of the 1994 season on Sept. 14. </P>
<P> ``I have a high degree of expectations that the (players') counter-proposal was a major step forward for both sides and will address spiraling salaries,'' said Harrington. </P>
<P> ``I expect to be here four or more days.'' </P>
<P> Federal mediator Bill Usery met with the owners for less than two hours Friday, and was meeting with the players Friday evening. </P>
<P> The negotiations beginning Saturday are a last-ditch effort to avert the declaration of an impasse. </P>
<P> Usery convinced the owners to postpone a December 5 meeting at which they planned to declare an impasse and unilaterally impose their terms, including a salary cap. </P>
<P> The players have said they would never accept a salary cap, and would continue their strike next season if the owners attempted to field replacement players under such a system. </P>
<P> Usery also cajoled the players into presenting their counter-proposal to the owners' ``luxury tax'' plan which was submitted Nov. 17. </P>
<P> The union was also expected to accept the elimination of salary arbitration, which many owners have blamed for the escalation of salaries to the current Major League Baseball average of $1.2 million. </P>
<P> In return the players would get unconditional free agency after four years. </P>
<P> The players have stressed a need for partnership with league management. The players want a voice in the selection of a new commissioner, television negotiations, expansion and realignment. </P>
<P> Kansas City Royals pitcher David Cone, the 1994 Cy Young winner in the American League, said: ``Certainly we feel a sense of urgency, but it's out of our control. If it's the owners' objective to impose the cap and test the union and get the guys to cross the line that's a whole different story. </P>
<P> ``But if they really want to talk about a true partnership we are here to do so.'' </P>
<P> Texas Rangers pitcher Kevin Brown said: ``We are not going to give them an artificial proposal to constrain salaries. That's been our premise from Day One. </P>
<P> ``We are trying to address their problems. We are trying to help provide revenue streams for the industry and provide some incentive to let the industry grow.'' </P>
<P> Stan Kasten, president of the Atlanta Braves, said: ``It's 120 days into the strike and it's very painful to both sides. There is a lot of pressure on both sides. Hopefully, that in itself will move us towards a negotiated settlement.'' </P>
<P> Colorado Rockies owner Jerry McMorris said: ``This is a very critical round that we will hopefully make some progress with. </P>
<P> ``I want to see some kind of drag on the explosion of salaries. Can we get on the same page and move ahead?'' </P>
