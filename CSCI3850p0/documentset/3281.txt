<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Treasury Department's top law enforcement official accused Clinton Administration budget planners of pushing cuts ``completely out of sync'' with the president's anti-crime initiatives, the Washington Post reported Saturday. </P>
<P> Ronald Noble, who as undersecretary for law enforcement presides over the Secret Service, Customs Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), in an interview with the newspaper, described proposed cutbacks in his budget as ''stupid.'' </P>
<P> Plans drawn up by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) would cut ATF's gun enforcement efforts by a quarter, a move that would save $53 million and result in laying off 530 employees, the Post said. </P>
<P> Noble was quoted as accusing OMB officials of being ''intellectually dishonest,'' acting in a manner that was a disservice to Clinton, and threatening the president's relationship with the nation's law enforcement leaders. </P>
<P> ``This is stupid ... and someone should be held accountable. I'm telling you that people over there should be fired or moved or replaced, or I should be fired, removed or replaced,'' he told the Post. </P>
<P> ``Some of us - one of us, is completely out of sync with what this president stands for,'' he said. </P>
<P> Clinton has made anti-crime programs, especially his support for gun control, a centerpiece of his domestic agenda. </P>
