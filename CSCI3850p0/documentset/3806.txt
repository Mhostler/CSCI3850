<P>  Commerce Secretary Ron Brown announced more deals for American companies Tuesday, bringing the total amount reaped during a ground-breaking trade mission to India to $4 billion. </P>
<P> Brown announced $2.6 billion in fresh agreements before meeting Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao and Finance Minister Manmohan Singh to urge them to push ahead with their three-year-old free-market reforms. </P>
<P> ``I'd like to emphasize that Prime Minister Rao's bold vision of a more open Indian economy, and the courageous reforms that he has implemented, have laid the groundwork for our successes today,'' Brown said in a statement. </P>
<P> ``President Clinton and I commend his leadership, and support his efforts as the United States and India continue to build a stronger commercial relationship.'' </P>
<P> The power, petrochemicals, telecommunications and health care agreements, expected to be signed at a lavish ceremony later Tuesday, followed $1.4 billion that were signed the previous day. </P>
<P> ``The extraordinary potential of the Indian market is only starting to become apparent, and today's agreements scratch only the surface,'' Brown said. </P>
<P> The deals included a $1.1 billion offshore oil and gas production contract for Enron Corp. AES Transpower received a financial guarantee from the Indian government clearing the way for a $633 million power plant in eastern India. </P>
<P> Enserch Development Corp. was expected to sign a memorandum of understanding on a $450 million project for a 300 megawatt combined-cycle power plant in the southern Indian state of Kerala, it said. </P>
<P> In an unusual deal, Petrodyne of the U.S. was to sign an agreement with Indian Oil Corp and Petro Energy Products India to move a U.S.-built oil refinery from Naples, Italy to India. </P>
<P> ``Clearly, the Clinton administration is acting as rapidly and as effectively as we know how, to shape the recent thaw into a warm and lasting friendship,'' Brown said in a speech prepared for delivery to Indian business leaders. </P>
<P> The United States is India's biggest trade and investment partner but recognizes that competition is heating up as New Delhi lowers trade barriers and opens its markets -- virtually sealed during four decades of socialist rule. </P>
<P> U.S. exports to India were $2.8 billion in 1993, while Indian exports to the United States totaled $4.6 billion, according to Commerce Department figures. </P>
<P> American firms have invested only $800 million in India, well below levels in China and many other developing countries. </P>
<P> But India approved $1.1 billion in new U.S. investment in 1993, more than twice the 1992 figure and 40 percent of all approved foreign investment. </P>
<P> U.S. executives complained Monday that India had not done enough to lower tariffs and open its markets, and Brown said there were worries about India's cumbersome regulations. </P>
<P> But Brown has been reluctant to follow the lead of many other foreign visitors who have urged Rao's government to move ahead more boldly. </P>
<P> The Commerce Secretary said Monday he was convinced Rao was irreversibly committed to liberalization, despite recent setbacks to his ruling Congress Party in state elections. </P>
