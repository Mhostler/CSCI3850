<DATELINE>TOKYO, May 27 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  In an escalating war of words over a car trade dispute between Japan and the United States, Tokyo on Saturday rejected a U.S. proposal to hold talks in Washington, saying the negotiations must be held in Geneva. </P>
<P> ``As for the venue, the talks should be held in Geneva because it will be held under the procedures of the World Trade Organisation (WTO),'' the statement said. </P>
<P> Washington has announced that it would slap a 100 percent tariff on luxury cars as a sanction against what it called Japan's unwillingness to open its car and car-part markets. In turn, Japan appealed to the WTO against what it said was a unilateral move by the United States. </P>
<P> On Friday, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor rejected Japan's request to hold talks next week under WTO guidelines, and said instead he would be willing to hold them in Washington on June 20 to 21. </P>
<P> That would come after the Group of Seven meeting of industrialised countries in Halifax, Canada, leaving little time before June 28 when the U.S. sanctions were to take effect. </P>
<P> Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama was scheduled to hold talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton in a separate bilateral meeting just before the June 15 to 17 Halifax meeting. </P>
<P> The latest MITI statement meant Japan has not given up the idea of bilateral negotiations before the G7 summit, but it also showed Japan was trying to avoid playing into U.S. hands by agreeing on the venue of the talks. </P>
<P> The statement said there were unclear points in Kantor's reply and said MITI would make further comments after seeking an explanation from the United States. </P>
<P> Earlier on Saturday, an unnamed MITI official criticised what he called a U.S. attempt to hide the nature of the pending WTO talks. </P>
<P> ``The U.S. side should stop their attempt to mislead everybody by using this rhetoric,'' the official told Jiji news agency. </P>
<P> Jiji said the United States had revealed the contents of a memorandum it sent to MITI Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, saying Washington would consider the WTO talks a resumption of bilateral talks on cars and car parts. </P>
<P> But the official told Jiji the WTO talks would cover only the U.S. decision to impose the sanctions. </P>
<P> ``We have no plans to resume auto talks unless the U.S. side drops its demands on the Japanese government to adopt a plan for increasing the purchase of U.S. car parts,'' the official said. </P>
