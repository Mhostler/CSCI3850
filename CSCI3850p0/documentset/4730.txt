<P>  Pressure grew on NATO secretary-general Willy Claes Sunday to resign over a defense contract corruption scandal amid concern in Belgium that the affair will damage the center-left coalition in May elections. </P>
<P> One of his former aides is in detention after being questioned over the scandal, in which the Flemish Socialist Party (SP) is alleged to have received ``gifts'' in 1989 from the Italian defense company Agusta. </P>
<P> Friday, police searched offices at the Belgian Economics Ministry, where Claes was minister at the time of the alleged payments. </P>
<P> Claes, currently in the United States, said last week he was determined to stay on in a post he took up just five months ago. </P>
<P> Yet, for the first time, a former SP colleague has publicly urged him to leave the NATO post until the affair is cleared up. </P>
<P> Parliamentarian Jef Sleeckx said on the Belgian television channel VTM Saturday night that he thought it best for Claes to step down. </P>
<P> Belgian opposition politicians have already called on Claes to quit, along with other top SP figures named in the scandal. </P>
<P> The SP, which says investigators should be given access to recently discovered Swiss bank accounts, believes the party's good name is being smeared. </P>
<P> Foreign Minister Frank Vandenbroucke, former head of the SP, said in an interview with the VT4 Dutch-language television channel that he thought the scandal was related to a ``sort of international financial mafia'' which had abused the party name. </P>
<P> Concern over the scandal has spread beyond Belgium's borders. A top member of Germany's liberal Free Democrats (FDP), junior partners in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government, called on Claes Sunday to step down until the scandal was resolved. </P>
<P> ``I recommend that the NATO secretary-general stand down until it is,'' FDP parliamentary leader Hermann Otto Solms told the Bild an Sonntag newspaper in an interview. </P>
<P> The United States has expressed support for Claes, however, and Dutch Defense Minister Joris Voorhoeve last week withdrew a suggestion that he should stand down during the probe. </P>
<P> At issue are allegations that Agusta made ``gifts'' to the SP in 1989 linked to a 1988 purchase of 46 helicopters for the Belgian army. </P>
<P> There has been no suggestion that Claes himself received any of the alleged payments, totalling about $1.70 million. </P>
<P> He has been badly wounded, however, by having to retract a statement that he knew nothing of the affair. He denies any wrongdoing. </P>
<P> Claes said in late February that he ``vaguely'' remembered discussing the matter after Vandenbroucke told Belgian media he had had a conversation with Claes about the payments. Agusta has always denied any wrongdoing. </P>
<P> Investigators widened their probe into the alleged kickbacks Friday to examine another alleged payment of $2 million into a Swiss bank account held by a former SP official. </P>
