<P>  A 25-year-old woman from Hong Kong, whose execution was postponed so she could spend Christmas with her family, was hanged Friday for drug trafficking, a government statement said. </P>
<P> Angel Mou Pui-peng, a Macau-born woman with a Portuguese passport who lived in Hong Kong, was arrested at Singapore's Changi Airport in 1991 with a suitcase containing 12.3 lbs of heroin. </P>
<P> Mou was sentenced to death in 1993 and her personal clemency plea was later rejected. </P>
<P> The president of Portugal, Mario Soares, and the Portuguese government had appealed for clemency on Mou's behalf to Singapore President Ong Teng Cheong. </P>
<P> Mou's family had petitioned Singapore's Prisons Department to postpone her scheduled Dec. 23 execution so she could spend one final Christmas with her relatives, including her nine-year-old son. </P>
<P> Under Singapore law, the death sentence is mandatory for anyone over 18 years of age found guilty of trafficking in more than half an ounce of heroin, one ounce of morphine or 18 oz of cannabis. </P>
