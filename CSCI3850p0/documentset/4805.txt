<P>  A Cambodian police chief has named five Khmer Rouge guerrillas he says are responsible for the murders of two Britons and an Australian last year, an Australian newspaper reported Thursday. </P>
<P> The Age og Melbourne quoted General Tak Van Tha, police chief in the southern city of Sihanoukville, as saying the five were responsible for the execution-style slayings of Australian Kellie Wilkinson, 24, her boyfriend, Briton Dominic Chappell, 24, and another Briton, Tina Dominy, also 24. </P>
<P> The three were taken hostage at gunpoint last April after their taxi was stopped at a Khmer Rouge roadblock on National Route 4 near the port city of Sihanoukville. </P>
<P> They were marched into nearby scrubland and shot within days of their capture, police sources have said. </P>
<P> The five guerrillas have been named in a court document being prepared by local police, The Age reported. </P>
<P> Other testimony includes an eyewitness account from a local villager who saw the three shortly after their capture. </P>
<P> ``They were killed while lying on their backs and the bodies were not buried,'' The Age quotes the villager as saying. </P>
