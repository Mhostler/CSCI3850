<P> The radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation, said the train linking Mandalay and Myitkyina was derailed when its brakes failed, and one of the carriages plunged into a ravine. </P>
<P> Several other carriages of the mixed cargo-passenger train overturned or came off the rails and one passenger carriage was left hanging from a bridge. </P>
<P> The train bound for Myitkyina had reached Wuntho township about 135 miles north of Mandalay when its brakes failed on a slope, sending it hurtling out of control down the hill. </P>
