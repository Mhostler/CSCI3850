<P>  Kristian Zoeller, a 220-pound high school football player, was a bit surprised when he received a letter from the Citadel rejecting his request for an admission application because he did not meet the school's criteria. </P>
<P> Zoeller, the school said, couldn't apply to the all-male college because he was a girl. What made it surprising is that Zoeller is a boy. </P>
<P> ``It was a mistake on our part. We had what looked like a gender-neutral name,'' said Maj. Rick Mill, spokesman for The Citadel. ``We didn't know it was a male, that's why it went back as a rejection.'' </P>
<P> It wasn't the first time the state-funded all-male military college has made such a mistake. Shannon Faulkner sued the Charleston, S.C., school in March 1993 after her admission was rescinded when officials discovered her gender. </P>
<P> A federal appeals court ruled last week that Faulkner's constitutional right to equal treatment had been violated and ordered the school to admit her as a full-fledged cadet. </P>
<P> As required, before the mistake was discovered The Citadel had forwarded Zoeller's name to the Justice Department, which promptly sent the Newburyport, Mass., boy a letter asking if he wanted to join Faulkner's sex-discrimination lawsuit. </P>
<P> ``I was a little surprised at what happened,'' Zoeller, 16, said in a telephone interview. ``I was more upset with the Justice Department because they didn't do any research before writing me. I called a couple lawyers at the department and told them I am a guy and I have all the right body parts.'' </P>
<P> He said his friends got a good laugh from the slip-up. </P>
<P> The college has since apologized and sent application materials to Zoeller, who is still considering attending the military college. </P>
