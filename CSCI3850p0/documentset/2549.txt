<P>  Senior U.S. officials said Friday that Washington's policy of broad engagement with China was producing results and expressed confidence Beijing would encourage North Korea to fulfill a landmark nuclear accord. </P>
<P> The officials said after talks between Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen they were disappointed North Korea reacted negatively to South Korea's decision to resume business contacts with the North. </P>
<P> But Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord insisted ``we shouldn't take this as any definitive North Korean comment'' and expressed hope that Pyongyang would eventually agree to cooperate and reciprocate, as the United States has urged. </P>
<P> Christopher said his meeting with Qian was ``part of the broader engagement between the United States and China which has produced important dividends within the last period,'' including trade, non-proliferation, military contacts and human rights. </P>
<P> Qian also described their recent contacts as productive.  The meeting between Christopher and Qian was the second in a month and came amid a virtual flood of high-level contacts between the two governments, which six months ago were on a collision course over trade and human rights. </P>
<P> That tension was broken when President Clinton reversed his policy linking extension of favorable trade benefits to China's human rights record and decided to pursue a strategy of ``broad engagement'' with the communist regime. </P>
<P> In addition to Christopher's meeting with Qian on the fringes of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, Trade Representative Mickey Kantor is to hold extended talks with his Chinese counterpart Sunday. </P>
<P> Next week, also on the fringes of the talks, Clinton will meet Chinese President Jiang Zemin. </P>
