<P>  An unidentified man was being held for psychiatric evaluation Thursday after he was found carrying a semi-automatic pistol near a motorcade route taken by President Clinton, Pennsylvania state police said. </P>
<P> ``It appears there was no threat to the president,'' a police report on Wednesday's incident said. ``The subject never removed the weapon from the holster and never pointed it at anyone. In fact, the president had passed the site of the incident when the subject was taken into custody.'' </P>
<P> The report said the 29-year-old man had been observed by a local police officer pacing back and forth along a road just before Clinton's motorcade passed on its way to the Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton airport in eastern Pennsylvania. </P>
<P> The officer then saw what appeared to be a holster underneath the man's jacket. Other police helped wrestle the man to the ground and took a 9-mm semi-automatic pistol from him. Police said later he had a license for the weapon. </P>
<P> Clinton had been visiting rural Kutztown, some 20 miles west of Allentown to promote the legislative program outlined in his State of the Union speech Tuesday evening. </P>
<P> ``The subject has been committed to the Allentown State Hospital for psychiatric evaluation,'' the report said. An investigation was continuing and a decision on whether to file charges would be made after consulting with the Lehigh County District Attorney. </P>
