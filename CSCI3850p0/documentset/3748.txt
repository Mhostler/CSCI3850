<P>  Oprah Winfrey, host of the most-watched daytime U.S. television talk show, admitted during a program to be aired Friday that she had smoked cocaine in her early twenties, the Washington Post reported. </P>
<P> The paper in its Friday edition said Winfrey, who turns 41 this month, broke down Wednesday while taping a program about recovering from drug abuse and admitted that she had also used drugs. </P>
<P> The program, taped in Chicago, dealt with the subject of women who have had drug problems. Four mothers were the guests, including Patrice Gaines, a Washington Post reporter who has written a book about her own troubled life. </P>
<P> Winfrey's show, which has been nationally syndicated since 1986, is characterized by a personal tone. For instance, Winfrey revealed on the show that she had been raped at age 9 by a cousin, and then molested by others close to the family until she was 14. </P>
<P> Deborah Johns, a spokeswoman for the show, said that on the program taped Wednesday, ``Oprah made a spontaneous admission to mothers battling drug addiction that she had also used drugs.'' </P>
<P> Winfrey's admission came after a discussion with one woman, identified only as Charmaine, who said she currently smokes crack cocaine, but isn't sure whether she is an addict because she is still functioning in her daily life, the paper said. </P>
<P> According to Gaines and another guest, Kim Davis, Winfrey started to cry and told Charmaine she could understand her situation, adding: ``I did your drug.'' She said her drug abuse had occurred during a relationship with a man. </P>
<P> The Post said Winfrey did not mention the drug by name, but quoted Johns as saying the talk show host had ``smoked cocaine 20 years ago.'' </P>
<P> Forbes magazine has rated Winfrey as the highest-paid entertainer in America. She owns her own production company, her own studio and the rights to her show. </P>
