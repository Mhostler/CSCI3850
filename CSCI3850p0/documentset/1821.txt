<P>  Three-point shots will be easier next year in the National Basketball Association and the Toronto Raptors will be hoisting their jumpers as members of the Central Division, the league announced Wednesday. </P>
<P> The three-point line was shortened by almost two feet from the top of the key to make it a uniform 22 feet from the basket. It had extended from 22 feet in the corners to 23 feet, nine inches directly in front of the hoop. </P>
<P> ``The closer three-point line will eliminate some of the congestion in the lane, and lead to more scoring opportunities,'' NBA vice president Rod Thorn said. </P>
<P> ``We think this will add to our game because the three-point shot is one of the most exciting plays in basketball.'' </P>
<P> Other rules changes enacted by vote of the NBA Board of Governors included awarding three foul shots for any player fouled while attempting a three-pointer, and a stiffening of penalties designed to eliminate bench-clearing incidents. </P>
<P> Any player who leaves the bench during a fight will be automatically suspended for at least one game and fined a maximum of $20,000 in addition to losing a pro-rated portion of his salary for each game he is suspended. </P>
<P> ``We were appalled by a couple of ugly incidents during the playoffs,'' said Thorn. ``We understand that emotions run high, but we will not tolerate brawls.'' </P>
<P> There will also be stricter enforcement of rules against taunting, and hand-checking will be eliminated from the end line in the backcourt to the opposite foul line. </P>
<P> The Raptors, who begin competition in the 1995-96 season, will join the Atlanta Hawks, Chicago Bulls, Cleveland Cavaliers, Indiana Pacers, Charlotte Hornets, Detroit Pistons and Milwaukee Bucks in the Central. </P>
<P> The expansion Vancouver Grizzlies, who come into the league along with the Raptors, had already been assigned to the Midwest Division. </P>
