<P>  Five children reported missing after disappearing from a movie theater Saturday night were found unharmed Tuesday in an abandoned apartment near their Houston neighborhood, Houston police said. </P>
<P> The children, who included four teen-agers and a four-year-old girl, were reported missing this week after the mother of one child went to pick up the children at the theater in west Houston, but could not find them. </P>
<P> Houston police said four of the children were found Tuesday afternoon by a police investigator who was driving down a street and recognized the children. </P>
<P> They then led the investigator to the apartment, where he found the fifth youth. </P>
<P> ``He was driving down the street and saw some of the children walking down a street and stopped them,'' said police spokesman Robert Hurst about the officer who found them. </P>
<P> ``It just appears they were staying in this apartment since Saturday. There is no foul play,'' he said. </P>
<P> The children were taken to a juvenile detention center, but police said they had not yet decided whether to press charges against the older children. </P>
<P> The children, who are all Hispanic, included two 12-year-old girls, a 14-year-old boy and a 15-year-old boy, police said. </P>
<P> Family members said none of the children had ever run away from home in the past and feared they were abducted since one of the children was so young. </P>
<P> One mother, speaking on a local Spanish radio station that was translated into English, had pleaded Tuesday for her child and the others to return home if they were unharmed. </P>
<P> The five children went to the theater, located about one mile from the apartment complex where they all lived, at about 1:30 p.m. CDT Saturday. </P>
<P> One called her mother at about 5:30 p.m. and was given permission to stay for another movie. </P>
<P> The mother then went to the theater at about 6:30 p.m. but could not find the children. </P>
<P> A maintenance worker from the apartment complex said he saw two of the children walking across a nearby street at about 9:30 p.m. , but the children did not return home, according to Houston Police. </P>
