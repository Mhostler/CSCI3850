<P>  A law student accused in a shooting rampage that left two people dead in this college town had a history of mental problems and once claimed to be telepathic, according to family members and acquaintances. </P>
<P> Wendell Justin Williamson, 26, was under guard and in good condition Friday at University of North Carolina Hospital after surgery on his legs, a hospital spokeswoman said. </P>
<P> He was formally arrested and charged Friday with two counts of first-degree murder, and assault charges were pending, police said. </P>
<P> On Thursday, Williamson parked his father's car at an apartment complex and walked toward the center of town carrying a rifle and dozens of clips of .30-caliber ammunition in a green military-style knapsack. </P>
<P> He gunned down one man on his front porch, and a college student who was riding on his bicycle. </P>
<P> A police officer was wounded and Williamson was shot in both legs during an exchange of gunfire with police. A Gulf War veteran who tackled the gunman also was shot. </P>
<P> Williamson, a top student and former National Merit Scholar, had been hospitalized at one time for psychiatric treatment, and had been seeing a psychiatrist at the university, his mother said after the shootings. </P>
<P> His mental problems became apparent during his first year at law school, where he was prone to delusions and outbursts of anger, said his classmates. </P>
<P> ``He wasn't the normal kind of law school guy. He definitely had something strange about him,'' law student James Coblin told the Daily Tar Heel, the college newspaper. </P>
<P> Police had to restrain Williamson during an incident in a parking lot during his first year, and last spring he stood up in class and announced he was exempt from an assignment because he was telepathic and already knew the answer, classmates said. </P>
<P> A law school faculty member said Williamson had recently been taking medication for his mental problems which had ''worked wonders on him.'' </P>
<P> When he returned to Chapel Hill Jan. 12 after a visit with his parents, Williamson stopped returning their phone calls, his mother, Sonda Williamson, told the Raleigh News & Observer. </P>
<P> ``I left messages on his machine and called the law school,'' said his mother. ``It's uncharacteristic of him not to return my calls.'' </P>
<P> University law professor Daniel Pollitt said students and faculty were shocked and saddened by the rampage. </P>
<P> Pollitt said it was unusual that a student would break under pressure in his final semester. Traditionally, the first year of law school is the hardest, and the third the easiest. </P>
<P> Pollitt speculated that Williamson could have been feeling pressure about finding a job when he passed the bar. </P>
<P> ``Some people are trying to decide which job to take, but other people don't have any interviews,'' he said. ``People who've been honor students since the first grade feel they've worked hard and done well and that they deserve better. They get angry.'' </P>
<P> District Attorney Carl Fox said Williamson would not be arraigned until Monday at the earliest because of his wounds. </P>
