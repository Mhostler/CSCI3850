<P>  The quiet resort town of Dunedin, Fla., has been approved to host home games for the Toronto Blue Jays if the Major League Baseball players' strike continues, American League President Gene Budig said Friday. </P>
<P> Dunedin Stadium, the longtime spring training home of the Blue Jays, seats only 6,218. </P>
<P> Barring a contract settlement, the Blue Jays are expected to open their season with replacement players in Dunedin April 3 against the Seattle Mariners. </P>
<P> The Blue Jays had applied to the American League for permission to play in Dunedin rather than challenge Ontario provisional law, which prohibits the use of replacement players in games at 50,516-seat SkyDome in Toronto. </P>
