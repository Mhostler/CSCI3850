<P>  North Korea said Monday that any plan to supply it with South Korean-style reactors could jeopardize its nuclear deal with the United States. </P>
<P> According to the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp., a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman quoted ``foreign news reports'' saying the United States, South Korea and Japan had agreed to supply the North with southern-style reactors. </P>
<P> ``If this is true, the agreement is obviously underlaid with a sinister political purpose of some forces including the South Korean authorities who dislike the (North Korean)-U.S. framework agreement and try to obstruct its implementation at any cost,'' KCNA quoted the spokesman as saying. </P>
<P> He said the United States understood North Korea's objection to South Korean reactors during the negotiations leading to an agreement last fall. </P>
<P> The United States, South Korea and Japan are leading a consortium to provide North Korea with light-water nuclear reactors to replace current graphite-moderated facilities under an agreement reached between Pyongyang and Washington in Geneva in October. </P>
<P> The United States, Japan and South Korea met last week in Washington to discuss the consortium, the Korean Energy Development Organization, but left several issues unresolved for another meeting in Tokyo. </P>
<P> Among these, the South Korean news agency Yonhap said in a dispatch from Seoul over the weekend, would be the specifications -- southern-style or otherwise -- for the two reactors to be supplied to the North, according to the BBC. </P>
<P> Implementation of the agreement would lead to North Korea freezing its current nuclear program. The United States and its allies suspect this is aimed at weapons development, although the North insists it has only benign intentions. </P>
<P> The replacement of the graphite reactors would eliminate one international worry about Pyongyang's program -- the proposed light-water reactors do not produce plutonium, a key ingredient of nuclear bombs. </P>
<P> South Korean officials have argued the case for supplying Pyongyang with reactors compatible with those in the South. Since both governments seek Korean reunification, they say, using similar power generation systems would speed economic integration. </P>
