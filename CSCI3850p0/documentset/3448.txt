<P>  Support for Australia casting off its constitutional ties with the British monarchy and becoming a republic has grown strongly in the past three months, according to a poll published Tuesday. </P>
<P> The latest Newspoll published in The Australian newspaper shows 47 percent of those polled supported an Australian president replacing Britain's Queen Elizabeth as head of state. It was the highest proportion in favor recorded in the paper's polling on the topic. </P>
<P> This was up from 42 percent in favor of the republic being promoted by Australia's Labor Party Prime Minister Paul Keating in the previous Newspoll conducted in September, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> The previous highest support for republicanism in Newspoll was 46 percent in two polls last year. </P>
<P> The poll showed 37 percent of those polled were opposed to the concept and 16 percent were undecided. </P>
<P> The paper said the latest poll showed support for Australia becoming a republic had climbed from just 21 percent in the first Newspoll on the subject in October 1987. </P>
<P> The poll showed a significant split between men's and women's attitudes to the republic. A clear majority of men, 53 percent, were pro-republic but only 41 percent of women were. </P>
<P> Keating wants Australia to become a republic by 2000 but the proposal has to pass the hurdle of a national referendum to change the constitution. </P>
<P> Since Australia became independent of Britain in 1901, most referenda have failed because Australian voters are skeptical of any proposal that they see as giving more power to politicians. </P>
<P> The Australia-wide telephone phone poll of 1,200 people was conducted on Dec. 17 and 18. </P>
