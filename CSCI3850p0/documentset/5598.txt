<P>  Peru's National Elections Board said Sunday's elections would go ahead despite a vote-rigging bid in a northeastern provincial city but opposition candidates said the fairness of the process could not be guaranteed. </P>
<P> As the vote-fraud allegations captured public attention, thousands of troops were deployed around the country to prevent a feared disruption of the vote by Maoist Shining Path rebels. </P>
<P> ``The elections are going ahead,'' board Ricardo Nugent told a press conference late Saturday. ``This is an isolated act which has not been repeated in any other provincial board.'' </P>
<P> The board said 15 people, including electoral officials, were detained and charged in an attempt in the city of Huanuco to tamper with more than 3,000 tally sheets in favor of candidates of President Alberto Fujimori's party and five opposing groups. </P>
<P> Four others were being sought in the crime, it added. </P>
<P> The Organization of American States, which had expressed ''serious concern'' over the alleged vote-rigging, said the 70- member observer team would watch the vote in Huanuco closely Sunday and called on the government to finish the probe. </P>
<P> Six of 13 opposition presidential candidates including Fujimori's chief opponent Javier Perez de Cuellar handed a statement to the OAS mission, saying the vote-rigging incident showed ``there was an organized fraud underway to favor Fujimori's reelection.'' </P>
<P> It said the ``principal benificiary'' of the scheme was Fujimori, since votes tabulated on the tampered sheets showed him with ``three times more than any other candidate.'' </P>
<P> The incident showed a ``grave illegality'' which invalidated the process, adding it would be impossible for the OAS mission to guarantee the fairness of the vote. </P>
<P> The board said tampering with 370 tally sheets took place in the home of Enrique Espinoza, identified as campaign coordinator of Fujimori's New Majority-Change 90 party, in Huanuco, some 150 miles northeast of Lima. </P>
<P> An aide to a congressman of Fujimori's party was involved in obtaining tally sheets from electoral officials as well as a candidate for the opposition Popular Christian Party, it said. </P>
<P> Attorney General Blanca Colan said those involved ``agreed to give the preferential vote (to congressional candidates) and, so no one suspected irregularities, the presidential vote to candidate Alberto Fujimori.'' </P>
<P> But six other presidential candidates also would have benefitted in addition to Fujimori, the board said. </P>
<P> Opposition parties claim Fujimori has had an unfair advantage in the contest, saying he used his office to further his reelection bid and that local officials campaigned for him. </P>
<P> Fujimori, the 56-year-old son of Japanese immigrants, who became eligible for re-election as a result of his ''self-imposed coup'' in 1992 when he closed Congress and declared emergency rule, is the favorite in Sunday's elections. </P>
<P> He has maintained a high level of popular support during his five-year rule by slashing inflation, stabilizing the economy and virtually wiping out the Shining Path guerrilla movement. </P>
<P> But guerrillas were active in some areas in the runup to the vote. On Friday, guerrillas entered three towns in the Huallaga Valley and warned villagers not to vote, police sources said. Guerrillas also painted slogans in a poor Lima district urging residents to abstain from voting. </P>
