<DATELINE>GUATEMALA CITY (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A U.S. woman on the second week of a hunger strike in Guatemala City's main square said Monday she would fast until the army reveals the whereabouts of her leftist guerrilla husband. </P>
<P> ``It's all in the hands of the Guatemalan army,'' said 43-year-old Jennifer Harbury, who described herself as ``weak and tired.'' </P>
<P> Harbury said the army seized her husband, Efrain Bamaca Velasquez, a top guerrilla leader, after clashes between government troops and rebels in March 1992 and has since held him in a secret military prison. </P>
<P> The Harvard law school graduate told Reuters she would name three Guatemalan military officers trained at the School of the Americas in Fort Benning, Georgia, who tortured her husband after his capture if the army fails to release him. </P>
<P> Harbury is becoming an increasing embarrassment to the army, which insists that Bamaca committed suicide to avoid capture after the battle two years ago. </P>
<P> ``She is suffering in vain,'' Defense Minister Mario Enriquez said in a recent interview. </P>
<P> But a rebel from Bamaca's column who escaped from a military base in late 1992 told the New Hampshire woman he had seen her husband there several times. </P>
<P> According to Harbury, peasants in the western province of San Marcos saw Bamaca alive earlier this year. </P>
<P> ``Some people have visions,'' Enriquez responded. </P>
<P> Bamaca, whose nom de guerre is Comandante Everado, has 17 years fighting experience in the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unit (URNG) and is its only indigenous commander. </P>
<P> Harbury believes he is a valuable asset to military intelligence, which she says is keeping him for information. </P>
<P> The couple met in 1990 when Harbury was interviewing women guerrillas in a camp on the Tajumulco volcano in western Guatemala. They married a year later in Austin, Texas. </P>
<P> Guatemala has a long history of human rights abuses. More than 100,000 people have died and human rights groups say a further 40,000 have ``disappeared'' during three decades of war. </P>
<P> Although the two warring sides signed a major human rights accord in March, violence in Guatemala has since escalated. Tortured bodies regularly turn up on the streets of the capital and repression against peasant and trade union leaders has increased. </P>
