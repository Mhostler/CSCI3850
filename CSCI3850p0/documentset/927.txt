<P>  Colombia's second largest Marxist guerrilla group is expected to send a letter to President Ernesto Samper this week welcoming his offer to renew peace talks, a television news program reported Sunday. </P>
<P> NTC Noticias said it had learned that the National Liberation Army (ELN) would send a letter to Samper next Tuesday, less than a week after the country's largest guerrilla group did the same. </P>
<P> But the program said the ELN wanted to reach a consensus with the country's other guerrilla groups over the issues to be discussed before beginning talks with the government. </P>
<P> The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) sent a letter to Samper last Thursday, expressing its willingness to negotiate peace after 28 years of armed struggle. </P>
<P> But when members of the ELN later killed 18 people in an ambush on a bus in Choco province, the government demanded they halt their attacks to prove how serious they were in negotiating peace. </P>
<P> Samper took office in early August vowing to improve public welfare, strengthen social justice and renew talks with the guerrillas. </P>
<P> The country's three main guerrilla groups, which together have some 10,000 members, have cost the country thousands of lives and millions of dollars in their clashes with army and police, bombings of infrastructure and raids on small towns and villages. </P>
<P> The previous government broke off negotiations in 1992 when the guerrillas refused to suspend their violent campaign. </P>
