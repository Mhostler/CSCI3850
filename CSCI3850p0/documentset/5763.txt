<P>  Russian President Boris Yeltsin said on Saturday he would be prepared to sign a much delayed treaty with Ukraine only after Kiev solved its dispute with its autonomous region of Crimea, dominated by ethnic Russians. </P>
<P> ``It will be correct to sign major political documents between Russia and Ukraine only after we are convinced that the relations between Simferopol and Kiev do not infringe the interests of the Crimeans,'' Yeltsin told Itar-Tass news agency. </P>
<P> ``Russians form the majority of the population in the Republic of Crimea, which is part of Ukraine. Russia has considerable interests in Crimea,'' Yeltsin said. </P>
<P> ``That is why we are not indifferent to the fate of Crimea. The president and the government want the problems in relations between the authorities in Simferopol and Kiev to be settled through political dialogue, without pressure and with respect for the will of the Crimeans.'' </P>
<P> Ukraine, trying to quell pro-Russian separatist sentiment in Crimea, has outlawed its constitution and the post of regional president. It also made the government of the Black Sea peninsula directly responsible to Kiev. </P>
<P> Russian officials have previously said the problem is an internal Ukrainian affair, but nationalists within and outside parliament have been pressing Yeltsin to step in to help Crimea. </P>
