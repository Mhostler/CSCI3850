<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Key members of Congress proposed Thursday to tighten U.S. sanctions against Cuba by taking aim at foreigners doing business with the Fidel Castro government. </P>
<P> If passed, the legislation would include barring any U.S. government or private business dealings with any foreigner who purchases U.S. property confiscated by the Cuban government. </P>
<P> ``It's time to tighten the screws, not loosen them,'' Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said as he introduced a new sanctions bill and rejected arguments that easing sanctions might hasten the end of communist rule in Cuba. </P>
<P> Helms appeared at a news conference with other sponsors of the bill, including House International Relations Committee chairman Ben Gilman, R-N.C., and Rep Robert Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat whose own bill tightening sanctions on Cuba became law in 1992. </P>
<P> They pledged to give the bill priority and predicted it would be enacted by Congress and signed by President Clinton. </P>
<P> The Cuban Foreign Ministry reacted coolly to the new sanctions proposal, saying it was hard to add much to the existing U.S. economic embargo against the Caribbean island. </P>
<P> Asked about the move at a weekly press briefing in Havana, Foreign Ministry spokesman Luis Delfin said that ``really the blockade is hard to toughen''. </P>
<P> Delfin said the aim appeared to be to internationalize the 33-year-old embargo, which would be difficult given widespread disapproval of the U.S. sanctions by other nations. </P>
<P> The new bill was the first foreign affairs measure to be introduced by Helms, a longtime Castro foe, since he took over the Foreign Relations Committee following Republican capture of the Senate in last November's elections. </P>
<P> The measure requires the president to bar loans, credits or financing by ``any U.S. person or agency'' to foreigners who buy U.S. property confiscated by the Cuban government. </P>
<P> The aim is to thwart Cuban efforts to raise foreign capital by selling property. </P>
<P> The bill would ban importation of sugar, syrups and molasses from countries that have imported Cuba sugar. </P>
<P> The ban would be lifted if the country agreed not to import Cuban sugar until free and fair elections were held in Cuba. Countries thus sanctioned would have their U.S. sugar quotas reallocated to other producers. </P>
<P> Under the bill, U.S. directors of international financial institutions, such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, would be instructed to vote against Cuba's admission and if an institution approved a loan to Cuba the U.S. contribution would be reduced by the same amount. </P>
<P> Cuba is not a member of the World Bank or IMF but Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., said Spain was seeking to pave the way for its admission. </P>
<P> The bill also required the president to withhold aid to any former Soviet state by the amount of its aid to military and intelligence facilities in Cuba, and required upgrading of Television Marti, which broadcasts to Cuba. </P>
<P> Torricelli said the bill effectively elimimated any chance of Cuba replacing American investment with funds from other countries. He predicted Castro would not last out the decade. </P>
<P> ``Whether Castro leaves Cuba in a vertical or horizontal position is up to him and the Cuban people,'' Helms said. ``But he must, and will, leave Cuba.'' </P>
