<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Treasury Secretary nominee Robert Rubin won swift confirmation from the Senate Finance Committee Tuesday only minutes after the panel's members had begun to question the former Wall Street executive. </P>
<P> At the urging of the panel's chairman, Senator Bob Packwood, an Oregon Republican, Rubin was confirmed in a unanimous voice vote by the committee after members of both parties praised him strongly. </P>
<P> ``The president has chosen wisely,'' said Senator Alfonse D'Amato, a New York Republican who introduced Rubin to the panel. Rubin is expected to win approval from the full Senate. </P>
<P> Rubin, 56, who has spent the last two years as head of President Bill Clinton's National Economic Council, will continue to field questions from lawmakers as part of his confirmation hearing before the Finance Committee. </P>
<P> He was tapped by Clinton after former Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen announced last month his plans to retire. </P>
<P> In his opening statement, Rubin offered to work with the new Republican-controlled Congress in shaping economic policy. But he set out clear markers on what he thought that should entail. </P>
<P> In prepared testimony, Rubin defended the administration's economic record in its first two years in office but acknowledged that more needs to be done. </P>
<P> ``Much remains to be done at this critical juncture if our country is to prosper,'' he said. ``It is crucial that the administration and Congress work together effectively.''  He sounded a conciliatory note to Republicans. ``I am pragmatic, and I believe that differences can usually be resolved, not always but usually,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``I also believe that there are no easy answers to the significant issues of economic policy and that difficult trade-offs are almost always involved.'' </P>
<P> Rubin suggested four principles to guide economic policy: maintaining fiscal discipline, promoting productivity, supporting international cooperation and modernizing financial markets. </P>
<P> ``Tax cuts or spending programs must be paid for, and we must sustain our efforts to continue reducing the deficit,'' Rubin said. </P>
<P> But he also backed a reordering of the budget to emphasize education, training and what he called other ``essential'' public investments. </P>
<P> Like Bentsen, Rubin is a moderate Democrat with strong ties to the business community. He is not expected to chart radical new policy directions as Treasury chief. </P>
<P> Rubin echoed Bentsen's call for changes in the way banks are regulated and hinted that he would press efforts to trim the number of regulators. </P>
<P> ``We can make American financial markets more competitive and more efficient through modernizing regulatory structure and regulations,'' he told lawmakers. ``But the issues are very complex and competing considerations must be weighed carefully.''  ``We need to sensibly but effectively regulate the vast global financial markets,'' Rubin added. </P>
