<P>  Algeria Thursday called on Israel to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and submit its nuclear installations to global inspections. </P>
<P> Foreign Mininster Mohamed Salah Dembri, speaking to the United Nations-supported Conference on Disarmament, also urged the Jewish state to back a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East. </P>
<P> He noted Algeria last month had deposited its instrument of adhesion to the 1970 NPT, which aims to halt the spread of nuclear weapons to countries that do not already possess them. </P>
<P> ``The effectiveness of the non-proliferation regime depends on its universality,'' Dembri told the 38-member conference, which opened its 1995 session in Geneva last week. </P>
<P> Referring to South Africa's putting an end to its nuclear program, he added: ``It is high time that Israel makes the same gesture to speed up creation of a zone exempt from nuclear arms in the Middle East.'' </P>
<P> Dembri said Arab states had already contributed to the nuclear non-proliferation regime in adhering to the treaty and working to promote a Middle East free of nuclear arms. </P>
<P> ``Arab states expect from Israel an equivalent commitment via adhesion to the NPT and submitting all of its nuclear installations to the safeguard regime of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),'' Dembri said. </P>
<P> The NPT pact, which has 171 member states, expires this year and is up for renewal at a major international conference opening in New York in April. </P>
<P> Algeria's appeal follows a meeting in Cairo Monday at which eight Arab states took a united stand against international tolerance of Israel's refusal to sign the NPT. They were: Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. </P>
<P> Israel argues that it faces a potential nuclear threat from countries such as Iran, Iraq and Libya. </P>
<P> Egypt, accepting reports that Israel has about 200 nuclear warheads, has indicated it may not renew its NPT adherence if Israel does not commit itself in principle to accept the treaty. </P>
