<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick agreed Wednesday that a top FBI official should be disciplined over the 1992 Idaho siege where a bureau agent killed the wife of white separatist Randy Weaver. </P>
<P> In her review of the incident, Gorelick also sharply criticized the U.S. Attorney's Office in Idaho for engaging in ''misconduct'' before the grand jury that was investigating Weaver. She did not elaborate. </P>
<P> She also was critical of the role the U.S. marshals played in the affair saying they had adopted an ``unduly risky course of conduct.'' The fatal shooting followed marshals' efforts to arrest Weaver and an associate for failing to appear on a weapons charge. </P>
<P> Weaver's wife, Vicki, was shot and killed by an FBI agent Aug. 22, 1992, as she stood in the doorway of the couple's isolated mountain cabin, holding their 10-month-old daughter. The agent was aiming for an associate of Weaver's. </P>
<P> Earlier in the 11-day standoff, the couple's 13-year-old son was shot to death by deputy U.S. marshals in a firefight that also claimed the life of Marshal William Degan. </P>
<P> Gorelick said in a statement she accepted FBI chief Louis Freeh's recommendation for a letter of censure for Larry Potts, who has been acting in the number two FBI job. </P>
<P> Potts, an assistant FBI director in 1992, has been blamed for failing to provide proper oversight during the siege. </P>
<P> Gorelick said she concluded that Potts did not adequately follow through to make sure his intent was being carried out on the rules of when to shoot. </P>
<P> She also said he should have acted more aggressively to provide FBI support for the U.S. Attorney's Office at Weaver's trial. </P>
<P> Although Gorelick criticized Potts for ``management omissions,'' she expressed no opinion on plans by Freeh to make Potts' appointment to the deputy job permanent. </P>
<P> Weaver and an associate were brought to trial in 1993 and acquitted on the most serious charge against them related to the killing of the marshal. </P>
<P> The Justice Department conducted a lengthy investigation into the affair, but a local Idaho prosecutor asked last month that the release of findings be delayed until he decides whether to bring criminal charges against federal officials. </P>
<P> Gorelick criticized the U.S. Attorney's Office for drafting ``an inappropriately broad and aggressive indictment'' against Weaver. </P>
<P> She also said federal prosecutors in Idaho should not have rejected a plan by the Marshals Service to negotiate surrender terms with Weaver. </P>
