<DATELINE>ANKARA (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Turkish riot police broke up a rally in the capital Ankara Tuesday, freely using batons, water cannon and dogs to beat back crowds enraged after Istanbul riots in which at least 15 people died. </P>
<P> Armored cars chased demonstrators down Ankara's Ataturk Boulevard to Kizilay square, sending protesters including many women fleeing down side streets. </P>
<P> The Ankara incidents followed two days of rioting in a district of Istanbul inhabited by members of the minority Alawite Moslem community, who oppose a recent upsurge in religious fundamentalism. </P>
<P> The Gazi neighborhood erupted in riots Sunday night after an attack by gunmen on Alawite coffeehouses, killing one patron. The gunmen killed the driver of the taxi they seized for the raid. </P>
<P> The Ankara rally was called to protest the attack as well as the death and destruction that followed. </P>
<P> Clashes broke out when police stopped protesters from marching on the parliament building. The demonstrators, armed with sticks and rocks, tried to storm the police barricade. </P>
<P> In the fighting that ensued the injured, many with head wounds, tried to escape from the melee or sat helplessly on the sidewalk. </P>
<P> Ankara gov. Erdogan Sahinoglu told Anatolian news agency that 17 policemen and 13 protesters were injured, while 20 people were detained. </P>
<P> The rally was called by Democracy Platform, a liberal grouping of human rights associations, professional groups and trade unionists to protest the Istanbul unrest. </P>
<P> In Istanbul Tuesday, hundreds of paramilitary police stood guard in the battered Gazi district. </P>
<P> About 100 yards away stood several hundred stubborn Alawites, who refused to abandon the streets around their prayerhouse despite a curfew imposed Monday. </P>
<P> Protesters said at least 10 people were killed Monday and 200 wounded after police opened fire on the thousands of people who marched through the main streets, chanting ``Death to Fascism,'' ``Police are murderers.'' </P>
<P> The exact death toll in Istanbul remained uncertain but Prime Minister Tansu Ciller said at least 15 people had died. </P>
<P> Alawites complain of discrimination by Turkey's majority Sunni Muslim population. </P>
