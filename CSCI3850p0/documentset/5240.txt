<P>  Quebec Premier Jacques Parizeau has admitted for the first time what opinion polls have been telling him for months -- any referendum vote held soon on Quebec's secession from Canada would be defeated. </P>
<P> ``Quebeckers are not ready now to vote in favor of sovereignty. We are not certain that we would get a majority now,'' Parizeau told reporters after a speech near Montreal Sunday to the youth wing of his Parti Quebecois. </P>
<P> Parizeau's comments in Ste. Hyacinthe, Quebec, carried by Canadian Press news agency, were the first hint that a referendum on Quebec sovereignty expected to be held in the province in late June could be delayed until later this year. </P>
<P> On the specific timing of the promised referendum, however, Parizeau said only that it would be held sometime in 1995. </P>
<P> Political analysts say Parizeau's apparent reluctance to hold the referendum sooner rather than later is unsurprising. Public opinion polls conducted over the last three months have shown that Quebeckers' support for separation is stalled at 40 percent to 45 percent, far short of the 54 percent or more most observers say would be needed to begin the sovereignty process. </P>
<P> ``Parizeau is taking stock of something that is right in front of his eyes and that he did not want to acknowledge,'' said Daniel Salee, a political scientist at Concordia University in Montreal. </P>
<P> When elected to power last September, the Parti Quebecois promised that it would hold the referendum in 1995. Hoping to build on the momentum of its election victory and recently concluded public hearings on the separation issue, the government was expected to hold the referendum this spring. </P>
<P> In the face of poll results showing minority support for separation, however, Quebec separatists have become less eager to hold the vote soon. The public hearings, which were boycotted by the province's opposition Liberal Party, also failed to produce a groundswell of public support for separation that the government was seeking. </P>
<P> Further public hearings on Quebec separation are under way, and the provincial government still has several weeks to make a final decision about setting a June referendum date. </P>
