<DATELINE>DUBAI, April 3 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Despite a Saudi Arabian freeze on new arms deals while it tackles cash-flow problems, a Canadian frigate will undergo trials in the kingdom this month and France is sending tanks for tests, industry sources said on Monday. </P>
<P> An Arab source close to Saudi thinking said the freeze was part of a serious Saudi government effort to further reduce a punishing budget deficit. </P>
<P> ``The policy is not to embark on any new purchases unless old commitments are met first and the money for new deals is readily available,'' he said. </P>
<P> But Western experts said a Canadian anti-submarine frigate, shown last month at an Abu Dhabi arms bazaar, was due in the Red Sea port of Jeddah. </P>
<P> Officials from Canada's Saint John Shipbuilding, which makes the frigate, were due to hold talks with Saudi officials in Jeddah about a possible sale, they added. </P>
<P> ``I think Saudi Arabia could be interested in one or two frigates despite the French deal,'' said a Western expert, referring to the Saudi decision in November to take up an option to buy two French frigates worth $3.6 billion. </P>
<P> Before a drop in oil prices that forced the latest belt-tightening, Saudi Arabia had held talks with Saint John in 1993 for the possible purchase of three to four frigates. </P>
<P> The kingdom, the world's largest oil exporter, and its Gulf allies are boosting anti-submarine defences after non-Arab Iran became the first regional state to deploy submarines. </P>
<P> Arab military experts said although Saudi Arabia was interested in testing new weapons, it was unlikely to place fresh orders soon. </P>
<P> ``You have deals in the pipeline with the U.S. worth about $25 billion and another $2 billion a year with Britain, so practically it will take several years to absorb this equipment before looking to buy new,'' one said. </P>
<P> The orders from the United States include 315 Abrams tanks. </P>
<P> A French industry executive said despite Saudi Arabia's reluctance to embark on a fresh arms shopping spree, Giat Industries would send two Leclerc tanks for trials in the forbidding August summer heat. </P>
<P> ``We still believe that it is in Saudi Arabia's interest to mix its tank force and purchase up to 150 Leclercs to meet its needs,'' he added. </P>
<P> Riyadh exercised an option to buy 150 more Abrams in 1992 for fear the U.S. production line could close. The deal was deferred when Kuwait ordered 256 Abrams. </P>
<P> An Arab military expert earlier said: ``I believe Saudi Arabia is fully committed to the M1A2 (Abram) programme ... It is unlikely it would order the French Leclerc.'' </P>
