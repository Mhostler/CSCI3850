<P>  Archeologists have found the tombs of two Egyptians who died about 2300 BC, director of excavations Ali Hassan said Thursday. </P>
<P> Both tombs, in the Saqqara necropolis about 12 miles south of Cairo, are in good condition, with paint still visible on the hieroglyphic inscriptions and on a mural showing people bearing offerings, he said. </P>
<P> ``They're the first for at least 10 years at Saqqara to contain such an amount of objects, and some of them could be museum pieces,'' he told Reuters. </P>
<P> Saqqara was the burial ground for the pharaohs who ruled at nearby Memphis, by legend the first capital of united Egypt. It has the first pyramid, the Step Pyramid of Zozer. </P>
<P> The tombs, including the debris which covered them from later centuries, contained wooden statues, several sarcophagi, well-preserved baskets with alabaster cosmetic jars and parts of what is probably a palanquin from about 1400 BC. </P>
<P> One of them belonged to Ka Aper, who described himself as ``the one well-known to the Pharaoh, the hereditary prince, the head of the archives of the Pharaoh and the head of all works in the vicinity of the Pharaoh Teti's pyramid.'' </P>
<P> ``He was a sixth dynasty priest but his name is completely new to us. We didn't know he existed. We've added a new very distinguished person to the history books,'' Hassan said. </P>
<P> The other tomb belonged to a priestess and is a very rare example of an Old Kingdom tomb built solely for a woman. At that time dead women were usually depicted only on the walls of their husbands' tombs, he added. </P>
<P> ``Her name was Najad Pet, the gift of the gods, and she was the priestess of the goddess Hathor, of the goddess Neith of the Delta and of the god Wepwawet, the jackal who opens the way for the dead,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``We found chambers of mud brick covered with plaster and painted with very fine scenes of offering bearers with beautiful garlands. The color is still there,'' he added. </P>
<P> Hassan said the tombs had been robbed in ancient times but there was still a chance they would find the sarcophagus of Ka Aper intact at a lower level. </P>
