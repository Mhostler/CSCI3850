<P>  Rio's Carnival kicked off Thursday when Rei Momo, the Fat King who presides over the five days of festivities, was given a key to the city. </P>
<P> ``From now on it's all about having fun,'' said the 572-pound Reynaldo de Carvalho, best known as O Bola, or The Ball, after receiving the huge, spangled key from mayor Cesar Maia. </P>
<P> ``Rei Momo is in charge and only happiness rules,'' Maia said beneath a sweltering tropical sun on the steps of an elegant palace which was once the British Embassy. </P>
<P> Organizers claim this year's Carnival will be the biggest and most lucrative ever. The city's 22,000 hotel rooms are all booked and only a handful of the 140,000 tickets to see the two nights of parades which begin Sunday remain unsold. </P>
<P> Advertising revenues at the parades alone are reported to total $2.5 million. </P>
<P> Even Bola is in on the act with a range of t-shirts that feature his outsize frame. ``People kept asking me for a souvenir so I found a way of giving something to everyone,'' he said. </P>
