<DATELINE>LIMA, (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori came under mortar fire Friday as he trekked back from a jungle conflict zone with Ecuador, but no one in his group was injured, press reports said. </P>
<P> Fujimori, accompanied by soldiers, security personnel and reporters was hiking down a muddy trail when three mortor rounds banged down, one just 50 yards from the group, local television and radio reports said. </P>
<P> The president's group was walking back from a two-day journey to the Cueva de los Tayos outpost a few miles from the Peru-Ecuador border when the barrage came, according to press reports. </P>
<P> ``There are no personal tragedies to report. The president, in great spirits, decided to continue the march,'' said reporter Guido Lombardi of Radioprogramas del Peru. </P>
<P> Reports of the attack could not be independently confirmed. Fujimori made no statements to the press afterward. </P>
<P> Meanwhile, an advance team of international observers in the afternoon returned from PV-1, Peru's command post near the disputed border area, to the northern coastal city of Piura. </P>
<P> But the head of the delegation, Brazilian Gen. Ariel Pereira da Fonseca, told a press conference only that the mission's members had been impressed the ruggedness of the terrain and high spirits of Peru's troops. </P>
<P> The observers, who on Thursday visited a post on the Ecuadoran side in the month-old conflict, was slated to leave Peru for Brazil early Saturday. </P>
<P> Fujimori was two hours from PV-1 when the mortor attack came, according to reports. The three shells landed within 100 yards of Fujimori, according to the reports. Several reporters were shaken by the attack, Lombardi said. </P>
<P> Earlier on Friday, Peru's military accused Ecuador of violating a cease-fire agreed to last week by bombing and firing artillery at Peruvian positions at Cueva de los Tayos, Base Sur and Tiwinza in the remote patch of Amazon jungle over the last three days. </P>
<P> In a statement, the Peruvian armed forces charged Ecuadorean troops had bombarded the area ``despite knowing that the president of the Republic ... was in the area.'' </P>
<P> In Quito, the capital of Ecuador, a military source contacted by Reuters denied the charge, saying ``the anti-personnel or the anti-tank mines we use are not forbidden by any law.'' </P>
<P> In a satellite telephone interview from Cueva de los Tayos, Fujimori said he had heard heavy bombardment in the disputed patch of Amazon jungle overnight and some mortor rounds in the morning but that fighting appeared to be dying down. </P>
<P> ``The belligerent actions appear to be diminishing in accordance with the declaration of peace of Itamaraty,'' Fujimori told Radioprogramas del Peru in the late morning interview. </P>
<P> He said Peru's troops would adhere to the cease-fire and peace accord unless fired upon by Ecuadorean soldiers. </P>
<P> The international observers visited PV-1 earlier in the day and said they did not hear or witness any attacks. </P>
<P> Forces from the two Andean nations have been slugging it out in the remote mountainous area since Jan. 26. A cease-fire and peace accord reached last week failed to halt the hostilities. </P>
<P> The dispute, stemming from conflicting historical claims to a large portion of the Amazon basin, is centered on the Cordillera del Condor, an Andean range in virtually unpopulated jungle along an undemarcated 48-mile stretch of the Peru- Ecuador border. The area is said to contain gold and oil. </P>
