<P>  The Clinton administration said on Thursday it would push Congress to pass legislation to meet its foreign aid commitments to the Asian Development Bank's ``soft'' loan programme. </P>
<P> U.S. Assistant Treasury Secretary Jeffrey Shafer said the White House would ask Congress to pay a full commitment of $680 million which the United States pledged in 1992 to the soft-loan Asian Development Fund (ADF). </P>
<P> The United States has so far only paid $243 million, or around 35 percent, of its commitment to the ADF, which gives loans with lengthy 35 to 40 year payback periods at a charge of only one percent to the ADB's poorest member nations. </P>
<P> Fears Washington would abandon its three-year old pledge had loomed large over this year's 28th annual meeting here and dominated much of the informal talks among delegates from both richer western nations and developing countries. </P>
<P> ``We will make a very solid effort and we certainly hope that members of Congress will accept our arguments of why this is good for the United States. It is very important for the United States to be very engaged in the Asian region,'' Shafer said. </P>
<P> Shafer said he hoped the United States -- the ADB's second largest shareholder behind Japan -- would donate at some point its full ADF commitment. He declined to comment on the possibility of a hostile, Republican-led Congress blocking it. </P>
<P> He said there appeared little need for another meeting around November to begin formal discussions on replenishing the ADF, whose funds of $4.2 billion will expire in 1996. </P>
<P> ``We don't feel it's time yet to set a date for beginning formal negotiations,'' he told reporters following a presentation to the ADB, a 55-member development finance body. </P>
<P> Many developing Asian nations, anxious to ensure he ADB's richer members such as the United States, Canada, Australia and Britain maintain strong donations to the ADF, have called for an ADB meeting around November to discuss the ADF. </P>
<P> Shafer said he did not favour the ADB shifting its current policy to allow India and China access to concessionary funds from the ADF. </P>
<P> The repeated denial of such access has been a sore point for both countries, who have argued their large populations and poverty levels justify soft loans. </P>
<P> ``I do not see that as a development that we would be in favour of,'' he said. ``We believe the resources of the ADF are limited and need to be focused and targetted very closely.'' </P>
<P> But he agreed Asia's emerging tiger nations should boost donations to the ADB, and was encouraged by signs that developing economies such as South Korea were willing to pick up their share. </P>
<P> Washington also urged the ADB to help many Asian countries foster healthy capital markets to mobilise savings for large, long-term investments and ensure commercial finances are harnessed and directed at the Asian region. </P>
<P> ``Today private financing accounts for only seven percent of infrastructure project finance in the developing world. This share should be much larger,'' Shafer told delegates. ``The bank is taking some steps in this direction.'' </P>
