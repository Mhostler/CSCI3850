<P>  The House should pass a sweeping anti-crime bill Thursday despite objections from some liberals and conservatives, Speaker Thomas Foley said. </P>
<P> The measure is a compromise version of bills passed by the Senate last November and the House in April. </P>
<P> Foley told reporters Wednesday that conservatives were angry because the bill banned 19 types of semi-automatic weapons. He said liberals, especially black members, were upset because it did not allow appeals of death sentences if racial bias could be proven, a provision the House approved. </P>
<P> Asked if he thought the bill would still pass, Foley replied, ``I think so.'' He said he and other Democratic leaders including President Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno were working with both groups to try to persuade them to back the bill. </P>
<P> ``We're talking to all of them,'' Foley said. </P>
<P> He said some Republicans were also opposing the bill for what he said were purely political reasons. Democrats have a 256-178 majority in the House, with one independent. </P>
<P> With crime seen as the top public concern, both parties are under election-year pressure to pass a strong law. Clinton has called the bill the ``toughest, largest and smartest federal attack on crime'' in U.S. history and has said he will sign it as soon as he gets it. </P>
<P> The bill authorizes more than $30 billion to hire up to 100,000 more police, build prisons and fund crime prevention programs. It includes the ``three strikes and you're out'' mandatory life sentence for anyone convicted of three violent offenses and extends the federal death penalty to more than 60 crimes. </P>
<P> Republicans say the bill is not tough enough and includes too many wasteful social programs. </P>
<P> The final version of the bill must be passed or rejected as a whole by both the House and Senate. It can be passed by a simple majority in the House but may need 60 votes in the 100-member Senate if opponents begin a filibuster. </P>
