<P>  The perpetrators of Argentina's infamous ``dirty war'', pardoned by presidential decree, may have to respond to civil damage suits for their crimes following a landmark court ruling, a lawyer said Friday.  Judge Oscar Garzn Funes on Thursday ordered Admirals Emilio Massera and Armando Lambruschini, once military junta members, and the Argentine state to pay a total $1 million to relatives of the disappeared Tarnopolsky family. </P>
<P> Hugo Tarnopolsky, his wife, Blanca, and their children, Sergio and Betina, were abducted by clandestine forces and taken to the infamous Naval School of Mechanics in July 1976, at the height of the ``dirty war'' waged against leftists during Argentina's 1976-83 dictatorship. </P>
<P> The judge's ruling means that ``the presidential pardon does not change (human rights violators') civil responsibility for the moral damage to family members,'' the Tarnopolsky family's lawyer, Betina Stein, said. </P>
<P> The state has already appealed the ruling, but if upheld, it could lead to more cases against the military for human rights abuses, the judge said. </P>
<P> Some 9,000 people disappeared during the dirty war. </P>
<P> Although damages have been awarded in the past for human rights abuses committed by the military, they have always been awarded exclusively against the state, said Norma Maratea, a director at the Argentine government's Human Rights Bureau. </P>
<P> Like other junta members, Massera and Lambruschini were imprisoned for rights abuses after the return of democracy. </P>
<P> ``Massera and Lambruschini were...the incarnation of a despot state, without grounding in rights, that subverted the customs and morals of the people,'' the judge declared in his sentence. </P>
