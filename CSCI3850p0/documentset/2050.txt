<DATELINE>MOSCOW (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The leader of Russia's breakaway region of Chechnya said on Sunday that an attack by Moscow-backed opposition forces on the capital Grozny had been repulsed, Itar-Tass news agency said. </P>
<P> In a dispatch from Grozny, Tass said that Dzhokhar Dudayev appeared on television early Sunday and said that the government had enough force to push back any attack on the town. </P>
<P> The frail coalition of opposition groups seeking to topple Dudayev, a former Soviet air force general, said Saturday they had stormed Grozny, leaving only the center of the town under Dudayev's control. </P>
<P> There was no independent confirmation of the Tass report as telephone lines between Moscow and Grozny were cut on Sunday. </P>
<P> Moscow in July openly backed an anti-Dudayev provisional council, set up on the border with Russia, which has vowed to oust the separatist leader. </P>
<P> Russian authorities accuse Dudayev of turning his mountainous republic into a safe heaven for criminals from around Russia. </P>
<P> Dudayev brands his opponents ``Moscow puppets'' and accuses Russia of direct involvement in the conflict. Russia rejects such accusations. </P>
