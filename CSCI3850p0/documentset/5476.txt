<P>  Germany confirmed Wednesday that Chancellor Helmut Kohl would attend ceremonies in Moscow May 9 marking the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. </P>
<P> Goverment spokesman Peter Hausmann said Kohl would lay wreaths at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in the Kremlin wall and at a German military cemetary outside Moscow but not be present for a military parade planned for the day. </P>
<P> Russian President Boris Yeltsin cleared the way for Kohl to travel to Moscow by informing him last week that he would also not attend the military ceremonies. The traditional military parade would not be held on Red Square, he said. </P>
<P> President Clinton, French President Francois Mitterrand and British Prime Minsiter John Major had already accepted Yeltsin's invitation. </P>
<P> Sensitive about the way Germany's defeat is handled in this season of embarrassing anniversaries, Kohl has made it clear from the start he would not be available for any victory military parades in the capitals of the war victors. </P>
<P> London and Paris, which are holding war anniversary events May 7 and 8, complied by organizing commemorations that stress the current cooperation among the former foes. </P>
<P> Moscow's traditional military parades threatened to bar Kohl, Yeltsin's closest ally in the west, from the ceremony. </P>
<P> According to the newspaper Die Welt, the original planning for May 9 included a parade of 5,500 troops across Red Square, led by men carrying the banners of the units that fought on the Second World War front. </P>
<P> T-34 tanks and ``Stalin organ'' rockets would be on show and veterans marching by would be decked out in all their medals. </P>
<P> A second parade -- now apparently the only one planned -- would have 10,000 troops and 300 tanks file by a new monument to the war dead outside Moscow. </P>
<P> The Sueddeutsche Zeitung praised Yeltsin for avoiding the military parade, which would have been embarrassing for all his guests because of Moscow's bloody war in the rebel republic of Chechnya, and for finding a way to allow Kohl to attend. </P>
<P> ``Yeltsin and Kohl have narrowly avoided a diplomatic catastrophe,'' the Munich daily commented. </P>
<P> Government sources said Tuesday that Kohl would attend the Moscow ceremony but his spokesman could not confirm this until Wednesday because not all details had been worked out. </P>
