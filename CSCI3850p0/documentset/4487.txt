<P> By Evelyn Leopold  The Security Council Wednesday pushed aside U.N. proposals for a rapid deployment force to cope with peacekeeping emergencies but at the same time left itself the option of using force in future missions. </P>
<P> In a policy paper on the future of peacekeeping read at a public meeting, the council responded officially to a Jan. 5 report from Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali in which he took a second look at his major 1992 Agenda for Peace blueprint on peacekeeping. </P>
<P> Boutros-Ghali had argued for governments to set up a rapid-reaction force under U.N. command to respond to peacekeeping emergencies. </P>
<P> But he also said that in the aftermath of Somalia, where the United Nations attempted to take forceful action, future operations should observe the traditional U.N. neutral and non-combatant peacekeeping role. </P>
<P> Not surprisingly, in view of the anti-U.N. sentiment in Washington, the council ignored the rapid deployment force, saying Boutros-Ghali should enhance ``existing stand-by arrangements, covering the full spectrum of resources.'' </P>
<P> Currently, countries earmark troops for the United Nations but have the option of turning down a mission, such as members did for troops to monitor refugee camps around Rwanda. Deployment of forces also lags months behind approval. </P>
<P> But the council left itself open to future large-scale missions, saying it agreed in general to the ``non-use of force except in self-defense'' but ``without prejudice to its ability to response to situations on a case-by-case basis.'' </P>
<P> Boutros-Ghali had also urged the council to reconsider how it uses sanctions, saying a ``mechanism'' should be established to assess the effects of sanctions of the targeted countries. </P>
<P> Clearly drawing on the case of Iraq, where the council is divided over how far Baghdad has gone toward satisfying its demands, he said the council's objectives were not always clearly defined and ``indeed seemed to change over time.'' </P>
<P> Despite reported urgings by Russia and France to endorse his position, the council Wednesday broke no new ground. Instead it urged Boutros-Ghali to reinforce staff members working for the Council's sanctions committees, which often lag months behind in considering requests for relief. </P>
<P></P>
<P> -- Supported for the first time ``micro-disarmament'' saying that small arms were probably responsible for most deaths in today's conflicts. The paper also said that arms embargoes have to be strictly implemented, despite threats by the U.S. Congress' vow to lift the arms embargo against Bosnia in May. </P>
<P> -- Promised to follow up ``with appropriate measures'' on violation of treaties relating to weapons of mass destruction, which envoys said at first drew some objections from China because of its possible relevance to North Korea. </P>
