<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Flanked by piles of books listing hundreds of federal rules, Republican lawmakers Wednesday unveiled a coalition to cut government red tape. </P>
<P> The alliance, called Project Relief, is designed to stir private-sector support for the House Republicans' ``Contract With America,'' which calls for rule-making reform. </P>
<P> ``The thing that binds us all together is red tape, government red tape, lots and lots and lots of it,'' said Bruce Gates of the National-American Wholesale Grocers' Association, who will lead the alliance. </P>
<P> The Contract with America is the Republicans' legislative platform for the first 100 days of the next Congress, which begins Jan. 4. Aside from regulatory reform, it includes a balanced budget amendment, line-item veto, tax cuts and welfare reform. </P>
<P> On Monday, the incoming Republican leaders of the House and Senate urged President Clinton to impose an immediate moratorium on federal rule-making, calling excessive government regulation a ``hidden tax.'' </P>
<P> In a letter to Clinton, initiated by incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, the lawmakers said the moratorium should stay in force through the first 100 days of the new Congress. </P>
<P> The Project Relief coalition, set up at the request of incoming Majority Whip Tom DeLay, a Texas Republican, is a collection of lobbyists and conservative think tanks. </P>
<P> Regulatory ``victims'' appearing with DeLay at the news conference included Charles Griffiths of Binghamton Slag Roofing Co. in New York. Griffiths wore the protective suit, respirator and hard hat he said the government required his employees to wear when working on roofs containing asbestos. </P>
<P> ``I feel like a quarterback with no offensive line to protect him from a 300-pound regulator,'' Griffiths said. </P>
<P> DeLay said the tremendous response to his request for a coalition -- more than 200 people signed up -- showed broad support for the Contract. </P>
<P> But it also showed the desire of lobbyists to curry favor with Republicans, who take control of the House in January for the first time in 40 years. </P>
<P> Groups joining the coalition include the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and National Association of Manufacturers. </P>
<P> The proposal for a 100-day freeze on new regulations was opposed by several consumer and environmental groups, who said it would delay needed rules to protect the public. </P>
<P> ``This proposal hijacks the political process. People voted for a sensible government, not a government that doesn't protect them from the unsafe hazards of safe drinking water,'' said Joe Schwartz of Physicians for Social Responsibility. </P>
