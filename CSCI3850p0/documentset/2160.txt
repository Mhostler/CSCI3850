<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A French woman was found alive in a rubber dinghy after 15 days at sea during which her husband apparently drowned and her five-year-old daughter was washed overboard just before help arrived, officials said Friday. </P>
<P> A Spanish rescue helicopter pulled Louise Longo-Huyghe, 36, from the dinghy in storm-tossed seas 120 miles off the northwestern coast of Spain Thursday afternoon. </P>
<P> She was badly malnourished and barely coherent, but later told a French deputy consul in the port of La Coruna that her husband Bernard Huyghe had died a week earlier aboard the dinghy, where his body remained for three more days. </P>
<P> Their daughter Gaella had been alive when a Russian cargo ship spotted the dinghy, but the girl was washed overboard before the helicopter arrived just hours later. </P>
<P> ``There had been reports that we were to pick up two people, but we didn't know if they would be dead or alive,'' a National Maritime Rescue spokeswoman in Madrid told Reuters. </P>
<P> ``When we arrived there was only one woman in a bad state of shock and very disoriented.'' </P>
<P> She said rescuers were still searching for the husband and daughter, but their efforts were hampered by choppy seas and poor visibility. </P>
<P> The family set out for Senegal from the French Atlantic port of La Rochelle on Sept. 30 aboard the Belgian-registered sailing boat Jan Van Gent, which they abandoned in a storm Oct. 5. </P>
<P> Rescue searches began five days later when the yacht was found drifting 120 miles off the Galician coast, known to sailors as the ``coast of death,'' the spokeswoman said. </P>
<P> She said the conditions at sea during the woman's ordeal were ``extremely dangerous'' with gale-force winds, 20-foot waves and at least three days of rain. </P>
<P> Hospital officials said Longo-Huyghe was in stable condition and able to communicate, but would have to remain hospitalized for the time being. </P>
