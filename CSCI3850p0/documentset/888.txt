<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, Germany (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Four of the six former Soviet citizens arrested by German police investigating the killing of six people in a Frankfurt brothel were released from custody Friday, a police spokesman said. </P>
<P> He said one man and a prostitute who worked at the high-class brothel were expected to be ordered held in investigative custody. </P>
<P> The six suspects were arrested Thursday morning near the southern town of Kempten in Bavaria at a hostel for ethnic German immigrants from east Europe. They had been brought to Frankfurt for questioning. </P>
<P> They were found with electrical cables which appeared to have been used to strangle the victims, police said. </P>
<P> ``We have made decisive progress in our investigations,'' Frankfurt police chief Karlheinz Gemmer told a news conference. </P>
<P> ``Based on evidence collected so far I have no doubt that the prostitute and a man she knew very well were linked to the deed,'' said Oskar Schaub, the policeman heading the investigation. </P>
<P> The Hungarian owners of the brothel, Gabor Bartos, 55, and his 48-year-old wife Ingrid as well as four prostitutes from the former Soviet Union were found dead in the high-class sex club near Frankfurt's banking area Monday. </P>
<P> German media have speculated the murders were committed by the Russian mafia because Bartos allegedly encroached on their business of trafficking in young women from eastern Europe. </P>
