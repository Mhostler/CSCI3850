<P> Eds: adds owners' rejection of players' proposal)  National Hockey League owners have rejected a players' promise not to strike in return for an owners' pledge not to lock them out, Canadian Press reported late Thursday night. </P>
<P> The owners' move would appear to clear the way for NHL commissioner Gary Bettman to postpone Saturday's opening of the season. </P>
<P> ``We had a pretty frank conversation and rejected the offer,'' a source who took part in an owners' conference call Thursday evening told the Canadian Press. </P>
<P> ``It's pretty obvious we won't be playing on Saturday,'' said a second source who listened in on the call. </P>
<P> After the 2 3/8-hour conference call, the owners issued a press release in New York saying they would respond to the players proposal at a news conference there Friday afternoon. </P>
<P> The owners were reacting to the proposal made earlier in the day by the NHL Players' Association. </P>
<P> ``If they reject it, it means they want a fight,'' union head Bob Goodenow said Thursday in turning the heat up on Bettman. ``Our players are fully prepared to stay in a long battle throughout the season. </P>
<P> ``The players are prepared to pledge that there will be no interruptions to the 1994-95 season and playoffs -- no strike -- provided there is no lockout,'' Goodenow said at a news conference. </P>
<P> ``We know this is going to be a long fight,'' Wayne Gretzky said. ``It could go on for months. We have told all of our players since last April that this could happen and, if it does happen, be prepared to sit out a year -- and we are prepared for that.'' </P>
<P> Goodenow said the league's 700 players would play under the same terms and conditions as last season provided also that the league reinstates payments to players such as health and life insurance payments and certain travel costs. </P>
<P> ``We believe this commitment by the players removes the NHL's only stated reason for the October 1 lockout.'' </P>
<P> Bettman has said a full collective bargaining agreement would have to be hammered out by Friday if the season is to start on time Saturday. </P>
<P> Players and owners have been without a contract since September 1993 and talks this week in Toronto and last week in New York failed to break the impasse. </P>
<P> ``If they reject (the players' proposal), it means they want a fight,'' Goodenow said. ``If there is a labor fight, it will be a dirty, nasty fight.'' </P>
<P> He said the two sides were still ``far apart'' on the major issues, which largely relate to revenue sharing and finding a way of supplementing teams in smaller markets. </P>
<P> The threat to the season comes at a time when hockey is witnessing a surge in popularity in the United States. League revenues jumped to $700 million in 1993-94 and salaries rose to $440 million. </P>
<P> ``We are willing to play this year and really push our league to another level,'' said Gretzky, whose contract with the Los Angeles Kings earned him $8.4 million last year, the highest in the league. </P>
<P> ``I would hope that a lot of the owners in the league are feeling the same way -- that this is not the right time to have a lockout,'' Gretzky said. </P>
