<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES, Nov 8 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Republican Pete Wilson won re-election as California governor Tuesday in a striking political comeback fueled by his support of a victorious ballot proposal cutting off public services to illegal immigrants. </P>
<P> With 33 percent of the votes counted, Los Angeles television channels KNBC and KABC reported that Wilson had a commanding 58 percent to 38 percent lead over Democratic challenger and state treasurer Kathleen Brown. </P>
<P> Brown conceded defeat at 10:15 p.m. PST (1:15 a.m EST), just about two hours after the polls closed, marking the end of one of the costliest and nastiest gubernatorial races in California history. </P>
<P> ``We accept the verdict of the people of California,'' Brown told supporters at her campaign headquarters. She would have been California's first woman governor. </P>
<P> Just moments later, Wilson declared victory to chants of ''four more years'' from his supporters. ``What you have won today is a victory for working Californians... I must say it wasn't too long ago that the smart money pundits were not only writing me off but they were writing off California.'' </P>
<P> Wilson, 61, a tough-talking ex-Marine and former senator, trailed Brown by wide margins in the polls until this past June. And two years ago, he had the worst job rating level of any modern California governor. </P>
<P> He presided over the worst economic recession in California since the Depression and faced a barrage of natural and political crises while in office, including the 1992 Los Angeles riots and the January 1994 earthquake. </P>
<P> But Wilson seized upon public resentment of illegal immigration in California, voicing strong support for the ballot proposal called the ``Save our State'' initiative. </P>
<P> Brown, 49, came out against the proposal, which won by a wide margin in the California election. </P>
<P> Wilson's turnaround has been attributed to his stance on illegal immigration and his calls for tougher measures against crime, which came amid signs of a resurgence in the California economy. </P>
<P> During the campaign, he voiced strong support for the death penalty and a victorious ballot proposal calling for life imprisonment without parole for criminals convicted of three felonies. </P>
<P> With his re-election victory, Wilson not only retains his position as governor but is expected to be in the running for the 1996 Republican presidential or vice presidential nominations. </P>
<P> Brown, who served on the Los Angeles board of education before becoming state treasurer in 1991, had been seeking to follow in the footsteps of her father Pat and brother Jerry. Each had served two terms as California governor -- Pat from 1959 to 1967 and Jerry from 1975 to 1983. </P>
<P> Brown initially seized on Wilson's weak showing in the polls, but she failed to maintain an early groundswell of support or to keep the campaign focused on the economy. </P>
