<P>  Djibouti's Afar guerrillas and President Hassan Gouled Aptidon's ethnic Somali-dominated government signed a peace accord Monday to end a three-year uprising in the tiny Red Sea state. </P>
<P> The accord was signed at the People's Palace by Djibouti's Interior Minister Idriss Harbi Farah and the secretary-general of the rebel Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy Ougoure Kifle Ahmed. </P>
<P> Officials said the agreement would lead to peace and national reconciliation in Djibouti and came after months of secret talks on power-sharing. </P>
<P> Hostilities in the arid state effectively ceased in July 1993, suspending a desultory civil war that had sputtered since November 1991. Secret talks followed, leading to Monday's accord. </P>
