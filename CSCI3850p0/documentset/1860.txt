<P> The official, who asked not to be identified, said troops had been put on alert in the United States. He declined to say how many but noted that enough U.S. military equipment was stationed in Kuwait to support a brigade of up to 5,000 soldiers. </P>
<P> The official declined to say immediately what aircraft carrier had been ordered to Iraq, but noted that the carrier George Washington in the Adriatic was only about four days steaming time from the Gulf. </P>
<P> The official said Clinton had also ordered four warships carrying 2,000 U.S. Marines to move into the northern Gulf from their current position in the southern part of the gulf. At least one U.S. military cargo ship loaded with equipment has also been ordered to sail toward the Gulf from the island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. </P>
<P> ``The moves are precautionary and are being made in response to the movement of Iraqi troops toward Kuwait,'' another defense official said. The Pentagon said 11 U.S. warships are currently in the Gulf and Northern Arabian Sea, including the cruiser Leyte Gulf and destroyer Hewitt, both armed with long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles. </P>
