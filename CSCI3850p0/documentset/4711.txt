<DATELINE>ROME (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Silvio Berlusconi's Freedom Alliance said Friday it would vote against Prime Minister Lamberto Dini's emergency budget in parliament, a move which could sink the measure and force Dini to resign. </P>
<P> The decision immediately sent the shaky lira crashing to a record low of 1,170 against the German mark. </P>
<P> Markets view the 20 trillion lire ($12.3 billion) package as vital in restoring some order to Italy's chaotic finances. </P>
<P> The mini-budget faces the serious threat of defeat in the lower house, where Dini only won a confidence vote following his appointment in January thanks to Freedom Alliance abstentions. </P>
<P> ``We will vote against the government mini-budget both in the Senate (upper house) and the Chamber of Deputies (lower house),'' the center-right Freedom Alliance said in a statement after a meeting at former prime minister Berlusconi's Rome residence. </P>
<P> The center-right Alliance said Wednesday that it was prepared to back Dini on the mini-budget and also on the contentious question of pension reform as long as the latter issue were settled by the end of March. </P>
<P> Berlusconi and his allies want to clear the deck for a general election by June. The media tycoon has been demanding a return to the polls since he was forced to resign following a mutiny by his Northern League coalition partner last December. </P>
<P> ``Our display of goodwill and responsibility was met with indifference,'' the Freedom Alliance statement said, explaining their change of heart. </P>
<P> Dini, appointed to head a stop-gap government in January, has said he will resign as soon as his four-point program has been approved. He also said that he would step down if it became clear that there were insurmountable obstacles in his path. </P>
<P> The Senate will vote on the mini-budget next Tuesday, after which it is due to pass to the lower house. </P>
<P> In the Senate, Dini has a numerical majority even without the Freedom Alliance but in the lower house he would have to rely on the votes of the Marxist Communist Refoundation who have already said they intend to vote against the package. </P>
<P> ``From now on we will do everything in our democratic power to prevent the success of this plot against the results of the free elections of last March,'' the Freedom Alliance statement added. </P>
<P> Berlusconi swept to power in a general election last March, but was ousted after the Northern League quit. Berlusconi's Forza Italia and the hard right National Alliance remain as the main partners in the Freedom Alliance. </P>
<P> Former central banker Dini, treasury minister under Berlusconi, was appointed in January to head a ``government of experts'' drawn from outside of the world of party politics. </P>
<P> The Freedom Alliance mocked the government's work. </P>
<P> ``After the ``technical'' cure, the lira is at a record low, the stock market is depressed, the cost of money has increased, the economy is weaker and the people of Italy are again called on to make useless and unfair sacrifices,'' the Alliance said. </P>
<P> ``Italy doesn't need taxes and more taxes but stable politics and a government drawn from the legislature,'' it added. </P>
<P> Berlusconi argues that only a general election can give Italy the stability it needs, but his opponents say that tighter controls on media ownership are required before a fair election is possible. </P>
<P> Political commentators believe that an election is virtually inevitable, either in June or October. </P>
<P> Billionaire businessman Berlusconi owns three national commercial television channels. </P>
<P> The Freedom Alliance's opponents attacked the decision to oppose the budget. </P>
<P> ``I hoped that good sense and a mimimum of sensitivity for the common good would prevail,'' said economist Romano Prodi, expected to lead a centre-left alliance against Berlusconi when an election is called. </P>
<P> ``I must say that partisan interests have won the day,'' he added. </P>
