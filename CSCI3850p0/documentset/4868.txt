<P>  Japan's ruling coalition is set to send a mission to North Korea this week at the invitation of the Stalinist state, Japanese newspapers said Sunday. </P>
<P> The newspapers said Kim Yong-sun, secretary of North Korea's ruling Workers Party, had asked the leaders of Japan's three ruling coalition parties -- the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), Socialist Party and New Party Sakigake -- to send a mission for the purpose of normalizing bilateral ties. </P>
<P> A Japanese mission, which could be headed by former foreign minister Michio Watanabe, was likely to visit Pyongyang Thursday at the earliest and stay for several days, they said. </P>
<P> Tokyo and Pyongyang began talks on normalizing bilateral ties in early 1991, but they broke down in late 1992 when North Korea rejected Japan's demand for information about a Japanese woman allegedly abducted by North Korean agents. </P>
<P> In Copenhagen, Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama held talks with South Korean President Kim Young-sam during which Kim referred to the planned Japanese mission to North Korea. </P>
<P> Murayama told Kim Tokyo would try to normalize relations with Pyongyang to help improve inter-Korean relations, Kyodo news agency said. </P>
<P> Murayama was quoted as telling Kim Japan would maintain close contact with South Korea on the matter. </P>
<P> Both leaders were among more than 100 heads of state and government attending a United Nations social summit in Copenhagen. </P>
<P> LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori said Friday the mission was also aimed at setting the stage for contacts with Pyongyang over the newly established Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO). </P>
<P> The United States, South Korea and Japan inaugurated KEDO Thursday in New York. </P>
<P> The organization plans to build two light-water nuclear reactors in North Korea as part of a deal between Washington and Pyongyang last October. </P>
<P> Under the accord, Pyongyang pledged to freeze and eventually dismantle its current nuclear program in return for modern reactors and alternative energy supplies. </P>
