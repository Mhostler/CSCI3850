<P>  Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu suggested Tuesday the United Nations deliberately exaggerated the number of Hutu refugees slaughtered in a camp last month anddenied Rwanda's army secretly buried corpses to cover up. </P>
<P> An international inquiry began work in Rwanda Monday to try to work out how many people died in shootings and stampedes when the Rwandan army tried to close Kibeho camp by force on April 22 as part of a policy of making Hutus return home. </P>
<P> The United Nations estimated that up to 8,000 were killed inthe camp but later revised down the figure to 2,000 after a ``scientific count.'' </P>
<P> Bizimungu reiterated his government's belief that around 300died in what he called a ``regrettable incident.'' </P>
<P> The variation in the U.N. figures ``proves that the person who made this report either lacked information or was making deliberate distortions,'' Bizimungu told a news conference duringa visit to Paris to attend VE Day celebrations. </P>
<P> ``I find these differences troubling,'' he said, adding ``I don't think that all of that can be accidental.'' He did not elaborate on possible motives for the suggested exaggeration. Some foreign aid groups also spoke of thousands killed. </P>
<P> Bizimungu said the army started shooting after Hutu militiasopened fire when the army tried to take contol of the camp. </P>
<P> The bodies of more than 330 people have been exhumed at Kibeho but some U.N. sources say Rwanda Patriotic Army (RPA) troops ferried bodies from mass graves to secret sites to cover up the extent of the slaughter. </P>
<P> ``I don't think that any corpses were hidden,'' Bizimungu said, saying that he himself visited the camp on April 23, the day after the massacre. </P>
<P> ``Supposing that there were 2,000 dead like they say, I don'tsee how (the army) could, in the space of several hours...hide more than 1,000 corpses. That seems unrealistic,'' he said. </P>
<P> The killings soured relations between the Tutsi-dominated government and the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda. Tutsis and Hutu allies were victims of Hutu-led genocide last year in which up to a million people were butchered. </P>
<P> Bizimungu said the Rwandan army at the camp could not have killed thousands merely with their rifles. Pointing around the room and pretending to hold a gun, he told about 40 reporters: ``I could not kill you all here only with a rifle.'' </P>
<P> Bizimungu said he did not believe that dividing Rwanda into separate Hutu and Tutsi states would solve the nation's problems. ``I don't think it would be a good solution,'' he said, adding it would contradict regional integration efforts. </P>
<P> He said he hoped relations between Rwanda and France would improve under president-elect Jacques Chirac. Outgoing PresidentFrancois Mitterrand snubbed Rwanda by refusing to invite it to aFranco-African summit last year. </P>
