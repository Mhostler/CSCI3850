<P>  Former President Jimmy Carter called on Congress Wednesday to ratify an international treaty banning discrimination against women, saying the United States is the only industrialized democracy not to have done so. </P>
<P> In an editorial column published by the Atlanta Constitution, Carter indicated that failure to adopt the 1979 United Nations treaty known informally as the Women's Convention could compromise U.S. interests at a meeting on women's rights set for next September in Beijing. </P>
<P> ``Fourteen years ago, I signed the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women,'' Carter wrote. </P>
<P> ``Now, three administrations later, the United States is the only industrialized democracy that has not ratified the convention -- because of inaction by Congress.'' </P>
<P> The convention, adopted by the U.N. general assembly in 1979, went into force two years later with the aim of ending discrimination that denies or limits women's equality in political, economic, social, cultural and civil fields. </P>
<P> The 139 countries that have since joined the convention have pledged to adapt their legislation and practices accordingly. </P>
<P> In his column, published in observance of International Women's Day, Carter said massive violations of women's human rights persist worldwide. </P>
<P> He noted sexual abuse suffered by women as part of politically instigated ethnic conflicts in Bosnia and Rwanda, extremist attacks against women activists in Algeria, Pakistan and Mauritius and employment discrimination against women in Russia and Japan. </P>
<P> The former president also pointed to obstacles faced by American women, including inequality in pay, educational support and health care. </P>
<P> ``Rape and domestic violence continue to be underinvestigated and underprosecuted, and the victims, who are overwhelmingly women, are often denied equal protection under law,'' he wrote. </P>
<P> Carter lauded the Clinton administration for introducing the U.N. Women's Convention to Congress last year. But he said Republican members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee delayed a floor vote, forcing the process to start again from the beginning this year. </P>
<P> ``The Clinton administration and Congress must put women's equality above partisan politics and ratify the Women's Convention, showing that the U.S. government is committed to full equality for its female citizens as well as for women around the world,'' the former president wrote. </P>
<P> Otherwise, he said, the lack of U.N. ratification will be ''highly noticed'' at the U.N. Fourth World Conference on Women, set for next September in the Chinese capital. </P>
