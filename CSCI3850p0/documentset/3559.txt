<NOTES>(Adds Walesa saying will not obey new tax levels)</NOTES>
<DATELINE>WARSAW (Reuter)</DATELINE>
<P>  Polish President Lech Walesa, moving to split the country's leftist coalition and isolate its youthful prime minister, said Tuesday he would not pay personal tax at new rates set by the government. </P>
<P> Asked by reporters on what basis he would pay his own taxes, Walesa said he would obey the previous 1991 law. </P>
<P> ``I don't recognize the announcement, because that is not a good solution,'' PAP news agency quoted him as saying. </P>
<P> The government's higher 1995 tax brackets were announced last week without the passage of the necessary law. </P>
<P> Walesa's right-hand man Lech Falandysz told Reuters that unless Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak reached an understanding with Walesa, he should either quit or be ready for a fight. </P>
<P> ``We should either have another prime minister, or it will come to war or a sharp conflict ... or there should be agreement,'' Falandysz, deputy head of Walesa's office said. </P>
<P> Walesa is locked in a dispute with the coalition over economic policy and the extent of presidential powers to control key ministries. </P>
<P> Pawlak, 34, heads the junior coalition member, the Polish Peasant Party (PSL), which has been more reluctant to implement economic reforms such as privatization than its larger partner, the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD). </P>
<P> Walesa himself told reporters that he would prefer to have SLD leader Aleksander Kwasniewski as prime minister because he was more lively than Pawlak. </P>
<P> But the SLD, which won the most votes in September 1993 parliamentary elections, said it would not allow Walesa to split the coalition. </P>
<P> ``The more divisions there are on the Polish political scene, the better for Lech Walesa and his circle. But we know what is going on and we don't have to give in to it,'' senior SLD official Jerzy Szmajdzinski told PAP news agency. </P>
<P> Under the current interim constitution, Walesa cannot fire the prime minister but he insists on his right to determine the appointment of the defense and foreign ministers. </P>
