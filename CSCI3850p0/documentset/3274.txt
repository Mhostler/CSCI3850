<P> Deputy Defense Secretary John Deutch, in announcing the decision, stressed that the action was ``not imminent, but in the planning stages''. He said it would probably take place early next year and that U.S. troops committed to the project ''would be there in limited numbers for a limited period of time to cover the final departure'' of the U.N. forces. </P>
<P> He estimated that ``2,000 or 3,000'' Marines would be involved in covering the final withdrawal. </P>
<P> Deutch said U.S. officials believed it was important for the United States to provide ``limited assistance'' in the withdrawal and said President Bill Clinton, who made the decision Friday, believed it was the ``right thing to do.'' </P>
<P> The United States, which at one stage had 28,000 troops committed to a humanitarian aid mission in Somalia, pulled the last of its forces out earlier this year. The mission was marred by clashes with Somali warlord forces and an ambush of U.S. soldiers. The U.N. Security Council has decided the remaining 15,000 troops, should be pulled out by March 31. </P>
