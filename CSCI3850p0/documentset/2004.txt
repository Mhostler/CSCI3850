<P>  A gunman and his hostage, tentatively identified as a Korean businessman, died in a shootout with police after a car chase through Hong Kong early Friday, a police spokesman said. </P>
<P> The gunman, identified in newspapers as 23-year-old Cheng Cho-yau, used a Chinese-made pistol to hold up a policeman in Hong Kong's Central business district and took the officer's gun and police radio. </P>
<P> He then stopped a taxi carrying the Korean man, grabbed a female passerby, climbed in the taxi and forced the driver to head for the southern side of the island. </P>
<P> Police gave chase and intercepted the hijacked car near the crowded Aberdeen harbor typhoon shelter on the south side of the island. The gunman fired a number of shots at police, who returned the fire. </P>
<P> Cheng and his Korean hostage were killed. The female hostage, aged about 18, and the taxi driver escaped unharmed, although the driver sprained his ankle. </P>
<P> Three policemen received gunshot wounds, the police spokesman said. None of the policemen was seriously wounded. </P>
<P> Police, retracing the gunman's steps, said he first surfaced near the famous Star Ferry pier in Kowloon across Victoria Harbor from Hong Kong island around 11 p.m. local time Thursday and approached a group of women. </P>
<P> When they refused to talk to him, he pulled out a pistol and hit one of them over the head. </P>
<P> A police patrol gave chase but the gunman disappeared after firing two shots. </P>
<P> He emerged on the other side of the harbor on Hong Kong island about half an hour later, the spokesman said. </P>
<P> Police have not yet determined the gunman's motives. </P>
