<DATELINE>TOKYO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Japanese authorities, stung by failure to prevent or solve poison-gas attacks, hinted on Thursday at a crackdown on fringe religious groups and introduction of wiretapping. </P>
<P> As police ran into dead ends in the search for clues to Wednesday's gas attack on the Yokohama railroad system, calls grew in newspapers and parliament for measures that would lift a reign of terror the nation has lived under for a month. </P>
<P> Police frustration at the lack of progress was summed up by retraction of an assessment that World War I phosgene gas was used in the attack in Yokohama, where more than 500 people needed hospital treatment. </P>
<P> More detailed examination of victims showed phosgene, or mustard gas, was not involved, leaving police with witness descriptions describing the fumes as either ammonia, or sulphur, or hydrochloric acid, or chlorine acid. </P>
<P> ``We don't know what we have,'' a police spokesman said. </P>
<P> The frustration spilled over into newspaper editorials and questioning in parliament. </P>
<P> ``This chain of terrorist acts must stop,'' the mass circulation Yomiuri Shimbun said. ``The security of this nation must be defended by all means, and this is a task not just for the police.'' </P>
<P> In parliament, Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama and other ministers were asked angry questions about whether the time had come to ban the doomsday cult linked to the March 20 Tokyo subway attack, which set off the present climate of fear. </P>
<P> Justice Minister Isao Maeda, whose department will prosecute those involved in the gas attacks, said the time may have come for legislation to deal with terrorism in Japan. </P>
<P> ``We will start considering the introduction of telephone tapping and decoy operations, which are basically not allowed under current laws,'' Maeda told a parliamentary panel. </P>
<P> Under present law, such covert operations are only allowed in serious drug-trafficking cases and not in other kinds of criminal or espionage cases. </P>
<P> Education Minister Kaoru Yosano told the same panel he might order Aum Shinri Kyo (the Supreme Truth Sect) to disband if it was behind the Tokyo sarin nerve-gas and Yokohama attacks. </P>
<P> Police raids on sect facilities since the March 20 Tokyo attack, which killed 12 people and injured more than 5,000, have disclosed the chemicals needed to make sarin. </P>
<P> Sect spokesmen have denied responsibility for the attack and police have made no charges or arrests directly connected to the attack. </P>
<P> Yosano said the government also needed to review legislation governing religious groups in Japan. </P>
<P> ``I believe there are some problems (with the law) given that there are cases when the government ministry which approves a religious organization is unaware of the organization's operations,'' Yosano said. </P>
<P> In Japan, religious organizations are under the jurisdiction of the Education Ministry. </P>
<P> Twenty-four hours after the Yokohama attack, where gas was released in a train and at two stations in the sister port city of Tokyo, at least 21 people remained in hospital complaining of nausea, burning eyes and painful coughing. </P>
<P> However, hospital authorities said they should all be able to leave before the weekend. </P>
<P> Police believe more than one person was probably involved in the Yokohama attack. </P>
<P> ``The three places could have been covered by one culprit, but it's more likely that more than one person was involved,'' the police spokesman said. </P>
