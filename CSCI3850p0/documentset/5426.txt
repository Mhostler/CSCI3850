<P>  Olympic figure skating champion Oksana Baiul of Ukraine announced Monday that she will remain professional and not seek to regain her amateur status. </P>
<P> The 17-year-old Baiul, who narrowly defeated American Nancy Kerrigan for the Olympic gold medal at the 1994 Lillehammer Games, had until April 1 to reapply for amateur status. </P>
<P> ``This has been a very difficult decision for me,'' Baiul said in a statement released by her agent at the William Morris Agency. </P>
<P> ``My career in skating is just beginning. I love to skate in amateur competitions, but there is a special artistic freedom for a professional.'' </P>
<P> Baiul's coach, Galina Zmievskaya, who also coaches 1992 Olympic men's champion Viktor Petrenko, said: ``This is Oksana's choice. I can coach for amateur or professional, it makes no difference. </P>
<P> ``But hopefully those governing skating will continue the positive direction of opening the sport to the best skaters.''  Baiul, who now trains in Simsbury, Connecticut near Hartford, has competed as a professional since last October. She is currently in Florida on a 76-city tour of the United States with several other figure skating champions. </P>
