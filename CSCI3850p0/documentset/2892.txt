<P>  The leader of Ireland's four million Catholics said Tuesday the Church would not protect pedophile clergy and warned further cases might emerge. </P>
<P> Cardinal Cahal Daly gave the assurance as claims of child sex allegations against two priests shook the devoutly religious population on both sides of the Irish border. </P>
<P> ``The church has no desire to cover up or shelter or shield anybody,'' Daly said in Armagh, Ireland's ecclesiastical capital. </P>
<P> In Dublin, The Irish Times said police were investigating a number of serious allegations of sexual abuse by Catholic clergymen. It said they were investigating allegations that a religious brother sexually abused a mentally disabled woman at a long-term residential home where he worked in County Cork. </P>
<P> The cardinal, speaking in a BBC radio interview, spoke of his revulsion over pedophilia and said the betrayal felt by the whole Church was nothing compared to the pain endured by the victims and their families, which ``wrecked'' lives. </P>
<P> Saying abusers must accept therapy and never again be in a pastoral postion near children, Daly said: ``More cases will surface because we are dealing now with cases going back maybe 10, maybe 15, 20 years. But they should be reported and they should be dealt with.'' </P>
<P> The latest controversy to hit the church erupted Sunday with allegations that a priest assaulted an eight-year-old girl in Londonderry, Northern Ireland's second city, in 1989. </P>
<P> A previous scandal involving a priest helped bring down the Irish government two weeks ago. Father Brendan Smyth is serving four years in a Northern Ireland prison for abusing Belfast children over a long period. </P>
<P> After a lengthy delay in legal proceedings, which triggered a dispute leading to the Dublin government's downfall, Smyth later returned voluntarily to face charges in Northern Ireland. </P>
