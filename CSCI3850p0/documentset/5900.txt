<P>  California Gov. Pete Wilson said Thursday that $9 million has been pledged to his potential presidential bid and Mass. Gov. William Weld will join his campaign finance leadership team. </P>
<P> Wilson formed an exploratory committee last month for a run for the Republican presidential nomination in 1996. He is expected to formally launch his campaign in May, aides say. </P>
<P> The exploratory committee said supporters had pledged more than $9 million for Wilson's presidential candidacy during a recent three-day telephone fundraiser. </P>
<P> The committee also announced that Weld will be among the leaders of Wilson's national campaign finance team. </P>
<P> Weld and southern California businessman Donald Bren will oversee the campaign's fundraising operation as national at-large campaign finance chairmen, the committee said. </P>
<P> Former Texas Gov. William Clements and northern California business leader Thomas Weisel will each take on the role of national campaign finance chairman, it said. </P>
<P> They will be joined by National Finance Director Anne LeGassick, responsible for raising more than $25 million for Wilson's successful gubernatorial campaign last year, and Margaret Parker, who served as national finance director for the 1988 and 1992 Bush-Quayle presidential campaigns, the committee said. </P>
<P> ``I am extremely pleased that we've been able to attract such a well-respected and experienced group of leaders to head our campaign finance operation,'' Wilson said in a statement. </P>
<P> He said Weld's support ``will be invaluable to my campaign in Massachusetts, in New Hampshire, and across New England and the United States.'' </P>
<P> Wilson is part of a crowded field for the Republican nomination, with Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole leading the pack. </P>
<P> Wilson's position as governor of vote-rich California and his overwhelming re-election last year have pushed him into the ranks of likely front-runners for the Republican nomination. </P>
