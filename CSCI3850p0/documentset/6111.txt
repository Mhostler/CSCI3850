<DATELINE>JERUSALEM, April 28 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A Scottish doctor who performed an autopsy on a Palestinian prisoner held by Israel said on Friday the man died from torture. </P>
<P> ``There is no doubt whatsoever about the cause of death and it's very clear that he has died from unnatural causes and that he has died from torture and we know how that was achieved,'' pathologist Derrick Pounder told Israel's army radio. </P>
<P> Abd a-Samed Harizat, a 30-year-old Palestinian from Hebron who died on Tuesday, was the first Arab to die in detention since Israel relaxed interrogation rules for the Shin Bet secret police last year. Palestinians in Hebron said he was known to support the Moslem militant Hamas movement. </P>
<P> The autopsy was performed by two Israeli pathologists and Pounder, who was brought in by the family. </P>
<P> Police have declined to comment on a charge by a human rights group that Harizat suffered blows to the head while in Shin Bet custody. </P>
<P> Before Pounder's comments, a lawyer for the family Andre Rosenthal said he was prevented from saying any more than that the three pathologists had agreed on the cause of death. </P>
<P> Rosenthal said a criminal investigation was under way in the Israeli justice ministry and that by agreement with investigators he could only speak on Sunday. </P>
<P> Last November, a ministerial committee gave the Shin Bet more leeway in questioning suspected Islamic militants after a rise in attacks on Israelis. </P>
<P> An Israeli security source said Harizat was a senior member of Hamas' military wing and connected to three Hamas guerrillas killed last week by Israeli forces in Hebron in the West Bank. </P>
