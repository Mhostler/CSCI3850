<P>  President Clinton will meet bipartisan leaders of Congress Wednesday to discuss anti-terrorism steps to be taken in the wake of the Oklahoma bombing, the White House said Tuesday. </P>
<P> Spokeswoman Ginny Terzano said Clinton would meet Republican and Democratic leaders of the House and Senate at the White House in the late afternoon to discuss ``legislative steps that we should take.'' </P>
<P> Clinton, who is visiting Iowa, has called for expanded funding for counter-terrorism efforts to deal with home-grown and foreign security threats and the creation of an FBI-led unit to deal with the problem. </P>
<P> Republican leaders have said they are ready to work with Clinton to stiffen anti-terrorism legislation. The Senate Tuesday voted 97-0 to approve a resolution condemning the bombing. </P>
<P> Clinton and his wife Hillary are to attend the funeral mid-morning Wednesday of a 19-year Secret Service veteran Alan Whicher, who was killed in the April 19 Oklahoma City blast that devastated the city's federal office building. </P>
<P> Whicher, a father of three, was a member of Clinton's security detail until he transferred to Oklahoma seven months ago and Clinton consoled his widow and children during a visit to the city Sunday. </P>
