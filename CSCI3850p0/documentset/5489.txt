<P>  Presidential candidates President Alberto Fujimori and former United Nations chief Javier Perez de Cuellar campaigned in Peru's provinces Wednesday in a final push to garner votes ahead of Sunday's elections. </P>
<P> Fujimori, who has been on a marathon of school and public works inaugurations in the past two weeks, flew by helicopter to christen the Pasto Grande water project in southern Moquegua district with a small group of photojournalists, local radio said. </P>
<P> His chief opponent, Perez de Cuellar, was also on a tour in southern Peru and slated to wrap up his campaign Wednesday night with a political rally in the historic city of Cuzco, campaign officials said. </P>
<P> Meanwhile in Lima, opposition and labor groups planned a ''Civic March for Democracy'' late Wednesday to mark the third anniversary of Fujimori's military-backed April 5, 1992, ''self-coup,'' in which he closed Congress and assumed broad powers. </P>
<P> Fujimori said he needed emergency rule -- which lasted eight months -- to wipe out Maoist guerrilla violence and push through free-market economic reforms. His party won congressional elections in late 1992 and wrote a new constitution allowing his re-election. </P>
<P> In a visit to the poor southern region of Puno Tuesday, Perez de Cuellar lashed out at what he called Fujimori's attempts to scare voters into opting for continuity and the president's use of state resources to help his re-election bid. </P>
<P> He also handed a formal complaint to a member of the Organization of American States vote observer mission about the participation of local officials in Fujimori's campaign visits, La Republica newspaper said. </P>
<P> The National Electoral Board has warned Fujimori that local officials should abstain from campaigning. </P>
<P> ``The opposition's campaign has been more effective in the last couple of weeks,'' said Manuel Torrado, head of the Datum polling agency. </P>
<P> ``If they had done this earlier, there may have been a second round,'' he added, predicting a first-round Fujimori victory Sunday. </P>
<P> Fujimori was far ahead in the latest opinion polls but pollsters say his support had slipped and he may have to face a second round if he does not garner 50 percent of the valid vote. Peruvian law forbids the publication of polls within 15 days of the election. </P>
