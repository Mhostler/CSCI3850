<DATELINE>BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik has formally resigned, state television reported, bringing his predecessor Vladimir Meciar a step closer to regaining power eight months after he was ousted. </P>
<P> Slovak television reported late Thursday that Moravcik, whose centrist coalition has ruled since Meciar lost a parliamentary no-confidence vote in March, had submitted his government's resignation to President Michal Kovac. </P>
<P> Kovac accepted the resignation but asked Moravcik to stay on as a caretaker in the absence of a new government, which has still not been formed five weeks after parliamentary elections. </P>
<P> Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) took more than a third of the votes in the elections but weeks of negotiations produced no coalition partners apart from the far-right Slovak National Party. </P>
<P> Together they commanded only 70 of the 150 seats in parliament. But the Czech news agency CTK reported that they had formed a pact with the Slovak Workers' Party, which won 13 seats on a platform of championing the rights of workers who have missed out in Slovakia's move from state socialism to a market economy. </P>
<P> The Workers' Party had previously said it was not interested in joining a coalition led by Meciar, a flamboyant nationalist who campaigned against wholesale privatization and was ousted in March. </P>
<P> Privatization, a key part of free market reforms following the 1989 fall of communism, ground to a virtual halt under Meciar. </P>
<P> But since March Moravcik has rushed through a number of privatizations as well as attempting to restore international financial confidence in the country. </P>
