<P>  The White House indicated Monday it did not consider Russia's refusal to cancel its planned sale of nuclear reactors to Iran as final. </P>
<P> White House spokesman Mike McCurry said there was ``a lot of dialogue left'' on the subject before President Clinton goes to Moscow May 9 to meet Russian President Boris Yeltsin. </P>
<P> He said the United States still hoped Moscow would reverse its decision on the $1 billion sale. Washington worries that Iran might use spent reactor fuel and technology to develop nuclear arms. </P>
<P> ``I suspect there will be a lot of diplomacy ahead on that subject well before the May summit of President Yeltsin and President Clinton,'' McCurry told a news briefing. </P>
<P> Asked if Moscow faced any consequences as a result of its refusal to back down, McCurry said, ``We'll have to see.'' </P>
<P> Earlier in Moscow, Defense Secretary William Perry said Russian officials had rejected his personal appeal on the subject and told him that tight controls could prevent the kind of nuclear arms proliferation that worried Washington. </P>
<P> Perry said he did not share that confidence and said U.S. and Russian officials would continue discussions in the coming weeks, including possible safeguards on spent fuel. </P>
<P> Russian officials also warned against quick expansion of NATO to the east and said parliament was unlikely to ratify the START-2 strategic arms reduction treaty because of friction with the Western military alliance. </P>
<P> McCurry, asked about these developments, said he thought there ``might be some pre-summit positioning'' going on. </P>
<P> McCurry was also asked whether the Clinton administration had provided Russian officials with Amerian intelligence on Iran, in hopes of persuading them to drop the nuclear sale. </P>
<P> He said Secretary of State Warren Christopher recently exchanged views on the subject with Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev and ``I believe the information exchange was rather complete.'' </P>
<P> But when asked whether the United States would toughen its sanctions on Iran, which Washington considers a sponsor of world terrorism, McCurry said he couldn't add anything to comments Christopher made Sunday, when the secretary of state said, ``I hope we'll toughen our stand.'' </P>
<P> Christopher said the administration would hold intense discussions on the sanctions this week, but would not confirm a report that he was recommending a near-total ban on trade. </P>
