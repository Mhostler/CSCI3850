<P>  Suspected neo-Nazis desecrated a Jewish cemetery in the central German town of Goettingen, overturning 11 gravestones and breaking some of them, police said Sunday. </P>
<P> The incident was first reported by a caretaker at the cemetery Friday, but may have happened even earlier. </P>
<P> Desecration of Jewish cemeteries and memorials was a feature of an upsurge in racism and right-wing extremism in Germany after unification in 1990, although such incidents seemed to be on the decline. </P>
<P> Unidentified vandals torched a Jewish synagogue in the northern port of Luebeck Sunday for the second time in 14 months. The earlier arson attack on the synagogue was the first at a temple in Germany since the Third Reich. </P>
<P> Four men with links to radical right groups are serving jail terms for the first arson case. </P>
<P> The direct attack on a place of worship raised the specter of the 1938 ``Kristallnacht'' pogrom which presaged the Holocaust. </P>
<P> Mobs whipped up by the Nazis burned down synagogues and looted more than 7,000 Jewish shops across Germany on the night of Nov. 9, 1938, leaving a trail of broken glass which gave the pogrom its name. </P>
