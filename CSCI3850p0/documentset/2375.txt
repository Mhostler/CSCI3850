<DATELINE>PENSACOLA, Fla.(Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A Florida jury Wednesday needed only 20 minutes to convict anti-abortion extremist Paul Hill for last summer's murder of a doctor and his unarmed escort outside a local women's clinic. </P>
<P> The panel of six men and six women found Hill guilty on two counts of first-degree murder, one count of attempted first-degree murder and one count of firing a loaded weapon into an occupied vehicle. </P>
<P> On Thursday, jurors will determine whether Hill's actions merit a sentence of death in Florida's electric chair. </P>
<P> The recommendation is not binding on Escambia County Circuit Judge Frank Bell, who will sentence Hill at a later date. </P>
<P> Hill, acting as his own attorney, made no closing statements to jurors just as he had declined to cross-examine any of the witnesses called to the stand since testimony began late Monday afternoon. </P>
<P> He showed little emotion as the verdict was read. </P>
<P> Women's rights activists used Wednesday's guilty verdict to call for a government crackdown on anti-abortion extremists. </P>
<P> ``Paul Hill is only one actor in this very bad play,'' said Patricia Ireland, president of the National Organization for Women (NOW), who has been monitoring the proceedings all week. </P>
<P> The slain escort and his widow were both NOW members. </P>
<P> ``Having him off the streets and behind bars is only one step.'' </P>
<P> Hill was convicted of murdering Dr John Britton, 69, and his escort, retired Air Force Lt. Col. James Barrett, outside Pensacola's Ladies Center on July 29. </P>
<P> Barrett's 68-year-old widow, June, was wounded in the attack. </P>
<P> Families on both sides of the trial left the courthouse quickly after Wednesday's proceedings ended without speaking to the media. </P>
<P> The Rev. David Trosch, a Roman Catholic priest who like Hill advocates the use of deadly force against abortion providers, appeared to be choked with emotion following the verdict. </P>
<P> ``He's chosen his method for making a statement to the world ... we just have to play it out to see if he's right as far as motivating people to action,'' Trosch said. </P>
<P> Hill supporters have said that the former Presbyterian minister would welcome death in the electric chair as a form of martydom. </P>
<P> Michael Hirsh, a Hill supporter and former lawyer for televangelist Pat Robertson, raised the possibility of an appeal on grounds that Bell erred by barring Hill from a defense based on justifiable homicide. </P>
<P> But Hirsh said he had not yet spoken to Hill about the verdict. </P>
<P> Court officials said the jury began deliberations at about 3 p.m. local time and reported reaching a verdict by 3:20. </P>
<P> The verdict followed more than two days of testimony by 27 witnesses, about a dozen of whom identified Hill as the man who fired seven shots from a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun into the Barrett's parked Nissan pickup truck. </P>
<P> An hour earlier, assistant state attorney Jim Murray had branded him a murder who considered himself above the law. </P>
<P> ``He demonstrated in the most graphic, violent kind of way that he doesn't believe he's bound by any laws with which he does not agree,'' the chief prosecutor told jurors in his closing argument. </P>
<P> ``He carried out what he had been preaching for the past year -- execute! -- execute a person with whom he did not agree on a matter of constitutional law.'' </P>
<P> Murray made his remarks standing next to a large color photograph of an anti-abortion sign confiscated by police from Hill's Pensacola home shortly after the murderers. </P>
<P> The sign read: ``Execute Murderers, Abortionists, Accessories?'' </P>
<P> Earlier in the day, June Barrett identified Hill as the man who had fired on her, her husband and Dr Britton outside the Ladies Center. </P>
<P> ``I said, 'Oh, my God, he is shooting','' she recalled during 15 minutes of testimony that was interrupted by tears. </P>
<P> ``I heard the first three and they sounded so loud. Boom! Boom! Boom!,'' added Barrett, a stocky woman with short gray hair. </P>
<P> ``I looked through the seats there and I saw this drip, drip, drip of blood drops. </P>
<P> ``I kind of whispered 'Doc are you OK?'. I opened my eyes a little wider, turned my head and said, 'No, he's not OK,''' she said. </P>
<P> The widow, who was wounded in the assault, rolled up the sleeve of her left arm to show the jury where a shotgun pellet had pierced her limb and struck her breast. </P>
<P> David Williams, a Florida state police firearms expert, said Wednesday that Hill was armed with 30 rounds of ammunition. </P>
