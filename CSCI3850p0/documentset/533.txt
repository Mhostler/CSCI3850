<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  An advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration on Monday opened an investigation into the addictiveness of nicotine as a step toward possible FDA regulation of the nicotine level of cigarettes. </P>
<P> The Drug Abuse Advisory Committee heard testimony that smokers who used a nicotine nasal spray to wean themselves off cigarettes also had difficulty stopping use of the spray. </P>
<P> On Tuesday, the panel of outside medical experts will hear testimony on the relationship of nicotine and smoking. </P>
<P> FDA Commissioner David Kessler has asked Congress to spell out his authority to regulate cigarettes as a drug, hinting that if he moved it could be to gradually ratchet down the nicotine level in cigarettes, rather than ban them outright. </P>
<P> The panel, following a day-long hearing, said the spray made by the Swedish firm Pharmacia AB was useful, but any agency approval of it should include some restrictions. </P>
<P> It recommended that the spray should be dispensed by prescription only and that stiff warnings accompany its sale. </P>
<P> Committee members indicated the FDA should bring the drug before the panel again soon to consider a recommendation whether it be approved to help wean people off cigarettes. </P>
<P> The panel only considered the spray's abuse potential and not its effectiveness, although it heard testimony that about 25 percent of users stopped smoking after a year of spray use. </P>
<P> But the studies also found that many spray users had trouble stopping its use after a year of use. </P>
<P> One reported after a year of ``using (it) regularly every day with bursts of extra use when anxious or agitated'' and another said at 12 months she was ``afraid to quit.'' </P>
<P> Harriet DeWit, a researcher at the University of Chicago, told the panel that the spray's abuse potential was likely higher than other nicotine replacements, such as nicotine gum or patches, ``but lower than cigarettes. </P>
<P> An FDA scientist, Michael Klein, told the panel that use of the spray could potentially be used as tobacco substitute in ''smoke-free'' buildings and elsewhere and that unrestricted access could result in abuse by minors. </P>
<P> Karl-Olav Fagerstrom, a Pharmacia official, said the spray was dependence producing, but ``I don't think nasal spray will fit into the common definition or criteria of abuse.'' </P>
<P> Other FDA officials said many drugs have the potential for abuse, but their effectiveness far outhweighed their risk. </P>
<P> Later this year, the panel is to consider whether to recommend that the FDA approve the spray for marketing. </P>
<P> Kessler has said that cigarette makers may be controlling the nicotine levels to keep smokers hooked, although the makers deny this. </P>
<P> But he said the technology may exist to allow the industry to adjust nicotine levels, adding ``why do the nicotine levels found in the vast majority of cigarettes remain at addictive levels? </P>
<P> He has some Congressional support for regulating cigarettes, but there is equally strong opposition from tobacco makers and tobacco farmers. </P>
