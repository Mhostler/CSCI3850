<P>  Iran's head of judiciary has hinted that a U.S. citizen detained since 1992 and accused of having links with foreign spies could be pardoned or have his sentence reduced. </P>
<P> Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi was answering a question at a news conference Saturday in Tehran on the fate of Milton Meyer, a long-time resident of Iran who Iranian officials said was arrested because he had links with foreign intelligence agencies and had sold sensitive economic information. </P>
<P> ``There is the possibility of reducing the sentence or pardoning of anyone detained for any crime. Of course, there should be a justification for that which could be raised either by the detainee or by the prosecutor,'' Iranian newspapers quoted Yazdi as saying. </P>
<P> The papers did not say when Meyer was tried or what sentence he had received. </P>
<P> Meyer, a businessman from Texas who was 58-years-old when he was arrested in 1992, is married to an Iranian and has lived in Iran since before the 1979 Islamic revolution. </P>
