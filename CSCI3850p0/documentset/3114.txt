<P>  Proposals by former CIA director Robert Gates to streamline the Central Intelligence Agency and transfer some of its functions to other government agencies have attracted the attention of senior administration officials, the Washington Post reported Saturday. </P>
<P> Gates told the paper in an interview, ``The idea is to have a leaner, more focused and tougher CIA.'' He said the Defense Department received five-sixths of the intelligence budget and should therefore do more of the work. </P>
<P> Gate's ideas were described by one senior White House official as ``interesting'' and ``reflective of some of our thinking,'' the paper said. </P>
<P> The National Security Council is currently preparing its own plans for intelligence in the coming year. </P>
<P> There has been speculation in Washington in recent weeks that President Clinton may replace CIA Director James Woolsey as part of a general overhaul of his cabinet in coming weeks. </P>
<P> Gates' plan calls for creation of a director of military intelligence and transferring to that four-star officer and the Pentagon all of the CIA's current responsibilities for analysis of foreign weapons and military force levels. </P>
<P> He said this would cut down on duplication. </P>
<P> However, he believes the CIA should continue to do its own analysis concerning nuclear, chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction, the paper said. </P>
<P> Gates' proposal would also transfer responsibility for paramilitary operations to the appropriate military services, from the CIA's covert wing. </P>
<P> Former Defense Secretary Les Aspin, who will head a bipartisan presidential commission on the intelligence community in the post-Cold War world, said some of Gates' ideas made sense, but would be difficult to implement, the paper said. </P>
