<P>  New York police have arrested a 22-year-old Irishman for falsely claiming he planted a deadly IRA bomb that killed two children and injured 50 people in England in 1993. </P>
<P> Police spokesman Joe Valiquette said Wednesday that John William O'Rourke was charged with making false statements to police after walking into a Manhattan police station and ''confessing.'' </P>
<P> Valiquette said the Federal Bureau of Investigation had checked with British police to see if his story, that he had placed a time bomb in a trash bin on a street in the northern English city of Warrington, could be authenticated. </P>
<P> Later Wednesday, police in the English county of Cheshire confirmed the FBI's assessment that O'Rourke's ``confession'' was false. </P>
<P> O'Rourke ``seemed to be in control of his senses'' when he walked into the police station, Valiquette said. When he later retracted his story he explained he had been threatened with ''bodily harm'' by two people if he did not confess to the bombing. </P>
<P> The March 20, 1993 Irish Republican Army bomb in Warrington killed two small boys and injured more than 50 other people. It prompted a huge anti-IRA public backlash both in mainland Britain and Ireland. </P>
<P> Valiquette said they did not know O'Rourke's home town, but said he had family in County Wicklow. He came to the United States last April. </P>
<P> He was being held at Manhattan's Metropolitan Corrections Center pending a hearing on Friday. </P>
