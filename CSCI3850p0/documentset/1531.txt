<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Danish Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen lost his majority in parliament in a general election Wednesday, but will try to reform his center-left coalition. </P>
<P> Rasmussen's coalition lost one of its members, the small Christian People's Party, in the election, but will be able to retain a working majority in parliament with the informal support of two leftist parties. </P>
<P> ``I will seek to form a government together with the Radical Liberals and the Center Democrats, (the two remaining coalition partners)'' the Social Democrat Rasmussen said late Wednesday evening. </P>
<P> On Wednesday The Social Democrats lost nine seats to 62, the Radical Liberals gained one to hold eight and the Center Democrats lost four to hold five, giving Rasmussen's coalition 75 seats in the 179-seat parliament. </P>
<P> The opposition grouping led by former Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen's Liberal Party won 80 seats overall, with Ellemann-Jensen recording a personal triumph by gaining 12 new seats to make his party the second biggest in parliament with 42 seats. </P>
<P> Although the opposition center-right grouping has more seats than Rasmussen's coalition, the 51-year-old prime minister has the active, if informal support of two parties described broadly as leftist. </P>
<P> The Socialist People Party, a splinter group from the defunct Danish Communist Party, won 13 seats, down two, while the Unity Party, a newcomer to parliament, stormed into parliament with six seats. </P>
<P> The Unity Party are a mixed bag of anti-European activists, environmentalists and traditional left-wingers with a power-base in the ``hippy'' commune of Copenhagen known as Christiania. </P>
<P> Rasmussen said he would present his resignation to Queen Margarethe, Denmark's monarch, at the start of a formal and complex process Rasmussen said could end with him forming a new government next week. </P>
<P> Political analysts said the end result of Wednesday's election would be a broad-based centrist government looking to conservative parties for support on keeping the country's economic prosperity alive. </P>
<P> Rasmussen would also need the support of the two leftist groups to initially give him enough votes to be elected prime minister and then on environmental and social issues. </P>
<P> ``We intend to cooperate (with Rasmussen),'' Ellemann-Jensen told Danish television. </P>
<P> Economists urged Rasmussen to cooperate with conservatives in parliament, saying financial markets would react well to news that the prime minister was seeking consensus with parties that believed in running a tight fiscal policy. </P>
<P> The three-week long election campaign focused on who is best suited to manage a booming economy, forecast to grow 4.4 percent this year, and bring down unemployment, still at a record 12.5 percent. </P>
