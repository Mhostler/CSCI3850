<P>  The Clinton administration has prepared provisional plans for up to $5 billion in military aid to the Bosnian government should it decide to withdraw from the international arms embargo, ABC television said Friday. </P>
<P> It said classified reports made available to members of Congress this week showed the administration had prepared two options -- one involving tanks, artillery and years of training, and the other restricted to anti-tank and anti-artillery weapons and shorter training. </P>
<P> There was no immediate comment from the Pentagon, which has denied media reports in Europe that it is providing military help to the Muslim-led Bosnian army. </P>
<P> The administration opposes a unilateral end to the embargo, saying this would damage U.S. relations with European allies who have peacekeeping forces on the ground in Bosnia and could undermine efforts to sustain international embargos elsewhere, like Iraq. </P>
<P> The United States last week ended its participation in the international operation to implement the embargo on the Bosnian Muslims, drawing criticism from France and Britain, which said this would mean an end to the U.N. humanitarian operations there.. </P>
<P> Largely because of pressure from Congress, which believes the Muslim government should be backed in its fight against the Bosnian Serbs, it is seeking to persuade a reluctant U.N. Security Council to end the embargo early next year. </P>
<P> ABC, which did not give a source for its story, said the options being presented to Congress were for programs valued at $3-4 billion or $5 billion. </P>
