<P>  The U.N. Special Commission in charge of dismantling Iraq's war machine threatened Wednesday to close down operations by February unless adequate funding was available. </P>
<P> In a report to the Security Council, Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the commission, said funds were drying up and therefore arms inspection teams would wind down their work, beginning in December, and close all operations by Feb. 15. </P>
<P> ``The financial situation is now so serious, and there are no signs of new funds becoming available, that the Commission has had to, out of a sense of financial responsibity, start contingency planning for the incremental closure of its operations,'' Ekeus said in the report. </P>
<P> The finances of the commission, which costs about $2 million a month, are complicated but several diplomats hoped the United States would make sure funding continued. They believed Ekeus' plea was meant to provoke nations holding Iraq's frozen assets to contribute to an escrow fund, which Washington would supplement with matching funds. </P>
<P> The commission, created by the Security Council in April 1991 is to supervise the destruction of Iraq's nuclear, chemical, biological and ballistic missiles, which it has done. It is now checking data to determine the extent of past programs and setting up a monitoring system to make sure Baghad cannot require dangerous weapons. </P>
<P> Serious Security Council consideration to lift sanctions on Iraq's oil exports, is tied to the commission's completing its work, which is not expected for about six months. </P>
<P> Ekeus timed his report for the council's regular review of sanctions, scheduled for Monday. But the 15-member body will not make any move toward lifting them. </P>
<P> However, Iraq has indicated that it may formally recognise Kuwait and its borders, a move that all council members have demanded before any sanctions could be eased. But this gesture, by itself, will not be enough to lift the oil embargo, envoys said. </P>
<P> The Special Commission was to have been financed with monies out of oil sales. But with the embargo still in place and Baghdad's refusal to sell small quanities of oil under heavy council monitoring, such funding has not been forthcoming. </P>
<P> Instead the commission has been funded by monies from Iraqi frozen oil assets placed in a U.N. escrow account and voluntary contributions. The United States has offered to match any funds from its frozen Iraqi assets but contributions have dried up, a commission spokesman said. </P>
<P> ``There is no indication of money coming in at the moment,'' a commission spokesman said. </P>
