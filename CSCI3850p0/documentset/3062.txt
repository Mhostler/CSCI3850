<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The CIA said Wednesday it has agreed to settle charges of gender discrimination by one of the agency's senior female spies in a deal valued at $410,000 by the spy's attorney. </P>
<P> The complaint, filed under seal in federal court in August by ``Jane Doe Thompson,'' portrayed the agency as rife with womanizing and drinking and generally hostile to women. </P>
<P> CIA Director James Woolsey said in a statement Wednesday that he agreed to settle the case brought by ``Jane Doe Thompson,'' but that the settlement ``does not concede the assertions of gender discrimination Ms. Thompson has made against the agency or its individual officers.'' </P>
<P> A CIA statement said Woolsey's goal was ``to achieve closure on Ms. Thompson's claims ... and put this case behind us.'' </P>
<P> The CIA is separately negotiating to avert a class-action lawsuit by almost one-third of all the female case officers in its clandestine division, who banded together to allege that the agency has discriminated against women. </P>
<P> Victoria Toensing, Thompson's attorney and a former Justice Department official, said the lawsuit alleged both gender discrimination and violations of Thompson's constitutional rights. </P>
<P> ``The government has agreed to pay her $410,000. The facts speak for themselves,'' she said. </P>
<P> Toensing said Thompson would be free to make her identity known once the settlement was finalized. Both sides have accepted an agreement in principle and the deal should be sealed soon. It also calls for Thompson to retire, she said. </P>
<P> Thompson has been identified by numerous press reports as Janine Brookner, the first female station chief in Latin America and a 21-year veteran of the agency. The reports said Brookner's ordeal began when she was sent to clean up the agency's operation in Jamaica. </P>
<P> The case has been shrouded in secrecy, but a public brief by Toensing painted a bleak picture of women's opportunities and working environment at the CIA. </P>
<P> ``Drinking and sexual prowess by agency males in high positions are well known, often countenanced and, if addressed at all, engender medical, not disciplinary, treatment,'' the brief said. </P>
<P> ``There has not been a station to which plaintiff has been assigned where senior male officers did not drink and womanize and create an adverse work environment for women.'' </P>
<P> According to ``Thompson's'' complaint, she filed a complaint against her deputy four years ago for ``beating his wife to the point of strangulation,'' but the deputy then initiated an inspector general investigation of ``Thompson'' herself. </P>
<P> She was then offered a promotion in 1991, but it was withdrawn after another male employee ``stated he would not work for a woman,'' the lawsuit contends. </P>
<P> ``Thompson'' also charged that the CIA failed to investigate her reports of other instances of misconduct by male employees in her office, including drunkenness, sexual misconduct and one employee's threat to kill a security guard. </P>
<P> Woolsey conceded in testimony before Congress in September that the agency's progress in hiring and promoting women and minorities has been mixed. He said the heads of six of the 13 staffs that report to him would be women by October, but there were still too few women and minorities in top jobs. </P>
<P> ``Over the last year, I have set forth an ambitious agenda for change at CIA -- in counterintelligence, and ... in the culture of the CIA,'' Woolsey said in Wednesday's statement. </P>
<P> ``The goals to which we are committed cannot be achieved overnight. But we will succeed.'' </P>
<P> Woolsey said he was committed to ensuring an environment of fairness for all CIA employees. ``I am committed to this not only because it is the right thing to do for employees, but because I believe we do our mission far better when we draw on the talents of a diverse work force,'' he said. </P>
