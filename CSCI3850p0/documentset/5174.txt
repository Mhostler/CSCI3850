<P>  A Kurdish separatist leader Friday accused the United States of secretly helping Turkey in its military push against Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq. </P>
<P> ``We emphasize the clandestine support given by the U.S. to this operation and the massacres,'' said Abdullah Ocalan, general secretary of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). </P>
<P> ``We want the United States government to withdraw its support from this dirty war and provide opportunities for political solution,'' Ocalan said in a statement released by the Kurdistan Information Center in London. </P>
<P> Turkey launched its military campaign into northern Iraq five days ago in an attempt to root out PKK guerrillas, who use bases there to attack targets inside Turkish territory. </P>
<P> ``We call on progressive, democratic, international public opinion to oppose these massacres and this occupation of south Kurdistan,'' Ocalan said in his statement. </P>
<P> Turkish officials Friday denied Kurdish reports of air raids on the village of Dergele. Earlier they had insisted there had been no civilian casualties during the week's campaign. </P>
<P> Secretary of State Warren Christopher said this week that Washington had urged Ankara to limit its incursion and to respect human rights and international law. </P>
<P> But President Clinton has also expressed ``understanding for Turkey's need to deal decisively'' with the rebels, angering the PKK leadership. </P>
