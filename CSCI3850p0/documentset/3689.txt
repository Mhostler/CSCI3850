<P>  Stepping up its campaign to thwart any easing of sanctions against Iraq, the United States presented evidence to the Security Council Tuesday that Baghdad was holding on to thousands of items of military and civilian equipment looted from Kuwait during the Gulf War. </P>
<P> The data, including satellite photographs, was circulated by U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright as the council was about to conduct a 60-day review of the sanctions it imposed on Baghdad shortly after its August 1990 invasion of Kuwait. </P>
<P> The sanctions, which include a ban on Iraqi oil sales, have remained intact since they were first enacted and no change is expected at the review scheduled for Thursday. </P>
<P> But Russia and France, supported by some other council members, have been active in urging acknowledgment of Iraqi cooperation with a U.N. special commission which oversees the scrapping of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and monitoring of its weapons potential. They argue that lifting of the oil embargo is linked to weapons demands only and not to other requirements. </P>
<P> The United States and Britain take a tougher line toward any easing of sanctions, saying Baghdad must demonstrate a pattern of compliance with all council resolutions. </P>
<P> U.S. spokesman James Rubin told reporters Iraq had retained some 9,000 items of military equipment, ranging from armored personnel carriers, trucks and jeeps to TOW and Frog 7 missiles, plus some 6,000 civilian items. Baghdad should have returned them under a 1991 council resolution. </P>
<P> The military list included more than 4,000 TOW missiles as well as an estimated 2,000 trucks and more than 1,750 jeeps and Land Rovers. </P>
<P> Rubin said Iraq used some of the equipment during a military buildup last October which threatened the Kuwaiti border. He referred particularly to some 200 Russian-made armored personnel carriers. </P>
<P> He said Iraq's failure to return the looted items long after the Gulf War raised serious questions about its peaceful intentions and credibility when the council reviewed the sanctions. </P>
<P> Albright's presentation followed a briefing for council members by Rolf Ekeus, executive chairman of the U.N. special committee on Iraqi arms. </P>
<P> At the time of the last review in mid-November, the United States circulated satellite photographs which it said showed Iraq was spending at least half a billion dollars on ``literally dozens of opulent new palaces'' for the use of President Saddam Hussein and his family. It said this contrasted with Baghdad's pleas that the sanctions were causing great hardship for ordinary Iraqis. </P>
<P> Calling Iraq ``an equal opportunity thief,'' Rubin said the stolen equipment included items which Kuwait had acquired from the United States, Russia, Egypt and other countries. </P>
<P> As an example of the way the data was pieced together, he said: ``Before they invaded Kuwait, Iraq had only 25 such (Frog) launchers. In a picture, we see 29 at a single site...  ``One tries to piece together what they had before, what they have now, where it's located, and therefore make a judgment as to how much they should return.'' </P>
<P> Civilian or dual-use items included ambulances, buses, pickup trucks, motorcycles, forklifts and radio sets. </P>
<P> Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz of Iraq is currently in New York lobbying council members to ease or lift the sanctions. </P>
<P> He has been meeting them at the residence of Iraq's U.N. ambassador but was expected to see council President Emilio Cardenas of Argentina at the United Nations Wednesday. </P>
