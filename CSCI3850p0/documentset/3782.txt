<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A blood spot found in O.J. Simpson's white Ford Bronco shows a mixture of DNA from Simpson and the two people he is charged with murdering, Newsweek reports in its upcoming edition. </P>
<P> Simpson has pleaded not guilty to murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman, who were stabbed to death outside her townhouse on the night of June 12. </P>
<P> The magazine in its Jan. 23 issue quotes an unidentified source saying DNA analysis shows virtually all the blood in the Bronco matches that of the former football player, with the exception of one spot that contains a mixture of blood from Simpson, his former wife and Goldman. </P>
<P> The issue is available on newsstands Monday. </P>
<P> A jury has been picked for the Los Angeles trial and opening statements in the case are scheduled to start Thursday. </P>
<P> According to Newsweek, Simpson's lawyers will argue that given the violent nature of the crime and the small amount of blood found in the Bronco and Simpson's home, that he couldn't have committed the murders. </P>
<P> The defense team will also assert that not one but two sets of footprints led away from the bodies -- neither of which they believe match Simpson's shoe size, the report said. </P>
<P> According to the magazine, the defense may question the character of Simpson's murdered wife by accusing her of having befriended drug abusers and wanting to cheat on her taxes. </P>
<P> The defense will also argue that somebody planted another potentially crucial piece of evidence -- a sock with Nicole's blood that detectives allege to have found in Simpson's bedroom, the magazine said, quoting an unidentified defense source. </P>
<P> The magazine said Simpson had attempted to halt bitter infighting between two of his high-profile lawyers, Robert Shapiro and F. Lee Bailey, by reminding them that he is being tried for a double murder. </P>
<P> And in a Newsweek telephone poll of 757 American adults Jan. 12-13, 60 percent said reported allegations of spousal abuse by Simpson are relevant and should be presented to the jury. </P>
<P> The poll, which appears in the same issue and which has a four point margin of error, also found that 75 percent of those asked thought the courts and legal system have been fair so far to the former football great. </P>
