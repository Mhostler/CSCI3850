<P>  China said Thursday it opposed any visit by Taiwan's president to the United States and the island's admission to the United Nations. </P>
<P> ``We are opposed to Lee Teng-hui visiting the United States in any form,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told a regular weekly press briefing. </P>
<P> ``This is our consistent principled position,'' Shen said. He warned that a visit by President Lee to the United States would drastically affect Sino-U.S. relations. </P>
<P> Lee has received an invitation to visit his alma mater, Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, and Taipei has urged Washington not to veto the trip, Taiwan's mass-circulation United Daily reported this week. </P>
<P> Lee, as president of what China regards as a breakaway province, has previously been refused a visa to receive an honorary degree from Cornell. </P>
<P> Beijing's communist rulers have sought regularly to isolate the island's Nationalist government since they won the 1949 civil war in China. </P>
<P> Shen repeated China's opposition to Taiwan joining the World Trade Organization before Beijing or the United Nations. </P>
<P> ``The United Nations is an inter-governmental organization composed of sovereign states. Taiwan is but a province of China and is not entitled to join the United Nations in any form,'' Shen said. </P>
<P> Beijing took Taipei's seat in the United Nations in 1971. </P>
