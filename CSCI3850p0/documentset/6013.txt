<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, April 25 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  An Indian crusader has opened a boarding school for prostitutes' children, launching a novel campaign to lift them from the squalor of brothels into life's mainstream. </P>
<P> Khairati Lal Bhola, head of the Bharatiya Patita Uddhar Sabha (BPUS) -- Indian Society for Uplifting the Downtrodden -- opened the school this month in Shivdaspur, northern India. </P>
<P> ``We will give them milk, bread, an education and a chance to be normal children,'' he said. ``It is the world's first school for prostitutes' children, and it is only a start.'' </P>
<P> BPUS plans at least one school like the one in Shivdaspur, near the temple city of Varanasi, in each of India's 1,100 red-light areas, he said in a recent interview with Reuters. </P>
<P> About 160 of India's estimated 5.2 million sex workers' children are enrolled in the primary school, which is partly funded by the central government. </P>
<P> Bhola, peaking in New Delhi, said the children would be moved to government-run schools after the fifth standard, and treated like normal 10-year-olds. </P>
<P> BPUS, whose 200 members include prostitutes from eight Indian states, plans schools to train sex workers in embroidery, tailoring and other skills that provide an economic alternative to trade in flesh. </P>
<P> ``Prostitution is a curse of poverty,'' said Bhola, a balding, 67-year-old who wears white hand-spun cotton and thick horn-rimmed glasses. ``If a starving woman can sell her daughter to pimps for 15 kg (33 lb) of rice, she does.'' </P>
<P> He said parents commonly sell their daughters to village pimps for 5,000-10,000 rupees ($160-320), who in turn receive about 30,000 rupees ($1,000) from brothel owners. ``The price depends on her age, her beauty and virginity,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``How can she escape once a brothel-owner who has paid that kind of money for her? She is a guarded money-spinner.'' </P>
<P> The group has rescued 473 prostitutes from brothels, he said. It has also arranged marriages for 18 -- a tough task in India's rigidly structured and caste-conscious society. </P>
<P> Bhola said he founded BPUS in 1984 after he saw pimps mistreating impoverished prostitutes in Delhi's notorious G.B. Road red-light district while passing by with his wife. </P>
<P> ``There are about 76,000 call girls in Delhi's 86 brothels, at least 10 million throughout India,'' he said. </P>
<P> Despite a government grant of 109,100 rupees ($3,500) for the Shivdaspur school, BPUS is struggling. </P>
<P> ``It will cost us 450,000 rupees ($15,000) a year for 40 mothers and their children,'' Bhola said. ``We are kept alive by donations. If each Indian were to contribute one rupee (3 cents), just one rupee, that would mean 900 million rupees ($30 million).'' </P>
