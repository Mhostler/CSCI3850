<P>  The United States aircraft carrier George Washington arrived in the Gulf Saturday as part of the U.S. military buildup in the region, U.S. military officials said. </P>
<P> Navy Spokesman Commander T. McCreary told Reuters that the carrier had about 80 aircraft on board. </P>
<P> A U.S. military official said that the carrier's aircraft would begin flights later Saturday in ``Operation Vigilant Warrior.'' </P>
<P> He declined to give details about the number or types of aircraft which would take part or where they would fly but said the operation was intended to deter Iraqi aggression. </P>
<P> He said the operation complements French, British and U.S. warplanes already conducting flights over southern Iraq to ensure Iraqi planes do not fly beyond the 32nd parallel. </P>
<P> ``We're not just worried about flights below 32. We are concerned about the ground force buildup in southern Iraq. While some of these forces have moved back they have not moved back to their original positions, so we are continuing to watch closely,'' he said. </P>
