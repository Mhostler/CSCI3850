<P>  President Boris Yeltsin said Tuesday Russia had to resolve its problems with Ukraine immediately but a special meeting of senior Cabinet ministers failed to overcome the key obstacle -- division of the Black Sea Fleet. </P>
<P> ``Today there is one issue -- how our relationship with Ukraine is to continue,'' Yeltsin said in opening remarks filmed by independent Russian television station NTV before talks behind closed doors in the Kremlin. </P>
<P> ``We cannot let the problems keep piling up, and we must define our position and take a decision today,'' Yeltsin said. </P>
<P> A statement released by the Russian leader's press service after the meeting suggested the participants had made no concessions on the biggest stumbling block in relations between the two former Soviet countries -- the Black Sea Fleet. </P>
<P> Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev told a news conference that Yeltsin would not go to Kiev to sign a long-delayed friendship treaty until the fleet issue had been solved. </P>
<P> The RIA news agency quoted the statement as saying Yeltsin and his ministers favored ``special friendly relations'' with Ukraine, including ``strategic partnership'' as an important element.'' </P>
<P> But NTV quoted the document as saying that such relations would only become a reality once the fleet issue had been solved to Russia's satisfaction. </P>
<P> Russia and Ukraine have been fighting over the fleet since the breakup of the Soviet Union. The two sides have agreed how to split up its aging 300 vessels but argue over where each side is to base its share. </P>
<P> The Itar-Tass news agency quoted Kremlin sources as saying the situation in the Crimean peninsula -- part of Ukraine but where Russian-speakers make up the majority -- was also on the agenda. </P>
<P> In March, Ukraine made Crimea directly responsible to Kiev and eliminated the post of regional president. </P>
<P> Present at the Kremlin meeting were Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets, Kozyrev and Federal Security Service chief Sergei Stepashin. </P>
<P> The head of the Black Sea Fleet, Felix Gromov, and several other ministers also took part in the talks, NTV said. </P>
