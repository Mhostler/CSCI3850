<P>  Mortars wounded four people in Sarajevo's old town Wednesday as U.N. peacekeepers sought a review of their role after acknowledging they were impotent to stop such attacks without air support. </P>
<P> U.N. officials, uneasy after failing to punish the Bosnian Serbs for shelling civilians, said the Security Council needed to compare the U.N. mission's ambitious goals and the limited means it has to fulfil them. </P>
<P> ``We need a serious debate on what people expect of us,'' said United Nations spokesman Colum Murphy. ``What does the international community want this mission to do?'' </P>
<P> Peacekeeping commanders were sharply criticised by the United States for ruling out NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serbs who fired shells into a Sarajevo suburb Sunday killing 11 people and wounding 40. </P>
<P> A chorus of senior American officials said NATO air power should have been used against the Serbs. </P>
<P> U.S. Defense Secretary, William Perry said that the recent Serb shellings of Sarajevo and other ``Safe Areas'' warranted an effective response from NATO. </P>
<P> A State Department spokeswoman said: ``We support measures, including the use of NATO air power which we believe can demonstrate to the ... Serbs that their actions in violation of the safe areas of Bihac and Sarajevo have consequences.'' </P>
<P> U.N. commanders in Sarajevo requested NATO air strikes on Serb positions after Sunday's attack but were overruled by U.N. special envoy Yasushi Akashi who feared the political cost. </P>
<P> Air raids after the U.N. failed to stop the Croatian army retaking Serb-held Western Slavonia would make the U.N. appear to victimise the Serbs and undermine their political moderates, Akashi aides said. </P>
<P> Wednesday's mortar attack on Sarajevo was the latest in a series that indicate growing boldness by the Serbs who are ignoring U.N. resolutions that ban heavy weapons from around the city. </P>
<P> Fighting broke out between ethnic Serbs and Croats along the north Bosnian corridor which links Serb territories in the west and east. </P>
<P> Serbs said the Croats shelled the corridor from their Orasje enclave. Croat sources said Orasje was intensively shelled by Serbs who killed two civilians. </P>
<P> Tensions rose in Eastern Croatia where rebel Serb and Croatian army forces exchanged small arms and mortar fire on Wednesday on the edge of a rebel Serb enclave. </P>
<P> The clash is the first since a fresh buildup of forces on both sides in the area followed Croatia's successful capture of Western Slavonia, another enclave, last week. </P>
<P> U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali was expected in Paris Wednesday to meet French leaders to discuss the current situation in former Yugoslavia. </P>
