<P>  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher fell ill Thursday during a U.S.-Canada summit and went to a hospital in Ottawa for treatment, White House spokesman Mike McCurry said. </P>
<P> ``He wasn't feeling particularly well,'' McCurry told reporters travelling with the American delegation in Ottawa. ''He went to the hospital.'' </P>
<P> McCurry at first said he thought Christopher had left the hospital, but U.S. officials said later they weren't sure and were checking to see if he was still at Civic Hospital. A spokeswoman for the hospital had no immediate information. </P>
<P> McCurry said Christopher would skip a gala dinner scheduled for Thursday evening in Ottawa with President Clinton and Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, but he would rejoin the schedule Friday, the second and final day of the U.S.-Canada summit. </P>
<P> McCurry declined to say what Christopher's symptoms were, but gave no indication that there was anything seriously wrong. The secretary of state, who is 69, showed no apparent signs of illness earlier when he attended a speech by Clinton in the Canadian parliament. </P>
<P> Christopher has a grueling schedule with a lot of travel, but has been in generally good health and jogs almost daily. </P>
