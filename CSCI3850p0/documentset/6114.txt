<DATELINE>TUNCELI, Turkey (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Turkish planes bombed a Kurdish rebel stronghold, almost inaccessible to ground forces, in eastern Turkey for the second day running Friday, witnesses said. </P>
<P> Three planes bombed Alibogazi ravine, a Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) hideout in rugged Tunceli province, Friday morning and Thursday afternoon, villagers in the area told Reuters by telephone. </P>
<P> There were no immediate reports of casualties. </P>
<P> Twenty-five thousand troops tried to storm the ravine, a 5,000-feet -deep gash cutting for 20 miles through the mountains, earlier this month but only partly penetrated it, the military said at the time. </P>
<P> Alibogazi, whose narrow top hinders air raids, was the scene of major battle in the 1930s when the army crushed a Kurdish uprising in eastern Turkey. </P>
<P> More than 15,000 people have been killed in the PKK's 10-year-old fight for a Kurdish state in southeast Turkey. </P>
<P> The army has been on a big drive against the PKK in Tunceli since late March in parallel with its anti-rebel operation in northern Iraq. </P>
