<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A housekeeper who may be able to provide O.J. Simpson with an alibi on the night of his ex-wife's murder was in hiding Saturday after tearfully promising not to flee the country before testifying Monday. </P>
<P> Following a day filled with dizzying legal twists and turns, Judge Lance Ito late Friday ordered Rosa Lopez to delay plans to leave for her native El Salvador and instead take the stand as a defense witness. </P>
<P> Lopez, who had expressed fear for her life and complained of harassment by the news media, pleaded with Ito to find her a place to stay where she would not be pursued by camera crews, and the judge vowed to do his best. </P>
<P> ``And I'll do my best for you, your honor,'' Lopez said through a Spanish-language interpreter before slipping out of sight with her lawyer. </P>
<P> In a rare legal maneuver, Ito will give Simpson's ``dream team'' of defense attorneys a chance to interrupt the prosecution's case against Simpson and present early testimony that they hope will help exonerate the football legend. </P>
<P> There were also major developments behind the scenes. Ito tentatively decided to dismiss a black juror after the man failed to report a past incident of domestic abuse on his jury questionnaire, the Los Angeles Times reported Saturday, citing unnamed sources. </P>
<P> The 46-year-old man created a stir when he wore a San Francisco 49ers cap -- a sign of support for the team Simpson played his final season with -- on a visit to the murder scene and lingered over photos inside Simpson's mansion. </P>
<P> Defense attorneys say Lopez -- who worked as a live-in maid for Simpson's next-door neighbor -- will testify that she saw his white Ford Bronco parked at his estate at the time prosecutors claim Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman were being stabbed to death outside her Brentwood townhouse. </P>
<P> During Friday's all-day court session, Lopez -- dressed in a purple jump suit -- said she wanted to leave for her homeland Saturday because her life had been ruined by the media glare, she had lost her job and had become estranged from her daughter. She has lived in Los Angeles for 27 years. </P>
<P> ``I want to leave. All these reporters are destroying my life,'' she said as she wiped tears from her eyes. ``I don't go out anymore. I'm afraid of so many things.'' </P>
<P> Alarmed at the prospect of losing Lopez forever, defense attorneys asked that she be allowed to testify immediately. </P>
<P> But prosecutors insisted that Lopez was bluffing. With the jury absent from the courtroom, she was subjected to withering cross-examination in which she contradicted herself again and again and raised doubts about her credibility. </P>
<P> Among other things, she at first said she had made reservations to fly to El Salvador Saturday night but then, when prosecutor Christopher Darden said the airline had no seat booked for her, admitted that she had lied. </P>
<P> She said she had immediate fears for her safety and planned to leave the United States for good but was then confronted with evidence that she had booked a roundtrip ticket and was not due to leave until sometime in March. </P>
<P> Even Ito seemed struck by the inconsistencies in Lopez' testimony, commenting at one point to Darden: ``It is a contradictory record. You're right about that.'' </P>
<P> But Ito ultimately decided that the risk was simply too high that Lopez would not show up when called to testify -- perhaps months later -- when the defense starts presenting its case. </P>
<P> As the court session dragged into the evening hours, he first ordered both sides to prepare to immediately question her on videotape. </P>
<P> Minutes later, Ito reversed himself and ordered sheriff's deputies to bring the jury -- which had been given the day off -- to hear testimony that could last until midnight. </P>
<P> Then, when prosecutor Marcia Clark reminded him that she had two small children to attend to, Ito said sheepishly, ``I plain forgot,'' and changed course once again, ordering Lopez to return to court Monday to testify. </P>
<P> Telling Lopez he could have her jailed if she tried to flee before then, Ito asked: ``You promise me that you will obey my order to return?'' </P>
<P> ``Yes,'' Lopez responded but she added, ``I don't want any reporters at the hotel.'' </P>
<P> By then, the jurors had already arrived at the courthouse, and Ito called them in for a brief explanation and an apology. </P>
<P> ``This is going to be an unusual trial,'' he told them. </P>
<P> Defense attorney Johnnie Cochran told jurors in his opening statement that Lopez would be a crucial alibi witness, but legal experts said she is now vulnerable to scathing attack by the prosecution. </P>
<P> But legal experts said the judge's decision also put the prosecution at a disadvantage by interrupting the story of the murders that they have been meticulously piecing together. </P>
