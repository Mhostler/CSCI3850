<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Clinton loves the Arkansas basketball team and hopes they come up with the same ability ''to hang in there'' as shown by Virginia -- their next opponent. </P>
<P> Clinton, like millions of other college basketball fans, has been glued to his television watching the NCAA tournament which has seen Arkansas win, but only after three close games -- two of them going into overtime. </P>
<P> Asked during an interview with ESPN Radio if his team can repeat as national champions, Clinton said: ``They have the ability to do it and they have the heart to do it. They've got to find the right combinations and maintain their concentration.'' </P>
<P> Clinton then said he was ``very impressed'' with the game Virginia played against Kansas Friday night, noting ``they were exhausted with seven or eight minutes left to go.'' </P>
<P> ``I didn't know if they could get through the end of the game, but somehow (they) found the strength and the reserve to hand in there and win that game'' and upset Kansas 67-58. </P>
<P> Clinton said Arkansas faces a ``hard game'' Sunday against Virginia but hopes they win. </P>
<P> When asked to predict the final winner of the tournament, Clinton declined, saying: ``As long as you know who I'm for, I don't have to predict who's going to win.'' </P>
