<P>  O.J. Simpson attorney Alan Dershowitz Monday played down reports of infighting on the former football great's defense team and said Simpson was anxious to get on with the trial. </P>
<P> Dershowitz, interviewed from Boston on ``CBS This Morning,'' was asked about reports that attorney Robert Shapiro was going to leave the team after last week's defense cross-examination of police Detective Mark Fuhrman by team member F. Lee Bailey, which experts said fell flat. </P>
<P> ``I don't think so,'' said Dershowitz. ``This is what was expected.'' </P>
<P> ``And then when our case goes on, you impeach that evidence and then the jury says to itself, 'Gee, Fuhrman looked like he was telling the truth. He was a smooth witness. Now, we see he wasn't telling the truth.''' </P>
<P> Fuhrman is a key witness in the trial of the football legend on charges Simpson murdered his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman June 12 because the detective said he found a bloody glove that ties Simpson to the crime. The defense has tried to portray Fuhrman as a rogue racist cop and alleges he planted the glove at Simpson's estate. </P>
<P> Shapiro apparently disagrees with the race strategy. Simpson is black; the victims were white. </P>
<P> Asked about reports of a major defense team meeting Saturday, Dershowitz said attorneys routinely meet to criticize and evaluate their cases, but said the Simpson case was ``being held in a fishbowl.''  Dershowitz said spent several hours Saturday with Simpson, who remains in jail. </P>
<P> ``He's anxious to get on with the case,'' the attorney said. ''His big concern is that we're only only getting two hours of testimony every day and that the case looks like it's dragging.'' </P>
<P> Testimony over the past few weeks has been held up by consideration of motions over what evidence or testimony is acceptable. </P>
<P> ``He'd like to see the case move more quickly and he has his own views about what's going on but he's in determined shape,'' Dershowitz said of Simpson. </P>
