<P>  Vice President Al Gore said Sunday he expects Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat will prosecute those responsible for terrorist attacks in his territory. </P>
<P> Responding to a question about Sunday's Islamic suicide car bombings that killed seven Israelis and wounded 45 in two attacks near Jewish settlements in PLO-ruled Gaza, Gore said that Arafat was committed to prosecuting terrorists. </P>
<P> ``In fact, I just had a meeting two weeks ago with Chairman Arafat in Jericho and he gave his commitment that they would ... bring prosecutions of those who are held as suspects of previous terrorist incidents,'' Gore said on NBC Television's ``Meet the Press.'' </P>
<P> ``There is every expectation in the region that Chairman Arafat and the Palestinian authority will follow through on that,'' he said. </P>
<P> The militant groups Islamic Jihad and Hamas have claimed responsibility for the attacks, saying the attacks were in part to avenge the bombing death of Hamas members in Gaza a week ago. </P>
