<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Vice President Al Gore promised Jordan Tuesday that the United States will write off all Jordanian debt to the U.S. government this year despite some domestic opposition. </P>
<P> ``Jordan has taken great risks for peace and the United States will demonstrate by its actions that we are by Jordan's side, now and in the future,'' Gore said in a speech soon after arriving in Amman. </P>
<P> ``We are committed to full debt forgiveness in 1995 and we will meet our commitment,'' Gore said to applause from officials who had become increasingly worried about the Clinton administration's ability to deliver on its promise. </P>
<P> Jordan's quest for U.S. aid as a reward for making peace with Israel last October was a dominant theme in Gore's visit, which set the stage for a meeting between King Hussein and President Clinton in Washington next week. </P>
<P> The king hopes his Washington visit will produce economic and military aid. The United States has indicated that a package of military assistance is under discussion. </P>
<P> Gore said the United States would also press other countries to help secure economic growth and stability in Jordan. France, Germany and Japan hold large amounts of Jordanian debt. </P>
<P> ``President Clinton will continue to urge other countries to relieve Jordan's debt burden as well as to provide economic assistance in support of Jordan's economic reforms,'' he said. </P>
<P> Jordan has hoped for aid on the scale lavished on Israel and Egypt after their 1979 peace treaty -- more than $5 billion annually between them -- but even the more modest sums planned by Clinton ran into trouble in Washington this year. </P>
<P> Clinton's proposal to spend $275 million to write off Jordanian debt to the U.S. government was recently slashed to $50 million by a congressional subcommittee. The Senate, however, approved a complete debt cancellation and a compromise will be negotiated by the lawmakers. </P>
<P> Jordan has secured some rewards from Washington already, including cancellation of a third of its U.S. debt last year and what U.S. officials say is agreement on $127 million in other forms of aid, mostly excess U.S. military equipment. </P>
<P> Gore leaves Jordan Wednesday after a visit to the ancient city of Petra. His Middle East tour began in Egypt and will continue to Oman, Saudi Arabia, Israel and the Palestinian self-rule area of Jericho in the West Bank. </P>
