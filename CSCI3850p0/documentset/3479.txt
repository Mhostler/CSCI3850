<P>  The man who introduced tough new drunken driving laws in Ireland said in remarks published Thursday that he had received a torrent of ``ferocious and abusive'' hate calls over the Christmas holiday. </P>
<P> Michael Smith, environment minister in the government which collapsed last month, said the telephone calls and abusive mail had made it ``a very difficult Christmas.'' </P>
<P> ``I can take the heat myself, but I don't like my family having to deal with it,'' Smith told the Irish Times. </P>
<P> He said that his private telephone number had been posted all over telephone booths as a 24-hour taxi service and he had had to cope with endless nuisance calls as well as abuse. </P>
<P> But Smith said his decision to lower the amount of legally acceptable alcohol in a driver's bloodstream had probably saved 100 lives over the Christmas period. </P>
<P> ``I've no apologies to make and I stand by the new laws which will save lives and stop families from going through the trauma of losing a loved one,'' he told the Irish Independent. </P>
<P> His remarks highlighted the controversy sparked by the decision to bring Irish drunken driving legislation into line with its European Union counterparts. </P>
<P> Drivers now face automatic two-year suspension and a fresh driving test if they are found to have more than .002 ounce of alcohol in their blood compared to .003 before. </P>
<P> The new limits mean that most drinkers can only have one drink in an evening if they intend to drive, which is way below the norm in a nation which cherishes its pubs and its brews as the hub of social and community life. </P>
<P> Tavernkeepers have complained that business over the Christmas period has fallen by as much as 70 percent and that staff members have had to be laid off. </P>
