<P>  Scientists said Thursday they were promoting a radical method of ``reversible'' male contraception in which men would be surgically sterilized after having their sperm stored for future fatherhood. </P>
<P> Reporting in the British journal Nature, the researchers said they envisaged a time when men would routinely use vasectomy as a contraceptive and would father children by artificial insemination, using pre-frozen sperm. </P>
<P> The scientists conceded that men would take some persuading to adopt this form of contraception. </P>
<P> The proposed method would be reversible in the sense that a man could have a vasectomy without giving up the chance of having children at a later date, wrote Carl Djerassi of Stanford University in California and colleague S.P. Leibo from the University of Guelph, Ontario. </P>
<P> The man's sperm would be stored at low temperatures in liquid nitrogen -- a technique known as cryopreservation -- until needed for insemination in his partner. This would provide a safe and reliable way of controlling fertility, they said. </P>
<P> ``Until now, human birth control has been achieved by interfering at some point of the reproductive cycle of a fertile person,'' the scientists wrote in a discussion paper. </P>
<P> ``In the future -- through vaccines and probably much sooner through vasectomy coupled with sperm cryopreservation -- the ``normal'' reproductive state of an adult may be infertility, a subsequent deliberate step being needed for fertilization.'' </P>
<P> Although there is no evidence that frozen sperm deteriorate over time, the scientists said the method could only work if men were sure that their babies would suffer no ill-effects. </P>
<P> They called for the armed services, which keep detailed medical records on thousands of men, to have them donate sperm for mass trials on the safety of long-term sperm storage. The sperm would be checked periodically for any deterioration. </P>
<P> ``Only time will tell whether men -- and women -- will buy the idea of this new form of contraception,'' they wrote. ``The indispensible first step is to set the clock running on a large-scale, long-term sperm cryopreservation program.'' </P>
