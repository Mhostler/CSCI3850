<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Philadelphia Eagles fired Rich Kotite as head coach Monday. </P>
<P> No successor was named, but Dick Vermeil, the only coach to take the Eagles to the Super Bowl, has been reported to be considering returning to the team he quit 12 years ago due to ''burnout.'' </P>
<P> Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie met with Kotite on Monday morning and then said they mutually decided to part ways. </P>
<P> ``Rich Kotite and the Philadelphia Eagles have decided to part company,'' Lurie said at a news conference at Veterans Stadium. </P>
<P> ``Rich Kotite will no longer be the head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles. All aspects of his contract will be honored. He is free to pursue head coaching opportunities.'' </P>
<P> Kotite has been mentioned as a candidate for the head coaching job with the expansion Carolina Panthers. </P>
<P> ``Coaches are hired to be fired,'' said Kotite, who had a year left on his contract. ``I don't know if I agree with that but I have the warmest feelings for everybody in this organization.'' </P>
<P> Kotite has been under fire since the middle of the season, even when the Eagles were 7-2 and contending for first place in the NFC East. </P>
<P> Lurie attempted to get former Dallas Cowboys head coach Jimmy Johnson to run his football operations. Johnson turned down the offer. </P>
<P> The Eagles skidded down the stretch, losing their last seven games to fall out of the playoff picture at 7-9. </P>
<P> The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Sunday that Vermeil is considering an offer from Lurie to serve as the team's general manager or general manager and coach. </P>
<P> According to the Inquirer, the 58-year-old Vermeil met for three hours with Lurie on Friday. </P>
<P> ``I went into the meeting without an interest, and I came out of the meeting with an interest,'' Vermeil told the newspaper. ``We discussed the possibilities of general manager or general manager and coach.'' </P>
<P> Vermeil, who coached the Eagles from 1976 through 1982, said he and Lurie agreed to consider the offer for a week or two before making a decision. </P>
<P> Vermeil, a college football analyst for ABC Sports, compiled a 54-47 record with the Eagles and guided the team to Super Bowl 15, where they were beaten by the Oakland Raiders 27-10. </P>
