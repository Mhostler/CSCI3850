<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Three men have been charged with conspiracy to launder over $7 million in cash from heroin trafficking through Hong Kong's Hang Seng Bank, federal prosecutors said Thursday. </P>
<P> Robert Maher, 61, Andrew Giordano, 58, and Peter Mancusi, 62, all of New York, were named in the 58-count federal indictment filed Thursday in Manhattan federal court. </P>
<P> No charges were levelled against the bank. </P>
<P> The indictment alleges that an unindicted co-conspirator in Bangkok, Thailand, a heroin distributor, controlled two accounts at the bank into which the cash was deposited. The co-conspirator was not identified in the indictment. </P>
<P> To conceal the nature, location and source of the money from his heroin trafficking, the co-conspirator arranged for the three men to deliver the cash from the sale of the drugs to the Hong Kong bank, prosecutors alleged. </P>
<P> The indictment further charged that between January 1990 and June 1991, Mancusi made 14 trips to Hong Kong, depositing more than $7 million. </P>
<P> On one occasion, it was alleged, he deposited more than $1 million cash into bank accounts controlled by the co-conspirator. </P>
<P> If convicted, the three men face up to 20 years in prison and more than $500,000 in fines. </P>
