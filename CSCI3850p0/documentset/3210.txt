<P>  British scientists said Wednesday they had taken an important step toward developing gene therapy, which doctors hope some day can be used to cure people of inherited diseases. </P>
<P> In a report in the science journal Nature, they said they had produced a tailor-made protein that stops uncontrolled cell growth. Cancer kills when cells divide rapidly -- one example is a tumor. </P>
<P> Sir Aaron Klug of Britain's Medical Research Council, who worked on the project, said the protein had only been tried out on mouse cells in a test tube. It works at the DNA level. DNA is the basic genetic building block of life. </P>
<P> The protein ``binds'' to the surface of the gene, stopping it from going into action. </P>
<P> ``This is the first time anybody has designed a protein to bind to a target of a particular sequence of DNA,'' Klug said in a telephone interview. </P>
<P> Klug and colleagues used their synthetic protein on a gene that causes acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a relatively rare form of cancer. But there was a good deal of information available about the gene. </P>
<P> ``We had chosen a well-known leukemia because people had experimented with it,'' Klug said. </P>
