<P>  Spanish customs police seized between two and three tons of cocaine in one of Spain's biggest ever drugs hauls when they stormed a ship in the mid-Atlantic Tuesday, a police spokesman said. </P>
<P> Police detained 11 people when they boarded the Panamanian registered oil tanker ``Archangelus'' in the early hours of the morning, he added. </P>
<P> Three other traffickers locked themselves in a room in the ship but gave themselves up later. </P>
<P> The boat was intercepted south of the Canary Islands after sailing from Brazil, apparently destined for Galicia in northwest Spain. </P>
<P> Police in the Galician town of Pontevedra arrested six suspected traffickers and one person was arrested in the east coast city of Tarragona in related raids, the spokesman said. </P>
<P> He said the exact quantity of cocaine and its estimated street value had not yet been established. </P>
