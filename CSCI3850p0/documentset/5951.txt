<DATELINE>SARAJEVO, April 23 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A French soldier was wounded on Sunday morning in an explosion in Sarajevo a day after three French peacekeepers were killed as they defused expired ammunition, a United Nations spokeswoman said. </P>
<P> ``We don't know whether it was a booby trap or a mine,'' Captain Miriam Souchaki told Reuters. </P>
<P> Three French peacekeepers were killed and four wounded on Saturday as they were defusing expired U.N. ammunition at the airport. Two French soldiers were shot dead by snipers a week ago in the city.. </P>
<P> The sniping incidents had prompted the French government to threaten to withdraw its troops from Bosnia unless the warring parties extended the current ceasefire due to expire on May 1. </P>
<P> But the Moslem-led Bosnian government and its Serb foes have so far rejected appeals to renew the three-month old ceasefire, which has been crumbling for several weeks. </P>
<P> France is the largest contributor of peacekeeping troops in Bosnia, with more than 3,000 troops serving in the former Yugoslav republic. </P>
