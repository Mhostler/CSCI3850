<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  It's life or death on the America's Cup challengers' course when racing resumes Thursday with round four. </P>
<P> In less than ten days time only four of the seven challenger teams will remain in the game and move forward to the semifinals of the Louis Vuitton Cup, the series which will determine the ultimate challenger for the America's Cup. </P>
<P> The pressure is less heated on the defender course as all three teams -- Young America, Stars & Stripes and America3 (cubed) -- qualify for the semifinals of the Citizen Cup, their elimination series. </P>
<P> But the boats will carry two, one or zero points forward into the next round based on their positions at the end of round four. </P>
<P> The top three challenger teams -- Team New Zealand, One Australia and Tag Heuer Challenge, also of New Zealand -- look to have secure semifinal berths. </P>
<P> Marc Pajot's France 3 and Makato Namba's Nippon sit precariously in fourth and fifth position and have everything to play for. </P>
<P> Snapping at their heels are Sydney 95 and Rioja de Espana in sixth and seventh places. It is doubtful that either will improve enough to vault into the top four but each could have a say in who gets the fourth spot. </P>
<P> With just three points separating France 3 and Nippon -- and five points available for a win in round four -- neither can afford to make a mistake. </P>
<P> Both boats have pulled out their ace cards. Nippon will race its second boat for the first time while France 3 will introduce its secret weapon in the shape of an altered mainsail which the French expect to increase their upwind speed dramatically. </P>
<P> Namba, skipper of Nippon was remaining silent about the speed potential of his new boat, which has been speed training since the team finished round three. </P>
<P> ``All I will say is I'm happy to announce that we will be using our new boat in round four,'' said Namba. </P>
<P> The French have introduced a sail which has a non-conventional shape, working within the restriction of a maximum total sail area. </P>
<P> Where most mainsails attach all along the vertical mast, an upright triangle has been cut away from the bottom corner extending midway up the mast and a shorter distance out along the horizontal boom, and that area has been used to increase the size of the curved corner at the outer top. </P>
<P> ``We're expecting the sail to show a speed improvement..we've tested it and modified it and are happy,'' said Wolfe. ``We know we have to win one more race than Nippon and the team is rallying around to do just that.'' </P>
<P> On the defender side, the long-awaited new boat of the all-women's America3 team arrived in San Diego last week and will be on the race course Thursday. </P>
<P> Rumor has it that the boat is lightning quick, which if true could turn things around for the women, who have yet to make any impact on the America's Cup. They are struggling in third place, 18 points adrift of Young America and Stars & Stripes, which share the lead on 25 points. </P>
<P> JJ Isler, starting helmswoman on America3, was confident that things were not as dire as that score might suggest. </P>
<P> ``We have 30 races (total) until someone gets eliminated,'' said Isler. ``If someone was going to be eliminated by the semifinals we would have had our new boat earlier.'' </P>
<P> Points on the challenger course increase from four points to five points for a win, and points from previous rounds are carried forward. Then the top four boats at the end of round four move forward to the semifinals with a clean slate. </P>
<P> For the defenders it will be a leap from four to seven points for a victory with previous scores counting. All three of the defenders will move into their semifinals, the highest scorer taking in two points, the runner-up one and the back marker zero. In the semis, each win is worth one point. </P>
<P> Racing starts with Rioja de Espana versus One Australia, Nippon versus Tag Heuer Challenge, Team New Zealand versus France 3 and America 3 will race Stars & Stripes. Young America and Sydney 95 have a rest day. </P>
