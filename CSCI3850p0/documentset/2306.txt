<P>  Muslim guerrillas launched two attacks against Israeli-allied militiamen in south Lebanon Sunday, wounding two gunmen, security sources said. </P>
<P> The offensive followed a day of attacks by pro-Iranian Hizbollah fighters in which an Israeli soldier was killed on the edge of the Jewish state's occupation zone. </P>
<P> The sources said a roadside bomb exploded near a patrol of South Lebanon Army (SLA) militiamen near the village of Rshaf inside Israel's occupation zone, wounding two militiamen. </P>
<P> Another SLA patrol came under a hail of machinegun and anti-tank fire in the Toumat Jezzine area in a finger of territory jutting north of the zone but under Israeli control. </P>
<P> There was no initial report of casualties in the second attack, they added. </P>
<P> Hizbollah (Party of God) claimed responsibility for the attacks. </P>
<P> Earlier Sunday, Israeli forces fired some artillery rounds onto Iqlim al-Toufah ridge, a rugged mountain area from where Hizbollah guerrillas attack the zone. </P>
<P> On Saturday, Hizbollah men killed an Israeli soldier and wounded two others and an SLA militiaman in a raid on a number of Israeli and SLA posts on the edge of the zone facing Iqlim al-Toufah. </P>
<P> The slain soldier was the 15th killed in Lebanon this year. </P>
<P> Israel denied a Hizbollah claim that its position at Dabshe hill on the edge of the zone was overrun by the guerrillas during Saturday's fighting. </P>
<P> Hizbollah, however, released a video tape showing its fighters closing in on Dabshe under a hail of machinegun, rocket and mortar fire. </P>
<P> It then showed guerrillas blowing up fortifications on the edge of the post and raising the group's flag. </P>
<P> Israeli and SLA forces retaliated with artillery fire which killed one civilian and wounded seven others and a Hizbollah militant. </P>
<P> Hizbollah and other groups have vowed to continue attacks on the Israelis and SLA in the zone until the Israelis leave. </P>
