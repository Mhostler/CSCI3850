<P>  A Croatian freighter that had languished off South America's west coast after being refused entry into three countries unloaded its cargo of toxic waste onto another ship, the Chilean navy said Thursday. </P>
<P> The ship, identified as the Croatian-flagged Triglav, loaded the 97 tons of toxic industrial waste onto another ship at a Panamanian port and the second ship was now headed for Europe, said the navy in a statement. </P>
<P> The navy was apparently aiming to defuse a controversy in Chile over whether the boat should be allowed into the country's waters. </P>
<P> President Eduardo Frei's government faced protests from unions and environmental groups over its decision to let the Triglav dock in Chile -- but not unload its toxic cargo -- after Colombia, Peru and Ecuador all barred it from their ports. </P>
<P> Carrying a poisonous mix of medical wastes, lead and zinc, the Triglav was reported to be 400 miles off the Colombian coast early Wednesday, the Chilean navy said. </P>
<P> ``The vessel Triglav will continue heading south, without its dangerous cargo,'' the navy's statement said. The ship was expected to reach Chilean waters next week and would be allowed to call at the port of San Antonio, the navy said. </P>
<P> The ship had reportedly loaded the waste in the Colombian port of Cartagena. </P>
<P> Its stated destination was Europe, although the peculiar route it was taking around the southern tip of South America aroused environmentalists' suspicions that the boat was planning to unload the waste in South America. </P>
