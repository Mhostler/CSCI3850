<P>  Washington's top disaster relief official said Wednesday Japan and the United States should share their experiences in recovery from major earthquakes but refused to comment on Japan's slow response. </P>
<P> James Lee Witt, Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), said his purpose in Japan was not to pass judgement on the Japanese government's record in the Jan. 17 Kobe earthquake which killed more than 5,000 people. </P>
<P> ``We are here to share our experience from an earthquake similar to the one which you (Japan) had,'' Witt told a news conference. He arrived in Tokyo Tuesday and is to tour Kobe until Saturday. </P>
<P> ``We are here to help you with the recovery, how fast you can achieve recovery, from the disaster... We are not here to see how fast the response was,'' Witt said. </P>
<P> Witt's team of nine U.S. disaster specialists was sent to Japan under an agreement between President Clinton and Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama soon after the Kobe earthquake. </P>
<P> FEMA directed relief efforts after the January 1994 earthquake that rocked Northridge, Calif. </P>
<P> A foreign ministry official who attended a meeting between Witt and Foreign Minister Yohei Kono told reporters Witt said swift coordination between central and local authorities was a key factor in successfully handling the Northridge case. </P>
<P> Murayama has publicly admitted he was slow to realise the extent of damage. The slow response, by both the central and local governments, has been blamed for the bungled efforts to send rescuers and emergency supplies into Kobe. </P>
<P> Stung by the criticism, the Murayama government is preparing a set of new emergency procedures which will enable the prime minister to take direct authority, like in the United States, and launch relief efforts quickly, Japanese newspaper reports have said. </P>
<P> Such a new system could be based loosely on the workings of the FEMA and is likely to include a panel of disaster experts who could brief the prime minister and coordinate relief efforts in an emergency, the reports said. </P>
<P> At least 5,102 people perished in the earthquake, nearly all in the port city of Kobe or surrounding towns. Some 270,000 were left homeless. Nearly 27,000 were injured and 11 people are still officially listed as missing. </P>
