<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, March 28 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  U.S. First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton took time out on the first day of a whirlwind tour of India on Tuesday to poke a bit of fun at herself. </P>
<P> Clinton said she was so excited by her trip that she was thinking of returning to India some day -- but promised to give weary U.S. embassy staff and diplomats time to catch their breath after organising the current three-day visit. </P>
<P> ``I'm very excited by the chance I have to be here, although it is much too short, and because it is so short I'm already thinking about returning at some future date,'' she said in brief remarks at the embassy compound. </P>
<P> ``Don't worry, that's not going to happen any time soon,'' she added quickly, drawing laughter. </P>
<P> Many embassy workers postponed vacations coinciding with school holidays last week to work grueling hours planning Clinton's visit to India, one of five countries she will see during her 12-day tour of South Asia. </P>
<P> The First Lady acknowledged the work that goes into preparing foreign jaunts by her and her husband, President Bill Clinton. </P>
<P> ``And I know there is a collective sigh of relief when people like me leave,'' she said with a smile. </P>
<P> ``I understand that, I don't take it personally -- I don't take anything personally anymore,'' she said, interrupted by applause. ``I just keep rolling right along.'' </P>
<P> It was the second stab at self-deprecation in two days by the First Lady, who generated much criticism for the ambitious policy role she carved out after her husband was elected president in 1992 but who has since adopted a lower profile. </P>
<P> In Pakistan on Monday, Mrs Clinton showed a sense of humour about the controversy surrounding her effort to expand the traditional role of U.S. First Ladies when a student asked her if she had a nickname. </P>
<P> ``My nickname? Well, it depends on who you talk to,'' she said. ``Some people, I would imagine, have quite rude nicknames for me.'' </P>
