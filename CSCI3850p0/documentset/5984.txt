<P>  Chay Blyth, the British adventurer who rowed across the Atantic 30 years ago, invited challengers Monday to a two-person team race between the Canary Islands and the West Indies. </P>
<P> ``The Atlantic Rowing Race will be a supreme mental and physical challenge. It will be the longest rowing race ever held and will require the teams to adapt to testing conditions that will push the human spirit to its limit,'' he said at launch. </P>
<P> Blyth, who devised the 70-day race which is set to leave from Tenerife in September 1997 and arrive in Barbados in December, envisages up to 30 two-person teams taking part in the 2,900-mile journey in boats they will make themselves from special kits. </P>
<P> In 1966 Blyth and John Ridgway became the first men to row across the Atlantic. Blyth also set the record for sailing around the world the wrong way, against the prevailing winds and currents, in 1971. </P>
