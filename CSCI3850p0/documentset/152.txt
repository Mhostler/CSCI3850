<P>  Greek police shot and wounded an Albanian woman Sunday after the car she was riding in refused to stop for a search near the Albanian border. </P>
<P> The woman was wounded seriously in the head and her husband was arrested. Two or three other men abandoned the car and fled into the rugged border region on foot, a police spokesman in the northern city of Ioannina said. </P>
<P> He said the car was on the Greek side of the border and had been ordered to stop for an inspection at a police road check. Someone in the car opened fire on the police who, in turn, fired back, wounding the woman, the spokesman said. </P>
<P> It was the latest shooting incident on the tense border in three days. </P>
<P> Athens has accused Albanian soldiers of crossing the border last Thursday and wounding a Greek soldier. Tirana denies this account, saying it was Greek soldiers who crossed into Albania. </P>
<P> Relations between the Balkan neighbors have been badly strained. Greece accuses Albania of systematically intimidating a large ethnic Greek minority in southern Albania. Tirana says Athens is trying to whip up separatist sentiments in the area. </P>
