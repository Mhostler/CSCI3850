<P>  Hall of Fame baseball players Mickey Mantle and Hank Aaron lent their support Thursday to a campaign against a deadly tradition made popular by the national past time: the use of smokeless or ``spit'' tobacco. </P>
<P> Aaron, baseball's all-time home run king, and Mantle, one of the game's greatest power hitters, joined Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders at a news conference to unveil the public awareness initiative. </P>
<P> Sponsored by the American Fund for Dental Health, the campaign is aimed at youngsters and parents in an attempt to deglorify the macho image that professional athletes, especially baseball players, lend to smokeless tobacco. </P>
<P> ``It's one of those baseball traditions that hopefully will retire very shortly,'' said National League President Len Coleman. </P>
<P> Smokeless tobacco comes in two different forms: snuff and chewing tobacco. Snuff is a finely ground tobacco whose users put a pinch of it between the cheek and gum and hold it there; chewing tobacco is bulkier. </P>
<P> Users will then spit out the brownish mixture of saliva and tobacco. While some may view it as a disgusting habit, it is a product whose use has steadily grown, especially among young people. </P>
<P> Elders, citing data from the 1993 Surgeon General's Report on Tobacco, said the tobacco has grown in popularity over the past 20 years, especially among young men. And some start using it as early as kindergarten. </P>
<P> The data also said that one ``dip'' of the highly addictive spit tobacco held in the mouth for 20 to 30 minutes delivers as much nicotine as two to three cigarettes. </P>
<P> What gets youths started? Watching their sports heroes mainly, said Joe Garagiola, a former Major League catcher and play-by-play man. </P>
<P> ``Tobacco companies get all kinds of free ads from baseball,'' he said. ``A kid sees that and forget it, he wants to try it.'' </P>
<P> Elders warned that ``our young people are the ones being set up to be victims of this product.'' </P>
<P> Mantle, who recently underwent treatment for alcoholism, said he first used smokeless tobacco after seeing his baseball heroes Nellie Fox and Enos Slaughter use it. After being scolded by then-New York Yankees manager Casey Stengel, ``I quit right then,'' he said. </P>
<P> Aaron warned fellow baseball players that they ``have to take stock in themselves and realize the message that goes out to our kids.'' </P>
