<P>  Bosnian Serbs appear set to release five aid workers -- four French and an American -- held for more than two months, their organisation, Pharmacists without Borders, said on Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``The Serbs seem prepared to release them and we have great hopes for this afternoon or this evening,'' the group's president Jean-Louis Machuron told France-Info radio. </P>
<P> Machuron said negotiations, conducted through clerics of the Serb Orthodox Catholic Church and lawyers in Belgrade, narrowly failed on Monday because of disagreement over the route the workers should take to Sarajevo. </P>
<P> He said the latest proposal was for the detainees to be taken to Belgrade. </P>
<P> Machuron said it was urgent that the five, who have been held for 67 days, be released. ``If we can't get them out as soon as possible, they will break down,'' he said. </P>
