<P>  About half of all male infertility cases can be explained by the lack of a crucial protein in the sperm, a group of Canadian researchers announced Thursday. </P>
<P> The protein, dubbed P30H, is added to sperm as it travels through the epididuimis tube, after being released from the testes, said Dr. Gilles Bleau, director of the Montreal group of scientists who made the discovery. </P>
<P> In the absence of this protein, the sperm is unable to make contact and bind with a woman's egg. </P>
<P> ``This is a very critical step in fertilization,'' said Bleau. ``A man who doesn't produce this protein, we believe is infertile.'' </P>
<P> These findings should revolutionize the way sterility in males is diagnosed and treated, said Bleau. </P>
<P> Currently, doctors test for sterility in men by evaluating whether sperm is being produced in the semen, if it is normal-looking, and if it is mobile. Using these criteria, doctors have been able to explain the causes of male infertility about 25 percent of the time. </P>
<P> Approximately eight to ten percent of Canadian couples suffer from infertility, while men and women are equally responsible for the condition. </P>
<P> The study analyzed semen from sperm donors kept in the Maisonneue-Rosemont hospital in Montreal and two separate in-vitro fertilization clinics. </P>
<P> This protein has been known to exist in hampsters, and it is only in the last three years that researchers have tried to identify it in humans, said Bleau. </P>
<P> He said these findings should help debunk many of the myths surrounding infertility because ``even though a man produces sperm does not mean he is fertile.'' </P>
<P> Researchers are now working on developing a new infertility test which would determine if the protein is present, said Bleau. </P>
