<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The trial of alleged ``Hollywood Madam'' Heidi Fleiss, scheduled to start next Monday, was postponed Tuesday to September 19, the same date as O.J. Simpson's murder trial, a District Attorney's Office spokeswoman said. </P>
<P> The date could pose an airwave quandary. Football great Simpson is accused of murdering his ex-wife and her friend and preliminary hearings in both trials have received gavel to gavel coverage on network television, even preempting regular programming. </P>
<P> Spokeswoman Sandy Gibbons said the Fleiss trial had been delayed because the prosecutor in the case, Deputy District Attorney Alan Carter, was tied up in a murder case which would not be finished by the previously scheduled date of August 22. </P>
<P> Fleiss is accused of running a high-priced call-girl ring in a case that has fascinated and titillated the nation for more than a year. </P>
<P> The 28-year-old daughter of a prominent Los Angeles pediatrician pleaded not guilty last September to four charges of pandering -- procuring the services of women for prostitution -- and one charge of possessing cocaine. </P>
<P> The case has reportedly sent a number of big name stars and producers running for cover. </P>
<P> Beverly Hills police say they have Fleiss' ``black book'' of clients but have no intention of publicizing its contents. </P>
<P> Anthony Brooklier, Fleiss' attorney, tried unsuccessfully to have the case thrown out earlier this year on the grounds of sex discrimination, claiming a pervasive police practice of arresting madams and female prostitutes but not their male clients. </P>
<P> Legal experts have speculated he might try to name names contained in the book to prove his point. </P>
<P> In the other case, Simpson, a football legend, has pleaded innocent to murdering his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman, on the night of June 12. </P>
<P> Fleiss' trial will be in the same Superior Court building as Simpson's. Television coverage in the Superior Court is allowed by law in California. </P>
<P> Fleiss was dubbed the ``Hollywood Madam'' after she was arrested in June last year in a multi-agency police sting in which a Beverly Hills detective, posing as a businessman, arranged for Fleiss to supply call girls for some Japanese clients. </P>
<P> Fleiss' legal woes were compounded at the end of July when she and her father, Dr Paul Fleiss, were indicted on federal charges of laundering money from her alleged prostitution ring. </P>
<P> Both pleaded innocent and are due to be tried in federal court on October 11. </P>
