<P>  If the politicians in this small city on the banks of the Oconee River agree on anything, it is that they cannot afford to host the Olympics if doing the job right means raising taxes. </P>
<P> So the local government chief said Monday authorities will try to attract corporate sponsors to kick in $10 million to pay for police and fire services and a new city park. </P>
<P> ``We're the smallest community with the greatest Olympic challenge outside of Atlanta. We have three venues and games every day of competition and we want to do a great job,'' said Gwen O'Looney, who serves as both mayor of Athens and executive of Clarke County. </P>
<P> ``This is not Easter Sunday. This is the Second Coming. It's only going to happen once.'' </P>
<P> Located about 60 miles (96 km) east of Atlanta, Athens is already famous as the home of the rock music bands R.E.M. and the B-52s, both of which grew from a vibrant youth atmosphere perpetuated by the University of Georgia. But for a month beginning in July 1996, the city also will play host to untold thousands who flock in to see Olympic soccer, volleyball and rhythmic gymnastics. </P>
<P> Unlike the city of Atlanta, Athens does not fall within the traffic plan being organized by the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games. The community also enjoys no organizing agreements that would help defray the cost of services. </P>
<P> O'Looney said extra police, firefighters and other public services alone would cost $2 million or more than 12 percent of the revenues now collected through local property taxes. </P>
<P> The Olympics spirit also has revived a six-year-old plan for a new city park that would provide a venue for special events during the Games and later serve as a center of gravity for new hotel and office-building developments. </P>
<P> The park, said O'Looney, would cost $4.5 million to build and $1.5 million to preserve and police after 1996. </P>
<P> ``On garbage, on all special services -- we've done a good job at making sure those people who use something pay for it. And we're working real hard to make sure that, as a community, we take the same approach to this responsibility,'' she added. </P>
<P> ``We're not wringing our hands, we're rolling up our sleeves.'' </P>
<P> Athens-Clarke County authorities are hoping to solicit sponsorships in $2 million and $1 million categories. </P>
