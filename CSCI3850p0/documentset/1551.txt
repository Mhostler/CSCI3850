<P>  Canada's Supreme Court will examine the case of a western Canadian teacher twice convicted of promoting hatred against Jews, the justice minister for the province of Alberta said Thursday. </P>
<P> Jim Keegstra, a former Alberta high school teacher, taught students that the Holocaust was a hoax. </P>
<P> Earlier this month the Alberta Court of Appeal overturned a second conviction against Keegstra of promoting hatred on the grounds that the jury in the case was not provided with all of the information it had requested. </P>
<P> Alberta has now asked the Supreme Court to look at the Appeal Court ruling and under Canada's legal system the country's highest court must examine the case. </P>
<P> ``This is not retrying Mr Keegstra,'' Alberta Justice Minister Ken Rostad said Thursday. ``This is a question of law that's going to the Supreme Court, not a question of his guilt or innocence.'' </P>
<P> If the Supreme Court upholds the Appeal Court ruling, Alberta will have to decide whether to hold a third trial for Keegstra, Rostad said. </P>
<P> Keegstra was originally found guilty of promoting hatred in 1985 after he taught stuate laws were unconstitutional. </P>
<P> Keegstra was retried and again convicted in 1992. </P>
<P> The 58-year-old Keegstra was fired from his teaching job in 1982 and now works as a mechanic in Eckville. </P>
