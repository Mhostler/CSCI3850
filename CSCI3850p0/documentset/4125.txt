<P>  An ultra-Orthodox Jewish group said Friday photographs showing Nazis leading naked Jews to slaughter were immodest and should be removed from Israel's national Holocaust museum. </P>
<P> Chaim Miller, a deputy mayor of Jerusalem and head of the Association for the Rights of the Ultra-Orthodox Community, said the pictures were an affront to ultra-Orthodox Jews and demanded Yad Vashem cover the nudity or remove the photographs. </P>
<P> ``I don't recommend that they tangle with us. The pictures are offensive. If they don't remove them we can make sure religious Jews don't visit the museum, we can check if any of their big donors are Orthodox,'' he told Reuters. </P>
<P> Miller said he had made a formal complaint to Yad Vashem after receiving letters recently from ultra-Orthodox Jews who objected to the photographs. </P>
<P> Yad Vashem's chairman Avner Shalev said the main picture in question showed Nazi troops poised to shoot hundreds of naked Jewish women and had been on display for more than 25 years. </P>
<P> ``We have no intention of covering up the historic truth and there's no possibility of euphemising it,'' he told Reuters. </P>
<P> He said more than 20 million people had seen the photograph since the museum opened. Nazi Germany killed six million Jews in World War Two death camps. </P>
