<NOTES>    NEW YORK (Reuter) - Make mine a double, please.</NOTES>
<DATELINE></DATELINE>
<P> That'll be no problem at Twins, a new bar and restaurant where even the most sober patron will be seeing double. </P>
<P> Owners, bartenders, waiters, waitresses, busboys -- they're all twins at Twins, which opens officially Friday on Manhattan's Upper East Side. </P>
<P> ``We decided to call it what we are,'' explained Lisa Ganz, who is launching the restaurant with her twin sister, Debbie. The 27-year-olds are identical, down to their waist-length auburn hair, their lipstick shade and the color of their manicured nails. </P>
<P> The decor is not without a twins theme, naturally. The bar stools are in pairs, attached at the base. A steel sculpture of double-helix DNA spirals to the ceiling and baskets of Wrigley's Double Mint gum dot the bar. </P>
<P> Twin waiters will be serving up such specialties as the Pat Duke Platter, Double Cheese Fondue and Twin Peaks Nachos. </P>
<P> For customers wary of being able to flag down the right waiter, Lisa Ganz swears there's a trick to telling identical twins apart. ``The older twin has a longer chin,'' she claims. </P>
<P> Finding such a unique staff wasn't difficult, through advertising and word of mouth, she said, but the scheduling is another story. </P>
<P> Most of the 40 people on staff have 9-to-5 jobs, and many will work just one night a week. </P>
<P> And each twin has to work when the other does. If one can't come in, the other doesn't work. </P>
<P> While that might be tough on the staff, it does spare the owners from being victims of the oldest twin trick in the book. ``One set had the same job for two years, and they switched off every other day. They got fired when they got caught,'' Lisa Ganz said. </P>
<P> Twins' bartenders John and David Mautone, 31, have worked together every job they've had, said David. ``We've always been together,'' he said. ``We're as close as two people could ever be.'' </P>
<P> The restaurant's owners say twins also get along remarkably well with other twins. ``They treat each other like they've known each other for years,'' Lisa Ganz said. ``They have an automatic bond.'' </P>
<P> Not everybody at Twins is a twin, though. ``I can't worry about finding twin chefs,'' Lisa Ganz said. ``It is a business after all.'' </P>
<P> General Manager Carlo Bruno is doing his gig solo as well. ''I move fast enough that you think I'm two,'' he said. </P>
<P> And Bruno is making his own, small stand against the onslaught of twins. </P>
<P> ``I've got a line of single malt scotches,'' he said quietly, while the Twins' owners were busy elsewhere. </P>
