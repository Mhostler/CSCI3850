<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Taj Mahal is getting designer moonlight. </P>
<P> Tourists flocking for a full-moon view of the marble wonder will now have fail-safe artificial light for a romantic vision of the magnificent tomb a Mogul emperor built for his beloved wife, the Times of India said Monday. </P>
<P> A private engineering company has designed a new lighting system for the 17th-century monument, India's top tourist attraction, the Times of India said. </P>
<P> ``With specially designed timers, filters and lighting devices, they can now produce the natural lighting effect which the full moon creates as it traverses the sky from dusk to dawn,'' the newspaper said. </P>
<P> The Taj, built by Shah Jahan for his second wife, Mumtaz, at Agra about 125 miles from Delhi, attracts each year 1.5 million tourists, a third of them foreign. </P>
<P> Most visitors like to view the great monument by moonlight, which suffuses the banks of the Yamuna River with a romantic ambience. </P>
