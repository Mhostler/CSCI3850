<P>  Republican U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison defeated Democrat Richard Fisher in the Texas U.S. Senate race, according to CBS and Dallas ABC affiliate WFAA TV. </P>
<P> Hutchison led Fisher by 62 percent to 37 percent with about 10 percent of precincts reporting. </P>
<P> Hutchison, a Dallas lawyer, was first elected to the Senate in a landslide victory in 1993 to fill the former seat of Democrat Lloyd Bentsen, who became President Clinton's Treasury Secretary. </P>
<P> Within months of her election, Hutchison was indicted for allegedly misusing state employees and equipment while serving as State Treasurer, in charges she labelled a political vendetta by Democrats. </P>
<P> She was acquitted last February when Austin Democratic District Attorney Ronnie Earle declined to present a case after losing a procedural argument. </P>
<P> Fisher, a Dallas businessman, is a former Ross Perot adviser who won an upset victory in last spring's Democratic Senate primary. </P>
