<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Jaromir Jagr scored twice and Ken Wregget made 31 saves Saturday as the red hot Pittsburgh Penguins closed in on the National Hockey League record for the longest unbeaten streak at the start of a season. </P>
<P> Ron Francis set up both of Jagr's goals in a 3-1 victory over the Montreal Canadiens that extended Pittsburgh's season-opening unbeaten streak to 11 games. </P>
<P> The 10-0-1 start for the Penguins is four games short of the NHL record set by the Edmonton Oilers, who opened the 1984-85 season with a 12-0-3 mark. </P>
<P> Jagr's second goal, an empty netter with 40 seconds left, moved him into a tie with Detroit's Ray Sheppard for the league lead with 10 goals. </P>
<P> ``It is excellent, fun for our fans, fun for our team. I like the way we are playing,'' said Jagr. </P>
<P> In Quebec, Martin Rucinsky and rookie Peter Forsberg each had a goal and an assist to lead the Nordiques to a 5-2 win over the Ottawa Senators as Quebec kept pace with Pittsburgh with its fifth straight victory. </P>
<P> Rucinsky broke a 1-1 tie in the final minute of the second period and Forsberg and Mike Ricci scored 70-seconds apart midway through the third to clinch the win. </P>
<P> The Nordiques improved to 6-0 at home and 10-1 overall to remain just one point behind first place Pittsburgh in the Northeast Division. </P>
<P> In Dallas, Trevor Kidd made 34 saves to record his first NHL shutout and Zarley Zalapski set up three goals to lead the Calgary Flames to a 6-0 rout of the Stars. </P>
<P> Mike Sullivan, Mark Greig and Steve Chiasson each scored their first goal of the season in the first period for Calgary. Theo Fleury, Paul Kruse and Dan Keczmer also scored for Calgary, winner of three of its last four games. </P>
<P> ``I didn't think about it until it was all over,'' Kidd said of the shutout. ``I just try to keep the puck out of the net. The guys did a good job for me.'' </P>
<P> In St Louis, Alexei Zhamnov accounted for all of Winnipeg's offense, recording his third career hat trick in a 3-2 victory over the Blues. </P>
<P> Zhamnov completed the hat trick with a powerplay goal off a wrist shot from just above the slot at 3:21 of the third period to break a 2-2 deadlock. He had another powerplay tally in the second period and an even strength goal in the first. </P>
<P> Winnipeg's Nikolai Khabibulin made 32 saves, including 28 over the first two periods. </P>
<P> At Tampa Bay, Sergei Nemchinov scored twice to lift the New York Rangers to a 3-2 victory over the Lightning, creating a four-way tie for first place in the Atlantic Division. </P>
<P> The Rangers got off only 15 shots in the game, but Steve Larmer and Nemchinov beat Darren Puppa 21 seconds apart as the Stanley Cup champions scored on two of their three shots in the second period. </P>
<P> The Rangers are tied with the Lightning, the New York Islanders and the Florida Panthers for first place. </P>
<P> In Toronto, Kelly Hrudey turned aside 41 shots and Tony Granato and Michel Petit each had a goal and an assist to lead the Los Angeles Kings to a 5-2 victory over the Maple Leafs. </P>
<P> Kevin Todd, Robert Lang and Rick Tocchet also scored for the Kings, who recorded their first road win of the season. </P>
<P> Dave Andreychuk and Mike Eastwood scored for Toronto, which lost for the first time in five home games. </P>
<P> At Florida, Jody Hull assisted on Mike Hough's first goal of the season in the second period, then scored the game-winner 92 seconds later as the Panthers edged the Hartford Whalers 4-3. </P>
<P> Stu Barnes, who scored 75 seconds into the game, and Brent Severyn picked up the first two goals for the Panthers. </P>
<P> Robert Kron scored twice for the Whalers, who lost their fifth straight to drop to 2-7-2. </P>
<P> At New Jersey, Josef Beranek had a goal and an assist and Dominic Roussel made 25 saves to lead the Philadelphia Flyers to their first road win of the year, a 3-1 triumph over the Devils. </P>
<P> Brent Fedyk's goal 31 seconds into the second period broke a 1-1 deadlock and put Philadelphia ahead to stay. </P>
<P> Stephane Richer scored the Devils' only goal on a shorthanded breakaway midway through the second period. </P>
<P> In Boston, Dave Reid scored with 4:05 left in the second period to lift the Bruins to a 1-1 tie with the Washington Capitals. </P>
<P> Dmitri Khristich scored for Washington 28 seconds into the second period. </P>
<P> Boston goaltender Vincent Riendeau replaced an injured Blaine Lacher early in the second period and stopped all 10 shots he faced to preserve the tie. </P>
<P> Neither team managed a shot in overtime. </P>
<P> In Uniondale, N.Y., Jamie McLennan stopped 26 shots and Troy Loney scored his first goal as an Islander to lift New York to a 2-1 victory over the Buffalo Sabres. </P>
<P> Loney scored the game winner at 14:23 of the second period for the Isles, who managed just two shots on goal in the final period but ended a three-game losing streak. </P>
<P> Buffalo took a 1-0 lead at 7:40 of the first period on Alexander Mogilny's powerplay goal. Ray Ferraro tied it at 8:21 of the second period with his eighth goal of the season. </P>
<P> In Vancouver, Trevor Linden and Tom Pederson scored 23 seconds apart in the first period for the only offense generated in the game as the Canucks and San Jose Sharks battled to a 1-1 tie. </P>
<P> Linden opened the scoring with an unassisted goal for Vancouver 6:45 into the first period. Pederson responded by shoveling a backhander past Kirk McLean. </P>
<P> McLean made 23 saves for the Canucks, while Wade Flaherty made 27 stops for the Sharks. </P>
