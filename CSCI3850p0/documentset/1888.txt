<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A painting attributed to the 17th-century Dutch master Rembrandt was stolen from the artist's former home in Amsterdam early Sunday, police said. </P>
<P> A police spokesman said the stolen work is a small oil painting on a wooden panel entitled ``Bearded Man,'' thought to have been painted by Rembrandt van Rijn in 1647. </P>
<P> Because art experts are not certain about the authorship of the painting, it is classified as ``attributed to Rembrandt.'' </P>
<P> A police spokesman said the thief entered the Rembrandthuis museum by smashing a front window with a heavy hammer, which he left at the scene of the crime. </P>
<P> In July two paintings by Rembrandt's tutor, Pieter Lastman, were stolen after a break-in at the same museum. </P>
<P> The Rembrandthuis was the artist's home from 1639 to 1668. It is now a museum exhibiting mainly etchings and sketches and attracts some 150,000 visitors a year. </P>
