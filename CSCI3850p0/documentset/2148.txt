<P>  The Clinton administration will be ''shrewder and more strategic'' in recommending changes to the U.S. health care system next year, the Washington Post quoted Health Secretary Donna Shalala as saying. </P>
<P> In its Friday editions, the newspaper quoted Shalala as saying President Clinton remained committed to expanding coverage for the uninsured but had made no decisions on what to propose next year. </P>
<P> Shalala said the 1994 battle over health care had made it clear that the American public was opposed to a general overhaul of the whole system. </P>
<P> ``The administration is not going to present such a big target again, but rather, will consider 'how much to bite off''', Shalala said, according to the newspaper. </P>
<P> Shalala said the basic work on the administration's revamped health reform strategy had been completed, but the National Domestic and Economic Policy councils were now drafting a financial and political strategy. </P>
