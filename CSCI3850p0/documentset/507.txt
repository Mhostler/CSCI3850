<DATELINE>STAPLEFIELD, England (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A vicar who was sacked by the Church of England because he did not believe in the literal existence of God delivered his last sermon Sunday. </P>
<P> Reverend Anthony Freeman addressed his congregation in the small West Sussex town of Staplefield for the last time ahead of a midnight deadline when he loses his license to preach. </P>
<P> Freeman told the larger-than-normal congregation and dozens of reporters and photographers in the 19th century church that he felt a little like persecuted biblical prophet Jeremiah: ``At least no-one has put out a warrant for my arrest.'' </P>
<P> Local bishop Dr Eric Kemp ordered the ban after giving Freeman a year to reconsider remarks published in an 80-page book ``God With Us'' in which he appeared to question the existence of God and the Anglican dogma of the Trinity of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. </P>
<P> Freeman wrote: ``There is nothing out there or if there is, we can have no knowledge of it.'' </P>
<P> On Sunday he insisted that did not make him an atheist. </P>
<P> ``I am not an atheist -- that is nonsense. I have proclaimed I believe in God,'' he told parishioners, some of them weeping. </P>
<P> He said he had no regrets about writing the book and said his views were an attempt to find ``space'' within the church for different opinions about the ways in which God existed. </P>
<P> His sacking has disappointed many in his congregation but pleased others who felt he was a little too modern in his thinking for the predominantly rural parish. </P>
<P> ``I like him as a man and he has been very kind but...it is like being an astronaut who doesn't believe in the moon,'' said parishioner Lesley Pritchard-Gordon. </P>
