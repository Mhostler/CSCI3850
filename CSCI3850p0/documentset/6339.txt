<P>  The wife of an American held in an Iraqi jail made a personal appeal to President Clinton Saturday to free her husband, but Secretary of State Warren Christopher blamed Baghdad for the lack of action. </P>
<P> Linda Barloon, appearing on videotape during Christopher's appearance on CNN's ``Evans and Novak'' program, asked Clinton, ''What are you doing? What have you done?'' </P>
<P> ``I'm asking you directly. Take action,'' she said. </P>
<P> Mrs. Barloon and Kathy Daliberti, whose husband is also jailed in Iraq, said Friday in a CNN interview from Baghdad that the men were in poor health and unable to handle the physical stress of imprisonment. </P>
<P> They expressed frustration at not meeting with any Iraqi officials and at not getting information from U.S. officials on what is being done to win their husbands' release. </P>
<P> David Daliberti, 41, and William Barloon, 39, were arrested in Iraq March 13 after crossing the border from Kuwait. They claimed it was a simple wrong turn that got them there, but Iraq sentenced each to eight years for illegal entry. </P>
<P> Christopher acknowledged the wives' obvious frustration, and expressed sympathy, but said: ``This is really the fault of the Iraqis ... the Iraqis ought to release them.'' </P>
<P> Pressed on what the Clinton administration was doing to win their freedom, Christopher said the United States was playing every diplomatic card available. </P>
<P> ``We're doing every single thing we can. That means we are contacting countries that have a better relationship with Iraq than we do ... We're doing it through the United Nations. We're making all the contacts we can,'' he said. </P>
<P> But Christoper stressed that one thing the United States would not do was ``make concessions to another government.'' </P>
<P> Barloon suffered chest pains earlier in the week and was taken to a Baghdad hospital. Daliberti went with him for precautionary reasons. </P>
