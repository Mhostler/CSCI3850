<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Northern California was pounded with rain, hail, snow and high winds Wednesday, making driving hazardous and leaving thousands without electricity. </P>
<P> The arrival of spring brought no letup in a series of powerful storms which have twice brought widespread flooding to California this year. </P>
<P> A cold Alaska storm front arrived over northern California during the night, unleashing heavy rain and hail and creating blizzard conditions in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, where up to three feet of snow fell over a 24-hour period. </P>
<P> ``The (San Francisco) Bay area is having very heavy thunderstorms and precipitation,'' National Weather Service forecaster Kathy Clark said. </P>
<P> Clark said she expected snow, falling at low elevations, could cause many highway closures Wednesday evening in parts of northern California. </P>
<P> Bad weather was a factor in at least one fatal road accident. The California Highway Patrol said a 32-year-old woman was killed in a head-on collision Tuesday in Contra Costa County, east of San Francisco, on a road made slippery by heavy rain and hail. </P>
<P> Rivers in northern California were rising, but flood experts said they did not expect a repetition of the severe flooding which inundated hundreds of homes and businesses earlier this month. </P>
<P> Some San Jose residents voiced concern about the rising Guadalupe River, which overflowed two weeks ago and flooded part of the downtown area. </P>
<P> Strong winds blew down power lines, leaving 45,000 northern and central California residents without electricity at one time or another since Tuesday night, said Cory Warren, a spokesman for Pacific Gas & Electric Co. </P>
<P> A 60-mile mountainous section of Interstate 80, one of the two main northern California routes over the Sierra Nevada, was closed due to blowing snow and poor visibility, the California Department of Transportation said. </P>
<P> President Clinton declared much of California a major disaster area after storms earlier this month which killed 14 people and forced 10,000 to evacuate their homes. </P>
