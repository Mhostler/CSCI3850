<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY, (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Mexican labor leader Fidel Velazquez proposed Monday that workers should give a day's wages to help pay back the $50 billion in international aid offered to rescue the peso. </P>
<P> ``We will propose to the workers that they give a day to pay this debt,'' Velazquez, a 94-year-old government stalwart who has headed the country's largest labor confederation for more than half a century, told a news conference. </P>
<P> His proposal, reported on national radio, sparked immediate protest calls from listeners, who said they were outraged that the country's low-paid workforce should be asked to pay for the Dec. 20 devaluation. </P>
<P> Reporters at the news conference asked why workers should help bail the country out of a crisis that many blame on excess speculation from well-heeled investors in the country's financial markets. </P>
<P> Mexico's minimum wage is the equivalent of $2.50 a day. </P>
<P> Velazquez, whose support has been crucial to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) during its 65 years in power, said he too would chip in a day's wages, but he declined to tell reporters how much he earns. </P>
<P> Economists say the purchasing power of Mexican workers still falls short of levels of over a decade ago, and many blame that on Velazquez who has kept a lid on labor unrest in exchange for a powerful position in the ruling party. </P>
<P> The labor leader said the proposal would be officially made Feb. 24, when the CTM, as his labor federation is known, holds its 59th anniversary. </P>
<P> He said the whip-round could add up to seven billion new pesos ($1.3 billion), a fraction of the $50 billion promised by the United States, the International Monetary Fund and other agencies last week to help shore up the peso. </P>
