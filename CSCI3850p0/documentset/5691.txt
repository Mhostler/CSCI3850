<P>  These are highlights in the history of Chrysler Corp., which billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian's Tracinda Corp. hopes to acquire in an unsolicited bid that values the nation's No.3 automaker at $22.8 billion: </P>
<P> - June 6, 1925, Walter P. Chrysler, a master mechanic who headed General Motors' Buick division, founds the Chrysler Corp. Later that year Chrysler introduces the Chrysler Four, Series 58, a car with a top speed of 58 mph. </P>
<P> - In 1927 Chrysler comes out with the popular -- and popularly-priced -- De Soto and Plymouth models. The company also acquires Dodge Brothers Inc., a producer of rugged vehicles, including one that drives into and out of the Grand Canyon. </P>
<P> - By 1929 Chrysler becomes one of the Big Three automakers along with GM and Ford Motor Co. </P>
<P> - During the 1930s Chrysler introduces developments such as an independent front-wheel suspension system, an automatic transmission and streamlined cars using curved glass windshields. </P>
<P> - During World War II, Chrysler shifts to defense production, manufacturing 18,000 models of the 32-ton Sherman M4 tank, the main combat vehicle of the Allied forces. </P>
<P> - In 1952 the Chrysler-produced Jupiter missile carries two monkeys into space. </P>
<P> In subsequent years, the company introduces such innovations as four-wheel hydraulic disc brakes, the ``Hemi'' V-8 engine, electric windows, power steering, all-transistor car radios and electronic fuel injection. </P>
<P> - In the 1960s Chrysler engineers develop an emission control system, front seat shoulder harness and a self-contained heater/defroster system. </P>
<P> - On Nov. 2, 1978, Chairman John Riccardo hires Lee Iacocca as Chrysler president. The next year, Iacocca is elected chairman. </P>
<P> - On Jan. 7, 1980, President Jimmy Carter signs the Chrysler Corporation Loan Guarantee Act, which provides $1.5 billion in federal loan guarantees to rescue the company from bankruptcy. </P>
<P> - In 1982 Chrysler returns to profitability after reporting record losses in 1981. </P>
<P> - In August 1983 Iacocco flies to Washington to pay off the federal loan guarantees seven years early. Minivans, an important new vehicle segment, are introduced the same year. </P>
<P> - In the 1980s Chrysler restructures into four units, including a financial arm, an aerospace unit, and a technology segment. It also expands by buying into foreign carmakers, including Officine Alfieri Maserati SpA, and forms a joint venture, Diamond-Star Motors Corp., with Mitsubishi Motors Corp. </P>
<P> - In 1987 Chrysler pays $800 million to make its biggest acquisition, American Motors Corp., which makes Jeeps. </P>
<P> - In 1992 Robert Eaton is named vice chairman and chief operating officer, and Iacocca steps down on Dec. 31. </P>
<P> - On April 12, 1995, Kerkorian offers to pay $55 a share, or more than $20 billion for Chrysler, in what would be the second-largest takeover in U.S. corporate history. Iacocca is a participant in the offer. </P>
