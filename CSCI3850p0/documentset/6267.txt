<DATELINE>DILI, East Timor (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Ten East Timorese went on trial Thursday on charges of disturbing public order linked to their alleged involvement in so-called Ninja gangs. </P>
<P> Five other Timorese went on trial Wednesday to answer similar charges linked to the gangs, groups of hooded youths East Timorese believe were hired by the military to scare opponents of Indonesian rule. </P>
<P> ``The defendants are charged with damaging people's property, such as houses and cars, as well as disturbing the peace,'' prosecutors said in their indictment read at the Dili district court Thursday. </P>
<P> The 15 East Timorese, along with two others who have yet to face trial, were arrested in crackdowns on the gangs, which first emerged in January. </P>
<P> Court officials said what the defendants had done was purely criminal and not political. </P>
<P> Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 after the Portuguese colonialists left and Jakarta annexed it the following year. Indonesian rule is not recognized by the United Nations. </P>
