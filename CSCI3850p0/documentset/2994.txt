<P>  A Libyan national is being held in France in a probe into the 1989 mid-air bombing of a French airliner in which 171 people died, an Interior Ministry spokesman said Sunday. </P>
<P> The spokesman said Omar Ali Mansour was detained Thursday in Paris on a warrant from anti-terrorist investigating magistrate Jean-Louis Bruguiere, who asked police to hold him until Monday, when he will question him. </P>
<P> Bruguiere has said he suspects Libyan involvement in the bombing of a French airline UTA DC-10 that exploded over Niger and crashed in the Sahara desert. Libya's failure to help the French investigation, along with its refusal to hand over suspects in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in which 270 people died, has led to United Nations sanctions against Tripoli. </P>
