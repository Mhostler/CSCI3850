<P>  Billed as the world's oldest rock and roll band, the Rolling Stones think they've still got a bit more life in them yet. </P>
<P> Speaking at the start of the Australian leg of their world Voodoo Lounge tour, the four remaining members of the five-man band that formed way back in 1962 saw no end in sight. </P>
<P> ``We're looking at people offering us shows for 1996 at the moment,'' lead singer Mick Jagger told a packed news conference Sunday. </P>
<P> But although the spritely looking Jagger, an exercise fanatic, looked as if he could make the distance, the years seem to be taking their toll on his fellow band members who began the current tour in Washington in August last year. </P>
<P> Guitarist Keith Richards, looking haggard, maybe from Saturday's flight to Melbourne from Tokyo, did not remove his sunglasses during the 25-minute indoor conference. </P>
<P> He has boasted in recent weeks that during the Stones' last tour to Australia in 1973 he was on acid the entire time and did not remember anything about the country. </P>
<P> ``There are the odd gaps,'' said Richards Sunday, dressed in his trademark black. </P>
<P> The band is expected to make $26 million from ticket sales alone from their seven Australian concerts in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Adelaide and Brisbane and up to $265 million from the 24-country, 12-month Voodoo Lounge tour which will be seen by 6.1 million people. </P>
