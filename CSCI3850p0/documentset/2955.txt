<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Senate handed President Clinton a much needed political victory Thursday, giving final congressional approval to a sweeping world trade agreement by an overwhelming bipartisan majority of 76-24. </P>
<P> Passage of the agreement in a rare post-election session of Congress culminated weeks of nonstop lobbying by Clinton, who had warned that failure to approve the accord would cripple the world economy and harm U.S. leadership efforts. </P>
<P> ``This vote for GATT shows once again that our country is moving in the right direction, reaching out to the rest of the world and looking at the best interests of our own people,'' Clinton said in remarks on the White House South Lawn, flanked by congressional leaders from both parties. </P>
<P> Reaching out to Republicans, whose strong gains in November 8 elections will give them control of Congress in January, Clinton said he hoped the GATT victory would be only the first in a series of bipartisan efforts. </P>
<P> Republicans delivered 35 votes for the agreement, while 41 Democrats backed the pact. The House approved the measure Tuesday by a vote of 288-146. </P>
<P> ``With passage of this agreement the Senate will affirm the leadership role of the United States around the world ... rejection of this agreement would be a signal of American weakness,'' retiring Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said in his farewell speech to the chamber. </P>
<P> Before approving the agreement, the Senate voted 68-32 to pass a budget waiver, necessary because the GATT implementing bill does not fully offset revenue losses from tariff cuts over the first 10 years of the accord. </P>
<P> GATT supporters wrapped up the 50 votes needed to pass the accord days ago, but battled until the final hours to shore up the necessary support for the waiver -- making it the vital vote. Thirty-seven Democrats voted for the waiver, joined by 31 Republicans. </P>
<P> ``The bottom line is we just can't isolate ourselves from the rest of the world. We've got to have a big 'open for business' sign all around America,'' said Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole. ``I've always thought that we could compete with anyone else in the world.'' </P>
<P> Dole's decision to support the pact last week, after securing a series of concessions from the White House, probably clinched passage of the deal. </P>
<P> The agreement culminates seven years of negotiations under three U.S. presidents. It will cut worldwide tariffs by 38 percent, provide new protections for a wide array of products and bring agriculture under the GATT for the first time. </P>
<P> Most U.S. business and farm groups support the pact, and the administration calls the expected $750 billion reduction in tariffs history's largest tax cut. </P>
<P> The agreement is opposed by labor and environmental groups and a high profile odd couple -- conservative commentator Patrick Buchanan and Texas billionaire Ross Perot, both former presidential candidates. </P>
<P> Opponents argue the new World Trade Organization, created by the agreement to adjudicate trade disputes, would undermine U.S. sovereignty. They also charge that American trade policy has been a failure -- pointing to declining wages and a U.S. trade deficit of more than $120 billion. </P>
<P> ``This is one more big drink from the same old bottle,'' said North Dakota Democrat Byron Dorgan, saying the pact gives big business access to cheap foreign labor, depressing U.S. wages. </P>
<P> Dorgan released a congressional study he said showed the North American Free Trade Agreement had resulted in a loss of 10,000 jobs to Mexico -- figures disputed by Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, who said NAFTA created 100,000 new jobs. </P>
<P> The administration says the WTO cannot force the United States to change its internal laws and cut a deal with Dole that would make it easier for the United States to withdraw from the organization. </P>
<P> The Dole deal calls for a U.S. commission, made up of appellate court judges, to review WTO decisions. If the panel decides the WTO has ruled unfairly against the United States three times, the Congress can vote to withdraw. </P>
<P> ``This fix is in the time-honored tradition of such legendary promises as 'the check is in the mail,.' It ranks right up there with 'yes, I will love you tomorrow,''' said West Virginia Democrat Robert Byrd who said the United States had never withdrawn from any major international body. </P>
