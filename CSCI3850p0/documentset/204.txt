<P>  When the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 smashes into Jupiter Saturday, it may be with more of a whimper than a bang, astronomers said Wednesday. </P>
<P> Two reports in the science journal Nature suggest that the comet, in a deteriorating orbit around Jupiter and already torn to pieces by the planet's gravitational field, will disintegrate further before it plunges into Jupiter's atmosphere. </P>
<P> The effect would be similar to the difference between throwing a stone into a pond and hurling a handful of gravel. </P>
<P> Comets are believed to be agglomerations of ice and grit, something like a very dirty snowball. Unlike meteors, they are easily broken apart. </P>
<P> Erik Asphaug of the NASA Ames Research Center in California and colleagues studied the comet and its breakup, caused when it passed by Jupiter in July 1992. They are still not sure how it started out, but it was never a completely solid structure. </P>
<P> ``The comet was presumably either a ``rubble pile' to begin with, or else a solid body or weakly cemented aggregate shattered (when it hit Jupiter's gravity belt),'' Asphaug wrote. </P>
<P> Paul Weissman of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California said this could mean the big crash will fizzle out. </P>
<P> ``As the clumps approach for their final plunge into the atmosphere at 60 kilometers a second (134,000 miles per hour), Jupiter's gravity will again pull them apart,'' Weissman wrote. </P>
<P> ``Rather than hitting as a single solid body, they will probably come in as an elongated shotgun blast of smaller pellets. Because of Jupiter's rapid rotation, the impact sites will be spread in longitude, like machine gun bullets lacing into a moving target.'' </P>
<P> They may just skim along the upper atmosphere instead of sinking deeper down and causing big explosions, he added. </P>
<P> British astronomers have said they feared the same result. Because of the huge distances involved and the difficulties in actually seeing the comet, they are not even sure that it is a comet. </P>
<P> Astronomers will know more about the comet and its structure as they watch what happens when it crashes into Jupiter. </P>
