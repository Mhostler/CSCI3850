<P>  Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole told the Senate Thursday he hopes to schedule a vote sometime next month on ending U.S. participation in the Bosnia arms embargo. </P>
<P> ``It's our hope that we will be able to vote on lifting the arms embargo in the U.S. Senate hopefully sometime in June,'' Dole said in Senate comments.  ``It seems to me that everything's falling apart,'' Dole said. ``We're getting less and less response from the United Nations.'' </P>
<P> ``It seems to me that the time has come for a total review of our policy,'' Dole said. ``And I would suggest to the president of the United States that he provide the leadership of this review and that we do it as quickly as possible.'' </P>
<P> Dole has been a leader in drives in both the Senate and House of Representatives to end U.S. participation in the U.N. arms embargo against Bosnia on grounds that Bosnian Muslims should be able to arm and defend themselves against Serbs. </P>
<P> He has said this may also force Serbs to accept peace. </P>
