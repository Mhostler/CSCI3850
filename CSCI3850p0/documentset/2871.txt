<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Norwegians rejected membership in the European Union by a narrow margin in a referendum Monday, according to two exit polls broadcast on television moments after the voting ended. </P>
<P> But leaders of the ``Yes'' and ``No'' sides refused to draw any conclusions on the basis of the exit polls. </P>
<P> ``I think the turnout will be decisive,'' Kristen Nygaard of the ``No'' side said. ``I don't want to speculate at all until we have a final result.'' </P>
<P> ``This looks very exciting,'' Inge Loenning, who heads the pro-EU lobby, said. ``I don't think it is over yet and we should be cautious about drawing any conclusions. I still hope there will be a 'Yes.''' </P>
<P> Full results could take hours to be registered. </P>
<P> Final opinion polls showed the pro-EU lobby had rallied strongly and was neck and neck with the ``No'' side whose comfortable lead appeared to be evaporating. </P>
<P> A majority of Norway's 3.2 million voters, many of whom fear giving up sovereignty to a faraway Brussels bureaucracy, have been widely projected to oppose membership, as they did in a similar referendum in 1972. </P>
<P> But the lead of the ``No'' side in opinion polls had gradually shrunk as the pro-Europeans intensified their campaign. </P>
<P> Electoral officials reported an unusually heavy turnout but stormy weather in the far north, which is a ``No'' stronghold, could work in favor of the ``Yes'' side. </P>
<P> The government had urged intransigent Norwegians to join their Nordic neighbors in entering the EU to gain a voice in shaping the economy and environment of Europe. </P>
<P> Norway is the last of four countries which had negotiated terms to enlarge the union to 16 member states. Austria, Finland and Sweden all voted to join in referendums earlier this year. </P>
