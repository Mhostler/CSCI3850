<P>  The future speaker of the House of Representatives said Friday he would oppose a multibillion-dollar U.S. aid package for Bosnia's Muslim-led government, calling the war-torn country ``a European problem.'' </P>
<P> Rep. Newt Gingrich, who is expected to take over as House speaker Jan. 4, also told reporters that the overwhelming portion of any aid package for Bosnia would have to come from wealthy European nations. </P>
<P> ``I can't imagine, given the current budget constraints, that this administration would commit itself to $5 billion in aid to Bosnia,'' the Georgia Republican said. </P>
<P> ``It certainly would not be a step towards a balanced budget and it wouldn't be a step towards a strong American military. I'd be very skeptical of that kind of proposal.'' </P>
<P> Gingrich's remarks followed questions by reporters about the Clinton administration's reported plans to send up to $5 billion in military aid to the Bosnian Muslims, along with a military training program for their army. </P>
<P> ``Frankly, I can't imagine why we would go in and provide that kind of money. So, I hope the report is not accurate,'' Gingrich said before a Pentagon spokesman confirmed details of the report. </P>
<P> ``Bosnia is largely a European problem. The Germans and the French and the British and the Italians are more than wealthy enough to provide the overwhelming bulk of the aid.'' </P>
