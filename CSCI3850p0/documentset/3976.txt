<P>  Cult science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke received an honorary university degree -- beamed through space from Britain to his home in Sri Lanka -- Thursday. </P>
<P> Clarke, author of ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' which became a hit film, rarely leaves his home as he suffers from post-polio syndrome. So Liverpool University conferred the degree by satellite link in what it believed was a world first. </P>
<P> The degree was conferred on the 77-year-old author, seated in the studios of Sri Lanka's state broadcasting organization in Colombo, by the university's vice chancellor, Philip Love, via Intelsat satellite. </P>
<P> The satellite link was plagued by problems with the sound system but the picture proved to be perfect. </P>
<P> ``Let me say how flattered I am by your kindness. I do appreciate all the work that has been done by so many people and so many computers to make this occasion possible,'' Clarke said. </P>
<P> He welcomed Liverpool University's decision to launch a science fiction course. ``It is about time we caught up with the Americans. There have been hundreds of courses in science fiction in the United States and we should recognize its importance as a link between the two famous cultures.'' </P>
<P> Clarke, who was born in Britain but spent much of his life in the United States, can now call himself a doctor of Letters. </P>
<P> After World War II, Clarke said man would reach the moon by the year 2000, an idea dismissed by experts as rubbish. </P>
<P> Clarke was the first to propose in 1945 the use of geostationary communication satellites to enable radio and television signals to be broadcast around the globe. </P>
<P> Clarke's latest book, ``The Snows of Olympus,'' is a guide to how humanity's colonization of Mars might take place. </P>
