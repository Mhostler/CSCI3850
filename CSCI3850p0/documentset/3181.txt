<P>  The familiar wail and drone of the nation's emergency broadcast system will give way soon to a new high-tech method of alerting the public to storms and catastrophe -- even when TV sets and radios are turned off. </P>
<P> The federal government Tuesday took the wraps off a new ''Emergency Alert System,'' which will transmit information faster, emit a shorter warning signal, and require less intrusive routine tests over the airwaves. </P>
<P> Radio and TV broadcasters, as well as the nation's cable systems will be required to install new equipment. Satellite broadcasters and other new services can voluntarily take part. </P>
<P> Eventually, TVs, car radios, compact-disc players and other consumer products will be equipped with technology that allows the signals to reach people even when they're not tuned in to their electronic gadgetry. </P>
<P> Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chief Reed Hundt said such a warning system would lessen the chance that alerts could be missed by people who don't happen to have their radios and TVs turned on as storms or other disasters loom. </P>
<P> Five years ago, he said, his wife's ``sixth sense'' told her to gather their three children and take refuge in the basement minutes before an approaching storm ripped through the neighborhood and flattened their house. </P>
<P> ``In the future, we won't have to rely on luck,'' Hundt said at a news conference to show off the new system. ``It won't be just a sixth sense that saves people -- it will be modern communications.'' </P>
