<P>  President Clinton has ordered an independent oversight board to conduct a government-wide review of allegations surrounding the deaths in Guatemala of an American citizen and a guerrilla married to an American lawyer, a senior U.S. official said. </P>
<P> Clinton also ordered the Justice Department to look into allegations some documents have been destroyed in the cases, said the official, who was traveling with the president in Tallahassee, Fla. </P>
<P> He said the president issued the orders after arriving in the Florida capital Wednesday night. </P>
<P> Last week, Rep. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., charged that Julio Roberto Alpirez, a Guatemalan colonel who was on the CIA payroll at the time, ordered the killings, and that the CIA had concealed its knowledge of the cases for years. </P>
<P> ``The president, after his arrival in Tallahasee, ordered the Intelligence Oversight Board to conduct a goverment-wide review of allegations surrounding the deaths of (Michael) Devine and (Efrain) Bamaca (Velasquez),'' the official told Reuters, speaking on condition he not be named. </P>
<P> ``He's also asked the relevant agencies that are looking into the matter, including the Justice Department, the CIA and the State Department, to make a review of any and all documents or information related to the case,'' the senior official said. </P>
<P> The official was confirming a report in The Washington Post about the president's orders to the oversight board, which is charged with reporting on any intelligence activities that may be unlawful or contrary to presidential orders. </P>
<P> Separately, Clinton issued an order to all federal agencies to preserve any documents related to the inquiries into the two killings, the senior official said. </P>
<P> And, the president instructed the Justice Department to open an inquiry into allegations that information about the cases was destroyed, he said. </P>
<P> The CIA's inspector general already has been investigating the question of who knew about the two men's deaths, and when. </P>
<P> The official said that Clinton acted out of concern that there may be interference with the inquiries into the deaths, which occurred before he became president. </P>
<P> ``There are some allegations that relate to current activity that might hinder the inquiries that he has ordered and that are already being conducted by the CIA. Obviously, he wants those to proceed without any interference,'' the official said. </P>
<P> Torricelli earlier informed the White House that an anonymous employee of the National Security Agency had charged that the NSA and the Army may have been involved in the murders and that both agencies were trying to conceal their roles by shredding documents, the Post said. </P>
<P> It said Torricelli's office received an unsigned letter, printed on NSA stationery, claiming that the CIA and Pentagon were aware of the circumstances of the murders at the time they occurred. </P>
<P> The letter claimed ``extensive communication intercepts by the NSA in Guatemala during the time of these murders clearly substantiate that the CIA and the DOD (Department of Defense) knew, at that time, the circumstances'' of the murders. </P>
<P> Acting CIA Director William Studeman last week said the CIA did not learn of the murders until long after they occurred. </P>
<P> The Post said the NSA letter claimed that U.S. Army Special Forces personnel in Guatamela were providing information to Alpirez regarding Bamaca and Devine. </P>
<P> It quoted Army spokesman Col. Donald Maple as saying the Army considering the allegations ``serious'' and was looking into the matter. But it quoted Lt. Gen. Paul Menoher as saying there was ``absolutely no truth'' to the allegations. </P>
