<P>  An Italian who last year become the world's oldest woman to give birth, at the age of 62, said Wednesday that she intended to try for another child. </P>
<P> Rosanna Della Corte, now 63, gave birth to a boy last July after a donor's eggs, fertilized with her husband Mauro's sperm, were implanted in her uterus. </P>
<P> She said she hoped to begin treatment for a similar artificially-assisted pregnancy next month at a fertility clinic in Rome run by specialist Severino Antinori, who delivered her son Riccardo. </P>
<P> ``I really want a brother or sister for Riccardo but I don't care what sex the baby is,'' Della Corte, who lives north of Rome near the town of Viterbo, said by telephone. </P>
<P> Asked to comment on a magazine report that she now wanted another child, she said: ``If there are the necessary (health) guarantees, I'm going to go ahead.'' </P>
<P> So-called ``granny pregnancies'' have unleashed an ethical storm in Roman Catholic Italy, where lack of legislation has attracted post-menopausal women who want to have children. </P>
<P> The Vatican's chief moral theologian Gino Concetti, whose views are known to be close to Pope John Paul's, said when Della Corte's son was born that the ``means by which her desire was realized is in open contrast to God's plan.'' </P>
<P> Della Corte turned to Antinori for help after her only child, a 17-year-old son also called Riccardo, was killed in a highway accident. </P>
<P> Antinori has defended his pregnancy program for women beyond normal child-bearing age, saying his yardsticks are life expectancy and a woman's physical and mental health. </P>
<P> ``I would say that a 63-year-old woman with a life expectancy of between 20 and 25 years is the oldest woman I would help,'' he said last year. </P>
