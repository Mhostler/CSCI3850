<P>  Eight people have been charged in a scheme which smuggled about 100 Chinese illegal immigrants into the United States and then kidnapped and subjected them to extortion, U.S. prosecutors said Tuesday. </P>
<P> The indictment unsealed in Manhattan federal court alleged that the defendants were part of an organization that recruited citizens from China to emigrate to the United States for a fee. </P>
<P> The organization required the ``recruits'' to pay part of the fee prior to their departure with the balance to be worked off during their first year in the United States. </P>
<P> If convicted of the all charges, most of the defendants face a possible maximum term of life in prison without parole. The defendants are all Chinese nationals. Some are legal U.S. residents while others are illegal immigrants. </P>
<P> Manhattan U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said the 13-count indictment alleged the victims were smuggled by ship and then loaded onto a small fishing trawler which took them to the shore of New Jersey. </P>
<P> They were then held against their will and transported to ''safe houses'' in New Jersey, Maryland and New York. </P>
<P> The indictment alleges that the immigrants were held hostage at these safe houses and a ransom -- often more than $30,000 -- was demanded by members of the scheme. </P>
<P> Some of the immigrants were ordered to make telephone calls to friends and relatives in China and the United States in order to extort money from the aliens and their families. </P>
<P> The indictment alleged that the victims were beaten and threatened with death if they could not come up with the money. </P>
