<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The forces which slammed an American Eagle flight into an Indiana farm field, killing all 68 on board, had never been seen before in other recorded incidents involving that type of aircraft, the chief engineer for the French company which built the plane said Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``There was no drag, no lift loss'' in the moments before the plane's autopilot disconnected and it went into an uncontrollable 9,000-feet dive, Andre Bord told a government safety hearing on the crash. </P>
<P> If there was ice present on the wings, he said, it caused only a ``minimal drag level.'' </P>
<P> But ``something external appears'' in the information from the plane's sophisticated motion and control data recorder that was subjected to computer analysis, he said, sending it into a dive. </P>
<P> Asked by investigators if this was the first commercially operated ATR-72 or ATR-42 where the autopilot suddenly disconnected followed by a sudden deflection of the ailerons -- wingtip controls which keep a plane level -- he said: ``We have had several autopilot disconnect phenomena in other incidents.'' </P>
<P> But he said the Indiana accident was ``unique'' compared to other incidents. </P>
<P> The crash last Halloween night while the plane was in a holding pattern during a rainstorm was the first in the world involving an ATR-72, which has been on the market for five years. Safety experts have said they believe icing was the cause. </P>
<P> Bord works for Aerospatiale of Toulouse, part of Avion de Transport Regional, which is owned by the French firm and Italy's Alenia SpA. </P>
<P> The company announced at the hearing that it was about to test a new de-icing system for the ATR-72 and the smaller ATR-42, both of which are popular with short-haul carriers in the United States and elsewhere. </P>
<P> The system involves an extension of the ``boot,'' a neoprene covering of the leading edge of the wing which can be inflated to break up ice when it forms. The company said it will extend the boot covering almost twice as far back on the wing than at present, and retrofit all planes with the new device. </P>
<P> It said a plane equipped with the new system was enroute to the United States and would be tested at Edwards Air Force Base in California by having a tanker plane spray water on the ATR-72 in flight. </P>
<P> In another development Wednesday, American Eagle asked for an additional search of the field where the plane crashed four months ago after family members of some of the victims said not all of the human remains had been recovered. </P>
<P> The airline made available a report from the Indiana State Emergency Management Agency indicating that state and local officials concluded last month that all of the remains had been found. </P>
<P> But some family members attending this week's National Transportation Safety Board hearing in Indianapolis into the crash traveled to the crash site near Roselawn, Ind., about 40 miles southeast of Chicago on Tuesday and said they had recovered fragments that appeared to be human remains, including a bone fragment. </P>
<P> Eagle, a unit of American Airlines' parent company, AMR Corp., said it was asking the emergency management agency ``to immediately assemble the appropriate parties to coordinate an additional inspection of the accident site and report promptly the results of its review.'' </P>
<P> The county coroner in the area said he had not seen the bone fragment -- which the family members brought to the hotel where the hearing was being held -- but said he would be willing to examine it. </P>
<P> The sister of one victim meanwhile filed suit against American Eagle in federal court in Chicago asking for an order to prevent any of the crash debris from being destroyed. Family members contended it was being shredded and said they had not been given any personal effects from the passengers or crew that might have been recovered. </P>
<P> The emergency management agency report said that 65 truckloads of soil had already been removed from the farm field and had been replaced by 120 truckloads of new soil, each weighing about 22 tons. </P>
<P> It was not the first controversy involving the crash site. </P>
<P> Some family members have complained publicly that the remains they received were misidentified, and that they had not been informed of a mass burial of unidentified body parts that was conducted by local officials. </P>
<P> There was also a dispute over payment between the airline and the Indianapolis company hired to clean up the site. </P>
