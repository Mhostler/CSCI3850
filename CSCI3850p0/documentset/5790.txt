<P>  Bosnia's National Museum director said he had resigned in protest over the rare display of a priceless medieval Passover book at Sarajevo's synagogue. </P>
<P> ``Using the 700-year old book at a time when the town is being shelled on a daily basis, when a whole network of international agents is waiting to pounce on it surprised me a lot,'' Dr Munever Imamovic said in a letter published in the city's Oslobodjenje newspaper on Monday. </P>
<P> ``Regardless of how old, valuable and significant the Haggadah is, we can see that powerful people can take it whenever they want.'' </P>
<P> The Sarajevo Haggadah, as the book is known, was hand- painted and illustrated in northern Spain in the latter half of the 14th century. </P>
<P> Its survival mirrors the trials of Sephardic Jews driven from Spain and Portugal in 1492, a significant number of whom settled in Sarajevo by the middle of the next century. </P>
<P> Bosnia's Moslem president Alija Izetbegovic agreed to display the book on Saturday at the request of the Sarajevo Jewish community to dispel rumours it had been sold and the proceeds used to purchase weapons for his army. </P>
<P> ``I think there's a little bit of hurt ego involved here,'' Ivan Ceresnjes, president of Sarajevo's small Jewish community, said of the museum director's complaint. </P>
<P> ``The book was returned with all precautions after being with us for only two hours.'' </P>
<P> Special units of the Bosnian army and police were on hand to protect the Sarajevo Haggadah during its brief outing -- only the second time the book has been displayed since World War Two. </P>
<P> Staff from the National Museum spirited the book to safety in the mountains west of the city when invading German soldiers arrived in 1941. It spent the war hidden under the floorboards of a shepherd's house. </P>
