<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Police killed five suspected Muslim militants in south Egypt Saturday in three separate raids, raising the death toll from violence in one week to 19, security sources said. </P>
<P> An Interior Ministry statement Saturday said security forces shot dead fugitive militant Khaled Hamdi Karim in a raid on his hideout in the town of Beni Suef, 65 miles south of Cairo. </P>
<P> The statement said Karim was on the run from a 10-year jail sentence handed down in his absence by a military court for his alleged involvement in last December's attack against German tourists in the Red Sea resort of Hurghada. Two Germans and two Egyptians were killed in the attack. </P>
<P> The statement said Karim shot at police first and was killed when they shot back. Police usually say militants open fire first but human rights groups say security forces shoot first and have criticized police for shooting at rather than arresting miliants. </P>
<P> Earlier Saturday, security sources said police at Adwa village in Minya province, 160 miles south of Cairo, attacked the hideout of what they called two dangerous terrorists wanted for involvement in attacks on junior policemen in recent months. </P>
<P> The sources said police killed Essam Ahmed Saad and Omar Mohammad Hussein when they refused to surrender during a police raid on their hideout in a deserted house at the village. </P>
<P> In a similar raid on the cemetery of Naga' Hammadi in Qena province, 280 miles south of Cairo, police killed Ahmed Ismail Marzouk, 19, and Mohammad Abdel-Hamid Naeem, 27, also suspected of involvement in attacks against police. </P>
<P> The five are believed to be members of al-Gamaa' al-Islamiya (Islamic Group), Egypt's largest militant organization seeking to overthrow the government and to establish a strict Islamic state. </P>
<P> More than 670 people have been killed in violence between al-Gamaa' militants and the police over the past three years. Human rights groups have said Egyptian security forces shoot to kill when tracking down militants. </P>
<P> Minya has been the center of violence in the past few months. Militants use the vast sugarcane fields and nearby mountains as hideouts from which to carry out hit-and-run attacks against police. </P>
<P> Eleven militants, four civilians and four policemen were among the 19 people killed since the beginning of this week. </P>
