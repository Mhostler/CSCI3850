<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle said Monday that Republican Sen. Mark Hatfield should be commended rather than attacked for putting principle over party in voting against the balanced-budget amendment. </P>
<P> Hatfield was the only one of the Senate's 53 Republicans to oppose the amendment, which lost by one vote. </P>
<P> Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole switched his vote after the outcome was certain in a procedural move so he could bring the amendment up for a vote later this year or in 1996. </P>
<P> Hatfield, a moderate from Oregon, said he voted against the amendment because it could change the way in which the constitution was interpreted. </P>
<P> ``It's awful,'' Daschle told reporters. ``I can't image that anyone could be chastized for putting principle over politics. The fact is that Mark Hatfield did just that. And I don't think anyone should be criticized for that. </P>
<P> ``I really believe that Mark Hatfield should be commended,'' Daschle, of South Dakota, said. </P>
<P> At the White House, presidential spokesman Mike McCurry also did some political tut-tutting over Hatfield's treatment. </P>
<P> ``It seems a sad day when someone who is a moderate within his own party, within the legislative branch, finds himself almost an outcast, put there by those who have an extreme view,'' McCurry said. </P>
<P> Dole said Sunday that many Republicans wanted Hatfield stripped of his post as chairman of the powerful Appropriations Committee as punishment. </P>
<P> Hatfield offered to resign from the Senate just before the vote on the balanced budget amendment, which would have allowed it to pass, but Dole rejected the idea. </P>
<P> Daschle said Hatfield would be welcomed in the Democratic party, but added he was sure Hatfield had no plans to switch. </P>
<P> Last Friday, Colorado Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell switched from the Democratic to Republican party. He said one of the main reasons he changed was because the balanced budget amendment which he voted for was defeated by Democrats with Hatfield's help. </P>
<P> Campbell's switch gave the Republicans a 54-46 majority. </P>
