<P>  Team New Zealand made Kiwi history at the America's Cup trials Tuesday by racing -- and winning -- with a woman on board for the first time in New Zealand's America's Cup history. </P>
<P> Maury Leyland stepped into the key role of tactician, replacing Tom Schnackenberg, for Team New Zealand's race against Pedro Campos's Rioja de Espana. Peter Blake switched almost half of his crew for the concluding race of round two of the challenger trials. </P>
<P> ``I can't believe it,'' Leyland said. ``It was a dream, something I have hoped to do since I was very small.'' </P>
<P> While Leyland's recruitment was notable, the day's racing was not. Light and shifty winds provided slow and frustrating conditions. </P>
<P> Rioja de Espana threw some fireworks onto the race course in the early part of its match -- leading Team New Zealand for three legs -- but the excitement died as Blake's team hauled Campos in and went on to win by 20 minutes, 50 seconds, passing the duel between Chris Dickson's Tag Heuer and Marc Pajot's France 3 en route. </P>
<P> Dickson and Pajot raced the closest match of the day, a victory for Tag Heuer. The two raced boat-for-boat around the entire course and the three-minute final margin belied the intensity of the race. </P>
<P> In the other challenger race, Syd Fischer's Sydney 95 suffered badly in the light and shifty airs. A bad start put Sydney 95 out of the race and Makato Namba's Nippon went on to win by a massive 32 minutes, three seconds -- the largest time difference of the series to date. </P>
<P> Team New Zealand's win consolidated its lead in the challenger standings with 16 points -- three points ahead of One Australia and Tag Heuer. </P>
<P> Kevin Mahaney's Young America closed the defenders' round two with a win over the all-women team America3 (cubed). The two points Mahaney scored for that win positioned Young America in a tie for first place in the defenders' standings with Dennis Conner's Stars & Stripes. </P>
<P> Conner's team actually lost two points on Tuesday when a match he won earlier in the series was thrown out to compensate for two postponed races that could not be made up. </P>
<P> Racing starts up again next Tuesday when both challengers and defenders begin round three. </P>
