<P> The Bosnian Serbs' self-styled parliament refused to disclose its decision on the latest peace plan Tuesday after two days of debate but it appeared the response would fall far short of acceptance. </P>
<P> Lake said the United States has not been advised of the Bosnian Serbs' decision but a senior official said the expected result is ``yes with lots of conditions or no.'' </P>
<P> ``If the Bosnian Serbs response is a no or a response that is tantamount to a no, the Bosnian Serbs should understand there will be consequences of such a decision,'' Lake said. </P>
<P> He noted that in drafting the peace plan, the United States, Russia and Europe agreed on steps to be taken if combattants rejected the plan, including tightening sanctions against Serbs, expanding safe havens for Muslims, threatening new NATO air strikes and -- as a last resort -- lifting a U.N. arms embargo to let Muslims receive new arms. </P>
<P> If the Bosnian Serb response is no, and initial pressures do not force a change in position ``then the Bosnian Serbs should understand that the pressures at the (U.N.) Security Council for a multilateral lifting of the arms embargo would be irresistible,'' Lake said. </P>
