<P>  The mother and brother of Beach Boys founder Brian Wilson, claiming libel, sued HarperCollins, the publisher of a 1991 autobiography, and Wilson's former therapist for more than $15 million Monday. </P>
<P> Wilson's mother, Audree, and brother, Carl, another member of the rock group, are suing HarperCollins Publishers Inc of Delaware and Dr Eugene Landy. </P>
<P> Wilson's book describes his descent into drug use and dependency. </P>
<P> The lawsuit says Landy ``collaberated extensively in the authorship of the book, and, in doing so, altered and manipulated sources,'' according to court papers filed in U.S. District Court in Concord. </P>
<P> The lawsuit says Audree Wilson is falsely portrayed in the book as an alcoholic, unfit mother and emotional cripple. Carl Wilson is described as an emotionally troubled alcoholic, drug dealer and manipulator who used trickery to get control of Brian Wilson's money, according to the action. </P>
<P> ``As soon as the Beach Boys returned to L.A., he (Carl) had me sign a trust document, giving him control of both my money and my vote in the Beach Boys corporation, Brother Records Inc,'' the lawsuit quotes Brian Wilson as saying in the book. </P>
<P> ``I didn't know what I was signing, though he assumed it was for my protection,'' Wilson wrote. ``Carl never once tried to talk to me personally. He showed absolutely no sensitivity that I was being stripped of my dignity and rights as a human being.'' </P>
<P> The lawsuit was filed in New Hampshire because the book was widely distributed in that state, the action says. </P>
<P> Attorneys for Carl Wilson and Audree Wilson were not available for comment. </P>
<P> According to the lawsuit, the book falsely claims that members of the Beach Boys ``almost killed'' Brian Wilson by forcing him to write songs and produce records even though they knew doing so would worsen his deteriorating mental and physical health. </P>
<P> The lawsuit also contends the book's claim that the band arranged for therapy for Wilson solely to have him fit enough to work to land a lucrative record contract is false. </P>
<P> Audree Wilson is asking for more than $5 million. Carl Wilson is seeking more than $10 million for damage to his reputation and money lost from drops in record sales, merchandising and concert tours. </P>
<P> The Beach Boys formed in 1964. Their California surfing sound caught on quickly with hits like, ``Surfing Safari'' and ''Little Deuce Coupe.'' </P>
