<P>  A childless Japanese couple are expecting twins from eggs donated by an Asian-American and inserted into another American who will give birth to them. </P>
<P> It will be the first case in Japan of test tube babies with three mothers, the Tokyo agent for the Infertility Center of America said Thursday. </P>
<P> The woman and her husband, both in their 40s, could not have a baby because she had lost her womb, said Yuki Sumi, the agent for the San Francisco-based center. </P>
<P> The couple had earlier tried to adopt a child in Japan but were turned down because of their ages and health problems. </P>
<P> Sumi said sperm from the husband was sent to San Francisco and used to fertilize eggs donated by the 21-year-old college student of Chinese descent in a test tube. </P>
<P> Six of the 17 fertilized eggs were implanted in the womb of a 30-year-old white American, who had previously given birth to a child conceived with her own husband. </P>
<P> The surrogate mother has been confirmed to be pregnant and is due to give birth next year to twins who well be registered in Japan as the couple's own children. </P>
<P> In all, the couple spent about eight million yen ($81,600), including medical and transport fees and payments to the women. </P>
<P> They have never met the donor, though they saw the surrogate mother's face in a videotape. The donor and surrogate mother had separate contracts and do not know each other. </P>
<P> Under an ethics code adopted in 1983 by the Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, artificial insemination involving donated eggs and surrogate motherhood are virtually banned in Japan. </P>
<P> But infertile women desperately wanting babies have continued going to Sumi, who runs a one-woman office called the Information Center for Surrogacy, asking for help from egg donors and surrogate mothers. </P>
<P> So far she has helped 10 infertile Japanese women to have 17 babies. ``I have received no protests from the Japanese health authorities as I have done nothing illegal,'' she said. </P>
<P> ``Couples, donors and surrogate mothers are all happy, and no problems have occurred between them.'' </P>
