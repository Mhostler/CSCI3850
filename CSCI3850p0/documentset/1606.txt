<P>  U.S. forces will begin offering cash payments Tuesday of up to $300 to entice Haitians to surrender handguns, rocket launchers and other deadly weapons, military officials said Monday. </P>
<P> Radio broadcasts began informing the population about the one-month buy-back program at an airfield in Port-au-Prince. </P>
<P> Haitians will be paid $50 for any handgun they turn in, $100 for a semi-automatic weapon, $200 for automatic weapons, $300 for heavy machine guns, mortars or rocket launchers, and $100 for any type of explosives. </P>
<P> ``The goal of the program is to remove illegal and unregistered weapons in order to have a more stable and secure environment and to assist the enforcement of the Haitian Constitution which prohibits owning of automatic weapons,'' Colonel Barry Willey told reporters. </P>
<P> There are an estimated 30,000 weapons in private hands in Haiti, most of them in the hands of paramilitary groups opposed to the return of exiled president Jean-Bertrand Aristide. </P>
<P> U.S. troops landed peacefully in Haiti last week under an agreement that calls for the military leaders who ousted Aristide in 1991 to step down by October 15. </P>
<P> Willey said Haitians will be paid in local currency, the gourde, and the program will last until October 25, when weapons registration will be handed back to the Haitian police. </P>
<P> U.S. forces dismantled the Haitian military's heavy weapons unit at a barracks oustside Port-au-Prince two days after arriving. </P>
<P> Many people cast doubt on whether the weapons buy-back program, modeled after programs in U.S. cities, would be successful in reducing the number of weapons. </P>
<P> ``It is more symbolic than anything else,'' one diplomat said. ``People think of guns as protection and this is a time of real uncertainty.'' </P>
