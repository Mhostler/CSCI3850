<P>  PLO leader Yasser Arafat left Gaza for Oslo Friday to receive the Nobel Peace Prize and work toward broadening his peace deal with fellow laureates Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres. </P>
<P> Arafat's office said the PLO leader left Gaza's southern Rafah exit in a motor convoy for Egypt, where a jet provided by the Norwegian government is waiting to fly him to Oslo. </P>
<P> Unprecedented security measures are to greet the leaders in Oslo, where their fragile peace pact on Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho was hammered out in secret talks before the three sealed the deal with handshakes on the White House lawn in September, 1993. </P>
<P> Arafat was accompanied by his pregnant wife Suha and a small group of advisers and journalists, his office said. </P>
<P> Earlier Rabin and Peres left Tel Aviv's Ben-Gurion Airport in an Israeli military airliner accompanied by about 100 guests, staff, and security personnel, witnesses said. </P>
<P> Arafat, meeting Peres Thursday to discuss differences over widening the peace deal to include the still-occupied West Bank, teased his Israeli counterparts on their superior travel arrangements. The Norwegian jet has eight seats. </P>
<P> Alluding to the agreement that limits his Palestinian Authority to light aircraft, Arafat said: ``I would like to have an airplane for my air force, but I haven't.'' </P>
