<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  To head off more violence in Haiti, there will be a heavy U.S. military presence at demonstrations Friday supporting ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the Pentagon said Thursday. </P>
<P> ``I think there's concern about the possibilities for problems tomorrow,'' spokesman Dennis Boxx said. </P>
<P> The Pentagon said U.S. forces have increased to 19,600, far higher than the 15,000 planned, and Boxx said one reason for keeping the number high is to try to prevent violence at the demonstrations and celebrations Friday. </P>
<P> He made the comment even before an explosion occurred during a pro-Aristide demonstration near the Port-au-Prince docks Thursday, one of several blasts that U.S. officials in Haiti said caused 40 casualties. </P>
<P> U.S. defense officials said in Washington that up to 30,000 Haitians might be out Friday for demonstrations in support of Aristide on the third anniversary of his ouster by military coup leaders. Aristide is to return to power about October 15. </P>
<P> They said members of a paramilitary group that supported the military government are supposed to help police the demonstrations but their presence might spark violence. </P>
<P> ``I think you will see a significant (U.S. military) presence'' at the demonstrations, one official said. </P>
<P> The Defense Department said the U.S. force in Haiti has increased to 19,600 with another 9,200 in ships offshore and Boxx said those numbers ``may go a little higher frankly.'' </P>
<P> Defense Secretary William Perry and other U.S. defense officials have repeatedly said the U.S. force in Haiti is to total about 15,000 troops. </P>
<P> Boxx said the reason for the difference is that many of the troops who were there for an invasion have not left, even though the invasion was headed off in a deal made by former President Jimmy Carter for U.S. troops to enforce a peaceful transfer of power to Aristide by October 15. </P>
<P> Boxx said about 1,900 Marines, for example, remain around Cap Haitien on Haiti's north coast and have not been pulled back to their ships in a group led by the landing ship Wasp. </P>
<P> ``Part of the reason for that is that we want to make sure we have all the assets necessary in Haiti to be able to deal with whatever we might be confronted with tomorrow,'' he said. </P>
<P> Separately, Aristide urged the U.S. Congress not to tie President Clinton's hands with legislation setting a date for withdrawal of American troops from his country. </P>
<P> ``Together, with President Clinton, we will succeed in restoring democracy to Haiti. Give us a chance in terms of not tying the hands of President Clinton,'' Aristide told reporters after a closed meeting with several members of the House of Representatives. </P>
<P> A House committee approved Wednesday a bill setting a March 1 deadline for ending the U.S. military operation in Haiti and the full House will vote on the measure next week. The Senate is considering similar legislation with a February 15 cutoff date. </P>
<P> Also on Thursday, the State Department announced the arrival in Haiti of the first 26 of an eventual nearly 1,000 international police monitors from 27 countries. </P>
<P> Raymond Kelly, 53, the former New York City police commissioner who will head the monitors, said they will not be policemen but will serve as ``mentors'' to Haiti's police which have been run as a branch of the military but are now being separated under a U.N. mandate. </P>
