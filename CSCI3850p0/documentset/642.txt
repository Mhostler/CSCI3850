<P>  The decision whether to appoint an independent counsel to investigate Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy is up to Attorney General Janet Reno, White House counsel Lloyd Cutler said Sunday. </P>
<P> Espy is the subject of a federal investigation over whether he improperly accepted free travel and gifts from the largest U.S. poultry processer, Tyson Foods Inc. </P>
<P> Justice Department officials said several weeks ago Reno was expected to request appointment of an independent counsel. </P>
<P> ``Well, it is entirely up to the attorney general to make that decision,'' Cutler said in a broadcast interview. </P>
<P> Cutler, on ABC's ``This Week with David Brinkley,'' was asked if appointment of an independent counsel was the proper course. </P>
<P> ``I have no idea what the evidence suggests,'' Cutler said. </P>
<P> ``But I have full confidence in Attorney General Janet Reno and her staff and they will come to a proper conclusion ... The independent counsel law requires the appointment of an indepdent counsel for someone like Mr Espy if further investigation is warranted.'' </P>
<P> Espy has denied any wrongdoing and says the criticism is a backdoor attack on President Clinton. </P>
<P> A 1907 law forbids anyone involved in meat inspection from accepting anything of value from meat processing firms. </P>
<P> Neither Espy press aides nor lawyer Reid Weingarten, recently retained by Espy to handle the investigation, was immediately available for comment. </P>
