<P>  President Clinton stepped back into World War II history in the Pacific Sunday before talks with President Fidel Ramos on U.S. economic dealings with the Philippines and security arrangements for Asia. </P>
<P> After an early morning jog in a tightly guarded Manila park, Clinton plunged into a daylong visit to this former U.S. colony which included a tour of the island fortress of Corregidor, where American and Philippine soldiers fought side by side against Japan. </P>
<P> Clinton, the first American president born after World War II, flew to the rocky island at the mouth of Manila Bay by helicopter. </P>
<P> With Ramos acting as his guide, he toured the ruins of concrete barracks and gun emplacements, ghostly reminders of the epic battle there. </P>
<P> He also toured the famous Malinta Tunnel on the island, known as ``The Rock,'' where Gen. Douglas MacArthur made his headquarters during the first desperate days of the war. </P>
<P> Under orders from President Franklin Roosevelt, MacArthur eventually retreated to Australia to reorganize U.S. defenses in the Pacific, leaving behind 12,000 troops who were forced to surrender to the Japanese in May 1942 after a five-month siege. </P>
<P> It was the largest surrender in U.S. history, and many of those who laid down their arms later died in captivity. Corregidor, now a Philippine park, was recaptured by the allies in February 1945. </P>
<P> After Corregidor, Clinton was scheduled to pay homage to war dead in a speech at the U.S. military cemetery in Manila. More than 17,000 Americans are buried there, making it the largest American military graveyard outside the United States. </P>
<P> His talks with Ramos were to focus on economic issues such as trade and investment, as well as post-Cold War security in Asia. </P>
<P> They would also cover sore points in relations between Washington and Manila like the quest of Philippine veterans for U.S. benefits and the plight of mixed-race children abanboned by their U.S. servicemen-fathers. </P>
<P> A White House official said Clinton told American business leaders at a breakfast meeting closed to the press that the U.S. Export-Import Bank had earmarked $100 million for various investment projects here. </P>
<P> Clinton's visit to the Philippines, the first by a U.S. president since Gerald Ford in 1975, took place almost two years to the day after the last U.S. sailors left Subic Bay, completing a military pullout forced by the Philippine parliament. </P>
<P> The visit is intended to show there are no lingering hard feelings on the issue, and to inaugurate a new era in U.S.- Philippine ties. </P>
<P> From here, Clinton goes on to Indonesia for an Asia-Pacific economic summit. The meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum will focus on creating a free trade zone throughout the Pacific by the year 2020. </P>
<P> But what has become an important secondary focus is his need to reassure Asian leaders that the Republican takeover of Congress in last week's election will not alter U.S. foreign policy. </P>
