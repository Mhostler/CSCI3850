<P>  Palestinian protesters and Jewish settlers clashed on a hilltop in the Israeli-occupied West Bank Saturday after Arabs set fire to mobile homes installed by the settlers this week. </P>
<P> About 10 settlers opened fire in the direction of the Arabs setting fire to the mobile homes at the site near the Palestinian village of Keisan and the Jewish settlement of Maale Amos, a Reuter cameraman said. </P>
<P> No one was hurt but two of the three mobile homes were burned down during a protest by some 200 Palestinians and leftwing Israelis opposed to settlement expansion, he said. </P>
<P> Palestinians say settlement expansion threatens the 1993 Israeli-PLO peace deal, which provided for self-rule initially in Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho. </P>
<P> The Israeli army said it had declared the area of the clash a closed military zone. </P>
<P> ``Several dozen Palestinians and Jewish residents of Maale Amos in the Bethlehem area gathered in the morning near the settlement on the background of a land dispute,'' an army spokeswoman said. </P>
<P> ``A number of Palestinians torched a caravan (mobile home). A number of Jewish residents opened fire in the air. There were no injuries. Three Arab residents were arrested by police,'' she said. </P>
<P> Leaders of the more than 100,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank said they were annexing lands to existing settlements for future construction. </P>
<P> The settlers installed three mobile homes on the hill a few hundred yards from Maale Amos Thursday, saying they were part of a new enclave under construction. </P>
<P> The Israeli army later issued orders to settlers to stop placing mobile homes at the site while their legal status was being checked. </P>
<P> The Israeli government has renewed a 1992 decision to freeze building in the West Bank. But a ministerial committee decided this week to continue building in several settlements around Arab East Jerusalem. Maale Amos is not among the enclaves included in the decision. </P>
