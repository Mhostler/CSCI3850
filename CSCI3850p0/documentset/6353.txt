<DATELINE>NOVA VAROS, Croatia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Serb civilians fleeing a Croatian army blitz on a rebel enclave were found dead in burning cars after apparently being caught in crossfire, U.N. sources said Sunday. </P>
<P> The refugee column may have have been riddled by small arms fire or hit by shelling which killed an undetermined number in the hamlet of Nova Varos en route to a bridge over the Sava River border to Bosnia, they said. </P>
<P> ``Some were still in their cars with the engines running and the wipers going when U.N. peacekeepers moved through. Some of the cars were burning. They said it was a terrible, pathetic sight,'' a U.N. military source said. </P>
<P> U.N. sources said retreating peacekeepers saw bodies in seven or eight vehicles but could not be certain how many. </P>
<P> U.N. Nepalese Battalion commander Lt.-Col. Nar Bahadur Kandel, whose base is one mile from the spot, would not speculate on whether the victims were accidental casualties or were deliberately targeted. </P>
<P> But he said Krajina Serb forces caught out by the surprise Croat attack on May 1-2 were firing from the hamlet with an anti-aircraft gun and mortars and ``the Croats must have targeted this area to counter those weapons.'' </P>
<P> Asked if the refugees may have been caught in a crossfire, he said: ``Could be. The column was fleeing from here to the south. Or it could have been shelling.'' </P>
<P> His account cast doubt on a report by superiors in Zagreb giving credence to allegations by Serb refugees now in Bosnia that Croatian troops had trapped them in a killing field. </P>
<P> Accounts from 100 refugees interviewed by the U.N. were so strikingly similar that they seemed ``reliable and justified,'' UNCRO spokesman Chris Gunness said. </P>
<P> Croatia has said some civilians may have died in crossfire incidents but vehemently denies U.N. charges of slaughter. </P>
<P> The Croatian government said Sunday the rebel Serb militia, withdrawing in confusion, had closed off the bridge to safety over the Sava. ``With this they created a shield compiled of men, women and children,'' it alleged. </P>
<P> Five days after the offensive, in which Croatian troops stormed over U.N. truce lines to retake the separatist pocket of Western Slavonia, the refugee corridor was still littered with abandoned cars, bicycles, umbrellas and clothing. </P>
<P> Curtains fluttered from the open windows of hastily abandoned homes. Tractors leaned drunkenly in ditches and overturned cars lay by the roadside. </P>
<P> But in Nova Varos, which was virtually destroyed in Serb-Croat fighting in 1991, the perilous route that brought thousands of civilians to safety as the battle raged bore grim, unmistakable signs that some had not made it. </P>
<P> Pushed to the sides of a stretch of road 1,500 yards long were piles of blankets, clothes, shoes, bread, potatoes, and sacks of flour, next to smashed cars and overturned farm trailers. </P>
<P> Two or three cars looked as if they had been crushed by tanks, possibly when victorious Croat forces cleared the highway. A dead pig lay among the debris. </P>
