<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn.(Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Connecticut Supreme Court Tuesday ordered a third ballot count in Norwich on the first day of hearings to determine the victor of the state's 2nd District Congressional race. </P>
<P> A three-member panel of the high court will decide if incumbent Rep. Sam Gejdenson, a Democrat who emerged the winner by a four-vote margin after a recount, is the true winner of the race. </P>
<P> The new tally is being challenged by Gejdenson and his opponent, Republican Edward Munster. </P>
<P> Gejdenson has asked that ballots be recounted in Norwich only, presumably to increase the size of his winning margin. Norwich was using a new electronic voting machine the day of the Nov. 8 election. </P>
<P> Munster's attorneys are challenging alleged discrepancies and inconsistencies in a number of the district's 54 towns and cities. </P>
<P> On election night Gejdenson appeared to be the winner by two votes. A recount left him ahead by 79,160 votes to Munster's 79,156 votes, or a four-vote margin. </P>
<P> By law the high court has until Dec. 18 to rule on the matter. The hearings are expected to last several days. </P>
<P> Meanwhile, Gejdenson was in Washington Tuesday for a vote on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Munster was in Washington also for an orientation session for new members of Congress. </P>
