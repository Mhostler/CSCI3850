<P>  President Clinton, concerned with burdens stemming from the expanding Whitewater probe, is increasing the size of the White House legal office to deal with the affair, Press Secretary Mike McCurry said Wednesday. </P>
<P> Clinton, who has been promoting his 25 percent reduction in the size of the White House staff since taking office, will have a group of at least four lawyers assigned to deal with the investigation of independent counsel Kenneth Starr and the hearings planned by the Republican-controlled Congress. </P>
<P> ``We're adding some folks to the counsel's office,'' McCurry told reporters at the White House. </P>
<P> ``This is in anticipation of coming congressional inquiries and some indications from the chairs of relevant congressional committees and subcommittees that they plan to be very active in the coming year,'' he said. </P>
<P> Jane Sherbourne, a former law partner of White House counsel Abner Mikva, will be put in charge of the group. She currently serves as an assistant in Mikva's office. </P>
<P> ``She's still building her team within the legal counsel's office that will be responding to the request that they're getting from Congress,'' he said. </P>
<P> The special team will be charged with defending the administration's role in the Whitewater affair, but will not represent individuals. </P>
<P> The team will ``represent the president and the office of the presidency,'' McCurry said, noting Clinton has ``private counsel to represent him on matters that are purely personal.'' </P>
<P> Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton have their own lawyers representing them on Whitewater issues, as do other administration officials involved in the affair. </P>
<P> The Whitewater affair began with an investigation of a land deal involving the Clintons before he was elected president, and has been expanded to cover other subjects -- including loans taken out when Clinton was running for governor of Arkansas. </P>
<P> Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, a New York Republican who heads the Senate Banking Committee, has said he hopes to launch a new round of hearings on Whitewater within the next three months. Last year, he forced the Democrats who then controlled Congress to conduct a limited probe. </P>
<P> ``Given the president's determination to cooperate fully with the congressional inquiries ... he wanted to make sure he had people on staff within the office of the legal counsel that would be prepared to represent the presidency effectively,'' McCurry said. </P>
<P> McCurry said an individual also would be named to deal with questions from the news media on the investigation. </P>
<P> ``I anticipate that there will be a lot of ... inquiries by the press to the group that will be working on the Whitewater-related matters,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``So it makes some sense to me to have someone who's fully proficient on that and someone who's working directly with the lawyers ... on the staff of the legal counsel,'' he said. </P>
