<P>  Some of France's greatest chefs are preparing meals for some of its poorest citizens during the cold winter months, Salvation Army officials said Tuesday. </P>
<P> Thirty-six chefs from the city of Lyon, the gastronomic capital of France, have agreed to cook soup for the city's homeless for the next two months. </P>
<P> The group includes Paul Bocuse, whose restaurant of the same name sports three stars -- the top rating -- in the prestigious Michelin Guide. </P>
<P> Also on the list are Pierre Orsi of Lyon's two-star Orsi restaurant, and Guy Lassausaie, president of the Lyon chefs' association, Les Toques Blanches de Lyonnaises, officials said. </P>
<P> Lassausaie organized the program -- which got off the ground in December -- in cooperation with the Salvation Army. </P>
<P> Each night, one of the chefs uses his own restaurant's kitchens to prepare about 20 gallons of ``winter soup'' -- a thick soup that includes vegetables as well as rice or noodles. </P>
<P> The soup is delivered to the Salvation Army center in Lyon, where about 80 people a night have been coming for a meal. </P>
