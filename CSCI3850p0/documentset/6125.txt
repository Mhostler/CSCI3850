<P>  The Italian government Friday decided to send troops to its southern Adriatic coast to stop an influx of immigrants arriving from Albania and other countries. </P>
<P> ``The government realizes that illegal immigration will increase in the summer and the troops will have the power to police the borders,'' said cabinet undersecretary Lamberto Cardia. </P>
<P> The cabinet approved $3 million to cover the cost of sending troops to the Puglia region, where in past weeks hundreds of Albanians, Turkish Kurds and refugees from former Yugoslavia have come ashore after crossing the narrow Strait of Oranto from Albania by boat. </P>
<P> The exact number of troops which would be part of the border control was not yet known, Cardia said. </P>
<P> He said the funding was approved as part of a decree law under which Italian troops have been sent to Sicily and the southern regions of Campania and Calabria to help police fight organized crime. </P>
<P> The troops will augment an already beefed-up border control in Puglia. Two weeks ago, the Interior Ministry dispatched 300 police officers to the region to try to curb the recent influx. </P>
<P> In 1991, about 40,000 hungry and impoverished Albanians aboard a flotilla of rusty freighters smashed their way into ports in southeastern Italy. Most were sent back to Albania. </P>
