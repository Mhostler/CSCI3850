<P>  Namibian President Sam Nujoma, whose ruling SWAPO party looks assured of a two-thirds majority in parliament after the first post-independence polls, pledged Sunday to consult the nation before changing the constitution. </P>
<P> ``No individual will decide whether the constitution needs changing, all Namibians will ultimately decide,'' the guerrilla leader-turned-president told reporters in the resort town of Swakopmund. </P>
<P> The two-thirds parliamentary majority, if confirmed when final results are annnounced Monday, gives SWAPO the right to unilaterally amend the constitution that it believes favors opposition parties. </P>
<P> Postal ballots were still being counted Sunday, but political analysts said that with more than 70 percent of the vote going to SWAPO, compared to 22 percent for the opposition Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA), the ruling party's grip on power had tightened. </P>
<P> SWAPO, which fought a 23-year guerrilla war against South Africa for control of this country of 1.5 million people, was expected to have 51 seats in the new parliament, compared to the 42 it now holds. </P>
<P> The DTA, unable to shake off its image of links with South Africa's past apartheid rulers, was expected to lose four seats, ending up with 17. </P>
<P> The remaining four would probably go to the United Democratic Front. </P>
<P> SWAPO, which has ruled Namibia since independence in 1990, has put off proclaiming victory until Monday's announcement by the independent electoral commission. </P>
<P> Nujoma, who in the presidential race crushed his only opponent, the DTA's Mishake Muyongo, thanked Namibians. </P>
<P> ``We are fighters. We are manufacturing weapons and ammunition against the new enemies...they are poverty, hunger, disease and ignorance,'' he told supporters. </P>
<P> There is little to separate the main parties politically but each draws its support from different ethnic and tribal groupings. The formerly Marxist SWAPO has its power base among the majority Owambo tribe. </P>
<P> Nujoma led SWAPO in its war against South African rule of the desert territory, twice the size of France. Independence was agreed in a deal linked to the withdrawal of Cubans from Angola. </P>
