<P>  France Sunday urged Rwanda to punish those responsible for killing thousands of people in a refugee camp and criticized conditions for international aid workers in the Central African state. </P>
<P> U.N. troops found an estimated 8,000 people dead and 650 wounded in Kibeho camp in southwest Rwanda Sunday -- mostly Hutus displaced after last year's genocide -- a U.N. official in Kigali said. </P>
<P> Witnesses said they were killed mainly by troops from the Tutsi-dominated army and in stampedes triggered by shooting on Saturday. </P>
<P> ``France condemns this violence and appeals to the Rwandan authorities to arrest and punish those responsible,'' the French Foreign Ministry said in a statement. </P>
<P> It added that France was concerned by the working conditions for the United Nations and humanitarian organisations in Rwanda, which it said had deteriorated considerably. </P>
<P> ``International aid to Rwanda should be able to benefit all the populations in need and be put in place without hindrance, respecting Rwandan sovereignty,'' it said. </P>
<P> France sent troops to Rwanda last year to protect those fleeing genocide, mainly of Tutsis and moderate Hutus, in which up to a million people died. </P>
