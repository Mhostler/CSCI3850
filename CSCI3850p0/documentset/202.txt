<P>  Tourists looking for the best value for their money should eat out in the Greek islands and Turkey, buy wine in Italy and hire a car in Malta, a travel survey released on Wednesday showed. </P>
<P> The Cost of Holiday Living 1994 compiled by travel company Thomas Cook showed a three-course meal in Greece would cost $9.20 and $10.40 in Turkey, compared to $17.10 in Florida. </P>
<P> Italy had the best value for wine connoisseurs at $3.85 a bottle, unlike Florida where a bottle would cost $8.56. But beer drinkers should head to Portugal, Tunisia or Turkey for the cheapest pint. </P>
<P> ``For those who...want to hire a car, Malta is the place to go this year, with one week's hire costing as little as $130,'' Thomas Cook said in a statement. </P>
<P> A similar rental car in Italy would go for $320 but for only $152 in Florida. The United States was also the cheapest place to buy gasoline at 39 cents a liter (quarter-gallon), as opposed to Italy where it sold for $1.02. </P>
