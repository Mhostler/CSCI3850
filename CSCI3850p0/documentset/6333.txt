<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A Saudi financier sentenced to death in his absence on charges of destabilizing Jordan was questioned by the prosecutor-general at a special state security court in Amman Saturday. </P>
<P> Mohammad Jamal Khalifah arrived in Jordan Thursday after being deported from the United States at Jordan's request. </P>
<P> ``Mr Khalifah appeared before the court's prosecutor-general who interrogated him for over four hours in the presence of the defendant's lawyers,'' a court official told Reuters. </P>
<P> ``He denied all charges levelled against him and will be tried after the interrogation process is over.'' </P>
<P> Lawyers said the court will order a new trial because he agreed to face the military tribunal. </P>
<P> Khalifah was sentenced to death in absentia, along with 10 others, by Jordan's state security court last December. He was among 25 Islamic fundamentalists accused of helping finance a plot to destabilise Jordan, including a series of bombings and plans to assassinate leading officials. </P>
<P> The defendants in the case were mostly Jordanians who fought in Afghanistan against the Soviet Union and were seized in a crackdown on Muslim radicals in January 1994. </P>
<P> Khalifah, in a letter sent to King Hussein and carried in the local press Saturday, pleaded not guilty. </P>
<P> He also is suspected by the United States of providing financial support for the militant Muslim groups Abu Sayyaf in the Philippines and Hamas in the Middle East. </P>
<P> Khalifah, a businessman, is a son-in-law of Saudi Arabian financier Usama Bin Laden who has been accused by Arab governments of financing hardline Muslim groups across the region and is believed to be in Sudan. </P>
<P> Khalifah, who was taken into U.S. custody Dec. 16, had been held without bail after being arrested for having an improper visa. </P>
<P> Through his U.S. attorneys, he has contested the charges, but said he would rather fight them in Jordan than remain held in the United States. </P>
