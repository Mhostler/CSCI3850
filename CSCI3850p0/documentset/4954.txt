<P>  The United States on Wednesday finally won its first diving gold medal of these Pan-American Games. </P>
<P> But a sombre shadow was cast over the games by death of Carlos Menem Jr, the son of Argentina president Carlos Menem. </P>
<P> A minute of silence was held before the action at each of Wednesday's events in memory of 25-year-old Menem Jr, who died in hospital on Wednesday afternoon from injuries sustained in a helicopter crash three hours earlier. </P>
<P> The United States won another four gold medals in swimming on Wednesday, and two U.S. artistic roller-skaters were expelled from the team after an altercation in the athletes' village. </P>
<P> Near the end of the day, the United States had accumulated 43 gold medals, followed by Cuba with 34 and Canada with 12. </P>
<P> The United States had suffered a frustrating time in the diving pool before Wednesday, losing the gold in the men's three meter springboard to Mexico and the women's equivalent to Canada. </P>
<P> The United States finally won when 23-year-old Dean Panaro led from start to finish to win the one-meter springboard with 404.82 points, nine points ahead of Fernando Platas of Mexico, who won the three-meter springboard on Sunday. </P>
<P> The United States Olympic Committiee anounced that artistic roller-skaters Richard Saucedo and Steven Siegmann had been thrown out of the team for ``a violation of the U.S. Olympic Committee's athletes' code of conduct.'' </P>
<P> The two left on Tuesday. Sources said they had fought in the athletes' village last weekend after consuming alcohol. </P>
<P> There were also hiccups at the rowing, where some qualifying races had to be cancelled because of a lack of competitors. In the races that did take place, the wind was so strong it blew competitors into their opponents' lanes. </P>
<P> There was a further blow to the athletics, which starts on Friday, when world 400 meters record holder Butch Reynolds pulled out of the U.S. team, further weakening a squad which is already devoid of its major stars. Officials had no explanation for the withdrawl. </P>
<P> The U.S. team has also lost Derrick Adkins, its best 400 meters hurdler, women's triple jump record holder Sheila Hudson-Strudwick, men's 100 meters specialist Tim Montgomery and women's 100 meters hurdler Lynda Tolbert. All are reported to be injured. </P>
<P> The U.S. continued to dominate the swimming, winning all but one of Wednesday's races. Canada's Lisa Anne Flood denied them a clean sweep by winning the women's 100 meters breastroke, her second gold medal of the games. </P>
<P> Seth van Neerden won the men's 200 meters breastroke for his second gold of the games while the men's 4x100 meters relay team set a new Pan-Am Games record of three minutes 18.68 seconds as they won a gold medal. </P>
<P> Josh Davis in the men's 400 meters freestyle and Amy Van Dyken in the women's 100 meters butterfly won the other golds. </P>
<P> The host nation won their first ever weightlifting gold medal in the Games when Daniel Lionel Lecman won the clean-and-jerk in the 91 kg category with a lift of 202.5 kg. </P>
<P> ``I am in a dream,'' said the 23-year-old from Buenos Aires. ''To win a gold in Argentina is the best.'' </P>
