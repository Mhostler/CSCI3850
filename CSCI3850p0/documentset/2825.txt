<P>  A cheese sandwich complete with teeth marks has been found down the back of a sofa 69 years after it was left there. </P>
<P> Two faded newspapers, including one dated from October 1925, were found beside the sandwich when 87-year-old Harry Landlin, from Peterborough in central England, broke up the heirloom. </P>
<P> ``It must have been the man who made the sofa,'' Landlin told reporters Friday. ``In those days, you didn't get a lunch break so you would eat your sandwich as you worked.'' </P>
