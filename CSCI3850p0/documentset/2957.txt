<P>  Canadian police said Thursday they recovered a valuable collection of stolen artifacts and memorabilia relating to Napoleon. </P>
<P> The collection, valued at several million dollars, was stolen last month from a private collector in suburban Vancouver. It included locks of Napoleon's hair as well as seals, a sword, medals, a bugle, epaulets, a telescope, porcelain and other items that once belonged to the diminutive emperor. </P>
<P> ``This was a very precious group of artifacts. We're very pleased to have them back,'' said detective Bob Fontaine of the West Vancouver police department. </P>
<P> A rare death mask of Napoleon had already been found by police some days ago, he said. Since the theft, the collector has decided to put the pieces up for auction. </P>
<P> Undercover police recovered the booty around dawn Thursday when they gave chase to a man who subsequently dropped two large shopping bags. They lost the man but, to their surprise, discovered the bags were stuffed full of the stolen goods. </P>
<P> France's Napoleon Bonaparte was a brillant military commander who proclaimed himself emperor in 1804. </P>
<P> He eventually fell from power and was exiled to the island Saint Helena where he died in 1821. He remains a figure of fascination for many who admire his military genius. </P>
