<P>  Severe bleeding from a gunshot wound, car accident or other traumatic injury can be stopped quickly and safely by injecting tiny substances in a gushing artery to act as a cork, researchers said Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``It's more effective and safer than surgery to stop the bleeding, and it's less expensive,'' said Dr. David Robinson, a researcher at Southern California University Hospital. </P>
<P> Instead of surgery to clamp the vein or artery, an emergency room physician can treat severe bleeding by using a slender catheter to inject particles of gel foam, tiny balloons or metal coils into a patient's vein. The procedure is typically used when a patient is bleeding profusely from injuries to their arms, legs, liver, kidney, spleen or neck, Robinson said. </P>
<P> ``The gel foam acts like a cork to block the site of the bleeding. The foam particles start dissolving in a few days, which gives the patient's artery time to heal normally and re-establish blood flow,'' he said. </P>
<P> For other injuries, a microscopic balloon or metal coil is permanently inserted to plug the vein, Robinson said. In those cases, doctors first determine whether other arteries are available to supply blood to the organ and keep it alive. </P>
<P> In a study of 61 patients treated with the microcatheter plugs, Robinson found that life-threatening bleeding was stopped in 97 percent of the cases. Two other patients required surgical repair for their injuries, he said. </P>
<P> In one recent case, Robinson said he used the technique on a patient who fell off a ladder and injured his liver. The internal bleeding was halted with an injection of gel foam and the patient went home with a functioning liver after just two days in the hospital. Had surgery been used, the patient would have been in the hospital for up to two weeks following delicate and risky liver surgery, Robinson said. </P>
<P> Robinson presented his research at the annual meeting of the Society of Cardiovascular & Interventional Radiology, a group specializing in treating medical problems with small catheters or other devices guided by radiologic imaging. </P>
