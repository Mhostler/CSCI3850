<P>  Members of Slovakia's reformed communist party said Saturday they would not form a coalition government with ex-Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, who won recent elections but has not yet formed a Cabinet. </P>
<P> The decision at a leadership meeting of the Democratic Left (SDL) party dampened prospects that a Meciar-led government will form soon to replace the interim government of Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik. </P>
<P> Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) won the elections on a populist platform six weeks ago with 35 percent of the vote and 61 seats in the 150-member parliament. </P>
<P> Meciar stunned opponents in a parliamentary session Nov. 4 when his party teamed up with the extreme right Slovak National Party (SNS) and the leftist Workers Party for 83 seats and passed a string of controversial laws. </P>
<P> The Meciar-led voting bloc assumed effective control of top committees overseeing the state broadcast media, privatization and the state intelligence service. </P>
<P> ``Since HZDS continues in executing its power in such a way which is unacceptable to SDL ... SDL will not negotiate with HZDS in participating in a government,'' said an SDL statement released at a news conference Saturday. </P>
<P> Although the Workers Party has joined Meciar in a loose parliamentary pact, it has refused to enter a government with him. His only ally is SNS, giving him 70 seats, just shy of a parliamentary majority. </P>
