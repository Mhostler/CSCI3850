<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The San Francisco 49ers ended two years of conference championship game frustration by beating the two-time defending NFL champion Dallas Cowboys 38-28 Sunday to win a berth in the Super Bowl against the San Diego Chargers. </P>
<P> ``It's a great feeling,'' said San Francisco quarterback Steve Young. ``It's something you just can't believe.'' </P>
<P> The 49ers will attempt to win a record fifth Super Bowl championship when they face the Chargers in Super Bowl 29 at Miami on Jan. 29. San Diego defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 17-13 in the American Football Conference championship game earlier on Sunday. </P>
<P> San Francisco, which has won all of its four previous Super Bowl appearances, lost to Dallas in the last two National Football Conference championship games, and made big player changes during the offseason specifically designed for this game. </P>
<P> ``It's the coaching thrill of my life,'' Niners coach George Seifert said after the win. </P>
<P> The 49ers stormed to a 21-0 lead in the opening minutes of the game and then held off a passing barrage by Cowboys' quarterback Troy Aikman to deny Dallas a shot at a record third consecutive Super Bowl title. </P>
<P> Young, emerging from the shadow of legendary former San Francisco quarterback Joe Montana, threw two touchdown passes and ran for a third score to spark the 49ers' offense. Young completed 15-of-28 passes for 155 yards. </P>
<P> Aikman, in his first loss in eight playoff games, set championship game records with 30 completions in 53 attempts for 380 yards, but he was intercepted three times and was battered relentlessly all day by the 49ers' defense. </P>
<P> Dallas receiver Michael Irvin also matched one championship game record with 12 receptions and set another with 192 yards. </P>
<P> Dallas turned the ball over on its first three possessions on an Eric Davis interception and touchdown, a Davis strip of Irvin after a reception and a fumbled kickoff by Kevin Williams. </P>
<P> The 49ers converted all three into touchdowns before the Cowboys responded with two touchdowns of their own. </P>
<P> It marked the first time in NFC championship game history that a team scored three touchdowns in the first quarter. The 28 points by the two teams tied a championship game record. </P>
<P> Dallas finally got its offense together late in the first period when Aikman threw a 44-yard touchdown pass to Irvin on third and 23. </P>
<P> Dallas's Chris Boniol missed a 27-yard field goal attempt and Young marched the 49ers back downfield for a field goal and a 24-7 lead. </P>
<P> The Cowboys answered when Emmitt Smith, playing despite a severe hamstring injury, scored with 1:56 left in the half. </P>
<P> But the Cowboys left San Francisco enough time to storm right back and pad its lead to 31-14 on a 28-yard touchdown pass to Jerry Rice with just eight seconds left in the half. </P>
<P> ``That really took the wind out of them right before halftime,'' Young said. ``That was the big play of the game. </P>
<P> ``Until then we really hadn't put it away. It looked like earlier it was going to get put away but they kept fighting back. I give them a lot of credit for fighting back. They played really hard. </P>
<P> ``It was just a death row game.'' </P>
<P> The 45 points were the most ever scored by two teams in the first half of an NFC title game. </P>
<P> Dallas got a break to start the second half when Adam Walker fumbled the kickoff at the 49ers' 25. Dallas converted when Smith blasted over from the one to cut the lead to 31-21. </P>
<P> Young took the Niners right back, marching them 70 yards in 10 plays for a 38-21 lead. Young capped the drive with a three-yard scoring run. </P>
<P> Smith finally was forced to leave the game with 10:28 left to play when his hamstring tightened. He finished with 74 yards on 20 carries and two touchdowns. </P>
<P> Dallas refused to give up, however. Capping an 89-yard, 14-play drive, Aikman hit Irvin with a 10-yard touchdown pass with 8:29 left to play to cut the lead to 38-28. </P>
<P> Barry Switzer, who replaced Jimmy Johnson as Dallas's head coach on March 30, was trying to become the first rookie coach to lead a team to the Super Bowl since Seifert did it with the 49ers in 1989. </P>
<P> Switzer may have cost the Cowboys a chance to get back into the game late in the fourth quarter when a drive stalled after he drew a 15-yard penalty for bumping an official. </P>
<P> The Cowboys had won five of six post-season meetings with the Niners. The only previous win for San Francisco was in the 1981 NFC title game when Dwight Clark caught a celebrated touchdown pass from Montana in the final minute. </P>
<P> The exuberant crowd of 69,125 was a record for a sports event at Candlestick Park. </P>
<P> Pittsburgh fans went home unhappy when the Chargers mounted a gritty come-from-behind victory in the earlier game. </P>
<P> Stan Humphries' 43-yard touchdown pass to Tony Martin gave the Chargers their first lead with 5:13 left in the game, and two defensive gems by linebacker Dennis Gibson in the closing minutes preserved the victory. </P>
<P> The winning score came when Humphries, who had been befuddled by the Steelers' defense in the first half, connected with Martin on a third-and-15 play. Martin sprinted past veteran Tim McKyer to catch the pass, capping an 80-yard, eight-play drive. </P>
<P> But it took Gibson's two standout plays to keep San Diego on top after Pittsburgh marched back to the Chargers' eight with two minutes left. </P>
<P> On second and goal from the nine, Gibson broke up a pass intended for Eric Green just outside the end zone. </P>
<P> After Pittsburgh moved to the three on third down, on fourth and goal to go for the Super Bowl, Gibson ended the Steelers' hopes by breaking up a pass intended for Barry Foster in the end zone with 1:04 remaining in the game. </P>
<P> ``It came down to one play and we were fortunate to get that one,'' said San Diego defensive star Junior Seau, who had 12 tackles and four assists despite a painful shoulder. </P>
<P> ``It was a game of peaks and valleys,'' said Seau. ``It went down to the last play. I don't know whether to cry. All I know is we are going to the Super Bowl.'' </P>
