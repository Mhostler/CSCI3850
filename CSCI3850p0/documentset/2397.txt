<P>  A U.S. Court of Appeals in Atlanta Thursday suspended a judge's ruling that barred the Clinton administration from sending back Cuban refugees being held at a U.S. naval base, the Justice Department said. </P>
<P> U.S. District Court Judge C. Clyde Atkins had ordered the U.S. government Monday to halt all voluntary repatriations of Cubans from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, also ordering that the Cubans be allowed access to legal counsel. </P>
<P> But the Clinton administration immediately asked the appeals court to stay the judge's ruling and eventually overturn it. Government lawyers contend that some 30,000 Cuban refugees held at camps in Guantanamo Bay and in Panama have no rights under the U.S. Constitution. </P>
<P> Justice Department spokesman Carl Stern said the appeals court would hear arguments Friday on whether to dismiss the suit altogether. </P>
