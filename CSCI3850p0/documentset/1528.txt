<P> Clinton, in remarks on Haiti during an arts event in the White House East Room, said 1,000 U.S. military police had landed in Haiti to monitor Haitian police activities ``and by their own presence help to deter violence.'' </P>
<P> He said that ``we strongly condemn yesterday's police violence there'' and said that Lieutenant General Hugh Shelton, commander of U.S. forces in Haiti, had met Haitian military chief Raoul Cedras and ``made clear our policy to them.'' </P>
<P> ``Our armed forces cannot and will not become Haiti's police force. But they can work to see that the Haitian military and police operate in a responsible and professional manner,'' he said. </P>
