<P>  The leader of Colombia's second largest Marxist guerrilla group is interested in a government offer to negotiate peace and end a 30-year armed struggle, the mayor of the port of Barranquilla said Monday. </P>
<P> Mayor Bernardo Hoyos said in a radio interview that he had received a letter from Manuel Perez, leader of the National Liberation Army (ELN), expressing willingness to start peace talks. </P>
<P> ``He tells me that he hopes that during this government they will be able to start something so that peace becomes a reality in Colombia,'' said Hoyos, who offered to act as a mediator. </P>
<P> Perez, a former Spanish priest who commands about 4,000 armed ELN members, is known especially for his bombing campaign against oil pipelines to protest against foreign investment in the oil industry. </P>
<P> His members are also known for extortion and kidnapping of ranchers and industrialists. </P>
<P> President Ernesto Samper said last Friday his government was ready to set an agenda for talks with the country's three guerrilla groups, including the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the Popular Liberation Army (ELP). </P>
<P> But he said they would have to show an earnest desire to lay down their arms and return to civilian life before the government would open negotiations. </P>
<P> Carlos Holmes, who was appointed by the president to explore the possibility of beginning talks, said he had received a positive response from the rebels to the offer. </P>
<P> The FARC sent a letter to the government last August expressing its willingness to discuss peace. </P>
<P> But other government officials say the rebels are fiercely divided amongst themselves over whether to renew talks with the government. </P>
<P> Former President Cesar Gaviria broke off negotiations with the guerrillas in February 1992 when they refused a temporary cease-fire and ordered an offensive with a military campaign against the rebels. </P>
