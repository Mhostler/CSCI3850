<DATELINE>ZAGREB, April 30 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Rebel Serb barricades kept Croatia's main motorway closed at ceasefire lines on Sunday after a spate of shootings that killed three Croatian motorists following the murder of a Serb. </P>
<P> The E-70 highway, crossing patches of a separatist Serb enclave, had been reopened in December under a U.N.-mediated accord to revive normal trade and travel as a basis for peace talks to reunite the country. </P>
<P> But after four months of essentially trouble-free traffic, an embittered Croatian refugee from Serb-held territory stabbed a Serb motorist to death on Friday night at a Croatian petrol station near truce lines. </P>
<P> That triggered a night of terror along the 23-km (15-mile) segment of the E-70 slicing through a Serb pocket in central Croatia as three passing Croatian motorists were killed in shooting attacks by Serb militia. </P>
<P> Five others were taken hostage but they were freed on Saturday evening in a swap for the body of the stabbed Serb. </P>
<P> UNCRO, the U.N. peacekeeping force in Croatia, said the Krajina Serb leadership had promised to remove anti-tank barriers and cement pyramids put on the highway after the shootings and reopen it after the swap. </P>
<P> But Serb barricades remained in place on Sunday and UNCRO said Croatian police at checkpoints on their side of the lines were advising motorists not to proceed for their own safety. </P>
<P> ``It is still closed. Both sides have security concerns,'' said UNCRO spokesman Chris Gunness. </P>
<P> ``What the U.N. is trying to do now is to allay the fears of both sides for the security of their people so that the highway can be reopened, we hope today,'' he told Reuters. </P>
<P> Krajina Serb authorities issued a statement saying the road would remain closed on territory under their control until further notice, Yugoslav state Tanjug news agency reported. </P>
<P> The U.N. is anxious not to let the sudden motorway mayhem turn into a crushing setback to its efforts to reconcile Croatia and its Serb minority, which revolted in 1991 against its secession from Yugoslavia and seized almost a third of the country. </P>
<P> Roadside violence erupted after a Croat, expelled from the town of Okucani in the rebel enclave four years ago, stabbed a Serb to death at Nova Gradiska petrol station. </P>
<P> Croatian police arrested the assailant. But in the ensuing overnight hours, a number of Croatian motorists transiting Serb terrain were shot at by enraged rebel militiamen. </P>
<P> Over 750,000 Croatians and Serbs had plied the E-70 without serious incident since December. The highway linked Zagreb with the Yugoslav capital Belgrade until 1991 and was once the major overland artery between central and Balkan Europe. </P>
<P> Its reopening enabled Croatian drivers to avoid detours of several hundred kilometres (miles). Serbs, in turn, emerged from their impoverished enclave to buy fuel and consumer goods. </P>
<P> E-70 car parks, especially the one at Nova Gradiska, became settings for reunions of mixed-heritage families split by the conflict. </P>
