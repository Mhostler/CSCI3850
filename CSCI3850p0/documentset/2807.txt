<P>  Fighting appeared to slow Thursday near the Bosnian town of Bihac as the United Nations worked to broker a cease-fire to prevent Serbs from overrunning the ``safe area,'' the U.N. force commander said. </P>
<P> ``What we are seeing at the moment is a slight slowing down of military activity in and around Bihac town,'' Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Rose, commander of U.N. forces in Bosnia, said at a news conference. </P>
<P> ``The civilian population are not in any increased threat at the moment from any direct firing or activity into the town,'' Rose told reporters in Sarajevo. </P>
<P> Earlier, U.N. peacekeepers reported artillery and tank fire continuing overnight and Thursday morning as Serb forces advanced within a U.N.-designated ``safe area'' around the Muslim-held town of Bihac. </P>
<P> Rose said U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) officials were trying to negotiate a cease-fire in the northwestern enclave that would allow the United Nations to create a demilitarized zone (DMZ) in Bihac town. </P>
<P> ``We are working extremely hard on getting a cease-fire there. Our plan would be to establish a demilitarized zone for the safe area that we've designated,'' Rose said. </P>
<P> ``That would entail all military elements either moving out or putting their weapons under control of the United Nations in the way that we have seen happen in (the eastern enclaves) Srebrenica and Zepa. And we would, of course, increase our military presence there enormously.'' </P>
<P> Bosnia's Prime Minister, Haris Silajdzic, confirmed fighting had subsided somewhat around Bihac. </P>
<P> ``The Bihac area is more stable now. We are working on a cease-fire in Bihac now and on a possible cease-fire in Bosnia,'' Silajdzic said after meeting Gen. Rose. </P>
<P> Asked if he supported the DMZ proposal, Silajdzic said: ``The main thing is that we help people in Bihac in a humanitarian way, because people have been without proper food since May.'' </P>
<P> About 180,000 mostly Muslim civilians have been surrounded by hostile Serb forces in the area for more than two years. </P>
<P> Muslim-led Bosnian government troops launched an offensive to break the siege in October and caught the Serbs by surprise, capturing about 95 square miles of territory. Counter-attacking Serbs from Bosnia and Croatia now have the upper hand. </P>
<P> Thousands of refugees have fled the fighting, which threatens a humanitarian catastrophe as Bosnia sinks into a third winter of war. </P>
<P> U.N. officials in Sarajevo believe the Serbs' aim is to destroy the fighting capacity of the Bosnian army's 5th Corps in Bihac rather than to overrun the safe area. </P>
<P> The U.N. tried to establish a DMZ in the eastern Bosnian enclave of Srebrenica in 1993 to prevent Serbs from overruning the Muslim population there. </P>
<P> Some government soldiers in the enclave surrendered weapons as others melted away into the mountains to fight again. Serb forces partially withdrew, but continued to block aid shipments to the remaining civilians. </P>
<P> NATO has offered close air support to the U.N. to protect the safe area of Bihac town, but so far the offer has not been taken up. </P>
<P> Gen. Rose said the Serb forces had crossed the safe area boundary to the south of Bihac town but said he hoped they would withdraw once the terms of a cease-fire were established. </P>
<P> ``At the moment they are generally respecting the safe area around the town, apart from Cazin and south ridges of the enclave that we're trying to stop at the moment and I hope at the end of it we are going to deploy the UNPROFOR troops up there around the line of that pocket or safe area and then stablize the situation,'' he said. </P>
