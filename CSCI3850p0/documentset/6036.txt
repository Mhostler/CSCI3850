<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czech Republic (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The six members of a Czech hard rock band received an eight-month suspended sentence after a Prague court ruled their 1991 album encouraged racism, the CTK news agency reported. </P>
<P> The band, called Branik, released songs which said that ``niggers'' ``gypsies'' and ``chinks'' needed to be driven to the jungle. </P>
<P> The court imposed a relatively lenient sentence because the band broke up soon after the album's release due to negative reaction from the public, CTK reported. </P>
