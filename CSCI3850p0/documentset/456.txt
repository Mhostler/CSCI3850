<P>  Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci, Washington's negotiator with North Korea, held talks in Moscow this week on Pyongyang's nuclear program. </P>
<P> Gallucci, who arrived Tuesday and completed talks Thursday, came to Russia to prepare for the resumption of U.S.-North Korean talks in Geneva. </P>
<P> His talks at the Foreign Ministry and Atomic Energy Ministry were aimed at finding a common approach to the problem posed by North Korea's nuclear program, the Foreign Ministry's deputy spokesman, Mikhail Demurin, said. </P>
<P> ``In particular there was discussion of the possible replacement of the current graphite reactors in North Korea with light water reactors. The two sides agreed ... that such a solution would be possible,'' he told a news briefing. </P>
<P> The United States and North Korea are due to resume talks in Geneva August 5. Washington has hinted it could give diplomatic and economic concessions if any arms development is abandoned. </P>
<P></P>
<P> ``According to the information available to us, North Korea has no nuclear weapons,'' he said, repeating earlier assessments by Russian nuclear experts since the crisis broke. </P>
<P> The United States believes North Korea has developed at most one or two nuclear weapons. </P>
