<P>  Videos of the complete opening statements from O.J. Simpson's murder trial will go on sale at stores across the country next week, a production company said Thursday. </P>
<P> MPI Home Video of Orland Park, Ill., said the opening moments of Simpson's trial have been packaged in two tapes, each running nearly four hours and retailing for just under $15 each. </P>
<P> The tapes include all of the defense's interrupted statement, and the reopening comments made by the prosecution. </P>
<P> The company said it plans to offer a number of ``journals'' updating the trial at future dates as well as the complete closing arguments. It said there was a market for the videos among people who work by day and cannot watch the trial and among schools and law libraries. </P>
