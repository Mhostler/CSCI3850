<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Actor Gregory Peck left Cedars-Sinai Medical Center Tuesday evening after undergoing a series of tests to probe the cause of a stomach pain he had complained of the previous night, a hospital spokesman said. </P>
<P> Spokesman Ron Wise said Peck, 78, who won an Academy Award in 1963 for ``To Kill a Mockingbird'' and who has starred in dozens of other Hollywood films over the last 50 years, was taken to the hospital from a restaurant Monday. </P>
<P> According to Daily Variety gossip columnist Army Archerd, Peck suffered from a pinched vasovagal nerve which caused him to keel over during dinner with his wife Veronique and physician Dr. Arnold Klein. </P>
<P> ``I had so many tests -- I didn't know how healthy I really was,'' Archerd quoted Peck as saying. </P>
<P> Peck has made more than 50 films including such classics as ``Twelve O'Clock High,'' ``Spellbound,'' ``The Gunfighter,'' ''Roman Holiday,'' and ``The Guns of Navarone.'' </P>
