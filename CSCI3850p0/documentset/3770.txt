<DATELINE>LONDON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Most people in Britain want Prince William, not his father Prince Charles, to become king, according to a Sunday newspaper poll. </P>
<P> ``Prince Charles' popularity has fallen to such a low that 54 percent of people now want his son to inherit the crown if he reaches the age of 18 before the queen dies,'' the Sunday Express said. </P>
<P> Forty-two percent supported Charles and 4 percent were undecided. </P>
<P> A majority of the 1,000 people questioned in the ICM survey also said that Princess Anne, Charles' younger sister, would make a better monarch. </P>
<P> The poll was taken after it was announced earlier this week that the prince's longtime mistress Camilla Parker Bowles and her husband would divorce. </P>
<P> Charles and his wife Princess Diana separated two years ago after more than a decade of marriage. Their eldest son William will be 18 in six years, but Queen Elizabeth II has given no indication that she will abdicate in favor of her son or grandson. </P>
<P> ``The long-term prospects for the monarchy are still grim. More than one in four now think the monarchy will go in the next 10 years and 29 percent say they would be better off without a royal family now,'' the newspaper said. </P>
