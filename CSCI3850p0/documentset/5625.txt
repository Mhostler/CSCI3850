<P>  The PLO, a day after two suicide bomb attacks in Gaza killed six Israelis, appealed to the United Nations to send troops to maintain security in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. </P>
<P> ``Peace in the Middle East needs urgent and courageous steps to maintain the peace process and reach its objectives,'' Palestine Liberation Organization political department chief Farouk Kaddoumi said in a statement in Tunis. </P>
<P> ``In the PLO's name, I demand the Middle East peace conference co-sponsors, and particularly the United States, to begin urgent consultations at the Security Council in order to deploy emergency U.N. forces in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.'' </P>
<P> He called also on the United States and Russia to persuade Israel to draw up a schedule for the withdrawal of its forces from the West Bank and Gaza Strip within one month and transfer security powers to a U.N. force to allow for Palestinian elections there. </P>
<P> Redeployment of Israeli troops from Palestinian populated areas in the West Bank and elections are the second stage of the 1993 PLO-Israel peace deal. They are now nine months behind schedule. </P>
<P> Israeli and Palestinian delegations are due to start a new round of negotiations in Cairo Monday to overcome political and security issues hindering faster progress to reach a new July 1 deadline. </P>
<P> The Israeli government decided to continue the talks in spite of Sunday's two suicide bombings near Jewish settlements in PLO-ruled Gaza Strip in which six people were killed. </P>
<P> Two militant groups, Islamic Jihad and Hamas, have claimed responsibility for the attacks. </P>
<P> Kaddoumi also demanded that Israeli authorities remove Jewish settlements from the Gaza Strip after U.N. forces were deployed and the polls arranged. </P>
