<P>  Federal agents were called in Thursday to investigate a bomb explosion near a California abortion clinic on the same day that anti-abortion extremist Paul Hill was convicted of murder, police said. </P>
<P> A small bomb exploded Wednesday night in a parking lot between the Planned Parenthood clinic and a financial services company in downtown San Rafael, 15 miles north of San Francisco, the police said. </P>
<P> No injuries were reported and the bomb caused only minor damage to the financial services company, San Rafael Police Commander Thomas Boyd said. </P>
<P> He gave no details about the bomb and said police had no evidence to indicate it was directed at the clinic but added ''you can draw the obvious conclusion that maybe it happened as a result of Planned Parenthood being there.'' </P>
<P> Boyd said no one had claimed responsibility for the bombing and police had no leads at present. </P>
<P> Experts from the FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms were combing through evidence at the scene Thursday, Boyd said. </P>
<P> Hill was convicted in Pensacola, Florida, Wednesday of murdering a doctor and his unarmed guard outside a women's clinic last summer. </P>
<P> Jurors were deciding Thursday whether to recommend the death penalty or life imprisonment for Hill. </P>
<P> FBI spokesman Rick Smith said the explosion could be connected to Hill's conviction. </P>
<P> ``That might be something that is related and obviously we are looking at that, but we haven't concluded, based on the early examination of the evidence, that that is the case,'' he said. </P>
<P> Diana Workman, executive director of the Planned Parenthood office, said it had not been determined that Planned Parenthood was the target of the attack. </P>
<P> ``If the evidence shows that we were the target, then this is further indication that there is a national conspiracy to shut down reproductive health providers by any means necessary,'' she said in a statement. </P>
<P> ``But we will not be stopped from providing safe, legal abortions and other reproductive health services to women who need and want them,'' she said. </P>
