<P>  American Michael Johnson became the first man ever to run 400 meters indoors in under 45 seconds on Friday to claim his first individual world record at the Reno Indoor Games athletics meeting. </P>
<P> Johnson, running a powerfully assured race, finished in 44.97 seconds to break the record of 45.02 set by compatriot Danny Everett in Germany in 1992. </P>
<P> ``It makes me feel good now that I'm an individual world record holder,'' said the 27-year-old Texan, a member of the gold medal-winning 4x400 relay team at the Barcelona Olympics. </P>
<P> ``I felt real good. I wanted to give the people here in Reno something to remember,'' said Johnson, adding that Reno's 4,500-foot altitude ``affected me, but affected me positively.'' </P>
<P> Johnson moved clear of the six-runner field that included Olympic champion Quincy Watts at about 150 meters. He held off Jason Rouser for the lead on his way to a 21.30 first lap. </P>
<P> ``I knew I needed to run 21.5 or better,'' Johnson said. ''Having to fight with Rouser helped.'' </P>
<P> Johnson raised his hands above his head and flashed the number one sign to a television camera. </P>
<P> ``I was a little surprised,'' Johnson said. ``But after reflecting on it it, I knew I was in really good shape coming in.'' </P>
<P> In the first event of the evening, Olympic heptathlon champion Jackie Joyner-Kersee set an American record in the 50-meter hurdles with a 6.67 seconds victory. The effort broke the U.S. mark of 6.84 held jointly by Joyner-Kersee and countrywoman Kim McKenzie. </P>
<P> Three hours later, Joyner-Kersee came back to beat German Olympian Susen Tiedtke-Greene in the long jump. </P>
<P> Gwen Torrance, the world's top-ranked woman sprinter outdoors last year, fought off a severe cold to win the 200 in 22.80 -- the fastest time this year and just outside of her own U.S. record of 22.74. </P>
<P> ``I've been feeling bad all week,'' Torrance said. ``But I made a commitment to run here, and I'm just really happy to have won.'' </P>
<P> In the men's 50, Henry Neal muscled away from a talented field that included the world's top-ranked 100-meter runner, Dennis Mitchell, to win in 5.63. </P>
<P> Jon Drummond of the U.S. was a distant second in 5.72, with Mitchell in fourth in 5.75. </P>
<P> In the women's mile, American Regina Jacobs outkicked Olympic 1,500-meter champion Hassiba Boulmerka of Algeria to win in a slow 4:51.62. </P>
