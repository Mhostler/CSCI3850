<P> ``I will confirm to you that they (Clinton and Major) did in fact talk about their respective schedules as they look ahead to commemorating Victory in Europe Day. However, I decline to provide any confirmation that we've got an announcement on a summit, saying only that an announcement will come at an appropriate time,'' White House spokesman Mike McCurry said. </P>
