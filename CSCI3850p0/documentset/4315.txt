<P>  Japanese police arrested a photographer and three publishing company officials Monday for allegedly selling a book of obscene nude photos, a police spokesman said. </P>
<P> He said photographer Noriaki Kano, Takeshobo Inc president Ippei Takahashi and two other publishing company officials were suspected of selling about 68,700 copies of the photo collection between last November and late January, when the book was pulled from store shelves. </P>
<P> The 192-page book features a selection of photos taken by Kano, including some showing women's pubic hair, that were used in previously published monthly photo magazines, he said. </P>
<P> The spokesman gave no further details of the case. </P>
<P> Pictures showing pubic hair were considered obscene in Japan and were banned until the end of 1992. Japanese authorities say obscenity is something that stimulates a person sexually but have not categorically defined the term. </P>
<P> Newspaper reports said Kano was the first Japanese photographer arrested over what police judged to be obscene photos published in regularly issued magazines. </P>
<P> They quoted police as saying the pictures constituted obscenity because they zoomed in on areas close to women's sexual organs in a way that appeared targeted on the sexual organs themselves. </P>
<P> Kano, 52, said earlier he would bring a lawsuit citing freedom of expression if he were arrested, the reports said. </P>
<P> Last month police raided the offices of Kano and Takeshobo in Tokyo after issuing a strong warning last July to the company over what they said were pornographic pictures printed in last August's edition of the book. </P>
<P> If convicted, the four suspects could face prison terms of up to two years or fines of $25,000. </P>
