<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  South Korea Saturday announced that this year's joint military exercises with the United States, codenamed Team Spirit, would be shelved as a gesture of conciliation to the communist North. </P>
<P> The Seoul defense ministry said in a statement the two sides had agreed to cancel the 1995 round of the massive war games to give the nuclear deal which Washington and North Korea struck in Geneva last October a chance to flower. </P>
<P> ``As the Geneva agreement has entered its initial stages of implementation, both the government of South Korea and the United States expect North Korea to fulfil the agreement faithfully,'' the ministry statement said. </P>
<P> ``With such expectations, the two sides have agreed not to hold the Team Spirit exercise slated for March this year.'' </P>
<P> The widely-expected cancellation follows the visit this week to Seoul of Winston Lord, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State, who held talks with foreign and unification ministry officials on North Korean relations. </P>
<P> Team Spirit exercises, which normally involve tens of thousands of U.S. and South Korean troops, began in 1976. </P>
<P> Washington normally drafts in large numbers of troops and military hardware for the exercise, boosting the nearly 37,000 troops currently based on the peninsula. </P>
<P> The United States has maintained a troop presence in South Korea since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. </P>
<P> The United States and North Korea last October signed a landmark pact in Geneva under which Pyongyang agreed to scrap its existing nuclear plants, where the West suspected an atomic arsenal was being developed, in exchange for the provision of new light-water reactors. </P>
<P> Weapons-grade plutonium is more difficult to extract from light-water reactors than from the graphite-moderated versions which operate in the North. </P>
<P> The first tentative stages of the deal have successfully been implemented, although North Korea has put up stringent objections to the fact that the new reactors will come from South Korea. </P>
<P> Washington and South Korea insist that the reactors must be provided by the South as Seoul is paying the lion's share of the estimated $4.5 billion cost of the Geneva deal. </P>
<P> Seoul and Washington shelved Team Spirit last year in a bid to keep Pyongyang at the negotiating table, a move which eventually paid off with the signing of the Geneva deal. </P>
<P> North Korea regularly lambasts Team Spirit as a dress rehearsal for invasion. </P>
<P> But a key element of the deal -- agreement by the North to resume talks on better ties with the South -- has so far been a non-starter and looks like becoming a major sticking point of the pact. </P>
<P> North Korea insists that before talks can resume, the South must first apologise for failing to pass on official condolences last July on the death of Kim Il-sung, the Stalinist state's founder and leader for half-a-century. </P>
<P> It has also called for the repeal of stringent South Korean security laws which ban cross-border contacts and the repatriation of prisoners Pyongyang maintains are being held in southern jails for their communist ideology. </P>
