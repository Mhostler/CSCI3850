<P>  Gerry Adams, head of the IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein, scored another point in a struggle for official U.S. recognition Thursday when he was invited to a White House St. Patrick's day party. </P>
<P> British officials could not conceal their dismay at President Clinton's decision to grant Adams a visa, lift a ban on Sinn Fein fundraising in the United States and invite him to the Irish-American event of the year on March 17. </P>
<P> The London government is holding exploratory talks with Sinn Fein after a ceasefire last September by Irish Republican Army guerrillas fighting to end British rule of Northern Ireland. </P>
<P> But it has linked upgrading talks to ministerial level with progress on taking out of service tons of IRA weapons stored all over Ireland and Northern Ireland. </P>
<P> British officials expressed disappointment at Clinton's invitation. </P>
<P> ``They (the U.S. administration) know what the situation is,'' a senior official said. ``They know very well what our view of the IRA is.'' </P>
<P> Clinton's decision was announced in Washington Thursday and included the lifting of a ban on Sinn Fein raising crucial funds among Irish-Americans for its political campaign to reunite Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. </P>
<P> Sinn Fein officials said Adams would leave for the United States Saturday and would repeat his view that Sinn Fein should be treated in the same way as any other Northern Ireland political party without delay. </P>
<P> Adams issued an eight-point policy statement Thursday which appeared to indicate the gap between Sinn Fein and London over how to tackle the issue of arms was narrowing. </P>
<P> British officials said they were studying the text closely. They suggested that it might be followed up when senior officials hold the next round of exploratory talks with Sinn Fein in Belfast, possibly next week. </P>
<P> Adams said his party was prepared to discuss decommissioning arms as part of a much wider agenda that included ``repressive legislation'' and Sinn Fein's demands for the release of hundreds of IRA prisoners, which Britain refuses outright. </P>
<P> ``There cannot be a single-issue agenda and no issue, including decommissioning, should be excluded from these discussions. We look forward to discussing all matters with a view to their resolution,'' he said. </P>
<P> Sinn Fein officials are quietly confident the exploratory talks will be upgraded to include junior Northern Ireland minister Michael Ancram and that Britain will drop its arms-first insistence. </P>
<P> Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, hinted at a softening of the British position in Washington earlier this week when he said a willingness by the IRA to decommission some weapons could unlock the door to progress. </P>
