<P>  Former NATO Secretary-General Lord Carrington triumphantly crossed the bridge over the river Waal in a Sherman tank Sunday -- just as he did 50 years ago. </P>
<P> Unveiling a plaque to commemorate the success of his unit, the British Grenadier Guards, in capturing the bridge, Carrington paid tribute to the Dutch people whom he helped liberate from four years of Nazi German occupation. </P>
<P> ``The battle here was the liberation of Nijmegen from hardship and repression, all of which the Dutch faced with courage and resistance, which those of us who were here 50 years ago will never forget,'' he said. </P>
<P> As he spoke, a convoy of 750 wartime vehicles travelled slowly from the Belgian-Dutch border towards Nijmegen, retracing the liberation route it took half a century ago. </P>
<P> Huge crowds, cheering and waving Dutch, British and American flags, lined the route as flower-bedecked military jeeps, tanks and motor-cycles, many of them carrying U.S. and British veterans, snaked along the narrow road which the Allied troops once dubbed ``Hell's Highway.'' </P>
<P> Small orchestras and impromptu bands struck up wartime melodies to catch the celebratory mood. </P>
<P> Progress was slow, just as it was in September 1944 when local residents poured on to the streets to welcome the troops who had parachuted, driven and marched into the southern Netherlands as part of Operation Market Garden. </P>
<P> ``People gave us apples and bread and cheese. It made it a bit of a hazard. They were blocking the road so the soldiers couldn't go on,'' recalled veteran U.S. paratrooper Harry Harrold, 72. </P>
<P> The convoy was the ground-based element of Market Garden, a bold, but ultimately failed, gamble to smash through German defenses and bring an end to World War Two. </P>
<P> While it succeeded in the south as the U.S. 101st and 82nd Airborne Divisions captured bridges at Eindhoven, Grave and Nijmegen, British paratroopers were isolated further north at Arnhem and suffered huge casualties, as recalled in the film ``A Bridge Too Far.'' </P>
<P> Carrington was commanding officer of the Grenadier Guards and was in one of the first tanks to break across the Waal bridge after three days of bitter fighting. </P>
<P> His Sherman tank stayed alone on the bridge to await reinforcements, which arrived just in time. </P>
<P> ``The thing that still puzzles me is why the bridge wasn't blown up. It would have been the sensible thing for them (the Germans) to do. I think we were very lucky,'' he said. </P>
