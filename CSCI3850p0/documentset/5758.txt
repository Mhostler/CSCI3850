<P>  One month after entering the hospital for heart surgery, Thailand's revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej appeared on national television to explain his ailment and assure the country he is recovering well. </P>
<P> King Bhumibol's picture was on the front page of nearly every Thai newspaper on Saturday following a 40-minute interview conducted by Privy Councillor Chao na Sylvanta. </P>
<P> In the interview,the king used charts and diagrams to explain the surgery he underwent last month to enlarge a narrowed artery in his heart. </P>
<P> The broadcast late on Friday was the king's first public address since he left the hospital on March 27 after more than two weeks of treatment. Before sitting down to explain his heart problem and the surgery in detail he was seen exercising and having his blood pressure monitored. </P>
<P> The blockage of the artery had allowed only 15 percent of the normal blood flow to pass into his heart, said King Bhumibol, who is 67. But doctors have said his heart problem is now cured and he would be able to continue to serve for another 20 or 30 years. </P>
<P> ``The doctors said I must rest now, but in the future I will continue with my projects,'' he said. ``When I fell sick, I thought I was weak. But now, after the treatment, I am sure that I am strong again.'' </P>
<P> The king said he had decided to draw pictures and explain his health to the Thai people himself because he had received letters saying the announcements made by doctors during his hospitalisation were ``confusing.'' </P>
<P> Thailand is a constitutional monarchy. </P>
