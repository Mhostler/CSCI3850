<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Joe Montana, considered by many to be the greatest ever to play the position, will retire at the end of this season, according to a newspaper report. </P>
<P> The New York Daily News is reporting Friday that Montana will call it quits at the conclusion of his 16th season, ending one of the most illustrious careers in NFL history. </P>
<P> The report cites unnamed league sources who claim that the 38-year-old Montana has made up his mind to retire after his second season with the Chiefs. </P>
<P> Montana, who led the San Francisco 49ers to four Super Bowl championships in as many appearances in the big game, was not available for comment on the report. </P>
<P> Montana has a chance to become the first quarterback to win five Super Bowls and the first to win it for two different teams if he leads the Chiefs to the title this season. </P>
<P> He is listed as questionable for Sunday's critical game against the Denver Broncos with a sprained arch and a strained ligament in his left ankle. The future Hall of Famer was injured in the third quarter of last Sunday's 10-9 loss to Seattle and did not return. </P>
<P> Prior to sustaining the injury, Montana became only the fifth player in NFL history to reach the 40,000-yard career passing plateau. </P>
<P> Montana has 40,102 passing yards in his career and joined Dan Fouts, Dan Marino, Fran Tarkenton and Johnny Unitas in the 40,000-yard club. In just two seasons as a member of the Chiefs, Montana has passed for 4,998 yards. </P>
<P> Montana spent the first 14 years of his career with the 49ers before being traded to Kansas City at his own request in April of 1993. He led the 49ers to Super Bowl titles after the 1981, 1984, 1988 and 1989 seasons. </P>
<P> Earlier this year, Montana was named to the NFL's 75th anniversary all-time all-star team. </P>
<P> The Chiefs are currently 7-5, two games behind the San Diego Chargers in the AFC West with four games left to play in the regular season. </P>
