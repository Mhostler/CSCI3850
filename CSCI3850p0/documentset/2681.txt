<P>  A 70-year-old Chinese official was injured when he fell into one of thousands of open manholes in Beijing that have had their covers stolen for scrap, the Beijing Youth Daily said Friday. </P>
<P> About 5,000 steel manhole covers were stolen from Beijing's streets and sold for scrap in the first nine months of this year, causing numerous accidents, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> Liang Sili, a member of the advisory Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, fell into a 20-ft deep open manhole while strolling with his wife in Beijing on Oct. 22, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> ``Luckily there was a ladder inside the manhole. (It) broke my fall. I would have been dead if it were not for the ladder,'' Liang said from his hospital bed. </P>
<P> ``I will raise a motion to severely punish those who destroy public facilities. I hope that after me no one else will fall into manholes,'' he was quoted as saying. </P>
<P> Rescue workers plucked Liang out and rushed him to hospital, where he received 10 stitches in the head, the newspaper said. He broke two ribs and injured his lungs. </P>
<P> Liang, a space expert, is a son of Liang Qichao, a Qing Dynasty government official who incurred the wrath of the Empress Dowager in the late 19th century by pushing for reforms. </P>
