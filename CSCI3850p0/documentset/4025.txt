<P>  An Israeli bus company has blamed a runaway sex drive for erratic service on one of its routes. </P>
<P> A driver, suspected of slacking on the northern Haifa-Nazareth stretch, was filmed by a hidden camera on his vehicle taking a different sort of busman's holiday -- detours to sideroads where he would make love to his girlfriend. </P>
<P> The company, which has suspended the driver, installed the camera after passengers along the route complained the bus often did not come to pick them up in the afternoon, a spokesman for Egged bus lines said Sunday. </P>
<P> ``He was not providing the proper public service,'' the spokesman said. </P>
