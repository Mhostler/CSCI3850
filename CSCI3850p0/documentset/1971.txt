<P>  The United States insisted Wednesday its goal in Iraq is to ensure Baghdad's compliance with U.N. resolutions, not to oust President Saddam Hussein from power. </P>
<P> ``I can tell you that the objective of U.S. policy toward Iraq since the beginning of this administration has been fulfilling Iraqi compliance with all relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions. That's still the policy and I think I'll leave it at that,'' deputy State Department spokeswoman Christine Shelly told reporters. </P>
<P> She said she was seeking to correct the impression left by a Washington Post story that quoted an unnamed senior U.S. official as saying the purpose of U.N. sanctions against Iraq was to ``get rid of Saddam.'' </P>
<P> Shelly also pointedly refused to endorse an assertion by the administration of former President Bush that it would ``shed no tears'' if Saddam somehow disappeared from the scene. </P>
<P> ``I'm just not going to get into that,'' Shelly said. </P>
<P> ``Our policy is directed toward the government of Iraq and to seek their compliance with the Security Council resolutions. But I don't want to get into characterizations of how we would feel if he were to depart.'' </P>
<P> The Bush administration had indicated it would never support a lifting of Gulf War sanctions against Iraq, including an oil embargo, while Saddam remained in power. </P>
<P> Asked about that, Shelly said: ``... the U.S.'s position is to seek full compliance (with U.N. resolutions concerning recognition of Kuwait, curbs on weapons of mass destruction and other issues) and if full compliance is to take place, then it's clear that other kinds of issues like that could be addressed, but we're not at that point, and so at this point it's a hypothetical question.'' </P>
<P> Washington, along with Britain, has been a hard-liner in insisting Iraq fulfill the Gulf War U.N. resolutions. </P>
<P> Many analysts feel Saddam's frustration over a deteriorating economic situation in his country worsened by U.N. sanctions that seemed unlikely to be lifted soon caused him to once again mass troops on Kuwait's border and create another Gulf crisis. </P>
<P> Officials of some U.S. allies, notably France, have expressed doubt about an Iraqi threat and suggested that Washington was exaggerating the seriousness of the situation to keep pressure on Iraq. </P>
