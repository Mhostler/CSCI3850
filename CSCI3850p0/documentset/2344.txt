<P>  Hundreds of cheering Haitians mobbed Port-au-Prince Mayor Evans Paul Tuesday as he commemorated the estimated 4,000 people killed during the military dictatorship with a simple ceremony at the city cemetery. </P>
<P> ``We lay this wreath of flowers in memory of all the people whose names we know -- and all the people whose names we don't know -- who fell so democracy could flourish in Haiti,'' Paul shouted through a bullhorn as he stood on top of a five foot high, blue tiled concrete crypt, one of hundreds families use for the bodies of their dead. </P>
<P> The ceremony coincided with All Saints Day. </P>
<P> Human rights advocates and the U.S. military estimate 4,000 or more people died in the three years after a coup threw out President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who returned to power Oct. 15. </P>
<P> Paul said he had spoken with Aristide Monday about the struggle to obtain jobs, education, health care and housing for the people and he asked them to be patient. </P>
<P> ``We are unable to make changes yet but we are fighting so we can do it,'' Paul said. </P>
<P> Although international relief is starting to pour in, the national government has been slow to get organized. </P>
<P> The parliament has yet to approve Prime Minister Smarck Michel -- chosen by Aristide last week -- and Michel has yet to name his Cabinet, which will oversee the government. </P>
<P> A spokeswoman for Michel said he will finish presenting his credentials Thursday and speak before both houses of parliament. She said parliament may act to approve him at that time. </P>
<P> Meanwhile, the White House said President Clinton's National Security Adviser Anthony Lake will visit Haiti this week for meetings with Aristide. </P>
<P> Lake, accompanied by officials of the State and Defense departments, will be in Haiti Wednesday and Thursday to meet with Aristide and a broad range of Haitian and U.S. officials, White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said in a statement. </P>
<P> At the cemetery ceremony in Port-au-Prince, Paul was greeted by an excited, mostly male crowd that roared its approval when he said that the flowers were being laid on behalf of Aristide. </P>
<P> The wreath, with one red ribbon that said ``Homage to the heroes'' and another that said ``Opposition to the tyrants,'' was tossed through an opening in a special crypt. </P>
<P> Paul's appearance at the cemetery heightened the excitement at the start of the two-day celebration of All-Saints and All- Souls days, during which people drink, sing and dance at cemetaries. </P>
<P> The smell of rum ceremonially spilled on the ground mixed with dust in the hot cemetery as the crowd closed in on Paul while he tried to leave. </P>
<P> His black, wing-tipped shoes were covered with dust. His car was surrounded by the crowd as his aides tried to push him into it. </P>
<P> At about the time Paul was visiting the cemetery, U.S. troops were at the airport for a far more sedate ceremony turning over control of the international airport to Bangladeshi troops. </P>
<P> Major General David Meade formally handed over security responsibilities to the Bangladeshi force of about 1,000 troops. </P>
<P> It was the second major transfer of power by the U.S. Last month the U.S. turned over security for the port to Caribbean troops. </P>
<P> A U.S. military spokesman said the ceremony marked a ''significant step forward (toward) eventually turning over the mission to the United Nations.'' </P>
