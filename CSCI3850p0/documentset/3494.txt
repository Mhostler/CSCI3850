<P>  Incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich will give up a controversial $4.5 million book advance that has caused a political furor, sources close to the arrangement said Friday. </P>
<P> The sources said that instead of taking the advance, Gingrich will take a token $1 from his publisher along with royalties from book sales. </P>
<P> The book deal which became public last week has caused a major controversy. The unusually high advance offer is far more than many best-selling authors receive and was announced at a time when the Republicans were calling for major cutbacks in welfare and other programs for the poor. </P>
<P> The Georgia Republican plans to outline his reasons for rejecting the big advance at an 11 A.M. EST news conference at his Atlanta congressional office. </P>
<P> On Thursday, Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole raised questions about the controversial advance. </P>
<P> Dole suggested the issue should be addressed by Gingrich to avoid distractions as Republicans take over control of Congress for the first time in 40 years. </P>
<P> The deal announced last week by Harper-Collins, a publishing firm controlled by media giant Rupert Murdoch's Australian-based News Corp. Ltd, would pay Gingrich a $4.5 advance for two books -- a non-fiction book outlining Gingrich's conservative political philosophy and an anthology of writings about democracy. </P>
<P> Dole is the highest-ranking Republican to raise questions about the book deal. </P>
<P> ``It's not too popular...it's a lot of money,'' the Washington Post quoted Dole as saying. ``Every time we're on a talk show I assume we're going to be asked about the book deal. Maybe it's book envy, maybe somethingh else.'' </P>
<P> Dole said Gingrich should address the questions over the book deal but offered no advice on what he should do. </P>
<P> ``I think that's something he has to deermine, but I think we just need to lay it to rest because we don't want it hanging around every time an issue comes up,'' Dole said. </P>
<P> ``I don't want to get in a quarrel with Newt, but I think it is of much concern,'' the Washington Times quoted Dole as saying. ``It's pretty obvious that it's already raised some questions.'' </P>
<P> A spokesman for Gingrich said the book issue will be addressed by Gingrich who has received a letter of intent from the publisher but who but has not yet signed a contract. </P>
