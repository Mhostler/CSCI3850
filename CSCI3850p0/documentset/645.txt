<DATELINE>HAVANA (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Hundreds of thousands of Cubans gathered at Havana's Revolution Square Sunday to show support for the government, two days after street clashes in the capital that injured 35 people. </P>
<P> The crowd, estimated by officials at 600,000, jammed the vast square at a meeting called to pay tribute to a policeman killed in a ferry boat hijacking but also to issue a firm rebuff against the unrest. </P>
<P> The sea of people waved Cuban flags, chanted revolutionary slogans, thundered out the national anthem and stood through a rain shower to hear deputy Defense Minister Ulises Rosales del Toro reiterate Cuba's angry charge that the United States was behind the unprecedented unrest. </P>
<P> The meeting was in honor of 19-year-old Gabriel Lamoth Caballero, killed by hijackers who commandeered a ferry boat in Havana last Thursday to try to travel to the United States. </P>
<P> But it was also a rallying call for the revolution after Friday's incidents, in which groups of people throwing stones clashed for several hours with police and civilian law enforcement brigades. </P>
<P> The Sunday newspaper Juventud Rebelde said 35 people, including 10 policemen, were injured in the clashes along a section of Havana's Malecon sea-front drive. It also said an undisclosed number of people had been arrested. </P>
<P> Rosales del Toro centered his address on the United States, reiterating President Fidel Castro's charge Friday that Washington wanted to cause disorder and provoke a ``bloodbath'' in Cuba. </P>
<P> And he also slammed the United States for its ``malevolent'' immigration policy on Cubans. </P>
<P> The deputy minister reiterated a threat by Castro Friday to flood the United States with Cuban emigrants if Washington did not alter what Havana views as an immigration policy that encourages illegal exits from the island. He said Cuba did not oppose negotiations for a just solution to the problem. </P>
<P> Cuba says the current policy stimulates illegal exits because Washington limits the visas it grants but, under the Cuban Adjustment Act, generally allows Cubans who have left the island illegally to stay in the United States. </P>
<P> Castro was absent for Sunday's rally, visiting Colombia for the swearing-in of new President Ernesto Samper. But a string of senior government figures including first deputy president Raul Castro, Castro's younger brother, stood on the podium along with an emotional group of relatives of the dead policeman. </P>
<P> A recent spate of ferry boat hijackings, highlighting the drama of a steady trickle of Cubans who leave the communist- ruled island illegally by sea to go to the United States, were the trigger for Friday's clashes. </P>
<P> Castro also admitted in remarks to reporters in Bogota Saturday that there was some discontent among the population amid Cuba's current severe economic crisis. </P>
<P> Thursday's hijacking, which ended with authorities bringing the hijackers and passengers back to Havana after the vessel ran out of fuel, was the third such incident in nine days. </P>
<P> Divers are still searching Havana bay for the body of a second policeman killed in the hijacking. </P>
<P> The rally Sunday, in the tradition of Cuba's huge gatherings for events such as key anniversaries, was the culmination of a blaze of pro-revolutionary activity organized since the clashes. </P>
<P> Officials said some 22,000 people queued Sunday to file past Lamoth's coffin, laid out in the Interior Ministry facing the square before the evening rally. </P>
<P> The crowds, in many cases organized by groups such as the Union of Young Communists, walked, cycled and were brought in droves of buses from Havana and the surrounding countryside. </P>
<P> Small demonstrations against the disturbances have been held in the city since Friday evening and state media has issued a flood of condemnation of the protesters and support for Castro and the revolution. </P>
<P> Juventud Rebelde, the youth communist weekly, gave a detailed version of how the unrest evolved. It said that a gathering of some 300 to 400 people grouped in the port area of Havana in the early morning of Friday, and were dispersed by authorities. </P>
<P> Following that incident, some 21 people tried to commandeer a tugboat, despite the fact the vessel did not even have a motor. They were detained, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> During the morning people congregated again at the end of the Malecon by the port, numbering about 700 by noon. The unrest erupted in the early afternoon, centred in the area around the Hotel Deauville on the sea-front, the newspaper added. </P>
<P> It did not give details of the injuries of the protesters, although it published accounts of some of the injuries suffered by police and other law enforcement members. </P>
<P> Police fired during the disturbances, but apparently in the air and it was not clear if live bullets were used. </P>
