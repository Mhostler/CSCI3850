<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Federal Trade Commission has proposed new rules to regulate telephone salespeople, requiring them to identify themselves and their organization at the start of every sales call, the Washington Post reported Friday. </P>
<P> Under the new rules, the telemarketer would also have to state that the call was a sales call, disclose any requirements to collect offered prizes and get the consumer's written permission to credit or debit a checking account. </P>
<P> Millions of people get calls from telemarketers offering cash prizes and other ``bait'' every day. Many hang up, but thousands buy the pitch and lose between $40 billion to $60 billion a year, the paper said. </P>
<P> The new rules, if finalized, would also prohibit a telemarketer from calling a consumer back to sell the same product within three months, and would require him to end all future calls if the consumer insisted. </P>
