<DATELINE>NOME, Alaska (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Doug Swingley mushed his team of nine dogs across Nome's Front Street just after noon Tuesday, becoming the first non-Alaskan to win the grueling Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. </P>
<P> The 41-year-old former rancher from Simms, Mont., set a new record for the 1,161-mile course, finishing in nine days, two hours, 22:19 minutes. </P>
<P> A crowd of well-bundled spectators braved the frigid minus-17-degree weather to cheer Swingley as he ran with his team into the finish chute here to claim victory in the 23rd Iditarod. </P>
<P> After bringing his dogs under a wooden arch that marks the finish line, Swingley sat on a podium and hugged two of his lead dogs, Elmer and Vic, who in turn licked his face. </P>
<P> ``I need some sleep,'' Swingley told reporters. </P>
<P> He broke the record set last year by Martin Buser, who covered the course in 10 days, 13 hours, 2:39 minutes. </P>
<P> Buser was Swingley's closest competitor through the later stages of the race and was reported to have left White Mountain, a checkpoint 77 miles from Nome, at 9:20 a.m. </P>
<P> Swingley credited his dogs for the speedy run. </P>
<P> ``There's a whole bunch of guys out there that are real competitors. If they had the same opportunity that I had to drive a team like this, they'd be sitting here instead of me,'' he said. </P>
<P> He also credited his strategy of pushing toward Iditarod, the abandoned gold-mining town that is the race's halfway point, before taking the 24-hour layover that is reqired of all mushers. Most of the top mushers took their layovers at Takotna, two checkpoints earlier. </P>
<P> ``The big question is whether you can get through the 24 farther into the race without taking something out of the dogs that you can't get back. The idea is to take the 24 before the dogs are tired so that they can come right back to where they were at the start,'' Swingley said in a post-race news conference. </P>
<P> Greeted in Nome by his family and with letters of congratulations from Montana Gov. Marc Racicot, Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont., and a Montana state flag, Swingley said he recognized the significance of his breakthrough in this Alaskan institution. </P>
<P> ``For me it's a moral victory for all my competitors down south. Now I can go home and now they can win the Iditarod, but I was the first guy from down there,'' he said. </P>
<P> As for Alaskan egos, ``That's what I didn't want to try to step on. I'm just another dog musher when it comes to Alaskan dog mushers,'' he said. </P>
<P> Taking into account technical rule changes, Swingley's team was over nine hours faster than Buser's 1994 championship team. </P>
<P> Last year, the race's time clock started for competitors on the first Saturday of March. </P>
<P> This year, the actual competition started Sunday, March 4, subtracting a nominal 24 hours from running time. Mushers this year started the race formally with a 20-mile, untimed run from Anchorage on the previous day. </P>
<P> The victory nets Swingley $52,500. He also collected other cash prizes from race sponsors for being the first musher to the race's halfway point, the first to the Yukon River and the first to the Bering Sea Coast. Those additional prizes totaled $9,500. </P>
