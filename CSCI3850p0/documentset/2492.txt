<P>  Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg fought off a stiff challenge from Republican state assembly speaker Garabed ``Chuck'' Haytaian to win re-election from New Jersey Tuesday for a third term. </P>
<P> ``You all worked hard...there were so many experiences, so many opportunities to make the system work and we made it work and the people of New Jersey said 'yes','' Lautenberg told cheering supporters in his victory speech. </P>
<P> Lautenberg, 70, a computer businessman who won the endorsement of 1992 independent presidential candidate Ross Perot on the last weekend of the campaign, is not widely liked but he held off Haytaian despite his opponent earning the support of popular Republican Gov. Christine Whitman. </P>
<P> ``I'd like to thank our Gov. Whitman, she's done a great job,'' Haytaian said in his concession speech. </P>
<P> At one point in the campaign, the issues of taxes, crime, gun control and abortion were upstaged by the views of Haytaian's friend, WABC radio talk show host Bob Grant, who has been accused of bigotry. </P>
<P> The controversy over Grant appeared to give the Democratic incumbent a boost in the polls and the Black Ministers Council of New Jersey condemned Grant for racist comments and Haytaian and other Republicans for participating in Grant's talk show. </P>
<P> In a rough debate, the senator produced a tape of what he called ``racist filth,'' told Haytaian to listen to it and see if he wanted Grant ``to be your water carrier.'' </P>
<P> Haytaian tried to tap into the anti-incumbent mood, depicting Lautenberg as a 12-year, do-nothing senator seeking to stay in office for the rest of the century. </P>
