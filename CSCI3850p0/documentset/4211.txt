<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  At least 120 passengers who said they sailed a ``nightmare'' journey on the QE2 from England and New York in December while the luxury liner was under repair have filed a civil negligence suit seeking $62 million. </P>
<P> The lawsuit filed in New York state court Monday was for breach of contract and future medical costs. </P>
<P> The lawsuit, filed in state court, seeks $100,000 in damages for each passenger and asks the court to set up a $50 million fund to cover any medical costs passengers might incur over the next 10 years related to any exposure to asbestos or other toxic diseases. </P>
<P> The 14-page lawsuit accuses the Cunard Line, owners of the QE2, of a number of fire and safety hazards including blocked passageways, inadequate sanitary facilities, unsafe and missing safety doors, and exposure to asbestos dust and noxious fumes. </P>
<P> The lawsuit alleges ``several passengers suffered other physical injuries, tripping over improper carpeting, exploding toilets and other hazards causing injuries.'' </P>
<P> ``Apparently, there was asbestos exposure aboard the ship and we're concerned that problems may not show up for 20 years,'' Paul Edelman, the lawyer representing the passengers told Reuters. </P>
<P> A Cunard spokeswoman would not comment on the lawsuit. She said that they had received the legal documents and that Cunard had retained a law firm. </P>
<P> The QE2 left Southampton, England, Dec. 17, 1994, after undergoing a $45 million refurbishing. In New York, the Coast Guard delayed the QE2's Christmas Carribean cruise for 37 hours because of fire and safety violations found aboard the ship. </P>
<P> Cunard offered passengers who sailed the QE2 in December refunds on their passage and a credit toward a second cruise. </P>
<P> Some QE2 passengers described the December Atlantic crossing and cruise as ``a nightmare'' and ``the voyage from hell.'' </P>
