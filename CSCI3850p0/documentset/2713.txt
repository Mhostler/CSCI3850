<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Democrat Tony Knowles declared victory Friday night in Alaska's cliffhanger gubernatorial race, with the State Division of Elections posting a 528-vote margin and only 210 absentee ballots left to count. </P>
<P> His win was decided 10 days after the election -- after officials tallied absentee and so-called ``questioned'' ballots -- those cast by voters outside of their home precincts or by new voters not yet on precinct rolls -- gathered in Anchorage, Fairbanks, Juneau and Nome. </P>
<P> Friday's count of 6,324 absentee and questioned ballots gave the Democrat 87,434 votes, or 41.1 percent, to Republican Jim Campbell's 86,906 votes, or 40.8 percent. </P>
<P> Lieutenant Gov. Jack Coghill, running on the ticket of the right-wing Alaskan Independence Party, won 27,795 votes, or 13.1 percent. Jim Sykes of the ecologist Green Party won 8,702 votes, or 4.1 percent. A fifth candidate and write-ins took the remaining .9 percent. </P>
<P> Knowles, the former Anchorage mayor, has a history of surviving close elections. He won his first term on the Anchorage Assembly in 1975 by 30 votes and was later elected and re-elected mayor by narrow margins. </P>
<P> Still to be counted Saturday were additional ballots gathered in Nome from largely native communities in northern and western Alaska. Alaska Natives -- Eskimos, Indians and Aleuts -- have overwhelmingly favored Knowles, so the result was expected to widen the Democrat's lead. </P>
<P> As supporters celebrated in his downtown campaign headquarters, Knowles told reporters he will try to win the confidence of Alaskans who voted for other candidates. </P>
<P> ``When you win by a small margin like that -- although it's the largest margin I think I've ever won by -- it brings you a sense of humility,'' Knowles said. </P>
<P> Even though the vote counts in the past days steadily widened the 339-vote margin he held the morning after Election Day, Knowles said he was not confident of victory until after results came in late Friday. </P>
<P> ``Ten days ago, on Tuesday night, everybody was feeling good about it. They saved me a parking space out front,'' he said. ''When I came tonight, there wasn't any parking space out there. So I knew I was always on thin ice.'' </P>
<P> Campbell campaign spokesman Mike Heatwole, who was at the Division of Elections office when Friday's totals were released, said the Republicans have not yet decided whether to seek a recount. </P>
