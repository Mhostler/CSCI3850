<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Chilean officials moved Thursday to soothe fears that military displeasure over the murder trial of two top-ranking army officers could boil over, saying any tensions were firmly under the government's control. </P>
<P> ``The house is in order,'' said President Eduardo Frei in the southern city of Temuco, adding Chileans would react calmly to next week's ruling in the trial. </P>
<P> ``This country is mature, and I think we will deal with this decision as any mature democracy would,'' said Frei. </P>
<P> The army has shown unmistakable signs of unease this week as the Supreme Court moves closer to a ruling in the case of retired Gen. Manuel Contreras and another officer accused of planning the 1976 murder of former foreign minister Orlando Letelier. </P>
<P> Letelier was killed with his U.S. assistant in a car bomb in Washington while they were helping U.S. opponents of Chile's then-military regime. </P>
<P> Defense Minister Edmundo Perez Yoma said there was no question the military would respect the court decision and ruled out any kind of armed challenge to the government. </P>
<P> ``Total normality reigns. All of the republic's institutions are working and acting with great responsibility and when I say all, I mean absolutely all,'' said Perez Yoma. </P>
<P> ``Anyone who thinks there is going to be a coup is crazy,'' the Santiago newspaper La Tercera quoted an anonymous military source as saying. </P>
<P> Chileans well remember the last time military tensions flared up -- in May 1993, when the army posted heavily armed troops outside army headquarters in downtown Santiago after Congress started investigating checks paid by the army to the son of ex-president Gen. Augusto Pinochet. </P>
<P> Pinochet, who took power in a 1973 coup and is still army commander-in-chief, called in the army brass for marathon closed-door meetings this week which local news media saw as a clear sign of military displeasure over the Letelier trial. </P>
<P> One general told reporters after a meeting that officers were ``quite bothered'' by the case. Another said ``there is restlessness because a court case has become a political case.'' </P>
<P> A Supreme Court judge said the court would have a ruling in the Letelier case early next week. </P>
