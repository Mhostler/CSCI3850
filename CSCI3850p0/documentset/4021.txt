<DATELINE>CHICAGO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The natural parents of a toddler who has been raised by adoptive parents said Saturday they did not plan to take custody of the child until an expected final appeal by the adoptive parents to the full Supreme Court is completed. </P>
<P> The adoptive couple, who have raised the 3 3/8-year old boy known in court records only as ``Baby Richard'' since a few days after his birth, had pleaded with the Supreme Court Friday to stop him from being turned over to the natural parents he has never met. </P>
<P> But Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens on Saturday denied the appeal. He also denied a second appeal by a court-appointed guardian in a custody battle. </P>
<P> It was the second time Stevens has denied a stay of Illinois Supreme Court decisions requiring the adoptive parents to turn over the child to his natural parents. </P>
<P> Later Saturday, the lawyer for Otakar Kirchner, the natural father, said he expected the adoptive parents would appeal Stevens' ruling to the full court. </P>
<P> ``I imagine (they will appeal) today or tomorrow,'' attorney Loren Heinemann said Saturday. ``I don't think they're going to take the child and run.'' </P>
<P> The natural parents have proposed to gradually introduce the boy to them. Their plan involves continued contact with the adoptive parents as well as help from child psychologists in the transition, provided the adoptive parents agree to make no more legal challenges. </P>
<P> The bitter custody battle has prompted a public outcry over the rights of adoptive parents, including pleas from Illinois Governor Jim Edgar and his wife for Kirchner to give up the fight for his son. </P>
<P> The Czech-born Kirchner was out of the country when his then-girlfriend, Daniela Janikova, gave birth in 1991 and handed the baby over for adoption four days later while telling Kirchner the child had died. </P>
<P> When he found out the boy was alive, he immediately began a protracted legal effort to have the adoption voided. The couple has since married and are expecting a second child. </P>
