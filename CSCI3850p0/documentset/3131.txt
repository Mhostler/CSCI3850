<DATELINE>MUNICH, Germany (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Magnus Larsson capped the biggest week of his career by powering past world No. 1 Pete Sampras to take the richest first prize in tennis at the $6 million Grand Slam Cup Sunday. </P>
<P> Larsson, who had helped Sweden win the Davis Cup final over Russia a week earlier, demoralized a tiring Sampras with his relentless serving power to win, 7-6, 4-6, 7-6, 6-4, in two hours and 38 minutes. </P>
<P> The victory earned the modest Swede, ranked 19th in the world, a winner's prize of $1.5 million that practically doubled his career earnings. </P>
<P> Larsson, who conquered compatriot Stefan Edberg and Americans Andre Agassi and Todd Martin on the way to the final, said the Davis Cup triumph had given him the confidence he needed. </P>
<P> ``I'd dreamed of that all my life. When that came true I thought I could come here and play without any pressure. I think this is the best Christmas present I could get,'' he said. </P>
<P> For Sampras it was an anticlimactic end to a week when he looked like adding the biggest check in tennis to the Australian and Wimbledon titles he won this year and the ATP world championship he took just three weeks ago. </P>
<P> Nevertheless he had the consolation of a $750,000 second prize together with a $250,000 bonus for each of the two Grand Slam events he has won this year. </P>
<P> The tall American looked sluggish from the outset and said he had not fully recovered from a gruelling 3 3/8 hour semifinal aganst Goran Ivanisevic less than 24 hours earlier. </P>
<P> ``It's tough on the body, it's tough on the mind and it just took its toll today,'' he said. </P>
<P> But he also paid tribute to Larsson: ``He's very underrated and someone who'll be a force next year.'' </P>
<P> With serve-and-volley predictably and at times tediously dominant on the super-fast carpet of Munich's Olympic Hall, both the first and third sets went with service throughout and were won by Larsson in the tie-break. In between, Sampras took the second set on a single break of serve. </P>
<P> But at the start of the fourth set, with the Swede showing no signs of flagging and getting an impressive 67 percent of first serves in, Sampras's resolve finally cracked. </P>
<P> Larsson, who had lost all his four previous encounters with Sampras including three in the last three months, produced four successive clean passes to break Sampras to love. He then promptly broke him a second time to go 3-0 up. </P>
<P> It took a match point at 5-2 to Larsson to sting Sampras into more than token resistance and he once more unleashed his forehand to claim a break back. </P>
<P> But the unflappable Larsson, who served 31 aces in the match, was not to be denied twice. </P>
<P> ``I thought I wouldn't lose my serve twice in a row, so I was pretty confident,'' he said. He took his next service game to love to claim the title. </P>
<P> Larsson said he had might indulge an old pastime after pocketing the $1.5 million prize. </P>
<P> ``When I was younger I went to the casino a lot but now I don't gamble that much,'' he said. ``Maybe tonight.'' </P>
