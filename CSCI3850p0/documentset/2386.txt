<P>  Prime Minister Tansu Ciller Thursday began the first visit to Israel by a Turkish head of government since the Jewish state's creation in 1948, promising to do all she can to bolster Middle East peace. </P>
<P> ``It is my privilege to be the first prime minister of Turkey to set foot on the state of Israel. It is, I feel, a visit that is long overdue,'' she told a welcoming ceremony in Jerusalem. She praised Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres for having what she called the courage to make peace with Israel's Arab neighbors. </P>
<P> ``We in the international community I feel should support it in every way we can,'' she said at the start of a three-day trip including talks Saturday with PLO chief Yasser Arafat in Palestinian-ruled Gaza. </P>
<P> In his remarks, Rabin cited the enduring role the 16th century Turkish Sultan Suleiman played in Jerusalem's history. ``The wall which encircles this city and which became its enduring symbol recognised throughout the world was built by the Ottoman Sultan Suleiman who was known to the Europeans as Suleiman the Magnificent,'' Rabin said. </P>
<P> ``Madame Prime Minister, Sultan Suleiman built a wall. You in your coming today to Jerusalem traversed the wall. As the first prime minister of Turkey to come to Israel since the establishment of the state of Israel 46 years ago, we thank you for your coming and we see in your visit here with your government ministers and other members of the government a sign and a symbol of a new era of relations between Israel and your great nation, Turkey,'' he said. </P>
<P> In Turkey, officials said Ciller's visit to Israel underscored the readiness of both countries for extensive cooperation in a peacetime Middle East and around the globe. </P>
<P> Ciller will end her tour with an official visit to Egypt Nov. </P>
