<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Bankrupt Orange County, Calif., unveiled a sweeping plan Thursday to reduce spending sharply in the next fiscal year, giving department heads about three weeks to prepare budgets that may face cuts of 30 percent. </P>
<P> County administrative officer Ernie Schneider told department heads they should present budgets that save 20 percent. Department heads were also told to identify an additional 10 percent in cuts, which would take place if the initial budget reductions prove insufficient. </P>
<P> ``This is major surgery,'' said Tom Uram, director of the county's Health Care Agency. ``This will be very trying.'' </P>
<P> Layoffs and service cuts will be the result, Uram said, adding that the agency could lose state funds for services. </P>
<P> The cuts will save the county about $110 million in fiscal year 1995-1996, which begins July 1. The budget shortfall in the fiscal year is expected to run to $160 million. </P>
<P> Departments were given until Feb. 10 to develop their cost-cutting plans. </P>
<P> ``We would want (the cuts) implemented as soon as possible,'' Schneider said in a telephone interview. ''Hopefully, they will improve our current fiscal situation.'' </P>
<P> Separately in New York, Salomon Bros. Inc., the county's financial adviser, said that it would auction about $380 million of Student Loan Marketing Association notes which are still held by the bankrupt county. </P>
<P> The sale will complete the county's restructuring of its investment portfolio, which suffered a $1.7 billion loss. </P>
<P> Meanwhile, in Santa Ana, the county's Board of Supervisors directed Schneider and the county's financial adviser to begin negotiations to restructure the county's short-term debt. </P>
<P> The board said the goal of negotiations would be to defer debt and set aside payments owed by the county in the current fiscal year and in fiscal year 1995-96. </P>
<P> ``We've got a big mountain to climb,'' said County Supervisor James Silva, referring to the county's immediate budget shortfall. </P>
<P> The county faces a shortfall of $172 million this fiscal year, about 37 percent of the general fund's annual unrestricted revenues. </P>
<P> The shortfall reflects a loss of interest earnings. </P>
<P> To help offset the shortfall, the county instructed department heads last month to cut $40 million. Hundreds of workers are slated to lose their jobs through the cuts. County services are also being reduced. </P>
<P> But Schneider said additional cuts should be made. He outlined a plan to save the county about $17 million more through spending reductions, fees and other measures. </P>
<P> What remains of the shortfall -- about $107 million -- may have to be offset through the restructuring and deferment of short-term county debt obligations, Schneider said. </P>
<P> ``There is an immediate need to restructure and postpone some of the (county's) short-term debt obligations,'' said Schneider in a report delivered Thursday to the board. </P>
<P> Orange County declared bankruptcy Dec. 6 after its investment pool suffered losses stemming in part from a risky strategy that assumed interest rates would stay low. </P>
<P> When rates rose, the county suffered heavy losses. </P>
<P> On Wednesday, the official charged with restructuring the county's troubled investment pool said it had been overhauled, and that its losses were $330 million less than previously estimated -- $1.69 billion, not $2.02 billion. </P>
<P> ``The hemorrhaging in the pool has stopped,'' the official, Thomas Hayes, said Wednesday. ``We're liquid, short-term and safe.'' </P>
