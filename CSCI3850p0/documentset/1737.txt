<P>  Iran has set up a water desalination plant on the Gulf island of Abu Musa which is also claimed by the United Arab Emirates (UAE), an Iranian newspaper said on Saturday. </P>
<P> The plant was built and operated by engineers from the nearby Iranian island of Kish, the daily Abrar said. </P>
<P> The report follows the launch of scheduled flights by a state-owned Iranian airline to Abu Musa Tuesday. </P>
<P> The UAE said the air link violated its sovereignty and was at odds with good neigborly relations. </P>
<P> Iran and UAE member Sharjah have shared control of Abu Musa, which lies near major oil shipping routes and has about 3,000 residents, under a 1971 agreement. </P>
<P> Both Iran and UAE claim sovereignty over Abu Musa and the largely uninhabited islands of Greater and Lesser Tumb nearby, which have been controlled by Iran since 1971. </P>
<P> Tehran officials in recent weeks have reiterated that the islands will forever remain Iranian and accused UAE and its Arab supporters of trying to internationalize the dispute. </P>
