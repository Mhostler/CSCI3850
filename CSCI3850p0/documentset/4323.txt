<DATELINE>OTTAWA (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A Canadian army general was forced to step down Monday, the first high-ranking victim of a series of scandals that have rocked Canada's military and tarnished its peacekeeping reputation. </P>
<P> The military's chief of staff stripped Maj.-Gen. Brian Vernon of his command for misleading the government about a video that showed soldiers of a paratrooper regiment giving electrical shocks as part of an initiation ritual. </P>
<P> Vernon was in charge of the elite airborne regiment disbanded by the government last month. Vernon has been re-assigned to military headquarters in Ottawa. </P>
<P> The regiment was disgraced after some of its soldiers on a U.N. peacekeeping mission in Somalia tortured and beat a Somali teen-ager to death. Other soldiers in the regiment were involved in a drunken shoot-up of a convent in Rwanda. </P>
<P> Canadians were later shocked by videotapes showing members of the regiment urinating and defecating on each other and simulating sodomy in a initiation ritual. </P>
<P> Another video showed Canadian soldiers on a peackekeeping mission in Somalia making comments about killing ``niggers.'' </P>
<P> Last week in Parliament Defense Minister David Collenette said a new video had surfaced and that he had been assured by military brass that it did not contain any new revelations. </P>
<P> But at a hastily called news conference, the minister was later forced to backtrack and admit that the third video showed soldiers testing their endurance to electric shocks and shaving heads. </P>
<P> Hazing ceremonies are banned in the Canadian army. </P>
<P> Collenette said he had relied on information given to him by his officials. </P>
<P> ``We were mislead, so the Chief of Defence staff has taken the proper action today,'' he said Monday in Parliament. </P>
<P> Chief of Defense Staff Gen. John de Chastelain said Monday that a report prepared by Vernon on the video ``contained inaccurate and misleading information which caused me to misinform the Minister of National Defense. I hold Maj.-Gen. Vernon fully accountable for his actions.'' </P>
<P> Vernon said on television last week that he had not seen the electric-shock scenes on the video. He was commander of Land Force Central Area in the province of Ontario. </P>
<P> A fourth video showing hazing ceremonies on a navy warship has also added to the controversy over the breakdown of discipline in the Canadian miltiary. </P>
