<P>  Britain's top art prize, ridiculed by jeering demonstrators who called it elitist, was awarded Tuesday to sculptor Antony Gormley who uses moulds of his own naked body. </P>
<P> Gormley, who risks suffocation to take impressions from his body, took the Turner prize with a collection of five iron-clad dummies bent double against a wall. </P>
<P> The $31,410 prize, named after Britain's great landscape painter, consistently provokes uproar in the London art scene and its 10th anniversary was no exception. </P>
<P> About 300 young artists heckled London's Tate Gallery when the glitterati arrived for the prize-giving. </P>
<P> The demonstration was organized by a group called FAT, which stands for Fashion, Architecture and Taste. </P>
<P> Founder Sean Griffiths said: ``The way the prize is given out reminds me of Clint Eastwood winning an Oscar just because he was 60.'' </P>
<P> ``We want to show that what is presented as a benign event raising the profile of contemporary art is actually an extremely elitist one.'' </P>
<P> Gormley, who relies on breathing tubes to keep him alive while being practically mummified in casts, once created a work using 43,000 figures. </P>
