<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  South African President Nelson Mandela Friday fired his estranged wife Winnie for the second time, saying it was necessary for good government. </P>
<P> Mandela's move came two days after Mrs. Mandela, 60, was reinstated as deputy arts, culture, science and technology minister after she launched legal action against the government over her March 27 dismissal. </P>
<P> ``After due reflection I have decided in accordance with the powers vested in me by the constitution to terminate Mrs. Winnie Mandela's appointment and to appoint Mrs. Brigitte Mabandla to the post...,'' Mandela said in a statement. </P>
<P> ``The overriding consideration, as in this instance, is what the president believes is necessary in pursuit of good government and the interests of the country as a whole.'' </P>
<P> The dismissal is effective from April 18 when Mabandla, an African National Congress (ANC) member of parliament and veteran human rights lawyer, takes up her post. </P>
<P> Mrs. Mandela, separated from her husband since 1992, launched a Supreme Court action Monday to have her earlier dismissal declared unlawful and unconstitutional. </P>
<P> The president's main black political opponent, Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, had supported Mrs. Mandela's action, saying in terms of the constitution he should have been consulted on the dismissals. </P>
<P> Buthelezi, who is a junior partner in the national unity government, told state television Friday Mrs. Mandela's dismissals was regrettable. </P>
<P> ``I have known them as a young couple many years, decades ago. For me...it is a very sad thing that things have come to this,'' he said. </P>
<P> The president, at the time on a tour of the Gulf, reinstated Mrs. Mandela as deputy arts minister Wednesday, saying her dismissal nearly three weeks ago should be considered invalid. </P>
<P> But Thursday evening, on his return, Mandela consulted Buthelezi and deputy presidents Thabo Mbeki and F.W. de Klerk -- former South African president and National Party (NP) leader -- over Mrs. Mandela's position. </P>
<P> Friday he announced her dismissal and again refused to give reasons. </P>
<P> ``There is no requirement for reasons behind such decisions to be made public. Such a precedent would impact negatively on the ability of the executive to govern well and wisely,'' his statement said. </P>
<P> Mrs. Mandela has been a vociferous critic of Mandela's unity government but sources in his ruling ANC said the main reason for her original sacking was her defiance of presidential orders to cancel a trip to West Africa. </P>
<P> The ANC said Friday it supported the president's decision to fire Mrs. Mandela. ``The ANC gives its unequivocal support for President Nelson Mandela's decision,'' the organization said in a statement. </P>
<P> But De Klerk's NP said in its reaction the matter had left a poor impression of the ANC's management style and had caused South Africa's image to suffer. </P>
<P> ``The National Party trusts that the distasteful saga concerning Mrs. Winnie Mandela's presence in the government of national unity is now over,'' the party said in a statement. </P>
<P> Mandela said in his statement he wished to thank his wife for services to the government. </P>
<P> ``I sincerely hope that this action will help her to reflect and improve on her conduct in positions of leadership,'' he said. </P>
