<DATELINE>GROZNY, Russia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Russian forces pounded the Chechen capital with bombs and artillery in fierce new attacks early Friday, destroying buildings in the city center and killing more civilians. </P>
<P> Witnesses said jets attacked Grozny at least once every hour throughout a second night of relentless bombardment, the bombs slamming into the city center. At least three corpses were hauled from the wreckage of a burning building. </P>
<P> Musa Merzhuyev, a military adviser to Chechnya's separatist leader Dzhokhar Dudayev, told the Russian news agency Interfax there were ``many dead and wounded.'' </P>
<P> ``The center of Grozny has been practically destroyed,'' he told Interfax at the Chechen military headquarters. </P>
<P> A local journalist in what is normally a city of 400,000, now depleted by the departure of refugees, said the roof of parliament was destroyed and the national bank was set ablaze. More than 200 buildings had been hit in days of bombing. </P>
<P> At least 20 people were killed in air raids on the besieged city Thursday. Witnesses said they feared the death toll was much higher after bombs and missiles hit residential areas. </P>
<P> Dudayev went on television Thursday night to call for Dagestan, a region bordering Chechnya in southern Russia, to unite with his people against Russia. </P>
<P> ``I call on the Dagestanis to unite with us at this difficult time for the Chechens and not allow Russia to strangle freedom in the Caucasus,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``In the name of Allah I call on all peoples of Dagestan to rise with weapons since grief may also come into your house.'' </P>
<P> President Boris Yeltsin ordered thousands of troops into Chechnya on December 11 to crush the ``independence'' it declared in 1991. </P>
<P> He initially intended to bring the mainly Muslim area quickly to heel but the military operation met fierce resistance and failed to seal off Grozny as quickly as planned. </P>
<P> Yeltsin said Thursday he was preparing a political solution to the crisis. He wrote to the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, to say he would address the Russian people soon with his assessment of events in Chechnya. </P>
<P> There were no details of the plans but a group of Yeltsin aides and experts was working on proposals for a peaceful resolution to the conflict, Itar-Tass news agency said. </P>
<P> Only Wednesday, Yeltsin ordered Defense Minister Pavel Grachev and Interior Minister Viktor Yerin to ``spare no effort'' in restoring Russian constitutional order in the rebel north Caucasus republic. </P>
<P> But signs of confusion and dissent among the military emerged from the defense ministry Thursday as it denied reports that top Russian commanders in Chechnya had been fired. </P>
<P> Tass and RIA news agencies said Grachev had dismissed the commanders and taken command of the Chechnya operation. </P>
<P> Tass also said Grachev had told first deputy Defense Minister Georgy Kondratyev and deputy chief of land forces Eduard Vorobyov to resign. </P>
<P> It later quoted the government press service as saying Vorobyov had submitted his resignation but that his boss, land forces chief Vladimir Semyonov, had refused to accept it. </P>
<P> The international reaction to events in Chechnya has been restrained. The United States has described it as Russia's internal affair while calling for a minimum of bloodshed. </P>
<P> But Thursday, the Human Rights Watch/Helsinki international human rights group criticized U.S. President Bill Clinton for not taking a stronger position. </P>
<P> It sent a letter to Clinton urging Washington to develop a forceful and comprehensive response to Russian attacks. </P>
<P> ``We urge you to make it clear to President Yeltsin that the conflict in Chechnya tests Russia's commitment to democracy and that Russia's conduct so far shows a fundamental lack of respect for human rights and humanitarian law. Such behavior is never ``an internal matter','' the letter said. </P>
<P> In Bonn, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe expressed concern at the events in Chechnya. ``I think the European Union should define a common position and we will do that in the next few days,'' he told a news conference. </P>
