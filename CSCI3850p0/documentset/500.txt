<P>  A Californian drug convict was sentenced Saturday to life in prison in a multiple murder case linked to Hells Angels motorcycle gang members. </P>
<P> An Oregon jury in Washington County, west of Portland, found Robert G. McClure guilty Saturday after a seven-week trial in which several ex-Hells Angels were among the 75 witnesses who testified. </P>
<P> Judge Jon B. Lund immediately sentenced McClure, 47, to four consecutive life prison terms. </P>
<P> McClure was found guilty of killing Margo Compton, 24, her twin six-year-old daughters Sylvia and Sandra, and Gary Seslar, 19, the son of Compton's boyfriend. All were shot in the back of the head execution style. </P>
<P> Compton had testified against Odis ``Buck'' Garrett, a long-time gang leader, and several other members of the Oakland, California, chapter of the Hells Angels in a California prostitution trial. She then moved to the small Seventh-day Adventist Community of Gaston in western Oregon. </P>
<P> The prosecution alleged Garrett found out where Compton was living and sent McClure to kill her in August 1977. </P>
<P> Both Garrett and McClure were convicted of drug offenses and imprisoned in California. Several prison inmates, also members of the Hells Angels, testified that McClure confessed to the killings while in jail. </P>
<P> McClure's attorney, Lisa A. Maxfield, argued the prosecution's case was based on the testimony of informants who were trying to reduce their own prison terms. </P>
<P> She said McClure had been offered up as a ``patsy'' to help other members of the gang get out of jail. </P>
<P> Garrett remains in prison in California. </P>
