<P>  The Serbian authorities cracked down on the major independent Belgrade television and radio broadcaster Wednesday, saying it had been registered unlawfully, its editors said. </P>
<P> The move against Studio B, whose editorial decisions have rankled the administration of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, was reminiscent of the action that forced the Belgrade independent newspaper Borba to regroup and alter its name. </P>
<P> ``The republican agency in charge of assessing capital has cancelled an earlier court decision establishing the broadcasting company Studio B as a joint stock company,'' Studio B editor Desa Cavic told Reuters. </P>
<P> Studio B, which was formed by the founders of Borba and continued the paper's tradition of opposition to Milosevic, had been state-owned until 1991 when it became a joint stock company owned by its workers, Cavic said. </P>
<P> Numerous state-owned companies were transformed into joint stock companies under liberal laws passed in 1990 under former Yugoslav prime minister Ante Markovic. </P>
<P> Studio B's ownership change had been approved by a competent Belgrade court, Cavic said. </P>
<P> The Serbian parliament, dominated by Milosevic's allies, debated the Studio B situation in 1993 but was unable to find fault with its status, she said. </P>
<P> Despite this, the government agency ruled the court's approval invalid and said Studio B no longer existed as a joint stock company. The agency made the ruling on February 2 but notified the company only Wednesday, Cavic said. </P>
<P> Studio B, which operated normally Wednesday night, has a month to file a complaint to the Supreme Court of Serbia. </P>
<P> It was not clear whether the authorities would enforce the government agency's decision in the meantime. </P>
<P> Studio B manager Dragan Kojadinovic said the company would fight with all means available against the decision, which its lawyers branded as illegal. </P>
<P> Studio B has been a thorn in Milosevic's side since March 1991 riots in Belgrade, when its radio and television station's openly backed anti-government demonstrators. </P>
<P> Kojadinovic said Studio B equipment had been hijacked and there had been several attempts to stifle its outspoken opposition. </P>
<P> Studio B has recently given wide coverage to the Bosnian Serb leadership despite their being blacklisted by Serbian official media in line with Milosevic's decision to sever all relations for refusing an international peace plan. </P>
<P> Western diplomats have voiced concern over Milosevic's latest moves to clamp down on opposition media. </P>
<P> Last year the authorities forced the closure of Borba newspaper, also questioning its ownership transformation deal. </P>
<P> The authorities struck it off the list of joint stock companies whereby it also lost its licence to publish, but backed down in January by allowing it to register as a new company and continue publishing under a new name ``Our Borba.'' </P>
