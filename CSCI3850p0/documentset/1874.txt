<P>  A bomb exploded next to a customs house near France's border with Spain early Saturday, damaging ground floor offices but sparing a family living above, police said. </P>
<P> No one claimed responsibility for the blast in the tiny border town of Urrugne, but police said it appeared to be the work of the underground Basque separatist group Iparretarak, which often targets government offices. </P>
<P> The upper floor of the building, located a few hundred yards from the border, was occupied by a customs worker, his wife and two children at the time of the explosion, but no one was hurt, said police in the nearby town of Saint-Jean-de-Luz. </P>
