<P>  The Muslim militant group Hizbollah, vowing a repeat of last week's suicide car bombing which wounded 11 Israeli soldiers, said Tuesday it would turn Lebanon into ``Israel's nightmare.'' </P>
<P> ``The Resistance has always strived and still aims to turn Lebanon into Israel's nightmare,'' Hizbollah (Party of God) chief Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah told a Beirut rally commemorating Salah Ghandour, the suicide bomber who died in last week's mission. </P>
<P> ``We are strong because we have many, many people...competing for a role in the road of martyrdom and jihad (holy war). </P>
<P> ``And with this secret of our strength we will continue the road of the Resistance which has practised and practises all forms of jihad and warfare, even suicide missions,'' Nasrallah told militants and supporters at a Beirut mosque. </P>
<P> Since its creation in 1982, the Iranian-backed Hizbollah has been pitted against some 1,000 Israeli troops and 3,000 allied local militiamen occupying a border zone in south Lebanon. </P>
<P> The bearded, black-turbaned Nasrallah said his militant fighters aimed through their attacks to ``reach a stage not restricted to stopping the Israeli from assaulting us, but to stop him even from thinking of aggressing upon us.'' </P>
<P> In the bloodiest attack against the Israelis since 1988, the suicide bomber -- a 27-year-old father of three nicknamed ``Angel'' -- rammed a car packed with 1,000 pounds of explosives into an Israeli convoy last Tuesday as it entered a military headquarters in Bint Jbeil in the occupation zone. </P>
<P> The bombing was in reprisal for the March 31 killing of a Hizbollah leader in the south in an Israeli helicopter ambush. </P>
<P> Hours before Nasrallah spoke at Tuesday's rally, Israeli troops wounded three Hizbollah guerrillas in a clash just outside the nine-mile deep border zone. </P>
<P> Israeli gunners also unleashed some 150 shells onto Hizbollah-held areas north of the buffer strip, wounding two Lebanese civilians, after guerrilla shelling wounded two Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army (SLA) militiamen, security sources said. </P>
