<DATELINE>MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Guerrillas killed five pro-Israeli militiamen in south Lebanon Sunday and Hizbollah's leader said its pro-Iranian guerrillas had the right to attack northern Israel and disrupt its tourism. </P>
<P> Five men of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army (SLA) were killed when guerrillas hit their patrol with wire-guided Sagger anti-tank rockets and rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), SLA security sources said. </P>
<P> The pro-Iranian Hizbollah (Party of God) claimed responsibility, and its leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah said the Shiite Muslim movement had the right to shell Israel to protect villagers in south Lebanon from Israeli shelling. </P>
<P> ``Shelling Israeli settlements is a right for the resistance, to defend its people. This weapon is in our hands and we can shell the settlements openly and in daylight because this enemy understands only the language of power,'' Nasrallah told supporters at a village in the eastern Bekaa valley. </P>
<P> He said Katyusha rockets fired into Israel on April 1, which killed an Israeli and wounded 12, had stopped Israeli and SLA shelling of south Lebanon villages. </P>
<P> ``Since last Friday none of our villages in the south or the Bekaa valley has been shelled. We have achieved a political, security and military goal by shelling the settlements,'' Nasrallah said. </P>
<P> Another Hizbollah leader said after the Katyusha attack that Hizbollah would no longer honor a July 1993 U.S.-brokered accord barring it from attacking northern Israel with rockets, if Israeli shelling targeted civilians in south Lebanon. </P>
<P> Ramming home the warning, Nasrallah said: ``We will not let the residents of those settlements live in peace if our people cannot live in peace, especially as it is the tourism season in those areas.'' </P>
<P> The SLA security sources said guerrilla missiles destroyed an armoured personnel carrier in Sunday's ambush near the southern town of Jezzine. </P>
<P> They said guerrillas simultaneously attacked three SLA posts in Israel's south Lebanon occupation zone with Saggers, RPGs and machineguns but caused no casualties. </P>
<P> Hizbollah issued a statement in Beirut saying it carried out the ambush and attacks on two of the SLA posts. It said eight SLA men were killed in the ambush. </P>
<P> Saturday, another militiaman was killed when a rocket hit an armoured troop carrier on the edge of the nine mile wide Israeli-held zone. </P>
<P> The 3,000-strong SLA, financed and supplied by Israel, helps about 1,000 Israeli troops control the zone which comprises 11 percent of Lebanon's territory and was created to prevent guerrilla attacks on northern Israel. </P>
