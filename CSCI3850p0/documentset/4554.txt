<P>  Rebel Serbs have launched a fresh terror campaign against Muslims in northern Bosnia, shooting, beating and robbing civilians in a major abuse of human rights, a U.N. spokesman said Saturday. </P>
<P> ``In Gradiska (northern Bosnia) for the past month, Muslim houses have been systematically robbed and their occupants terrorized,'' Kris Janowski of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) told reporters in Sarajevo. </P>
<P> He said armed men in uniform had severely beaten Muslim civilians and ransacked their houses in villages around the Serb-held region of Banja Luka, site of ethnic expulsions of non-Serbs throughout the war. Whole villages were asking to be evacuated, he said. </P>
<P> Janowski said it remained unclear why there had been a spate of attacks again in the Banja Luka area but the assaults were all aimed at outlying villages and hamlets where non-Serbs had escaped previous ethnic purges. </P>
<P> ``These are the last finishing touches of ethnic cleansing in Bosanska Krajina (northern Bosnia). That's basically what it is,'' he said. ``And it is being condoned by the authorities.'' </P>
<P> The attacks made a ``mockery'' of human rights in general and Bosnia's current cease-fire accord in particular, which obliged the combatants to respect human rights, Janowski said. </P>
