<P>  President Clinton Thursday told Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus the United States will expand the NATO alliance despite Russian obections, the Czech leader said. </P>
<P> ``I was assured that the president is in favor of the expansion of NATO,'' Klaus told reporters after meeting Clinton in the Oval Office. ``He knows that the Czech Republic belongs to the first countries which would be included in NATO,'' he said, adding that Clinton said he would discuss the issue with Russian President Boris Yeltsin next week in Moscow. </P>
<P> ``He confirmed that his position is strong (and) that it can't be influenced in a negative way,'' Klaus said. </P>
<P> Clinton and Yeltsin are to meet at the Kremlin next Wednesday to discuss several areas of disagreement, including whether or not NATO should be expanded -- something Moscow views as a threat to its security. </P>
<P> Klaus stressed that his nation's desire to join the military alliance ``is nothing against Russia,'' but driven by a wish to become fully integrated into Europe. </P>
<P> The talks between Clinton and Yeltsin will follow celebrations on Tuesday marking the 50th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany. Clinton also will visit Ukraine before returning to Washington on May 12. </P>
