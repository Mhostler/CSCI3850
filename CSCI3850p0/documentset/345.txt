<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Security Council Thursday endorsed Russia's troops in Georgia and at the same time made sure U.N. military observers had the authority to monitor their activities. </P>
<P> After weeks of negotiations, the council unanimously adopted a resolution, which, in effect, gives U.N. legitimacy to Russia's controversial peacekeepers without formally authorizing their dispatch. </P>
<P> As a trade-off, U.N. observers -- increased from 55 to 136 -- are free to monitor, investigate and report on the operation to enforce a cease-fire between Georgia and its breakaway province of Abkhazia. The resolution extends the U.N. Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG) for six months. </P>
<P> ``An important aspect of the resolution is clearly expressed in its positive attitude towards the peacekeepers,'' said Russia's ambassador Yuli Vorontsov, after outlining their accomplishments to date. Most members agreed that Russian troops so far had performed admirably. </P>
<P> ``We have moved firmly, if cautiously, but above all positively,'' said U.S. ambassador Madeleine Albright, a sponsor of the resolution along with Russia, Britain, France and Germany, which is not a council member. </P>
<P> But several members, including Pakistan, New Zealand and Brazil, expressed the misgivings in recognizing the force, made up almost solely of members from one country, with a direct political interest in the outcome of the conflict. </P>
<P> Council President Jamsheed Marker of Pakistan said he would have preferred the United Nations organize the force as Georgia originally requested. </P>
<P> ``Pakistan is concerned over an emerging tendency to attribute peacekeeping roles to the countries of the region... especially when those countries have direct interest in the area of the conflict,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``The members states of the U.N. should in no way abrogate their responsibilities in such a manner,'' he added. </P>
<P> Moscow has fielded a 3,000-strong force to reinforce a fragile cease-fire on the Abkhaz border and oversee the return of 250,000 ethnic Georgians who fled the lush Black Sea province when the rebels prevailed last year. </P>
<P> Some soldiers from other former Soviet republics who are now members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) may join the operation but are not there. </P>
<P> Russia had insisted that at a minimum the United Nations, which sidestepped sending or paying for peacekeepers, had to welcome Moscow's efforts in Georgia. At one point Ambassador Yuli Vorontsov threatened to block any action Washington wanted in Haiti if its efforts were not recognized. </P>
<P> The council's hesitation also stemmed in part from earlier Georgian accusations that maverick Russian military units trained the Abkhaz rebels and supplied them with arms in a bid to reassert Moscow's presence in the strategic region. </P>
<P> But now that Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze has turned back to Russia for help, the council welcomed Moscow's peacekeepers but stressed U.N. monitoring. </P>
<P></P>
<P> -- Welcomes Russia's contribution of a peacekeeping force. -- Commends CIS efforts in maintaining a cease-fire and towards returning refugees to their homes in Abkhazia. </P>
<P> -- Authorizes the U.N. mission to monitor and verify the cease-fire and a separation of forces agreement signed by combatants in May and to observe operations of Russian troops. </P>
<P> -- Allows U.N. observers to investigate violations of the May pact on their own initiative or at the request any party. </P>
<P> -- Establishes a fund for the peacekeepers, or other relief aid projects, with donors able to specify a preference. </P>
