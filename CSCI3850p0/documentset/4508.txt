<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Former congressman Donald Lukens, convicted in 1989 for having sex with a teen-age girl, has been indicted on five criminal counts of conspiracy and bribery, the Justice Department said Thursday. </P>
<P> It said Lukens, 64, a Republican who served in Congress from 1987 through 1990, was taken into custody by FBI agents in Dallas after being charged with accepting tens of thousands of dollars in bribes. </P>
<P> The federal grand jury indictment alleged that Lukens in 1990 accepted $27,500 in payments from his co-defendant, Ohio businessman John Fitzpatrick, and Henry Whitesell, whose 1990 shooting death is under investigation by Ohio authorities. </P>
<P> In return for the alleged payoff, Lukens was charged with using his congressional office to assist the two associates in connection with a trade school they operated in Ohio. </P>
<P> The indictment also charged Lukens with soliticing and accepting four bribery payments, ranging from $2,500 to $15,000, between May and September 1990, right before he resigned from Congress. </P>
<P> Lukens, who lives in Middletown, Ohio, faces up to 65 years in prison and a $1.25 million fine if convicted on the charges. </P>
<P> Lukens resigned Oct. 24, 1990, just days after a House ethics panel began probing allegations he made advances to a congressional employee who worked as an elevator operator. He had been defeated in the Republican primary in May 1990. </P>
<P> Lukens was convicted in 1989 on charges of having sex with a 16-year-old girl whose mother accused Lukens of offering her a government job to buy her silence. </P>
<P> The indictment arose out of a Justice Department investigation into the House bank scandal, which emerged in 1991 when it was disclosed that a large number of lawmakers had overdrawn their accounts. The bank then was closed. </P>
<P> Former congresswoman Mary Rose Oakar, a Democrat from Cleveland, was indicted Wednesday on conspiracy charges, conversion of government funds, filing a false financial disclosure report and making false statements to the FBI. </P>
<P> Oakar, whose case also arose as a result of the House bank scandal, denied any wrongdoing and predicted she would be vindicated. </P>
<P> ``There is no substance to these false and misleading charges. I have never profited from my public service,'' she said, adding she had devoted her political career to ``workers, the elderly, the poor (and) the uninsured.''  She has hired prominent defense attorney Kenneth Mundy, who represented Washington, D.C., Mayor Marion Barry at his drug trial. Barry was convicted on only one of the charges against him. </P>
