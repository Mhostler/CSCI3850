<P>  Nick Leeson, the vanished futures trader at the heart of the Barings financial collapse, was fined for indecent exposure last year, The Business Times reported Wednesday. </P>
<P> Leeson ``dropped his pants in front of a group of women'' at a Singapore discotheque about five months ago, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> ``When they asked him to apologize, he dared the women to report the matter to the police and handed them his handphone,'' Business Times said. ``The women promptly phoned the police and Leeson subsequently found himself before a magistrate and was fined $140 for indecent exposure.'' </P>
<P> Singapore police had no comment on the reported incident. </P>
<P> Leeson, 28, is at the center of a $1-billion trading loss that brought down the two-century-old Barings. </P>
<P> Malaysian police have put out a general alert for the Briton, who was the Baring Futures general manager in Singapore. </P>
<P> He was last seen in the Regent Hotel in Kuala Lumpur Feb. </P>
