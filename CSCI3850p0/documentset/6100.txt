<P>  A U.S. senator who helped liberate the German concentration camp at Buchenwald 50 years ago said Thursday he can never forget the piles of bodies he saw there. </P>
<P> ``I saw them thrown in piles like cordword,'' Sen. Strom Thurmond said at a Holocaust Days of Remembrance ceremony at the U.S. Capitol Rotunda. ``Most were dead, a few were not.'' </P>
<P> Thurmond said most of the Jews and other inmates of the camp were starved to death but others had been shot or clubbed with wooden mallets. ``How could anybody be so inhuman, so brutal?'' the South Carolina Republican asked. </P>
<P> ``The world must never forget what occurred at these concentration camps. Never forget!'' Thurmond told the audience, which included Holocaust survivors and other veterans from units which freed Nazi camps. </P>
<P> Thurmond, now 92, was a U.S. Army officer during World War II. He took part in the D-Day landing and entered Buchenwald on April 12, 1945. </P>
<P> Most of the other camps were captured by allied forces by the end of April and the war in Europe ended on May 8. </P>
<P> The late Henry Morgenthau, President Franklin Roosevelt's Treasury Secretary, was awarded the Dwight D. Eisenhower Liberation Medal at the ceremony for his work in helping Jewish concentration camp victims. It was accepted by his son Robert, the attorney general for New York County. </P>
