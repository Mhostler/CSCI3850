<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A Turkish court ordered the confiscation of all copies of the country's leading pro-Kurdish newspaper Thursday in a drive against alleged separatist forces, its editor said. </P>
<P> Under the order issued in Istanbul all copies of Ozgur Ulke are to be seized beginning Thursday evening, editor-in-chief Baki Karadeniz told Reuters. </P>
<P> ``This proves there is no freedom of the press in Turkey,'' he said. A copy of the order was faxed to Reuters. </P>
<P> Turkey's general clampdown on dissent -- particularly over the Kurdish issue -- has troubled Turkey's Western allies and trading partners. </P>
<P> Last week, an Istanbul prosecutor announced he was pressing separatism charges against Yasar Kemal, Turkey's best known author, for writing that Turkey oppressed its Kurds. </P>
<P> The author could face a five-year jail term for his article, published in January in the German magazine Der Spiegel. </P>
<P> Kemal's lawyers said Thursday an Istanbul state security court ordered the confiscation of a book of essays, ``The Freedom of Thought and Turkey,'' because it included his article. </P>
<P> Lawyers, writers and intellectuals say they detect a toughening of the judicial system as more people, even business groups, begin discussing the state's harsh line against the Kurdish separatist insurgency in the southeast. </P>
<P> Condemnation from the West over the jail terms of eight Kurdish MPs in December helped Greece veto a proposed customs pact between Turkey and the European Union. The issue will be discussed again next month. </P>
