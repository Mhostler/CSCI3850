<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Newly elected Democrats in the House of Representatives told President Clinton Thursday he needs to do ``a much better job'' of informing Americans of the wisdom of his policies. </P>
<P> Their unsolicited political advice came at a White House meeting with Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. </P>
<P> Rep. Mike Doyle of Pennsylvania, one of 13 Democrats who bucked the Republican tide in last November's election to win a House seat, said he and his colleagues pressed Clinton ``to do a much better job communicating some of (his) successes.'' </P>
<P> ``A lot of people who are just struggling to make ends meet, working two jobs and not seeing their incomes get any higher aren't hearing the message,'' Doyle said. </P>
<P> ``They aren't understanding that the administration is trying to focus on their concerns, and we need to do a much better job getting that message to the American people.'' </P>
<P> Calfornia Rep. Zoe Lofgren said Clinton and Gore ``spent a lot of time listening'' during the 75-minute meeting. </P>
<P> They were ``getting our ideas, understanding what working families are going through in our districts, son they would understand those issues. It was a remarkable experience,'' she told reporters. </P>
<P> Clinton's congressional supporters have often complained about his communications failures, and he is taking steps to allay their concerns and lay the groundwork for a re-election bid in 1996. </P>
<P> These included the installation of former State Department spokesman Mike McCurry as White House press secretary, and the prospective naming of Sen. Christopher Dodd, a wily veteran of many political campaigns, as Democratic Party chairman. </P>
<P> Clinton had been expected to announce Dodd's selection on Thursday, but the White House said logistical and scheduling problems would delay the announcement until the weekend. </P>
<P> Some Democratic state party leaders have complained that Dood is too liberal for the post and cannot give it his undivided attention because of his Senate responsibilities. But White House officials said Clinton was determined to name him. </P>
