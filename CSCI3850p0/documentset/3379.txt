<P>  Hundreds of Mexican troops seized control Thursday of the town of Larrainzar from leftist peasant guerrillas in the crisis-torn southern state of Chiapas. </P>
<P> Reporters said about 600 soldiers and police in a column of light tanks mounted with heavy machine guns and army trucks rumbled into the central Chiapas town, which had been controlled by the rebel Zapatista National Liberation Army since Monday. </P>
<P> There was no fighting because Zapatista rebels posted on the outskirts of the town took cover when the army column approached, witnesses said. </P>
<P> Zapatista soldiers in Larrainzar, which is 12 miles northwest of San Cristobal de Las Casas, told reporters late Wednesday that they would sidestep any army advance but pledged not to leave the area. </P>
<P> The army column, led by two generals, moved in after soldiers filled in deep ditches in the highway approaching the town which had been dug by Zapatista rebels and their supporters to prevent government troops from launching a quick attack on nearby rebel positions. </P>
<P> Dozens of townspeople applauded the soldiers as they moved into the main square. </P>
<P> The Zapatistas occupied Larrainzar and several other Chiapas towns Monday after leaving their jungle strongholds and slipping through army lines, but the army has steadily regained control without either side firing a single shot. </P>
<P> The rebels told reporters their orders were to avoid combat while resisting any military offensive to force them back into the dense Lacandon jungle. </P>
