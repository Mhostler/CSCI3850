<DATELINE>LONDON, May 19 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  British health officials said on Friday that the condition of three people from Zaire under observation had improved and they were unlikely to be carrying the deadly Ebola virus. </P>
<P> The three -- a mother and two children -- were taken to hospital after they felt unwell while visiting a Home Office (interior ministry) building in Croydon, south of London. </P>
<P> A spokesman for the Public Health Laboratory Service said: ``The fever they had has subsided overnight and they all have normal temperatures.'' </P>
<P> She said that if they did have Ebola they would not be getting better. She added they were not being tested for the virus but the family was undergoing other tests. </P>
<P> The Ebola virus has killed 79 people in Zaire since the end of March, most of them in the town of Kikwit, 500 km (350 miles) from Kinshasa, where the outbreak began. </P>
<P> Ebola, which has spread panic in Zaire and frightened people worldwide, kills by causing severe internal bleeding and shock and is passed on by contact with the blood from victims. </P>
<P> The three were placed in an isolation ward in an unnamed hospital, north of the British capital, as a matter of precaution. </P>
