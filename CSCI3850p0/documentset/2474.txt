<P>  Greek former banking tycoon George Koskotas, central figure in a multi-million dollar scandal that dragged down the Socialist government in 1989, was sentenced Tuesday to 25 years in prison for embezzlement. </P>
<P> A three-member appeal court found Koskotas guilty of embezzling millions from the Bank of Crete and forging bank documents, court officials said. The court gave seven other senior bank officials prison terms ranging from 10 to 16 years. </P>
<P> Koskotas, a financial tycoon and press baron during the 1981-1989 Socialist government, went on trial in January 1992 after a special court acquitted Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou of all charges in the case. The 13-judge court, set up by parliament in 1989, convicted two former ministers of involvement in the scandal. </P>
<P> Papandreou, who was re-elected last year, was cleared of charges of being behind a scheme to embezzle state funds deposited at the Bank of Crete, which Koskotas owned, and accepting bribes from the flamboyant banker. More than $200 million is missing from the bank, which came under state control in 1988. </P>
<P> Koskotas, 41, fled in November 1988 after being charged with embezzlement, forgery, and obstructing justice. He gave up a two-and-a-half year fight against extradition from the United States in June 1991 and was the main prosecution witness against Papandreou and two of his closest ministers. </P>
<P> Court officials said he has the right to appeal his sentence to a higher court. </P>
