<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The chairman of Exxon said in federal court Thursday the corporation is contrite, reformed and undeserving of further punishment for the nation's worst oil spill. </P>
<P> Lee Raymond, the oil giant's chairman and chief executive, testified in U.S. District Court as the final witness defending Exxon against claims for up to $15 billion in punitive damages for the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster. </P>
<P> Raymond, recounting his reaction when he heard about the grounding of the tanker, said: ``I was chagrined, I was horrified and, to an extent, devastated that it happened.'' </P>
<P> He quoted a statement made by his wife after the incident. ''Her comment to me was that it was the first time she'd ever been embarrassed that we worked for Exxon.'' </P>
<P> He refuted contentions by the plantiffs -- some 10,000 commercial fishermen and thousands of Alaska Natives, plus property owners and coastal municipalities -- that the spill had little economic effect on the giant corporation. </P>
<P> He said $2.8 billion has been paid or ordered to be paid by Exxon for cleanup, environmental-damage restitution, compensation to fishermen and other Alaskans and misdemanor fines. </P>
<P> ``There has never been any single event in the history of the copmany that has had this kind of expense associated with it,'' Raymond said. </P>
<P> The prospect of punitive damages came after jurors ruled in the first phase of the summer-long trial that recklessness by Exxon and former captain Joseph Hazelwood caused the 11 million gallon spill. </P>
<P> In the trial's second phase, which ended early this month, the jury awarded $286.8 million in compensation to fishermen. </P>
<P> Exxon also struck a partial settlement with some 3,500 Alaska Natives -- Alutiiq Eskimos, Indians and Aleuts -- for $20 million in replacement costs for food traditionally harvested from the spill area's waters and beaches. </P>
<P> The third phase, which started Monday, is over how much, if anything, Exxon should pay in punitive fines. Closing arguments are scheduled for Friday. </P>
<P> In cross-examination by plaintiff attorney Brian O'Neill, Raymond refused to admit recklessness caused the grounding. </P>
<P> Augustus Elmer, president of SeaRiver Maritime, the division that used to be known as Exxon Shipping Co, also testified Thursday. He spoke of the safety improvements Exxon made after the spill. </P>
<P> The company boosted crew sizes, instituted the recording of work hours to avoid crew fatigue, strengthened drug and alcohol policies and adopted stricter rules about tanker travel through ice and other marine conditions, he said. </P>
