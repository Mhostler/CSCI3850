<P>  The United Nations refugee agency warned Friday of a possible catastrophe around the Zairean town of Bukavu unless massive international assistance was provided immediately for displaced Rwandans. </P>
<P> The appeal was issued by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in a statement said the situation around Bukavu could become worse than the one that now exists around Goma. </P>
<P> A UNHCR spokesman said the statement was prepared before reports Friday that thousands of Rwandan Hutus were streaming towards the Zairean border from the southwestern security zone created by France. </P>
<P> Spokesman Fernando del Mundo said the UNHCR had no information on how many new refugees could materialize since none had actually yet crossed the border to Bukavu. </P>
<P> He added that the population movement seemed to be inspired by Hutu radio broadcasts warning of insecurity in the region. </P>
<P> The UNHCR statement said the agency was having difficulties finding appropriate sites and supplies for about 320,000 Rwandan refugees in the Bukavu region. </P>
<P> To the south, Uvira is struggling to care for 150,000 Rwandan and an extra 100,000 Burundi refugees. </P>
<P> ``The office (of the High Commissioner) is urging donors to help in providing water and sanitation facilities, trucks and in-site preparation in Bukavu and Uvira,'' the statement said. </P>
<P> ``The assistance programs in the Bukavu and Uvira region have assumed urgency amid concerns of a potential major new influx of Rwandese refugees unless the presence of U.N. forces is strengthened in the protection zones, more confidence building measures are taken and proper levels of relief aid are put in place,'' it added. </P>
<P> ``If an exodus happens, the situation in the Bukavu region cold be worse than what is now happening in Goma.'' </P>
