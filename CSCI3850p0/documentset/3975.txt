<DATELINE>PARIS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Christian Lacroix sent the fashion crowd into near hysteria Thursday with a stunning couture collection that won him veneration worthy of a messiah. </P>
<P> With near-religious fervor, the audience swept to its feet and pelted Lacroix with flowers, screaming ``Bravo! Bravo!'' as he shyly ventured onto the catwalk after a collection that will certainly go down in couture history. </P>
<P> Lacroix, 43, who closed the week of couture shows, did not present a single one of the retro revivals the overwhelming majority of designers have shown this season. </P>
<P> A tremor shook the gilt and mirrored ballroom as the crowd chanted in unison ``Christian, Christian,'' calling him back out for an encore. </P>
<P> He conjured up magnificent evening gowns of taffeta, tulle or organza with hasty bits of drapery that looked as though they'd been distractedly knotted and forgotten, quivering across a bust or cascading down a skirt front. </P>
<P> Pastel satins and chiffons, highlighted by black Chantilly or shimmering embroidery, were sculpted into bustiers and ingenuously tailored jackets that cinched waistlines and curved out at the hip. </P>
<P> On other catwalks this Spring Summer season, the late 1950s and early 1960s Jackie Kennedy look has dominated. </P>
<P> Curvy jackets emphasizing hourglass figures and tight over-the-knee skirts harking back to Alfred Hitchcock films were shown in nearly all the major collections -- Valentino, Gianni Versace, Christian Dior, Balmain and Guy Laroche. </P>
<P> Voluptuous bodies are back in style -- flat chests, boyish hips and androgynous clothes are out. </P>
<P> Several designers mimicked Christian Dior's bracelet sleeves clipped half-way up the forearm, with shoulders slightly padded and squared. </P>
<P> Demure pastels and pearly gray and beige were the most popular colors this week in keeping with an ultra-feminine mood, and even Lacroix discarded his gaudy chartreuse, fuschia and brown matches in favor of more harmonious shades. </P>
<P> Trousers were rare, except at Jean-Louis Scherrer, where Bernard Perris matched them with waistcoats, neckties and redingotes, clinging to the 1970s dandy look of past seasons. </P>
<P> Haute couture, a unique craft of individual creations and one-of-a-kind styling, is not meant to follow trends. Yet most collections this week seemed to come from the same basket. </P>
<P> Originality was missing from the catwalks, but so were the supermodels. Aside from Claudia Schiffer, the best known women were Nadja Auermann, Carla Bruni and Elle Mcpherson who made special appearances for Valentino and Dior. </P>
<P> Naomi Campbell was busy making a video for her latest album and according to Women's Wear Daily (WWD) trade paper, Kate Moss was seen last Saturday in Los Angeles with actor boyfriend Johnny Depp at the Golden Globe awards. </P>
<P> WWD also said Christy Turlington's astronomical fees had scared off the couturiers while Linda Evangelista could not be found. </P>
