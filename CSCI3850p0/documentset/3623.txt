<P>  The border crossing from China's southern boomtown of Shenzhen to the British territory of Hong Kong is the busiest land transport post in Asia, the Xinhua news agency said Saturday. </P>
<P> A total of 3.97 million vehicles carrying 9.78 million tons of cargo crossed the border in 1994, the agency said. </P>
<P> The Huanggang crossing point was designed with a capacity to handle 50,000 vehicles a year when it was set up five years ago. But at peak times the crossing handles 15,000 vehicles a day, and is the busiest in Asia, Xinhua said. </P>
<P> To boost efficiency, the Huanggang customs post has set up a special lane for empty vehicles, which account for almost 30 percent of traffic. </P>
<P> It is China's first round-the-clock customs point, expanding working hours to 24 a day from Nov. 3, Xinhua said. </P>
