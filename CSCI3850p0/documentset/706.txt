<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  East Timor's Roman Catholic bishop has scathingly attacked Indonesia for alleged killings, torture and arbitrary arrests in the former Portuguese colony and wants a public referendum to decide its future. </P>
<P> Bishop Carlo Belo said in an open letter, obtained by Reuters Thursday, that Indonesia should reduce its military presence and hold talks with those fighting for self-rule. </P>
<P> Indonesia annexed East Timor 18 years ago with a bloody invasion. </P>
<P> The letter, signed by Belo and bearing the diocesan seal, had been widely circulated in East Timor, residents said. A copy was sent to the Vatican's diplomatic mission in Jakarta. </P>
<P> Foreign Ministry spokesman Irawan Abidin said in Jakarta that he regretted Belo's remarks and dismissed them as allegations. </P>
<P> ``There is nothing new in what he is saying,'' he said. ``We cannot turn the clock back. East Timor was made part of Indonesia in accordance with all the rules.'' </P>
<P> Belo's attack comes after troops used tear gas and sticks to break up a demonstration in East Timor's capital, Dili, in July when hundreds of protesters marched to the local parliament building after two nuns were insulted by four men. </P>
<P> The clash, criticized by Indonesia's trading partners, the United States and Australia, was the worst since troops shot and killed up to 200 demonstrators in a Dili cemetery in 1991. </P>
<P> The cemetery is one of the places to be visited by a Japanese delegation of legislators and journalists currently in East Timor to observe the human rights situation. </P>
<P> The Japanese, who have said Tokyo will help find a solution for East Timor, are the first foreigners to enter the ex-colony since the July 14 demonstration, in which 20 people were hurt. </P>
<P> Belo, who turned down offers to serve in European churches to return to East Timor after he was ordained in 1980, said in the letter the Catholic Church was concerned over the worsening religious and cultural conditions. </P>
<P> Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976, a year after its invasion, but the action has never been recognized by the United Nations. </P>
