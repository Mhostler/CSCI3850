<P>  The Dominican government said Friday it will not permit the entrance of any more Haitian political leaders linked to the coup that toppled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. </P>
<P> ``The country is not in a condition to accept anyone,'' said Foreign Minister Carlos Morales Troncoso. </P>
<P> He also said the presence in the country of former police chief Joseph Michel Francois, who arrived on a tourist visa on Tuesday, is temporary. </P>
<P> Dominican intelligence officials who have spoken with Francois said he plans to remain in the Dominican Republic permanently. He has been staying in the capital with his brother, Evans, formerly Haitian envoy to the country, who has been living in the Dominican capital for months. </P>
<P> Speaking to reporters as he left a meeting with Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer, Morales Troncoso emphatically denied press reports that Haitian army chief Lieutenant-General Raoul Cedras and Philippe Biamby, his aide, have arrived at the Dominican frontier and plan to enter the country. </P>
<P> Intelligence sources had said earlier Friday that Cedras and Biamby had not asked for Dominican political asylum. One who said he spoke to Cedras Wednesday said Cedras had indicated that he planned to travel to Spain and Biamby would go to Venezuela. </P>
<P> Morales Troncoso said Francois was allowed to enter the country only at the request of the United Nations High Commission on Refugees. </P>
