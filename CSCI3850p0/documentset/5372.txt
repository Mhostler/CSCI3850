<DATELINE>SEOUL, April 1 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Hans Blix, the director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), will arrive in Seoul on April 6 for a three-day visit, a foreign ministry official said on Saturday. </P>
<P> Blix would attend an annual atomic power industrial meeting at the invitation by the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute, the official said. </P>
<P> Further details were not given. </P>
<P> ``He may exchange overall views on nuclear issues when he meets with senior officials,'' the dometic Yonhap news agency quoted a government official as saying. </P>
<P> Yonhap said Blix was scheduled to meet President Kim Young-sam and other government officials, including Foreign Minister Gong Ro-myung. </P>
<P> His trip drew public attention as North Korea has threatened to walk away from the landmark U.S.-North Korean nuclear deal agreed to in October if it is forced to accept South Korean reactors. South and North Koreas are still technically at war since 1950-53 civil war. </P>
<P> The United States has said South Korea should provide the reactors since only Seoul has agreed to shoulder the huge cost and Washington wants to encourage inter-Korean dialogue. </P>
<P> South Korean President Kim Young-sam said on Friday his country would not spend a penny unless Seoul plays a central role and a South Korean model is adopted. </P>
