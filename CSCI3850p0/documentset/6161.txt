<DATELINE>PARIS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  French presidential candidates Jacques Chirac and Lionel Jospin Sunday suspended their campaign to prepare for a two-hour televised duel that may hold the key to the May 7 election. </P>
<P> Chirac, the 62-year-old conservative frontrunner, and Socialist Jospin, 57, were to spend most of the next three days closeted with advisers to prepare in minute detail for Tuesday night's debate which surveys said could sway a fifth of voters. </P>
<P> Live televised duels, a tradition in French presidential elections, have proved to be a formidable hurdle in which a one-liner can break a candidate or make a president. </P>
<P> Playing on each other's nerves, both candidates, asked what they wished their opponent, told the weekly Journal du Dimanche: ``Serenity.'' </P>
<P> Chirac went into the last week to the run-off buoyed by solid conservative support and a consistent lead estimated by the last permitted opinion polls at 54 to 55 percent to Jospin's 45 to 46 percent. </P>
<P> The conservative camp, split over the failed first-round challenge of fellow-Gaullist Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, reunited behind Chirac over the weekend at a mass reconciliation rally in the Paris Bagatelle park. </P>
<P> Centrists, who had backed Balladur, were prompt to demand a reward for their support but drew no response from Chirac. </P>
<P> ``We'll take all our place in the new government and the new majority since we intend to take all our place in action,'' said Democratic and Social Center (CDS) leader Francois Bayrou. </P>
<P> ``My objective today is to win ... We are not yet at the stage of forming a government,'' Chirac told the Journal du Dimanche. </P>
<P> On the eve of the anti-immigrant National Front (FN) annual Mayday rally at which leader Jean-Marie Le Pen is to disclose his position in the run-off, Chirac made a direct pitch for the the far-right's strategic 15 percent share of the vote. </P>
<P> ``I am convinced that many among National Front voters reject with all their strength a third Socialist term,'' he said. </P>
<P> Jospin, who won the backing of Greens leader Dominique Voynet, was wary of upsetting leftwingers with an overture to Le Pen. ``I have always fought vigorously the National Front's ideas, without the least concession,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``A wink to the National Front is out of the question,'' said his aide Dominique Strauss-Kahn. </P>
<P> Analysts said that, despite Socialist proposals to water down tough anti-immigration laws, Le Pen could be tempted to withhold his support from Chirac with a view to gaining a foothold in parliament. </P>
<P> The first-past-the-post voting system has kept the FN out of parliament, and Jospin has proposed to dissolve the right-dominated National Assembly and introduce a share of proportional representation. </P>
<P> As the candidates left the political scene to their aides, a mantle of secrecy fell on preparations for the debate. </P>
<P> The two camps have negotiated to the last details, including the lighting, the place of the 10 cameras, the shape and size of the table. They were said to be still discussing the list of issues and the order in which they would be raised. </P>
<P> ``We are on the eve of an election quite different from previous ones. The televised duel could well play a bigger role than previously,'' said political commentator Alain Duhamel, who has been chosen by both camps to lead the program with television presenter Guillaume Durand. </P>
