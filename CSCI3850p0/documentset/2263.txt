<DATELINE>LONDON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Ireland has banned Oliver Stone's controversial film ``Natural Born Killers'' and British authorities have delayed release of the saga about a couple on a murderous rampage. </P>
<P> Stone has defended the film, starring Woody Harrelson from television's ``Cheers'' as a psychopath, as a satire on how the media turns serial killers into celebrities. </P>
<P> Ireland's film censor, Sheamus Smith, announced the ban Wednesday without giving any reason for the decision. The film was due to be released in Ireland Nov. 18. </P>
<P> The British Board of Film Classification is debating whether to give it a certificate and its release has now been delayed until next year. </P>
<P> ``At the moment it has not got a classification and the board will not make a comment on a film that has not been classified,'' a spokesman for the board said Thursday. </P>
<P> Warner Brothers, the film's distributor, confirmed the delay and a spokeswoman said: ``This is very disappointing.'' </P>
