<DATELINE>GAZA (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  PLO leader Yasser Arafat and the Muslim militant group Hamas reached agreement Monday to defuse tension after inter-Palestinian clashes in Gaza in which 13 people died. </P>
<P> Mohammad Barakeh, an Israeli Arab mediator in the dispute, told Israel Radio: ``This agreement puts an end to the bloodshed so that relations will be conducted on the basis of dialogue and not on the basis of confrontation and violence.'' </P>
<P> The 13 were killed and as many as 200 wounded Friday in the most bloodshed since Israel handed over the teeming strip to Arafat's self-ruling Palestinian Authority six months ago. </P>
<P> The unrest pitted police of the Palestinian Authority against Muslim militants who oppose Arafat's 1993 peace deal with Israel. </P>
<P> Talab al-Sane', an Arab member of the Israeli parliament who had joined in the mediation, said Sunday night that Hamas, the PLO's leading rival, had dropped a demand that Arafat accept blame for Friday's violence. </P>
<P> He said Hamas accepted a clause that would empower a 20-member fact-finding mission with ``all facilities'' to investigate the bloodshed, though it was still unclear whether the Islamic group would join the inquiry. </P>
<P> The two sides hotly dispute how the shooting began. Witnesses said police opened fire on stone-throwers but the Palestinian Authority said the first shots were at police. </P>
<P> In New York, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin reaffirmed his commitment to the peace deal with Arafat, telling reporters that to halt the process would reward ``the enemies of peace.'' </P>
<P> ``I don't want to deal with internal Palestinian issues,'' Rabin said of the Gaza clashes. </P>
<P> ``The only test is the establishment of law and order and the prevention of a possibility that actually exists today of attacks against Israelis in the Gaza Strip itself and beyond.'' </P>
<P> Barakeh said there was nothing in the agreement requiring Hamas to be disarmed, or barred from launching anti-Israeli attacks from the strip, home to nearly one million Palestinians. </P>
<P> Arafat, meeting some 100 Palestinians from Jerusalem in his Gaza headquarters Sunday, suggested outsiders may have taken part in the shooting. </P>
<P> He held up X-rays for his top health official Riyad al-Zaanoun to point out wounds from dumdum and plastic bullets. ``Who has dumdum bullets, my brothers? Who has plastic bullets?'' Arafat asked several times. </P>
<P> Members of the crowd, who applauded Arafat warmly throughout his speech, cried out ``Israel'' and ``the Zionist enemy.'' Israel denied any involvement in Friday's events. </P>
<P> Dumdums are soft-nosed bullets that expand on impact, causing gaping wounds. Plastic bullets are often used for riot control by Israeli troops in the occupied West Bank, but they can be lethal. </P>
<P> Earlier Hamas's military wing demanded Arafat sack three senior officials -- his police commander, ``justice minister'' and another official -- execute four collaborators and agree to a string of other conditions if he wanted peace. </P>
