<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, May 17 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Indian government has cleared a political mine from the ruling Congress party's path before general elections next year by deciding to let an anti-terrorist law widely condemned by Moslems to expire. </P>
<P> Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's cabinet decided late on Tuesday to let the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Act (TADA) die a natural death when it lapses on May 23. </P>
<P> India's large Moslem minority as well as human rights groups had long denounced the 10-year-old TADA, which critics say has been used to keep thousands of innocent people behind bars. </P>
<P> TADA's most controversial provision allows police to keep people in jail for up to a year without charges or trial. </P>
<P> More recently opposition to the law had been building within Rao's Congress party following defeats in state elections. </P>
<P> Congress' dismal showing in the polls was partly attributed to a widespread belief that TADA had unfairly targetted Moslems, who make up about 120 million of India's population of 900 million and have traditionally voted for Congress. </P>
<P> Railways Minister C.K. Jaffer Sharief and Civil Aviation Minster Ghulam Nabi Azad -- both Moslems -- had threatened to quit Rao's government unless TADA was allowed to lapse. ``Either TADA must go or the government will go,'' Sharief said. </P>
<P> The law, enacted one decade ago during a violent separatist uprising centred in the northwestern state of Punjab, was also criticised for failing to control terrorist acts. </P>
<P> The head of the National Human Rights Commission had urged the government to do away with the ``draconian'' law. U.N. Human Rights Commissioner Jose Ayala Lasso also criticised the law during a visit to India earlier this month. </P>
<P> With international attention focused anew on Kashmir following the destruction of a revered shrine last week and a resurgence of tension, the government was under increased pressure to polish its human rights record. </P>
<P> Indian troops have been accused of widespread rights abuses in Kashmir, including rape, torture and summary killings. </P>
<P> More than 65,000 people have been arrested under TADA. Only a fraction of those detained have been charged and fewer than one person in 100 has been convicted. </P>
<P> The law has provided the muscle for a crackdown following bombings in Bombay in 1992 that killed 260 people. Film star Sanjay Dutt is among the nearly 200 people, mostly Moslems, who are on trial for the blasts, but many more have been detained. </P>
<P> Earlier this month Rao met chief ministers from India's 26 states who were split over whether to extend TADA. </P>
<P> States bordering Pakistan in the west or led by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) favoured keeping the law but preventing abuses, while many other states as well as leftist parties like the Janata Dal came out against it. </P>
<P> The cabinet decided to revise existing statutes instead of extending TADA, government officials said. The government will not extend TADA's authority to hold closed-door trials and detain people for long periods for mere possession of weapons. </P>
<P> However, existing statutes are expected to be amended to extend maximum police detention to 30 days from 15 and judicial custody to 90 days from 60, newspapers said. </P>
<P> Opposition parties led by the BJP accused Rao, who is grappling with a rebellion within Congress as well as a mounting challenge from other parties, of trying to make political hay ahead of elections he wants to hold before next April. </P>
