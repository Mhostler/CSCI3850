<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Republicans are increasingly divided over a controversial House welfare reform plan to deny benefits to legal immigrants, with lawmakers calling for major changes in the legislation.  Florida Republican Ileana Ros-Lehtinen said Tuesday that she and fellow Florida Republican Lincoln Diaz-Balart want the bill amended to let states decide whether to bar benefits to legal immigrants, many of whom pay taxes. </P>
<P> The two lawmakers, who refused to sign the House ``Contract with America'' because of the immigration provision, will meet this week with House Speaker Newt Gingrich to discuss the immigration plank in the bill, estimated to raise $22 billion. </P>
<P> ``I am unsure we will be successful,'' Ros-Lehtinen said. ''The money that comes from limiting aid to legal aliens is the mechanism to fund the economic reforms, tax credits ... in the Contract.''  In addition, a key Republican senator and state governors have expressed doubts about the wisdom of the measure, which would bar government aid to a legal immigrants, affecting mainly older retirees and the disabled. </P>
<P> Gingrich last week appeared to back off the plan, part of his 100-day ``Contract With America,'' saying the issue should be revisited. But top lawmakers on the House Ways and Means Committee are determined to keep the provision in the bill, partly because they support the principle and partly because the plan saves $22 billion over five years. </P>
<P> ``These people are not our responsibility if they're not our citizens,'' said Florida Republican Clay Shaw, chairman of the House Ways and Means subcommittee that will write the welfare reform bill. </P>
<P> ``The obligation we have is to our own citizens, not to legal residents who have not received citizenship,'' he said. </P>
<P> The head of the Senate Labor Committee, Nancy Kassebaum, a Kansas Republican who will have jurisdiction over part of welfare reform, said she did not think the House plan would fly in the Senate. </P>
<P> ``I think it would be awfully hard to make the case that people who are paying taxes and contributing to the economy would find themselves unable to participate in the benefits system,'' she said, adding she had heard Republican senators express doubts about the House immigration plan. </P>
<P> During a House hearing last week, Michigan Gov. John Engler, a leader in welfare reform efforts, said he did not support a federal requirement to cut off immigrant benefits. </P>
<P> Immigration has become an emotionally charged issue in recent months, with California voters approving Proposition 187 to bar benefits to illegal aliens. That measure is being challenged in court and Shaw said he expects a court challenge to the House Republican plan if it becomes law. </P>
<P> The Republican welfare reform bill would deny benefits to legal immigrants, including programs not generally thought of as ``welfare,'' such as child immunizations, job training and education programs. </P>
<P> The legislation has two exceptions -- allowing benefits to refugees for the first six years they are in the United States, and to elderly immigrants who are at least 75 and have lived in the United States for at least five years. </P>
<P> ``They (Republicans) are split and I think there's going to be a pretty serious fight about it,'' said Cecilia Munoz, deputy vice president of the National Council of LaRaza. </P>
<P> The welfare proposal is only part of what many activists hope will be a major push by congressional Republicans to rewrite U.S. immigration policy. </P>
<P> ``It's certainly a desirable policy ... (but) just cutting immigrants off welfare is not a substitute for immigration reform,'' said Dan Stein, executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform. </P>
