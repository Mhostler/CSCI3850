<DATELINE>PALE, Bosnia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Bosnian Serb army commander General Ratko Mladic said Friday his forces would retaliate against NATO and the United Nations for an allied air attack against a Serb tank west of Sarajevo. </P>
<P> ``It is not just a matter of retaliating against NATO, it is also against those who ordered the planes to take off,'' Mladic told Bosnian Serb television in Pale, outside Sarajevo. </P>
<P> Mladic's condemnation of the raid, carried out by NATO at U.N. request in response to Serb attacks on U.N. peacekeepers, echoed earlier threats by the Bosnian Serb army (BSA) to retaliate and repeated the Serb view the attack was unjust. </P>
<P> ``The current U.N. commanders have in full lined up behind NATO and they are forerunners of the NATO force. My message is they should give up these insane acts against the Serb people and its army.'' </P>
<P> Mladic made no mention of the attacks on U.N. peacekeepers, which seriously wounded a French soldier, or U.N. accusations that the BSA has repeatedly violated a U.N. heavy weapons exclusion zone around Sarajevo. </P>
<P> ``We are by no means jeopardizing the U.N. peace mission nor any of the NATO member states,'' Mladic said. </P>
<P> A U.N. spokesman in Sarajevo said the Serbs directed fire at U.N. peacekeepers after the air strike Thursday evening but said the overall military situation Friday appeared relatively stable. </P>
<P> Mladic called for a political solution to Bosnia's 29-month war and alleged the Muslim-led Bosnian army was launching assaults on Serb positions in hopes that an ``outside force, whether it's NATO or somebody else, will realize their war goals.'' </P>
<P> But he said the BSA, which currently controls 70 percent of the country, would prevail. ``They are no match to our army.'' </P>
<P> Mladic dismissed widespread rumors in Sarajevo and elsewhere that he had been wounded recently in the northwest enclave of Bihac. </P>
<P> ``During trouble, the Muslims usually say I'm either wounded or dead because they reckon it will have negative effects on our army and our people. But here I am sound and in one piece and in a good mood to keep up my work.'' </P>
