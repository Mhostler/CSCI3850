<P>  Bosnia's U.N. ambassador Friday suggested the United Nations consider court-martialing British Lt. Gen. Michael Rose for failing to act against Bosnian Serbs besieging Sarajevo. </P>
<P> Ambassador Muhamed Sacirbey, in a letter to British Ambassador David Hannay in his current role as Security Council president, said: ``It is our view, that in most armies subject to civilian authorities, General Rose's actions would at least garner a view of a potential court-martial.'' </P>
<P> ``We do not believe this assessment to be exaggerated, and instead we should question why there is no such review when the United Nations, rather than a national authority, is involved,'' he said. </P>
<P> The Security Council is not expected to take any action on the request, diplomats said. </P>
<P> Sacirbey faulted Rose, the commander for the U.N. Protection Force, or UNPROFOR, in Bosnia, for not agreeing to a NATO air strike Tuesday when Bosnian Serb forces opened fire on a U.N. convoy near Gorazde, killing a Bosnian driver employed by the United Nations. </P>
<P> He said this should be compared to a NATO retaliatory strike Sept. 22 when French peacekeepers were attacked. </P>
<P> ``We would like to believe that the life of a Bosnian employed under the U.N. mandate is not deemed of lesser value than of non-Bosnians working under the identical mandate and for the same objectives,'' he said. </P>
<P> Sacirbey also alleged that Rose was not following Security Council mandates and was undermining U.N. authority by his contacts with Bosnian Serb Gen. Ratko Mladic. It quoted a letter from Rose to Mladic saying UNPROFOR was not mandated to impose a solution through force or arms. </P>
<P> The United Nations at the time said UNPROFOR decided against an air strike after Bosnian Serbs gave assurances that the attack would cease, which it did. </P>
