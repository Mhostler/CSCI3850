<DATELINE>LONDON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Britain lost out to Spain on Friday in what it prides itself on doing best -- making a cup of tea. </P>
<P> Spain's national airline Iberia won the 1994 In-Flight Best Cup of Tea Award from Britain's National Tea Council, beating British Airways and British Midland at making their national drink. </P>
<P> ``We're absolutely delighted,'' said an Iberia spokeswoman after a team of tea tasters traveled 672,430 air miles on 239 flights on 30 different airlines. </P>
<P> The defeated Britons were characteristically tight-lipped. </P>
