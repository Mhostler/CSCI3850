<P>  Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi denied Thursday that his government had forced the resignation of anti-graft judge Antonio Di Pietro, while some opposition leaders called for his justice minister to resign. </P>
<P> ``I have criticized the ``Clean Hands' pool when I felt unjustly attacked and when my collaborators were victims of unfounded accusations,'' Berlusconi told La Repubblica newspaper in an interview. </P>
<P> ``But at the same time, I have always recognized the role of the magistrates in the battle against the perverse system of the first republic,'' he said. </P>
<P> Di Pietro, hero of Italy's anti-corruption drive, resigned Tuesday, sending shock waves across the country. </P>
<P> He said in an emotional letter to Milan's chief prosecutor Francesco Saverio Borrelli that he had been used in a game of political tug-of-war and that he was a hostage to politics. </P>
<P> Milan's anti-corruption ``Clean Hands'' magistrates have been at loggerheads with the government of Berlusconi, who is under investigation for alleged corruption. </P>
<P> Members of the government have accused the magistrates of over-stepping their judicial authority. Opposition politicians have said the government hounded Di Pietro out of the courts. </P>
<P> Centrist reformer Mario Segni Wednesday asked Italian Justice Minister Alfredo Biondi, who has come to blows with the anti-corruption judges on several occasions, to step down in the light of Di Pietro's resignation. </P>
<P> ``If he doesn't resign'' Segni told a news conference,'' I'm going to start a petition next week.'' </P>
<P> Segni said the government's attempt to push through a decree in July limiting the magistrates' powers of arrest, and a ministerial inspection of the magistrates' offices in Milan this month had created an atmosphere of tension. </P>
<P> Di Pietro has remained silent about his future, amid speculation the former policeman would go into politics. </P>
<P> Berlusconi told La Repubblica that Di Pietro would be warmly welcomed into the world of Italian politics. </P>
<P> ``He has qualities which would have great value on the political scene: personality, support and imagination,'' Berlusconi said. </P>
<P> ``Everyone would rather have him as an ally than a rival... I think his entrance into politics would be a positive move because he is unlikely to align himself with extremists. He's a man of the center,'' he added. </P>
<P> Di Pietro turned down an offer from Berlusconi earlier this year to become interior minister. </P>
