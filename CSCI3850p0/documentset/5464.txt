<DATELINE>BEIJING, April 5 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  China said on Wednesday it would try to slow a brain drain by fining state-financed students who fail to return on time from foreign studies or stray from their proposed curricula. </P>
<P> A reformed state-funded scheme for students getting degrees overseas will be tested in northeastern Jilin and eastern Jiangsu province and gradually introduced across China, the official China Daily reported. </P>
<P> State-funded students who fail to return on time or who stray from their planned studies will be obliged to return all state grants and face unspecified fines, the report said. </P>
<P> Education Minister Zhu Kaixuan told reporters in March that only 75,000 of the 220,000 students who have gone abroad to study since 1979 have come back. </P>
<P> Half of China's overseas students were state-funded, but Zhu did not say how many of those had returned. </P>
<P> The new rules require students selected to study overseas to sign contracts with the State Fund for Studying Abroad that define their rights and obligations, the China Daily said. </P>
<P> The fines will be meted according to the severity of a student's offence, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> It gave no details of the fines that would be levied. </P>
<P> Under the rules, qualified applicants in the two trial provinces can apply for funding for 80 new overseas study positions in April -- as long as they have their employers' approval. </P>
<P> Graduates whose university degrees were funded by the state are generally barred from study abroad until they have compensated the government by working in a state enterprise for a number of years. </P>
<P> Growing numbers of students are willing to pay lump sums to the state to avoid the restriction. </P>
