<P>  The Los Angeles City Council has approved a $512,000 payment to political activist and former Black Panther Michael Zinzun to settle a claim that he was defamed by police when he ran for office in 1989. </P>
<P> In his lawsuit against the city, Zinzun, 45, accused then Assistant Police Chief Robert Vernon of deliberately derailing his 1989 bid for a seat on the Pasadena City Council by issuing incorrect and damaging information to the news media. </P>
<P> Newspaper articles using that information implied that the Los Angeles Police Department's Anti-terrorist Division maintained a dossier on Zinzun. </P>
<P> In 1991, a Superior Court jury awarded Zinzun $3.8 million but that was thrown out by a judge. An appeal against the judge's decision had been pending since then. </P>
<P> The city council's decision Wednesday was the third legal victory for Zinzun, who is chairman of the Coalition Against Police Abuse. </P>
<P> In 1983, Zinzun and others sued the city over the LAPD's Public Disorder Intelligence Division and won. The division was disbanded and the plaintiffs were awarded $1.8 million. </P>
<P> He was later paid $1.2 million by the city of Pasadena over a 1986 confrontation with police that left him blind in one eye. </P>
<P> After Wednesday's award Zinzun told reporters, ``Hopefully this will send a message to the city. Until we have police accountability, the city will be paying out large sums.'' </P>
