<P>  Japan secretly studied developing nuclear weapons in the late 1960s but ruled out making atomic bombs for political and diplomatic reasons, a major newspaper reported Sunday. </P>
<P> The Asahi Shimbun said the government of Prime Minister Eisaku Sato commissioned a panel of academic experts to study Japan's nuclear weapons options over a period of two and a half years from 1967. </P>
<P> The paper said it obtained copies of the two reports produced by the panel between 1968 and 1970. </P>
<P> The reports concluded that Japan could in a short time acquire the technical capacity to develop a small number of plutonium-based bombs, but that doing so would isolate Japan diplomatically, strain state coffers and draw intense political opposition at home, the paper said. </P>
<P> The reports also questioned the nuclear deterrent value of Tokyo's possessing a few nuclear weapons in the face of large atomic arsenals held by the Soviet Union and China. </P>
<P> ``This report explained to foreign observers and to those in Japan who argued in favor of nuclear armament why Japan could not build nuclear weapons,'' the Asahi quoted one of the panelists, a former official at the International Atomic Energy Agency as saying. </P>
<P> Then Prime Minister Sato -- who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1974 for promoting Japan's non-nuclear policies -- was aware of the contents of the secret report, the Asahi said. </P>
<P> Japan's three non-nuclear principles of not allowing, manufacturing or possessing nuclear weapons were set forth by Sato in 1967 and elevated to a national principle by a Diet declaration in 1971. </P>
<P> Sato was caught between conservative politicians and bureaucrats who wanted Japan to obtain an indepedent nuclear force like that of France, and the strong anti-nuclear sentiment in Japan, the only country to suffer an atomic bomb attack, the paper said. </P>
<P> One calculation that swayed Sato was the worry that by going nuclear, Tokyo would alarm Washington and thwart Japan's hopes of winning the return of Okinawa, then governed by the U.S., the paper said. </P>
<P> In an accompanying feature on Japan's nuclear potential, the liberal Asahi warns that the country's ambitious plutonium recycling program and successful space program make it harder to dispel doubts about its nuclear intentions today. </P>
