<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Bombing suspect Timothy McVeigh inspected the Oklahoma City federal building only days before it was devastasted in a bomb blast, a former Army buddy has told federal investigators, the New York Times reported in Saturday's editions. </P>
<P> Quoting unidentified law enforcement officials, the newspaper said Michael Fortier, a friend of McVeigh's from Fort Riley, Kan., was ready to cooperate with authorities. </P>
<P> The Times quoted law enforcement officials as saying Fortier told them McVeigh discussed plans for the bombing months earlier when the two were in Kingman, Ariz. </P>
<P> Fortier told officials that he drove with McVeigh to Oklahoma City about a week before the blast, which killed 166 people. </P>
<P> Fortier has denied any direct involvement in the bombing, the worst civilian terror attack in U.S. history. </P>
<P> McVeigh and another Army buddy, Terry Nichols, are the only suspects charged so far in the bombing. McVeigh and Fortier lived in the same barracks for three years. </P>
<P> The Times also reported that the Alfred P. Murrah federal building was a target of a right-wing plot as early as 1983. </P>
<P> Quoting federal law enforcement sources, the paper reported that white supremicist Richard Wayne Snell was a member of a group that planned to park a van or trailer loaded with explosives in front of the building and detonate it. </P>
<P> Snell was executed in Arkansas April 19, the same day the fuel oil and fertilizer bomb exploded in front of the building. He had been convicted of murdering a black state trooper and a Jewish pawnbroker in separate incidents not linked to the bomb plot. </P>
<P> McVeigh has never mentioned Snell and there is no apparent connection between the 1983 plot and last month's bombing, authorities told the Times. </P>
<P> Snell watched television reports of the bombing before he was executed and said before he died, ``Hell has victories. I am at peace.'' </P>
