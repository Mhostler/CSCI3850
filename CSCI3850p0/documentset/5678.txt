<DATELINE>DHAKA, April 12 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Bangladeshis, evidently fed up at a spate of opposition-sponsored strikes on Wednesday, ended the latest protest over demands for early elections and work issues hours before it was due to end. </P>
<P> Commuters and vehicle operators said they ran out of patience at the planned four-day stoppage due to end late on Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``Politicians never seem to realise that a day of no-work means no meals for many,'' mini-taxi driver Shahidul Islam told Reuters. He said he lost at least 300 taka ($7.5) a day during strikes. </P>
<P> In Dhaka, the stock exchange, banks and most businesses were open on Wednesday in defiance of the strike, witnesses said. </P>
<P> The movement of trains and ferries from Dhaka was normal on Wednesday, although a few trains were stopped by protesting factory workers near Chittagong, transport officials said. </P>
<P> They said buses and trucks started operating by early afternoon, at least five hours before the last day of strike was to end. </P>
<P> But the country's two ports at Chittagong and Mongla remained mostly idle. </P>
<P> Chittagong port officials said on Wednesday nearly 300,000 tonnes of cargo piled up during the strike, which kept thousands of trucks off the roads. </P>
<P> ``We are having a cargo jam ... which will need days to clear,'' one told Reuters. </P>
<P> The strike, the latest of a long series, was aimed at forcing Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia to step down and allow early elections and to press for higher workers' salaries and job security. </P>
<P> Khaleda remained firm as ever and showed no concern at all over what the opposition called a non-stop action to shake the stability of her government. </P>
<P> Khaleda, the country's first woman prime minister, was elected in 1991 in what were billed as Bangladesh's first free elections. The next elections are not due until next year. </P>
<P> The opposition says it cannot trust her to hold fair elections and insists a neutral caretaker government be installed to supervise them. </P>
<P> They have staged around 50 similar strikes since Khaleda took office. </P>
<P> The country's emerging business community has opposed the frequent strikes and has asked opposition leaders to find an alternative way of pressing their point. </P>
