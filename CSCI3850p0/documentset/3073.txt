<DATELINE>OSLO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The three guardians of the fragile peace pact between Israelis and Palestinians arrive Friday to share the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize amid unprecedented Norwegian security. </P>
<P> Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and PLO leader Yasser Arafat will receive the Nobel gold medals in a City Hall ceremony Saturday for their roles in the historic 1993 accord on Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho. </P>
<P> The laureates will be protected during their three-day stay by Norway's biggest ever police operation involving a Nobel Prize event. </P>
<P> About 800 police officers will be on hand, flights will be restricted over Oslo and concrete road blocks set up at strategic places in the normally placid Norwegian capital. </P>
<P> Both ultra-nationalist Israelis and Islamic militants oppose the choice of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. Many Jews are angry that Arafat, the former guerrilla leader, is a co-winner. </P>
<P> Rabbi Avi Weiss, leader of the New York-based Coalition for Jewish Concerns, said he planned to conduct a mock funeral outside Oslo City Hall later Thursday to symbolize Americans and Israelis ``who have died as a result of PLO terrorism.'' </P>
<P> ``Outside of Adolf Hitler there is no person who has murdered more Jewish people in this century than Yasser Arafat,'' Weiss told Reuters after his arrival in Oslo. </P>
<P> ``This is not a political issue, but a deeply ethical issue,'' he said. ``This sends a message you can murder Jewish citizens and American citizens and get the peace prize.'' </P>
<P> Weiss's group and other Jewish groups planned further peaceful protests over the weekend. </P>
<P> Oslo police said foreigners suspected of planning illegal acts linked to the awards ceremony would be turned back at the border, but that peaceful rallies would be permitted. </P>
<P> ``We now have three prize winners who are favorite targets in the eyes of some groups,'' Inspector Oeystein Berger, in charge of security, said. ``Not everyone agrees with the peace process in the Middle East.'' </P>
<P> The day before their scheduled arrival in Oslo, the Israeli and Palestinian leaders were grappling with the latest crisis in the peace process -- expanding Palestinian self-rule. </P>
