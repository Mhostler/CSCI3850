<P>  Investigators are becoming convinced that the Oklahoma City bombing grew out of a conspiracy lasting more than six months and that Timothy McVeigh was a ``driving force'' behind it, the Los Angeles Times reported Thursday. </P>
<P> The paper, citing unnamed sources, said investigators believe the blast was financed by a series of robberies. They also believe it was motivated by hatred of the U.S. government and that the 1993 assault on the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Texas, served as the flashpoint, the paper said. </P>
<P> Investigators, it said, are casting new nets for John Doe No. 2, described as a tanned, muscular man believed to have been McVeigh's accomplice. McVeigh, 27, is the only person so far charged in the bombing. </P>
<P> The Times quoted one official as saying, ``There's nobody high on the list'' in the search for John Doe No. 2. </P>
<P> Investigators were ``hammering hard on the phone records of McVeigh and Terry Nichols, identifying each and every phone call they made to individuals and businesses'' over a period of months, the paper quoted a source as saying. Nichols, an aquaintance of McVeigh, is being held as a material witness in the case. </P>
<P> Another source close to the case told the Times, ``It's becoming more viable'' that McVeigh was at least a ``driving force'' in the bombing. ``He had the capacity and the anger,'' the source said, adding that investigators were discounting suggestions that McVeigh was only a follower or had been duped into his alleged actions by a larger group of conspirators. </P>
<P> Focusing on evidence that McVeigh had no known source of income for much of the period before the bombing, the paper said, investigators are trying to determine whether he and others were involved in robberies to finance the attack. </P>
