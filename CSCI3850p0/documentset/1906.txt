<P>  Although Iraq set a Monday deadline for action by the Security Council on easing Persian Gulf War sanctions, the council was not even holding private consultations on the issue. </P>
<P> The council's next 60-day review of sanctions imposed on Iraq after its August 1990 invasion of Kuwait is not due until mid-November. </P>
<P> No change in the sanctions, which bar Iraqi oil sales, has occurred since they were first imposed more than four years ago and none is expected even next month. </P>
<P> The Iraqi Oct. 10 deadline is related to a periodic report by ambassador Rolf Ekeus, head of the U.N. special commission in charge of scrapping Baghdad's weapons of mass destruction, who is expected to say that arrangements for long-term monitoring of Iraq's weapons potential is now up and running. </P>
<P> Baghdad had been expecting that Ekeus' written report would reach the council Monday. Iraq hoped that the council might then set a definite trial period -- perhaps six months -- for the monitoring system, after which it could consider an easing of the sanctions. </P>
<P> But the United States and Britain oppose any specific trial-period, preferring an open-ended test of Iraqi compliance. </P>
<P> Recent Iraqi troop movements toward Kuwait, and Baghdad's continued refusal to recognize the emirate's independence, were expected to undercut even those council members, such as Russia, France and China, inclined to set a firm deadline and move towards lifting sanctions. </P>
<P> And Ekeus's report was not expected to reach Security Council members before Tuesday, council members said. </P>
<P> Closed-door consultations on the document, accompanied by a briefing by Ekeus, might not take place before Thursday, one source added. </P>
<P> Even then, it was possible the council would not take any specific action other than to take note of the report. </P>
