<P>  Black women in the United States are more than three times as likely to die during pregnancy as white women, the federal government said Thursday. </P>
<P> A report issued by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) blamed the gap in part on limited access to health care for blacks, saying that nearly 40 percent of black mothers still were not getting early prenatal care as recently as 1990. </P>
<P> The latest applicable death statistics, from the years 1989-91, show white women suffering a mortality rate of 5.7 deaths for every 100,000 live births. </P>
<P> CDC officials said preliminary data for 1992 put white mortality at 5.0 deaths per 100,000 births and the black death rate at 20.8. </P>
<P> The study, which measured maternal survival rates over the course of half a century, showed a 98 percent decline in death rates for all American women since 1940, when 363.9 women died for every 100,000 children born. </P>
<P> The racial disparity in death rates for pregnant women, measured decade by decade, peaked in 1960 when mortality for blacks was 4.1 times that for whites. The gap then slipped to a factor of 3.9 in 1970, 3.4 in 1980 and 3.3 in 1990. </P>
<P> ``Although the reasons for this disparity are unclear, possible explanations include differences in pregnancy-related incidence of disease, access to and use of health care services and the content and quality of care,'' the CDC report said. </P>
<P> The preliminary data for 1992 alone is not statistically significant because of changes in measuring how the mortality rates are counted. </P>
<P> During the 1980s, more than three-quarters of all mothers received early prenatal care. But by the end of the decade, 39.4 percent of black mothers still were not getting care, vs. 20.8 percent of whites. </P>
<P> Even when women of both races entered prenatal care, the study said, differences remained between blacks and whites in terms of the advice they received from health-care providers and the technology used to monitor their pregnancies. </P>
