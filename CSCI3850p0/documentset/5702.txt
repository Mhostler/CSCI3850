<DATELINE>BEIJING, April 13 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  China said on Thursday it would not hold a state funeral for late elder statesman Chen Yun in accordance with the wishes of the country's most influential man after paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. </P>
<P> Chen died on Monday in Beijing at the age of 90. </P>
<P> Regulations do not require a memorial ceremony for the leader who helped to guide China's economy for four decades after the 1949 communist takeover but who retired from his last office and an active political role in 1992. </P>
<P> ``There will be no farewell ceremony and state funeral in accordance with his personal will and relevant regulations,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Chen Jian told reporters. </P>
<P> He did not say whether Chen Yun's body would be cremated, as has been standard for Chinese leaders with the notable exception of Chairman Mao Tse-tung, who lies in state in a vast mausoleum in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. </P>
<P> The spokesman said it was not unusual that the national flag, five gold stars on a red background, had not so far been lowered to half-staff in the mammoth central square in mourning for Chen Yun. </P>
<P> Beijing would announce later when the flag would be lowered, he said. </P>
<P> A self-trained economist and central planner, Chen was at once one of Deng's closest colleagues and chief rivals. </P>
<P> China is reported to have altered rules and protocol for state funerals after a grand April 1989 funeral in the Great Hall of the People for former Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang became a rallying point for student pro-democracy protesters. </P>
<P> The protests centred on Tiananmen Square were crushed by the army with heavy loss of life in June 1989, bringing to an end a lengthy student occupation of the square that severely embarrassed China's communist leaders. </P>
