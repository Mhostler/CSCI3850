<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Iran fired four missiles including a Russian-made Scud at a camp of the exiled Mujahideen Khalq organization in Iraq, damaging two buildings but causing no casualties, a Mujahideen spokesman said Sunday. </P>
<P> Foreign reporters taken to the site by the Mujahideen said they saw two craters inside the camp and debris from a dining hall and prayer area. </P>
<P> ``There were two craters, broken glass, fallen ceilings and shrapnel and small pieces of missile in the camp,'' Reuters Television correspondent Ahmad Bahaddou said. </P>
<P> Ashraf camp, the group's largest in Iraq, is 50 miles from the Iranian border and 75 miles northeast of Baghdad. </P>
<P> Mujahideen spokesman Fareed Suleimani said one of the missiles was a Russian-made Scud with a 2,200 pound warhead and 100-140 mile range. </P>
<P> He said no one was injured and only two of the four missiles hit the camp. Experts were examining debris from the missiles to try to determine their source, he said. </P>
<P> The official Iranian news agency IRNA said earlier Sunday that Iran had attacked a Mujahideen base in Iraq after guerrillas tried to cross into Iran to hit oil installations. </P>
<P> ``Early reports from inside Iraq indicated that the MKO (Mujahideen Khalq) operational base sustained heavy damage and a number of MKO terrorists were killed in the attack,'' it said. </P>
<P> IRNA gave the location of the base as 20 miles from Baghdad in the Abu Ghoraib area. </P>
<P> It said the attack was part of a pursuit operation by border guards who earlier Sunday killed two Mujahideen guerrillas and arrested three as they tried to cross to Iran to bomb oil installations in the Mousian region. </P>
<P> ``Simultaneously with the chase operation of the Iranian border guards at least four strong explosions were heard from inside the MKO terrorist base called Ashraf,'' IRNA said without elaborating. </P>
<P> Suleimani denied that his group had sent any guerrillas to attack targets inside Iran ``in the past few months.'' He also denied Iran's report of attacks on Mujahideen bases in Iraq apart from Ashraf. </P>
<P> In a statement faxed from the Mujahideen's Paris office to Reuters in London, the group blamed what it called a biased U.S. State Department report for acting as ``a green light'' to Iran. </P>
<P> In a scathing report on the resistance group made public in Washington last Monday, the State Department said the Mujahideen was not a viable alternative to the Tehran government. </P>
<P> In the unclassified portion of the document, it said it had consulted a large cross-section of Iranian opposition groups and expatriates, including Mujahideen sympathizers. </P>
<P> Reporting its conclusions, it said: ``Shunned by most Iranians and fundamentally undemocratic, the Mujahideen Khalq are not a viable alternative to the current government of Iran.'' </P>
<P> Shahin Gobadi, spokesman for the group in Washington, lashed out at the State Department and termed the report ``a bunch of bold-faced lies that shows they have not studied historical factors about this organization.'' </P>
<P> Last month the group said Iran's Revolutionary Guards raided the Ashraf camp with mortars but inflicted no casualties. </P>
<P> The Mujahideen have their headquarters in Baghdad and several bases inside the country, some close to the Iranian border. </P>
<P> Efforts to mend relations between Iraq and Iran following their 1980-1988 war have all but failed. </P>
<P> Iran has made better ties conditional on Baghdad's curbing of Mujahideen activities inside Iraq. </P>
