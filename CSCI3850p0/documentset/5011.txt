<P>  A girl napalm victim whose agony was captured in one of the best known images of the Vietnam War is now living in Canada, Britain's Mail on Sunday newspaper reported. </P>
<P> The paper said it had traced Phan Thi Kim Phuc, now 32, to a working-class area of Toronto where she lives with her husband and 11-month-old son. </P>
<P> Kim was 9 when she was photographed in 1972 running naked and screaming with pain along a road near Saigon during a South Vietnamese napalm bombing raid. </P>
<P> The Mail on Sunday said she sought asylum at Canada's Gander airport in 1992 with her husband after arriving on a flight from Cuba, where she had been studying. </P>
<P> The newspaper quoted her as telling Canadian authorities she was tired of being used as a propaganda symbol by the Vietnamese authorities. </P>
<P> ``I want to hide myself from the world for now. It is wonderful to be in Canada, but I have suffered so much that I have to think very carefully about what I say,'' the Mail on Sunday quoted her as saying. </P>
<P> The Mail said it had also tracked down Kim's elderly parents and brother, still living in the village of Trang Bang where the 1972 napalm attack happened. </P>
