<P>  A 51-year-old migrant farm worker once suspected of committing as many as 15 murders in several states was sentenced to life in prison Friday for the death of an Indiana teen-ager. </P>
<P> Circuit Judge W.W. Haralson sentenced Frank Potts to a second life term for the 1989 slaying of Robert Earl Jines, 19, whose body was found on the convicted man's farm in northeast Alabama, court officials said. </P>
<P> He already is serving one life sentence for sexually assaulting an 11-year-old girl in Florida. </P>
<P> Potts, who plans to appeal, read a statement before sentencing Friday in which he maintained his innocence. </P>
<P> He was convicted a week ago after a week-long trial in which prosecution witness Harvey Taylor described helping Potts bury Jines in a steep, rocky area on Potts' 40-acre retreat a few miles north of Scottsboro in 1989. </P>
<P> Prosecutors said Potts killed Jines with several blows to the head because he was interested in Jines' girlfriend, who testified during the trial that Potts had repeatedly made advances toward her. </P>
<P> Taylor, a logger, led authorities to Jines' remains in March 1994, triggering an extensive but unsuccessful four-month search for other bodies on Potts' property in the northeastern corner of Alabama. </P>
<P> Authorities say they still believe other bodies are buried on the land, but they have not scheduled any more searches. </P>
