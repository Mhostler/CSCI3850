<P>  Police Tuesday were engaged in a massive manhunt to track down five convicted murderers who fled a southeastern Florida prison by tunneling underneath the complex's barbed wire. </P>
<P> Six inmates fled through a 25-foot tunnel at about 6:15 p.m. EST Monday, according to John Townsend, assistant superintendent at the high-security Glades Correctional Institute. He said one inmate was captured immediately but five remained at large Tuesday morning. </P>
<P> Prison authorities said the convicts made their escape by digging the tunnel from the prison chapel, apparently by working during leisure-time visits over the past three weeks. </P>
<P> He said hundreds of officers, many with search dogs, were combing 30 square miles of marshy farmland surrounding the prison, backed up by additional officials in helicopters. </P>
<P> Belle Glade is located southeast of Lake Okeechobee and west of Palm Beach. </P>
<P> ``We believe that the inmates are hiding out either in the cane fields or in the ditches and not making any movement right now,'' Townsend said. ``There is so much activity in the area that it would be hard for them to move 100 yards without being detected.'' </P>
<P> But Townsend said officers also had been sent to the Miami area -- where all five were from -- and bulletins about the escapees had been issued throughout the state. </P>
<P> All of the convicts were near the beginning of their life sentences, a mandatory 25 years in prison. </P>
