<P>  Thailand has turned down a U.S. request to pre-position military equipment in Asia but other sites are being considered, Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord said Thursday. </P>
<P> He told reporters the proposal involved ``civilian ships offshore with pre-positioned equipment that would help not only in regional contingencies but also in the Middle East and around the world, and it would also help in areas like disaster relief of an ... absolutely peaceful nature.'' </P>
<P> ``We are disappointed, but we have a terrific security relationship with Thailand generally and we just didn't have a meeting of minds in this particular one,'' he added. </P>
<P> Lord briefed reporters ahead of a trip to South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand by Secretary of State Warren Christopher that begins Monday. </P>
<P> For part of his two-week trip, Christopher will hook up in the Philippines and Indonesia with President Clinton, who will attend the annual Asia Pacific Economic forum summit in Bogor, Indonesia on Nov 14-15. </P>
<P> Lord said the United States saw a great value in pre-positioning in the case of the latest crisis with Iraq. </P>
<P> Because the previous administration pre-positioned significant materiel in the region after the 1991 Gulf War, when Iraq again began to threaten Kuwait in September ``we got significant numbers of forces and equipment in there within a matter of days rather than weeks during the Bush administration,'' he said. </P>
<P> Lord acknowledged that unlike Iraq, there is no similar threat to Asian security. The region has ``a more stable relationship among powers than we'd seen in most of this century,'' he said. </P>
<P> But he stressed that ``the best way to deter threats ... or not to have them, is to be ready for them and hope you don't have use this kind of equipment.'' </P>
<P> Lord said the United States has ``other options. We're at those now'' although he refused to be specific. </P>
<P> The U.S. view is that this is an opportune time to hold such security discussions. </P>
<P> ``This is a no-threat, no-enemy arrangement where you have potential antagonists, given historical tensions, talking to each other directly about their intentions -- whether it's military budgets or territorial claims -- to try to build confidence, reduce tensions and make sure that the region stays as relatively stable as it is right now,'' Lord said. </P>
