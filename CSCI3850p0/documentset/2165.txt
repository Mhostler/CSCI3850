<P>  Ukraine won aid pledges from the United States and Canada at a secret IMF meeting this week, but other nations held off from making specific promises of support, international monetary sources said on Friday. </P>
<P> The sources, who declined to be identified, said the United States looks likely to stump up about $70 million to $100 million and Canada around $10 to $20 million to help Ukraine transform its economy from communism to capitalism. </P>
<P> ``It was too early for other countries to make a final commitment,'' one source said. </P>
<P> Canada will be hosting an international economic conference in Winnipeg on October 27 to try to drum up additional support for the former Soviet republic. </P>
<P> The sources said the International Monetary Fund's board could give final approval to a $350 million loan for Ukraine next week, once Kiev takes some preliminary steps to stabilize its shaky economy. </P>
<P> Ukraine's conservative parliament on Wednesday backed President Leonid Kuchma's plan to introduce radical economic reforms in one of Europe's weakest economies. </P>
<P> Kuchma, who will attend next week's meeting in Winnipeg, did not require parliament's formal approval for the plan, which calls for privatization, lifting of price controls and liberalizing foreign trade. </P>
<P> But the parliamentary support gives him moral authority to proceed. </P>
<P> Monetary sources said the European Union appeared to be close to deciding on a specific aid package for Ukraine, but it was not clear how big it would be. </P>
