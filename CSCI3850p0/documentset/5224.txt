<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A high-level Vatican delegation was leaving for Vietnam Monday to discuss church-state relations, including the restoration of church property, in the communist-ruled country. </P>
<P> A Vatican statement said the delegation was headed by Msgr. Cludio Celli, who holds a post eqivalent to deputy foreign minister of the Holy See. </P>
<P> Celli, an expert on Vietnam, would hold talks with government officials and meet bishops. </P>
<P> Vietnam, where Roman Catholics are a small minority, is one of the few countries with no diplomatic relations with the Vatican. Catholicism was brought to Vietnam by French colonists and was later associated with the U.S.-backed South Vietnamese government. </P>
<P> Hanoi put many priests in re-education camps after the Vietnam war ended in 1975 but has since eased restrictions on the six million Catholics in the mostly Buddhist population of 72 million. </P>
<P> The Communist Party oversees church activities and insists on reviewing candidates for appointment as bishops, a procedure to which the Vatican reluctantly agreed last year. </P>
<P> Celli, who visited Vietnam last year, is expected to discuss negotiations to restore confiscated church property. </P>
<P> To show his solidarity with the church in Vietnam, Pope John Paul last year named the archbishop of Hanoi, Paul Pham Dinh Tung, a cardinal. The communist authorities had barred him from visiting his parishes for many years. </P>
