<P>  A U.N. spokesman said Friday a cease-fire between Bosnian Serbs and Muslims, due to have started at noon (6 a.m. EST)), might be delayed because talks on a formal agreement were continuing. </P>
<P> ``Since the talks are ongoing, we might have to postpone the cease-fire for 12 or 24 hours,'' Alexander Ivanko told reporters in Sarajevo. </P>
<P> Ivanko stressed that progress was being made in the negotiations by U.N. envoy Yasushi Akashi, who met leaders of both sides Friday morning. </P>
<P> The delay was caused by Serb requests to change the wording on paragraphs dealing with a prisoner exchange and the status of a Big Power peace plan for Bosnia. </P>
<P> The cease-fire was negotiated this week by former U.S. president Jimmy Carter. </P>
