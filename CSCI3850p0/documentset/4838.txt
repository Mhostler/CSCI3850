<P>  An avalanche early Friday killed a father and son and seriously injured a woman when it destroyed their house at the base of a mountain in Blanc-Sablon, an isolated community on Quebec's north shore. </P>
<P> Authorities evacuated 38 people from 15 nearby homes Friday as rescuers searched the crumpled house for survivors. The avalanche occurred a few hours after midnight, but the occupants were not found until mid-morning. </P>
<P> ``The visibility is nil. Rescuers are linking themselves together with ropes to avoid getting lost in the blowing snow,'' said Francois Dore, of the provincial police force. </P>
<P> ``Winds have been blowing at 120 kilometers an hour (73 mph) and more since last night. We are having difficulty reaching our own people up there,'' Dore said. </P>
<P> The family's name was not released, but police said the man was 36-years-old and his son was 16. The woman, who police said was the 32-year-old wife and mother, was taken to a nearby home. </P>
<P> The house is located about four miles east of Blanc-Sablon, a village on Quebec's north shore just opposite the northwestern tip of Newfoundland. </P>
<P> Police and civil security personnel were heading the evacuation, but little else is moving in the community. Those people evacuated were taken to a local school. </P>
