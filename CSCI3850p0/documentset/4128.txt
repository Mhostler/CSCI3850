<P>  Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, stung by a controversy over minimum wages, said Friday he and his cabinet would take a 25 percent pay cut until the basic salary went up. </P>
<P> Cardoso, a Social Democrat who took office Jan. 1, has seen his popularity drop because he promised to veto a raise in Brazil's minimum wage while his salary almost doubled. </P>
<P> In his first national address, Cardoso defended a package of constitutional reforms he will send to Congress Feb. 16 designed to open up an economy among the world's 10 largest. </P>
<P> He vowed to work with lawmakers to create a stable economy with more jobs, continued low inflation and higher minimum wages. </P>
<P> The minimum wage is now 70 reals a month, the lowest in Latin America, and Congress last month passed a law raising it to 100 reals. </P>
<P> Cardoso, elected by a landslide because of a successful anti-inflation plan he designed as finance minister, opposes the rise because social security payments are linked to the minimum wage. </P>
<P> He estimated that, if he approved the raise, the social security budget would have a five billion real deficit this year. The real is trading at about $1.15. </P>
<P> ``As long as it is not possible to pay at least 100 reals, ministers will give up a recently created job bonus, which is equivalent to nearly 25 percent of their salaries, and the president and vice president will do the same,'' he said. </P>
<P> Congress last month approved raises almost doubling pay for Cardoso, who gets 8,500 reals a month, and for his cabinet and lawmakers. </P>
<P> The president called on Congress to reduce its salaries and said he could not have vetoed the raises once they were approved by the legislature. </P>
