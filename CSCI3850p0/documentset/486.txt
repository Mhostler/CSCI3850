<P>  Robert Kennedy Jr, son of the slain U.S. senator, will meet Canadian native Indian chiefs next week to discuss protection of a controversial Pacific coast rain forest. </P>
<P> Kennedy, a lawyer with the Washington D.C.-based Natural Resources Defense Council, has helped lead an international effort to save the forest at the Clayquot Sound of Vancouver Island on Canada's west coast. </P>
<P> He will meet August 4 to 7 with leaders of the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council in Tofino town, about 100 miles west of Vancouver, a spokeswoman for the Indian group said Friday. </P>
<P> A visit by Kennedy to the area a year ago drew attention to a summer-long protest campaign in which more than 800 people were arrested for blockading logging trucks into the forest. </P>
<P> Environmentalists say Clayoquot Sound, one of the world's biggest and last intact temperate-zone rain forests, is doomed because of a provincial government decision in 1993 to open most of it to logging. </P>
<P> Native Indians objected because they were not involved in the decision, which covers their traditional lands. </P>
<P> During his visit, Kennedy will be briefed by the chiefs on an agreement signed with the government in March that gives Indians a role in managing the area and veto rights over land-use plans. </P>
