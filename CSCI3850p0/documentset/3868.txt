<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Former Argentine dictator Juan Carlos Ongana, who overthrew elected President Arturo Illia in a 1966 military coup, said Friday he is considering running for president in May 14 elections. </P>
<P> But the 80-year old Ongana will only run if ``a consensus, a front'' of political groups called upon him, he said in a statement issued to the state-owned Telm news agency. </P>
<P> A representative of the Blue and White Movement, a splinter faction of the small far-right National Dignity Movement (Modin), told the Clarn newspaper Friday morning that Ongana would be its candidate. </P>
<P> Ongana governed Argentina until 1970, when he was himself overthrown in a palace coup. </P>
<P> The last known verbal declaration of Ongana, who almost never speaks to the press, was that he believes Argentines ''have good memories of my government,'' according to Clarn. </P>
<P> Responding in writing to a magazine questionnaire recently, Ongana said Argentina is ``subordinated to the domination of international capitalisms.'' </P>
<P> The Blue and White Movement split with Modin, founded by Aldo Rico, one of the leaders of a series of barracks uprisings against democratic governments in the 1980s, after Rico gave support to a government candidate to be governor of Buenos Aires province last year. </P>
<P> In the last survey by pollsters Mora y Araujo in December, 1 percent of voters said they would vote for Modin. The Blue and White Movement was not included in the poll. </P>
