<DATELINE>ZAGREB, Croatia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Hundreds of angry Bosnian Muslim refugees rioted after the United Nations tried to persuade them to return to their homes, blockading U.N. workers and setting fire to their vehicles, U.N. officials said Sunday. </P>
<P> Although tensions eased after the incident, the irate refugees were still preventing a U.N. driver from leaving the safety of a U.N. peacekeeping battalion observation post. </P>
<P> The unrest flared Saturday evening in a U.N. monitored no-man's land dividing rebel Serbs from Croatian government forces where 10,000 Muslim refugees from the Bihac region of Bosnia gathered six weeks ago. </P>
<P> Eight U.N. workers were forced to seek shelter with Polish U.N. troops, who at one point on Saturday fired warning shots in the air. Seven of the aid workers have now been allowed to travel out of the refugee-swamped demilitarized zone. </P>
<P> The refugees had fled the collapse of a Muslim separatist rebellion led by local business tycoon Fikret Abdic against the Bosnian government in Sarajevo. </P>
<P> Conditions in the zone, near the town of Karlovac, southwest of Zagreb, are far from ideal and several refugees have been killed after straying into nearby minefields. </P>
<P> United Nations relief workers began to distribute leaflets explaining that the refugees were unlikely to be allowed into Croatia or to a third country and that the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees could help them return home in safety.  U.N. officials said the trouble may have arisen because the refugees are still under the sway of Abdic loyalists and his defeated army who are hostile to any return of refugees to areas controlled by their enemy, the Bosnian army Fifth Corp. </P>
<P> ``They are getting extremely politically charged information from Abdic radio on the threat from the Bosnian army Fifth Corps,'' a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said. </P>
<P> The refugees believed the remaining trapped driver was connected to the Bosnian Fifth Corps and the U.N. was rushing documentation to the area to disprove this, officials said. </P>
<P> Some 25,000 refugees fled the end of the Abdic revolt. Some 10,000 are marooned in the no man's land where Saturday's disturbance occurred and the rest are camped at a chicken farm in the breakaway Serb-held Krajina region of Croatia. </P>
<P> The Bosnian government, backed by the U.N., has repeatedly urged the refugees to return to Bihac, giving them assurances of safety, but few have heeded the call because of claims by Abdic that they would be persecuted. </P>
