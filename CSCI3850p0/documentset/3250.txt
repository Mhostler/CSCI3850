<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Talks aimed at bringing National Hockey League owners and their locked-out players back to the negotiating table broke off Thursday with the season precariously close to a cancellation. </P>
<P> Lawyers from both sides were trying to set ground rules and aim at specific problems in the dispute but their meeting broke up without reaching common ground, according to Arthur Pincus, NHL vice president of communications. </P>
<P> Most observers believe the deadline to reach an agreement that would provide sufficient time to play that abbreviated schedule is less than two weeks away. </P>
<P> Asked if there was a meeting set for Friday, Pincus said: ''I don't believe so.'' </P>
<P> Bettman and Players' Association chief Bob Goodenow have only spoken once since full negotiations broke off Dec. 6. </P>
<P> The key stumbling block to an agreement appears to be a payroll tax plan put forward by the owners. Players have been against the tax, claiming it is in effect a salary cap. </P>
<P> The season was originally scheduled to begin Oct. 1. The start was delayed at first by Bettman until Oct. 15 in hopes both sides could make ``substantial progress'' towards reaching a collective bargaining agreement. </P>
<P> The NHL lockout, which has now reached 77 days, has already resulted in the cancellation of 24 games for each team. </P>
