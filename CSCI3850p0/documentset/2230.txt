<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A Taiwan karaoke parlor where a fire killed 13 people late Tuesday had been fined 10 times since 1993 and ordered to close down for violating safety rules, a Taipei city government report said Wednesday. </P>
<P> More than 100 people have died in recent years in fires at Taiwanese entertainment spots, many of which were unlicensed and operated without strict safety inspections. </P>
<P> ``That's the trouble with Taiwan these days -- life seems to be cheap,'' said Lin Chong-mou, secretary-general of the Association for the Prevention of Public Disasters. </P>
<P> Lin, surveying the charred remains of a fiberglass shell used to cover the building's facade to make it resemble a rock wall, said the city government knew the parlor was dangerous. </P>
<P> Jaw Shau-kong, an opposition candidate in the Dec. 3 mayoral elections in Taipei, demanded that Huang Ta-chou, the incumbent mayor and a member of the ruling Nationalist Party, resign to take responsibility. </P>
<P> The fire department inspected the building 17 times between February 1993 and September 1994 and repeatedly fined the owner for running a karaoke parlor in a residential area, officials quoted by the state-funded Central News Agency said. </P>
<P> The inspectors also singled out inflammable interior decorations and windows sealed with illegally erected signs as fire hazards. </P>
<P> Eight men and five women 18-40 years old died in the blaze, which ripped through the top four floors of the five-story building in central Taipei. One other person remained in serious condition in a hospital. </P>
<P> Witnesses and officials at the scene said a short-circuit in a sign outside the building probably caused Tuesday's fire. </P>
