<P>  Police torturers in some countries have developed very effective ways of hiding the damage their victims may suffer, sometimes causing permanent injury without leaving visible scars, a British doctor said Thursday. </P>
<P> Dr Duncan Forrest of the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture in London said some police in India were especially good at hiding their work. </P>
<P> He said he had examined 31 Indian Sikh men who claimed they had been tortured. Although they had no obvious scars, he found considerable physical and mental damage. </P>
<P> ``All claimed to have been beaten by police with an assortment of weapons, including fists, boots, lathis (long stout bamboo canes), leather belts with metal buckles, leather straps with wooden handles (patta) or rifle butts,'' Forrest wrote in the Lancet medical journal. </P>
<P> ``In addition, 18 reported being beaten while suspended off the ground by the wrists or ankles and 15 were given electric shocks either with a magneto (small generator) or from a mains socket.'' </P>
<P> Forrest, whose group examines and treats up to 3,000 torture victims a year, said police seemed aware of the need to prevent obvious, visible injury with people due to appear in court. </P>
<P> And he said it was unreasonable to demand asylum-seekers display scars to prove they had been tortured. </P>
<P> ``Although the police are cautious about causing visible scarring, they do not always avoid more insidious damage,'' he added, referring to a report from Kashmir about 10 cases of kidney failure due to beatings. </P>
<P> Forrest said the Indian torturers had developed unique ways of tormenting their victims. One method involved overstretching the hips by forcing a man onto the ground with his legs spread. </P>
<P> ``This torture was often done with the victim sitting on the floor with a policeman behind him pulling his head back by the hair while pressing a knee into his back. Twenty-two men reported this torture,'' Forrest wrote. </P>
<P> They also used a thick wooden roller called a ghotna to damage legs without bruising or scars, Forrest said. Such methods did cause permanent damage, although it was subtle. </P>
<P> ``The most common complaint was of pain on walking, principally in those who had had abduction of the hips and/or application of the roller.'' Other men had blurred vision, overstretched muscles and damaged joints. </P>
<P> ``Features of post-traumatic stress disorder included loss of concentration and memory, intrusive thoughts, flashbacks, panic attacks and, especially, recurrent nightmares reproducing events experienced during detention.'' </P>
<P> In the Middle East torturers beat victims on the soles of their feet -- another method calculated to leave no marks, Forrest added in a telephone interview. </P>
<P> But he said in Africa torturers seemed less worried about leaving scars. ``The presidential guard are the usual ones in Zaire -- there is a special belt they use to whip people which has a metal buckle.'' </P>
