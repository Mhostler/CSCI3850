<P>  A conservative group waging a boycott of Walt Disney Co. over the movie ``Priest'' said Tuesday it would run a full-page newspaper advertisement attacking talk show host Rush Limbaugh for not running the group's ads. </P>
<P> The ad by the anti-abortion American Life League depicts a bundle of cash and the caption ``Finally something big enough to shut Rush Limbaugh's mouth.'' The group said the ad would run in USA Today on Wednesday. </P>
<P> The head of the group, Judie Brown, said she was told because Limbaugh's television show airs on a Disney-owned station in Los Angeles, running the ad would present a conflict of interest. </P>
<P> Disney owns Miramax Films, which made ``Priest.'' </P>
<P> A spokesman for the ``Rush Limbaugh'' show declined to comment. </P>
<P> Brown said the Limbaugh show first had agreed verbally to broadcast 10 ads for $100,000 but later told the group its ads would not run. </P>
<P> The ads are the centerpiece of the group's media campaign against ``Priest,'' which they claim is anti-Catholic. The movie opens nationwide on Wednesday. </P>
<P> Last month the League and other groups started a boycott of Disney products. </P>
<P> Their ads, which denounce Disney's ties to Miramax and the movie, already run on religious networks.  Objections from the conservative Catholic League already persuaded Miramax to push back its nationwide opening date of ''Priest'' to April 19 from April 14, which was Good Friday. The movie has opened in New York and Los Angeles. </P>
