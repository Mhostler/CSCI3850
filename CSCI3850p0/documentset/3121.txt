<DATELINE>MONTERREY, Mexico, Dec 10 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Puerto Rican Felix Trinidad climbed off the canvas and went on to stop American Oba Carr in the eighth round and retain his International Boxing Federation welterweight title Saturday. </P>
<P> Down in the first round, Trinidad recovered to deliver his own knockdown punches. </P>
<P> ``That is sometimes a wake-up call and it made me fight harder,'' Trinidad said of the knockdown. </P>
<P> Trinidad floored Carr with an uppercut followed by a short right with about a minute left in the eighth round. Carr got up, but another right quickly put him down again. </P>
<P> The American challenger gamely rose once more, but he was defenseless and referee Robert Gonzalez of the United States stopped the beating at 2:41 of the eighth. </P>
<P> ``I was able to find my range and wear him down,'' said Trinidad, 25-0. </P>
<P> Carr, 32-1, had put Trinidad down in the first round with a straight right but from there on he absorbed the worst of the punishment. </P>
<P> Carr's white trunks were stained with blood from a bloody nose and a cut inside the mouth. He was also cut under the eyes at the end of the fight. </P>
<P> ``It just wasn't my night,'' he said. </P>
<P> The scheduled 12-round fight was one of five world title bouts in an outdoor ring at the Monterrey baseball stadium. </P>
