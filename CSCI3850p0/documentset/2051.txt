<P>  The second strong earthquake in as many weeks shook the disputed South Kurile islands in the Pacific on Sunday, Itar-Tass news agency said. </P>
<P> The quake caused no casualties or damage on the chain of islands -- the subject of a bitter territorial dispute between Russia and Japan since the end of World War Two. </P>
<P> On October 4 a powerful undersea earthquake measuring 8.1 on the Richter scale hit the South Kuriles, killing 10 people and injuring more than 1,500. </P>
<P> Russia seized the South Kuriles from Japan in the last days of the war. Tokyo puts the return of the islands, which it calls the Northern Territories, as a precondition to signing a formal peace treaty with Moscow. </P>
<P> Russia has refused to discuss the return of the islands. </P>
