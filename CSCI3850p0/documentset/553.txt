<P>  A Haitian woman who accused the country's military of trying to kill her politician husband has been accused of ``provocation'' by the police and told to present herself at the city's main police station. </P>
<P> In a communique sent to radio stations from the head of the city's police department, Mrs Marie-Helena Georges was accused of making accusations against the police in comments denouncing Monday's alleged attack. </P>
<P> ``These accusations represent a provocation ... (and we) invite her to present herself to the police,'' the statement said. </P>
<P> Lieutenant-Colonel Michel Francois, the man diplomats believe is behind much of Haiti's politically-related violence, is the ranking police officer in Haiti. </P>
<P> On hearing the summons, Mrs Georges told Reuters she would skip the invitation and go into hiding. ``I am worried,'' she said. </P>
<P> Georges called radio stations Tuesday morning giving details of the alleged attack, saying police and soldiers shot at her husband late Monday, hitting him in the back. He was alive and in hiding Tuesday. </P>
<P> Georges, a former senator and fierce opponent of ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, recently did an about-face and criticized Haiti's ruling military, calling on them to resign. </P>
