<P>  British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd welcomed Bosnia's decision not to press for immediate exemption from a U.N. arms embargo, but said Wednesday that might become unavoidable if the Bosnian Serbs refused to accept the latest peace plan. </P>
<P> In that case, the U.N. force would have to be withdrawn, he said in a speech to the General Assembly. </P>
<P> ``I welcome the decision of the Bosnian government to accept that now is not the moment to lift the arms embargo,'' Hurd said. </P>
<P> He was referring to a speech in the same U.N. body Tuesday by Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic agreeing to a resolution that would end the arms ban only after a six-month grace period. </P>
<P> Britain and other countries with troops in the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia strongly oppose any lifting of the embargo, either immediately or at a later date, fearing this would widen the conflict and result in their soldiers being targeted by the Bosnian Serbs. </P>
<P> Hurd said the decision of the Muslim-led Bosnian government allowed the U.N. force to continue its mission. </P>
<P></P>
<P> ``We have said before that if the Bosnian Serbs do not join the peace process and agree the map presented by the Contact Group, then our present approach may be exhausted, lifting the arms embargo may become unavoidable and UNPROFOR would have to withdraw.'' </P>
<P> But Hurd said this would be a policy of despair and that ``we must continue to show all the parties that the way forward is political agreement, not more military action.'' </P>
<P> Those who refused the peace plan and continued warfare must be isolated and put under sustained pressure, he said. </P>
<P> Hurd also proposed establishing a network of facilities to respond quickly to crises in Africa, where he said nearly 40 percent of all U.N. peacekeepers were now deployed. </P>
<P> ``By setting up a coherent structure of support systems running from early warning and preventive diplomacy right through to humanitarian and peacekeeping deployment on the ground, we can ensure that the skills and resources can be put into action as soon as the need arises,'' he said. </P>
<P> The foreign secretary said this should include an early warning system to pull together information about potential troublespots and U.N. assistance to help the Organization of African Unity and African countries to establish mechanisms for what he called ``preventive diplomacy'' in Africa. </P>
<P> ``I propose that, under U.N. auspices, a number of military staff colleges in Africa should become 'Peacekeeping Skills Centers,' giving training in doctrines and disciplines of peacekeeping, and in mediation and conflict resolution,'' he said. </P>
<P> Another element would be the setting up of U.N. logistics basing centers, such as already existed in Europe, to store easily accessible equipment, together with mobile logistics teams earmarked by member states. </P>
<P> Hurd said this would not require any enormous new machinery but would address the need for a framework for mobilizing existing resources, capability and know-how. </P>
<P> The British minister also took issue with references to the Falkland Islands in a speech to the General Assembly Tuesday by Argentine President Carlos Menem. </P>
<P> Hurd said Britain was quite clear about its sovereignty over the islands and other British South Atlantic dependencies, over which the two countries went to war in 1982. He also expressed concern over the recent incorporation into Argentina's constitution of new clauses, mentioned by Menem, which reaffirmed Argentina's claims. </P>
<P> ``In the Falkland Islands, as Northern Ireland, we must heed the wishes of the people concerned,'' Hurd said. </P>
