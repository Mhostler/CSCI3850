<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Lebanon said Saturday night that Israel was exerting mounting political, military and economic pressure to separate it from Syria in the Middle East peace process but the attempt would not succeed. </P>
<P> Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri, speaking hours after Israeli gunboats extended a naval blockade along Lebanon's coastline almost to within sight of the capital Beirut, accused Israel of ``terrorism.'' </P>
<P> Israel's sole aim in tightening the pressure in the past week was to force Beirut to stop coordinating with Damascus and to submit to Israel's will in the peace process, he said. </P>
<P> ``Israel wants just one thing, to subjugate Lebanon to its will in the (Middle East) settlement and that Lebanon should leave the sphere of liaison and coordination with Syria,'' Hariri said in a televised speech Saturday night. </P>
<P> Israel has given no explanation for the new blockade. </P>
<P> Lebanon closely coordinates its stance in the Arab-Israeli peace talks with Syria, which has 35,000 troops in Lebanon and is the country's main power broker. Both countries demand back all their territory occupied by Israel and neither has made progress in the negotiations in three years. </P>
<P> Hariri, a billionaire Sunni Muslim, said Lebanon would not budge ``one centimeter'' from its alliance with Syria. </P>
<P> ``The solidarity between the Lebanese and Syrian tracks will never be broken. It will remain the guarantee of our rights in liberating our lands and regaining our sovereignty,'' he said. </P>
<P> He called the Israeli pressure ``political, military and economic terrorism.'' </P>
<P> Israel frequently uses air raids and shells villages in fighting with Muslim guerrillas trying to oust it from south Lebanon. At least eight Lebanese villagers were wounded by the shelling last week. </P>
<P> Israeli gunboats have also begun barring Lebanese fishermen from venturing more than half a mile out to sea along 47 miles of coast from the Israeli border up to 12 miles south of Beirut. </P>
<P> Hariri also blames Israel for a car bomb in a Beirut Shiite Muslim suburb that killed three people in December. </P>
<P> Hariri said the extended blockade amounted to a new occupation zone in addition to the south Lebanon border strip occupied by Israel since 1982. </P>
<P> ``It (Israel) aims at besieging Lebanese sovereignty with a chain of military and security restrictions so that we are now facing two occupation strips,'' Hariri said. </P>
