<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Consumer prices continued their moderate advance by rising 0.3 percent in January, fueled by a rebound in clothing prices and higher costs for housing, airline tickets and gasoline, the Labor Department said Wednesday. </P>
<P> But after factoring out volatile food and energy costs, there was a notable pickup in the closely watched ``core'' inflation rate, which at 0.4 percent posted its largest rise in more than two years last month. Food prices actually fell. </P>
<P> The 0.3 percent rise in the Consumer Price Index forJanuary compared to a 0.2 percent increase in December. It was the largest gain in five months. </P>
<P> The 0.4 percent rise in the core rate slightly exceeded economists' forecasts, after increasing 0.1 percent in December. Economists had expected the core rate to increase 0.3 percent. </P>
<P> The January rise was the largest since a 0.5 percent increase in October 1992. </P>
<P> ``The 0.4 percent (rise in the core rate) is at the high end of expecations,'' said Matthew Alexy, chief market strategist at CS First Boston Corp. ``One factor is the apparel component, which was up 0.7 percent.'' </P>
<P> But he added: ``Put that apparel price increase against six months of consecutive declines and it doesn't mean that much. It's a small negative.'' </P>
<P> Clothing prices posted their biggest increase in nearly 1 3/8 years, after falling 0.2 percent in December. Smaller-than-usual discounts on fall and winter clothing in January fueled the increase after clothing prices had fallen throughout most of the second half of last year. </P>
<P> In general, the latest data continue the trend of moderate price rises that occurred in 1994, when prices rose 2.7 percent. That was the same as in 1993. The back-to-back performance was the best in three decades. </P>
<P> Despite the tame price outlook, the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates seven times in the past year to slow the economy and prevent it from overheating. The Fed boosted short-term rates half a percentage point earlier this month. </P>
<P> There are scattered signs the higher rates are starting to bite. Sales at the retail level began to slow late last year. Sales of new cars fell last month for the first time since mid-1994, and the unemployment rate jumped unexpectedly in January. </P>
<P> The CPI showed that food and drink prices fell 0.2 percent last month after jumping 0.6 percent in December. Fresh fruit and vegetable prices tumbled. Pork prices, by contrast, posted their largest advance in more than four years, climbing 1.3 percent. </P>
<P> Energy costs rose 0.3 percent last month after falling 0.1 percent. Gasoline prices jumped 0.4 percent after rising 0.1 percent in December. </P>
