<P>  President Clinton, fighting to limit party losses in November elections, did some political cheerleading here Saturday during a Democratic fundraising tour. </P>
<P> Clinton's appearances in an effort to avert a major setback in the November 8 mid-term elections included efforts to project a picture of White House accomplishments. </P>
<P> Faced with looming Democratic setbacks in the House and Senate, possibly beyond the traditional losses the party in charge of the White House suffers in non-presidential election years, Clinton urged the party faithful not to give up hope heading into the elections. </P>
<P> ``We are making real progress on hard problems against intense, organized opposition from the other party and from the special interests. That is the fact,'' Clinton told a rally for Senate candidate Ann Wynia. </P>
<P> Clinton's words came as Republicans are expressing increasing confidence about their chances in November and feel it is not outside the realm of possibility that they can take control of the Senate and possibly even the House as well after years as the minority opposition. </P>
<P> Clinton's own faltering popularity has led many Democratic candidates to distance themselves from the president in their fall campaigns. In reaction Republicans have worked to link Democratic standard bearers to Clinton. </P>
<P> But Clinton blamed a continuing anti-incumbent public mood for the unsettled political season. </P>
<P> ``Our challenge in this election is that many Americans are still profoundly upset with the political system, profoundly disillusioned, even cynical and they are in a mood to throw the rascals out without distinguishing who the rascals are,'' he said. </P>
<P> Key Democratic Party officials traveling with Clitnon tried to rebut the notion that Clinton is a drag on the ticket. </P>
<P> They told reporters on Air Force One on Clinton's flight from Chicago to Minneapolis that they believe Democrats will lose no more than the historical average of 24 seats in the House and two or three in the Senate -- not enough for the Republicans to gain control. </P>
<P> ``If you look race by race, we are in better shape than people think we are,'' said White House political director Joan Baggett. </P>
<P> She said requests from candidates for appearances by the president have been increasing and, ``No one has asked us not to come in.'' </P>
<P> Clinton showed he is a draw at raising money. In fundraisers Friday night in Chicago and Saturday in Minneapolis and Kansas City, he was helping raise more than $1 million. </P>
<P> In Minneapolis, he campaigned for Wynia, a former state legislator holding a narrow edge over Republican Representative Rod Grams in the race for the seat being vacated by Republican Dave Durenberger. </P>
<P> Is Clinton a help in traditionally liberal Minnesota? Said Wynia's spokesman Kevin Chandler: ``I doubt he's much of a help, nor does he do much harm, but he does help raise money.'' </P>
<P> Once word got around that this comment had been made, Wynia approached reporters to say she was delighted when she learned Clinton was willing to campaign for her in Minnesota and that he had brought ``a lot more energy and attention'' to her campaign. </P>
<P> In his stump speech in Chicago Friday night and in Minneapolis Saturday, Clinton focused on progress he has made in 20 months in office. He was to repeat it later Saturday in Kansas City before heading to New York City. </P>
<P> Reeling off a litany of accomplishments, Clinton paid most of his attention to economic issues, saying 4.3 million jobs have been created, that $250 billion is being cut from the federal budget deficit, that taxes have been cut for 15 million working families while only the wealthiest 1.2 percent is paying higher income taxes. </P>
<P> In addition, he said, he led the way in passing anti-crime and handgun-control legislation as well as a program for national service. </P>
<P> A Newsweek poll released Saturday said Clinton's overall popularity rating has gone up marginally -- from 37 percent to 39 percent -- since the magazine's last poll on September 9. </P>
<P> The president's disapproval rating has also risen, however, from 47 percent to 50 percent, according to the poll, which had a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points. </P>
