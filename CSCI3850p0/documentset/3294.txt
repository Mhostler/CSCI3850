<P>  Syria's Vice-President Abdel-Halim Khaddam said Saturday armed resistance against Israel was ``a legitimate act'' that should continue until Israel withdrew from all occupied Arab lands. </P>
<P> Khaddam said Syria, which hosts several Palestinian groups opposed to an Israeli-PLO peace deal and backs pro-Iranian guerrillas fighting Israeli occupation forces in south Lebanon, has rejected calls to curb the resistance groups. </P>
<P> The Syrian leader, however, said his country, which is engaged in peace talks with Israel, will continue to work for the achievement of a ``just and comprehensive'' peace settlement. </P>
<P> ``Resistance of occupation is a legitimate act which is endorsed by all international laws including the U.N. charter,'' Khaddam said in a speech during a meeting of the Arab Bar Association in Damascus. </P>
<P> ``Those who are trying to turn the resistance of occupation into an accusation to charge others should realize that we regard those who are defending their dignity, and fighting to liberate their lands, as strugglers who deserve all praise,'' he said. </P>
<P> Syria has previously rejected several calls by the United States to curb the activities of Lebanese guerrillas and close the offices of radical Palestinian groups who are opposed to the Middle East peace process. </P>
<P> The call was the main demand made by Washington to remove Syria from a list of countries which the U.S. accuses of supporting international terrorism. </P>
<P> Syria describes the guerrillas as freedom fighters and denies the U.S. charge. </P>
<P> ``Voices rise from time to time urging Arabs to adapt themselves to join the so-called new world order. The adaptation wanted requires Arabs abandon their rights and open their doors for Israel to dominate and control them...,'' Khaddam said. </P>
<P> ``To achieve this adaptation Arabs are also required to curb and eliminate resistance against the israeli occupation, because resistance is in their views terrorism, while the killing of thousands of Arabs in Palestine, Lebanon and Syria is a right for the strong party,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``This right is protected by the new world order.'' </P>
<P> The Damascus-based Palestinian groups, set up in the late 1960s, launched scores of bloody attacks against Israeli and Jewish targets worldwide but have recently concentrated their action against targets in Israel and the occupied territories. </P>
<P> The radicals say that Israel's 1993 self-rule deal with the PLO deprived Palestinians of their basic rights and vowed to wreck it. </P>
<P> Syria opened peace talks with Israel three years ago within the framework of the Arab-Israeli peace conference, but the negotiations were stalled over the fate of the Golan Heights, captured by Israel in 1967, and future ties. </P>
<P> Damascus wants full Israeli pull back. Israel says it will only reveal the extent of withdrawal after Syria agrees to full normal ties. </P>
