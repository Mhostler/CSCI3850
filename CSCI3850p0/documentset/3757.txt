<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres paid homage Friday to victims of two anti-Semitic bomb attacks in Buenos Aires in which about 120 people died and told the culprits they would not get away with murder. </P>
<P> ``I believe we should get hold of the people responsible for the bombings,'' he told a news conference. ``They should not be under the illusion that they will get away with murder.'' </P>
<P> Peres discussed with President Carlos Menem, Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella and security chief Brig. Andres Antonietti the slow progress in investigations into the bomb blasts that razed a Jewish cultural center last July and the Israeli embassy in March 1992. </P>
<P> The July car bomb killed about 90 people and injured nearly 300, making it probably the worst peacetime attack on Jews since World War II. </P>
<P> ``The investigations are going well and I think we are on their trail,'' Menem told reporters. Di Tella said Peres was told of new information which has come to light in recent weeks, but said it was not yet conclusive. </P>
<P> Both attacks have been blamed on Muslim extremists and Di Tella told Reuters the investigations led by Judge Juan Jose Galeano ``have an Iranian connection'' -- a charge Tehran has vigorously denied. </P>
<P> Galeano and Israeli diplomats here have warned repeatedly of the risk of further attacks. Alberto Krupnickoff, head of the Argentine Jewish cultural group AMIA, said Friday ``neither the mountains nor the River Plate will protect us'' as long as the culprits remain at large. </P>
<P> Police are holding two men in connection with the car used in last July's attack. One of them, Carlos Telleldin, is an ex-policeman of Middle Eastern ancestry who said he sold the Renault van but he was unaware it was to be used as a car bomb. </P>
<P> But diplomats and Jewish leaders believe the bombers may have taken shelter in the growing Muslim community around Argentina's northern border with Paraguay and Brazil, which they say is becoming a refuge for fundamentalist gunmen. </P>
<P> ``It is proven that they collect funds for fundamentalist groups there,'' Di Tella said in an interview. ``But that does not prove anything, it does not prove the ones collecting funds are also doing the shooting.'' </P>
<P> Peres, who traveled to Argentina from Venezuela, crossed the River Plate to Uruguay for a two-day gathering with Jewish community leaders from the region. </P>
