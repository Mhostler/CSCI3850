<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  As Jordan signed up for what Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres calls the peace coalition, old coalition member Egypt welcomed Jordan into the fold but states still outside lamented the collapse of Arab solidarity. </P>
<P> The Palestine Liberation Organization, despite its own agreements with Israel, took offense at the way Israel and Jordan had handled the question of Jerusalem, which the Palestinians hope will one day be the capital of their state. </P>
<P> In Washington Monday, King Hussein of Jordan and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin sealed the end of 46 years of belligerency and agreed on first steps toward normal relations. </P>
<P> With the new agreement, Jordan is catching up with Egypt, which signed a peace treaty with the Jewish state in 1979, and with the Palestinians, who broke Arab ranks with a self-rule agreement for the West Bank and the Gaza Strip last year. </P>
<P> But it jumps ahead of Syria and Lebanon, the other states on the old front line between Israel and its neighbors. </P>
<P> The Arab League, supposedly a forum for molding an Arab consensus but increasingly dominated by Egypt and its conservative allies, said Jordan's agreement was a step on the road to a just and comprehensive peace. </P>
<P> ``This step must be complemented by similar and urgent steps on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks, leading to Israel withdrawing from all the occupied Syrian Golan and Lebanese territory,'' Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid said in a statement. </P>
<P> He did not mention Jordan's promise to work to abolish all economic boycotts. The league tries to enforce the boycott of Israel and has resisted U.S. attempts to have it abolished. </P>
<P> Egypt, an active proponent of peace even at the expense of Arab unanimity, predictably welcomed Jordan's move but tried not to antagonize its friends in Syria. </P>
<P> ``It's a step toward Jordan recovering its rights ... This is something that we and other Arabs can only support,'' said Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa. </P>
<P> But he added: ``I cannot tell whether this Israeli-Jordanian agreement produced a breakthrough on the other tracks ... Without progress on the Syrian track and also the Lebanese track one cannot say that there is a comprehensive peace.'' </P>
<P> In the preparatory stages of the Jordanian-Israeli agreement, Palestinian officials had been largely sympathetic, saying it would be hypocritical to ask King Hussein not to do something they themselves had done already. </P>
<P> But Tuesday an official PLO source attacked the agreement as a sell-out to Israel's position on Jerusalem. </P>
<P> In a statement issued by the PLO news agency WAFA, the source said: ``The Israeli government has no right to give any role or commitment on Jerusalem since it is an occupying state.'' </P>
