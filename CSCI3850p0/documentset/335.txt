<P>  ``N.Y.P.D. Blue,'' the police drama that stretched the limits of nudity and language on television, led the 46th annual Emmy Award nominations Thursday with 26, while CBS led the networks with 91 nominations. </P>
<P> The Academy of Television Arts & Sciences announced the 343 nominations in 26 categories in a live broadcast hosted by Richard Frank, president of the academy, and actress Patricia Richardson, star of the ABC series ``Home Improvement.'' </P>
<P> It was the second consecutive year that CBS was the leading network in Emmy nominations. Last year it garnered 92 nominations. It was trailed this year by ABC with 73 nominations, NBC with 66, PBS with 25 and Fox with 9. The cable television network HBO took 34 nominations. </P>
<P> The Emmy Awards will be presented September 11 in Pasadena, California, and broadcast live on ABC. </P>
<P> ``N.Y.P.D. Blue'' debuted on ABC last fall and immediately sparked controversy for its male nudity and strong language. Its nominations included outstanding drama series, four for best director for a dramatic series, two for best actor in a dramatic series, five for best writing, two for best supporting actor and three for best supporting actress in a dramatic series. </P>
<P> ``And the Band Played On,'' a made-for-television movie from HBO about gay life and AIDS, won the most nominations for a single program with 13. ``Gypsy,'' a made-for-television movie from CBS, and ``Seinfeld,'' an NBC comedy series, each took 12 nominations. </P>
