<P>  The influential Izvestia newspaper said Thursday it expected Russia's hawkish defense minister and the counter-intelligence chief to be fired shortly as scapegoats for the faltering military campaign in Chechnya. </P>
<P> The report, based on the newspaper's own sources and unconfirmed by the government, fueled speculation President Boris Yeltsin plans widespread personnel changes and major reforms of the armed forces because of Chechnya. </P>
<P> Izvestia said Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, counter- intelligence chief Sergei Stepashin and two unnamed deputy prime ministers were likely to be dismissed some time this month. </P>
<P> It said the fall-out of the Chechnya campaign had already begun with the removal last Friday of Nationalities Minister Nikolai Yegorov, whose responsibilities included Chechnya. The official cause of Yegorov's departure was bad health. </P>
<P> ``Competent sources says N. Yegorov was the first victim of the unsuccessful military campaign,'' Izvestia, the government newspaper in Soviet times, said in a front-page article. </P>
<P> ``The next victims, Kremlin specialists say, will without doubt be P. Grachev, S. Stepashin, and probably two deputy prime ministers as well,'' it said. </P>
<P> A government spokesman declined comment. ``Rumors like these have been circulating for quite some time,'' he said. </P>
<P> Other Russian and Western sources in Moscow were also unable to confirm the report and said they expected Yeltsin to make more gradual changes than those suggested by Izvestia. </P>
<P> They offered no clues as to which of Russia's six deputy prime ministers or two first deputy prime ministers Izvestia's sources thought could be ousted. </P>
<P> Rumors about a big reshuffle and military reforms have been rampant since Russian troops, sent to Chechnya on Dec. 11 to end its three-year independence bid, got bogged down. </P>
<P> Yeltsin, his authority weakened by the crisis, is anxious to reinforce his position and his image as a democrat. An official statement said he discussed ``personnel matters'' with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin Tuesday but gave no details. </P>
