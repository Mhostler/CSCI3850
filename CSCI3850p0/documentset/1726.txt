<P>  Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said Friday a Gulf Arab states' decision dropping a decades-old boycott of companies trading with Israel was important and he hoped for further such steps. </P>
<P> ``I welcome this decision. I think it's an additional move in dismantling the walls of hatred and separation and boycott,'' he told reporters after a meeting with U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. </P>
<P> Peres said it was ``an important move and we hope it will be continued.'' </P>
<P> The announcement, by Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) foreign ministers after a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, means the six member countries will drop a ban on trading with companies that deal with Israel, as well as on companies that trade with those companies. </P>
<P> But no mention was made of ending a primary boycott against direct dealings with Israel. </P>
<P> The boycotts were imposed by the Arab League even before the Jewish State was established in 1948, but has weakened in recent years. </P>
<P> Asked about prospects for a complete end to the boycott, Peres said those who applied it hurt themselves, not just Israel. </P>
<P> ``The boycott has had a negative effect upon the Arab countries as well, because today markets are more important than countries and if you put limits to trade, you limit your own capacity to trade in a changing world.'' </P>
<P> He said he hoped a conference next month in Casablanca, Morocco, on economic issues would ``actually begin a new era in the economic relations of the Middle East.'' </P>
<P> Asked about prospects for high-level negotiations with Syria, he said: ``Undoubtely a direct contact is necessary to air out our differences and to find common ground to overcome the disagreements between our two countries.'' </P>
<P> But he said that ``all the attempts to have meetings on the political level between the Syrians and ourselves were rejected by the Syrians. We think it is a mistake because you need the levels that can make decisions and change decisions.'' </P>
<P> He added: ``We are very close strategically (to a meeting with Syria) and very far away tactically. We need the tactics of agreement.'' </P>
<P> Peres earlier conferred with Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev after Kozyrev met Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara. He said the Russian diplomat proposed the three ministers get together. </P>
<P> ``Mr Kozyrev suggested that we shall drink vodka together, and as far as I am concerned I am ready to do it,'' Peres said. </P>
<P> But he said press reports of contacts between Israel and Iraq were ``totally unfounded.'' </P>
<P> Asked if he would be prepared to meet Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, he replied: ``No. I don't have any reason to put any trust in Saddam Hussein. </P>
<P> ``We remember the Scuds he fired against Israel,'' Peres added, referring to some 40 Iraqi missiles that hit Tel Aviv and other centers during the 1991 Gulf War, in which Israel was not a combatant. </P>
