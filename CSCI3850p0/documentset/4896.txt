<P>  France told the Security Council Monday that sanctions against Iraq should be continued but made clear that it favored lifting oil exports once Iraq had complied with U.N. weapons demands. </P>
<P> In a written text, distributed to reporters, Ambassador Jean-Bernard Merimee said that a 1991 Gulf War cease-fire resolution clearly states that the council should lift the oil embargo once weapons demands are met. </P>
<P> But he said his delegation ``believes that the regime of sanctions applied to Iraq cannot be modified yet since that country has still not met the requisite conditions for this.'' </P>
<P> In contrast, U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright has argued that Iraq needs to fulfill requirements of all resolutions and has hinted that Iraq is rebuilding its arms factories. </P>
<P> The Security Council Monday reviewed sanctions against Iraq, which will be maintained. No country to date has moved to ease the trade bans, primarily because Iraq has not yet accounted for all its past weapons of mass destruction. </P>
<P> In what appeared to be an indirect criticism of the United States, Merimee said France trusted reports from Rolf Ekeus, the head of the U.N. Special Commission in charge of scrapping Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. </P>
<P> ``Iraq will have to be judged not on vague accusations or a presumption of culpability but of the facts assembled and documented by the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Special Commission,'' Merimee said. </P>
<P> At issue is a 1991 cease-fire resolution which links oil sanctions to weapons demands and other requirements such as returning stolen Kuwaiti property to imports of goods to Iraq. </P>
<P> The ambassador, however, noted that the Special Commission was still searching for materials relating to germ warfare before a major report to be submitted in mid-April. </P>
<P> Merimee said Iraq only had itself to blame if in April it did not comply with U.N. inspectors quest to account for past programs in the biological arms field, which Ekeus said he needed to fulfill his mission. </P>
<P> ``For our part, we are prepared when the time comes to take the necessary iniatives ... if Iraq satisfies the obligations that govern the removal of sanctions,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``But for this to happen the Iraqi authorities must act for it is up to Iraq to comply with all the provisions that concern it,'' Merimee added. </P>
