<DATELINE>TEHRAN, Iran (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Iran's air force commander, Brig. Gen. Mansour Sattari, and several of his deputies were killed in a plane crash in central Iran, a senior official said Friday. </P>
<P> ``The air force commander and some of his deputies were among the 12 people on board a small plane that crashed, apparently near Isfahan,'' Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati said in a Friday prayer sermon. All were killed, he added. </P>
<P> He said the plane was flying from Isfahan to Tehran, 200 miles to the north, Thursday night. It headed back toward Isfahan because of ``a technical problem'' before it crashed. </P>
<P> Iran's official news agency IRNA said the plane was a Lockheed C-140 JetStar. </P>
<P> The air force public relations office in Tehran declined to comment on the incident, the second time since the 1979 Islamic revolution that Iran's air force chief and senior officers have died in plane crashes. </P>
<P> Sattari was appointed commander of the air force in January 1987 in the last stages of the eight-year Iran-Iraq war. </P>
<P> Then a colonel, Sattari was unlike his predecessors a radar expert, not a fighter pilot. </P>
<P> He oversaw the overhaul of the air force after the end of the war with Iraq in 1988, when Iran acquired Russian-built MiG-29 and Sukhoi Su-24 fighter planes to boost its pre-1979 fleet of U.S.-built F-4, F-5 and F-14 aircraft. </P>
<P> The accident is the latest in a series of air crashes in the past two years involving civilian and military planes which have not been fully explained by Iranian authorities. </P>
<P> In February 1993, one of the Sukhoi fighters crashed in mid-air near Tehran with a Tupolev Tu-154 chartered by an Iran Air subsidiary. </P>
<P> All 134 people aboard the two planes were killed. No official report about the incident has been made public. </P>
<P> Last March a military C-130 Hercules, bringing home families of Iranian diplomats in Moscow, was hit by a missile apparently fired by Armenian forces in the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region in Azerbaijan. All 32 people on board were killed. </P>
<P> A Fokker F-28 of the state-owned Aseman airlines crashed on Oct. 12 during a flight from Isfahan to Tehran with 66 people on board. There were no survivors. </P>
<P> In September 1981, an air force C-130 Hercules bringing back top military commanders after a successful operation in which Iranian forces broke the Iraqi siege of the oil city of Abadan in the south, crashed near Tehran. Authorities attributed the crash which had no survivors to technical faults. </P>
