<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES, (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  An arraignment court hearing for night club bouncer-turned actor Mickey Rourke, who is charged with misdemeanor spousal abuse, was postponed Friday to September 8. </P>
<P> Rourke, 44, a successful amateur boxer before becoming a bouncer and then an actor, is accused of attacking his wife, actress-model Carre Otis, knocking her down and kicking her during an argument at his office in Hollywood on July 18. </P>
<P> The actor, who starred in ``Diner,'' ``Year of the Dragon,'' ''Barfly,'' ``9 3/8 Weeks,'' and ``Pope of Greenwich Village,'' was not in court Friday. He also starred with his wife in the steamy 1990 film ``Wild Orchid.'' </P>
<P> Speaking to reporters outside the Municipal Court in Hollywood, Rourke's lawyer, David Wood, indicated he sought the postponement so he could discuss the case further with the Los Angeles City Attorney's office. </P>
<P> ``The District Attorney had an opportunity to review this case with the police department and found that the facts alleged were not worthy of filing (felony) charges,'' Wood said. </P>
<P> When Rourke was charged last Friday, Deputy City Attorney William Sterling said the case had been referred to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office for consideration of a possible felony charge, but that office had decided the abuse was not serious enough to warrant the graver charge. </P>
<P> If convicted, Rourke, who has not yet made a plea in the case, faces up to one year in jail and or a $1,000 fine. </P>
