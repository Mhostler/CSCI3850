<DATELINE>LUSAKA, May 5 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A senior Zambian foreign affairs official said on Friday Angola's rebel UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi had arrived in the Zambian capital and his war rival President Jose Eduardo do Santos was expected soon. </P>
<P> ``Savimbi has arrived in Zambia. He is here. He arrived on Friday morning,'' said the official who declined to be named. He would not give any further details. </P>
<P> Asked about President do Santos's wherabouts, the official said: ``We are waiting. We are expecting him.'' </P>
<P> Earlier another official said Zambia was confident the talks would take place. ``We have faith in these talks taking place...,'' he said. </P>
<P> A U.NN official who was involved in the signing of last November's peace accord said: ``We need to exercise our patience.'' </P>
<P> No programme, schedule or venue for the summit has been disclosed. </P>
<P> Dos Santos and Savimbi were expected in Lusaka on Thursday, six months after government and UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola) rebels signed a peace accord in the Zambian capital. </P>
<P> On Thursday Zambian officials laid out a red carpet and chairs for dos Santos at Lusaka airport in time for his 3 p.m. plane to land. Disconsolately, they rolled the carpet up again a couple of hours later and packed up the chairs. </P>
<P> A U.NN official said that Savimbi was in the Zairean town of Gbadolite but was not sure if he had left for Lusaka. </P>
<P> U.NN special representative to Angola Alouline Blondin Beye declined to speak to reporters on his arrival on Friday morning. </P>
<P> ``I have nothing to disclose,'' Beye said. </P>
<P> Observers from Russia, Portugal and the Untied States arrived on Thursday and said they did not know where Savimbi or Dos Santos were. </P>
<P> Savimbi, who has been on an African tour for the past week, was quoted on Thursday as saying the meeting was a necessity and ``will constitute the crowning of efforts at national reconciliation which began a long time ago.'' </P>
<P> The two men last met in Portugal in 1989. </P>
<P> The Angolan war has dragged on since independence in 1975, with a break of less than two years in the late 1980s, and laid waste the oil-rich nation. Tens of thousands of people have been killed and millions fled their homes. </P>
<P> Each side has accused the other of repeatedly violating the November 20 ceasefire, delaying the arrival of 7,600 U.N. peacekeepers. </P>
