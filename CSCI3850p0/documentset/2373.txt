<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  No stranger to scuffling with Tokyo, an upbeat U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said Wednesday he expects ``to move the ball forward'' in high-level talks with Japan next week. </P>
<P> In an interview, Kantor also downplayed a spate of hard-line new Japanese comments over the contentious car sector as nothing but ``rhetorical flourishes.'' </P>
<P> ``I'm not at all discouraged -- just the opposite.'' </P>
<P> Ministers from the two sides, who have repeatedly come to blows over bilateral trade, are slated to meet on the edge of a broader Asia-Pacific summit to be held in Indonesia. </P>
<P> Neither side wants two-way tensions to cloud the regional meeting, whose theme is supposed to be economic integration, not alienation. </P>
<P> Hence the warm new tone. </P>
<P> Kantor last met his Japanese counterpart a month ago in marathon, round-the-clock negotiations that culminated in a partial market-opening deal countered by partial U.S. sanctions action. </P>
<P> The compromise led to a cooling-off period between the two economic giants that took the edge off jittery currency markets and raised hopes for a warming in relations. </P>
<P> Kantor stuck to that tone, voicing hopes for progress when he again meets with Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono and Trade Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto in Jakarta Nov. 13. </P>
<P> ``I'm sure we can privately deal with a number of issues and move the ball forward,'' said Kantor, who refused to be drawn on specifics. </P>
<P> ``I think we're making progress. Is it fast enough? Of course not. Are we concerned about continued closed markets? Of course we are. But we're going to continue to work at it. I'm not easily dissuaded.'' </P>
<P> A host of outstanding trade issues remain, chief among them differences over autos and auto parts, which make up two-thirds of the $60 billion U.S.-Japan trade imbalance. </P>
<P> The United States is pressing Japan to open its lucrative car market, be it encouraging dealers to carry U.S. models or calling on its automakers to buy more U.S. parts. </P>
<P> Hashimoto, known for his sharp tongue and straightforward manner, has recently dug in his heels over re-opening the car talks so long as the White House persists in its threat to resort to sanctions. </P>
<P> Last month, Kantor said he would initiate a probe of Japan's spare car parts market under the Section 301 trade clause, a move which could lead to sanctions in 12 months. </P>
<P> Ever since, the two sides have kept a flurry of letters flowing back and forth, outlining their objectives and objections in the sector -- apparently to no good end. </P>
<P> But Kantor, who has built up a strong rapport with Hashimoto, dismissed his sharp words as games. </P>
<P> ``We all engage in rhetorical flourishes from time to time. Minister Hashimoto is a very adroit and able political figure. I wouldn't expect him to take any different position,'' Kantor said. </P>
<P> Turning to his decision Tuesday to shun sanctions action over flat glass and offer Tokyo a second reprieve in the case, Kantor said it would have been ``counter-productive to move in some other direction after making so much progress ... Industry encouraged us to keep going.'' </P>
<P> The United States has for years accused Japan of operating a cartel in its $4.5 billion flat glass industry, which produces sheet glass for both the building and car markets. </P>
<P> The latest talks, held in Tokyo, slipped past a Monday midnight deadline for a deal but Kantor said of 38 issues that had to be resolved, only three remain under debate. </P>
<P> ``That's major progess,'' he said. </P>
<P> Kantor has given Tokyo ``a limited period'' to make good on its pledge to strike a glass deal and avert U.S. retaliation. </P>
<P> He declined to be drawn on what options the Clinton administration might pursue should Tokyo renege on its promise, nor has he informed Hashimoto exactly how much time remains to cut a deal or risk renewed U.S. wrath. </P>
