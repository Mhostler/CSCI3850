<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A federal judge Tuesday overturned the murder conviction of a man whose daughter said she witnessed him kill an eight-year-old girl and then repressed the memory of it for 20 years. </P>
<P> The trial of retired firefighter George Franklin, 55, was believed to be the first in the nation that revolved around the controversial subject of memories suppressed and then revived years later. </P>
<P> U.S. District Judge Lowell Jensen of San Francisco ruled Tuesday that the judge in Franklin's 1990 trial had made two constitutional errors that undermined his right to a fair trial. </P>
<P> ``This is a tragic event which cries out for resolution, but it cannot be resolved by a trial where violations of the Constitution have eliminated the necessary presence of fundamental fairness,'' Jensen wrote, ordering the reversal of the conviction. </P>
<P> Prosecutors in San Mateo County, south of San Francisco, have 90 days to decide whether to retry Franklin. They could also appeal Jensen's ruling to a higher court. </P>
<P> Franklin was found guilty of first-degree murder in November 1990, largely on evidence provided by his daughter, Eileen Franklin-Lipsker. He was sentenced to life in prison. </P>
<P> Franklin-Lipsker, then 29, told police that as an eight-year-old she watched her father sexually molest her friend, Susan Nason, and hit the girl on the head with a rock. </P>
<P> She said she had suppressed the traumatic memory for 20 years but a glance from her own six-year-old daughter made it come back. </P>
<P> Nason disappeared from her home in Foster City near San Francisco in September 1969. Her body was found three months later in a ravine. She had been beaten to death. </P>
<P> Jensen said the prosecution should not have been allowed to introduce evidence at the trial of a January 1990 incident in which Franklin remained silent when urged by his daughter during a prison visit to ``tell the truth.'' </P>
<P> The prosecution argued that Franklin's silence was proof that he was guilty. </P>
<P> Jensen also said that Franklin's lawyers should have been allowed to introduce evidence that details of the murder recounted by Franklin-Lipsker had been reported in the media. </P>
<P> Jensen did not invalidate the ``recovered memory'' testimony, but he said that recovered memories must be at least subject to the same rigorous scrutiny normally given during trials to memories of events long past. </P>
<P> After exhausting appeals within the state court system, Franklin's lawyer Dennis Riordan appealed to the federal court to release Franklin on the grounds that the conduct of the trial violated the U.S. Constitution. </P>
<P> Riordan said he had informed Franklin, jailed in San Luis Obispo in central California, of the judge's ruling and that Franklin had reacted with ``as much relief as happiness.'' </P>
<P> A spokesman for the San Mateo County District Attorney's office said prosecutors were surprised by the decision. They will review the ruling and then decide whether to retry Franklin, he said. </P>
