<DATELINE>GAZA (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Palestinian security forces, under pressure from Israel to curb guerrilla attacks by militant Muslims, arrested about 40 members of the radical Hamas group in the Gaza Strip Monday, a PLO official said. </P>
<P> Some 200 Hamas supporters protested the crackdown in an evening demonstration in front of Palestinian police headquarters in the Gaza town of Deir el-Balah. </P>
<P> Demonstrators carried signs condemning the Palestinian self-rule authority for confronting Hamas to comply with Israel's demands. </P>
<P> ``The authority stands with the occupation against the giants of the holy struggle,'' read one sign. </P>
<P> In Jerusalem, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin welcomed news of the roundup, calling it ``a good sign.'' </P>
<P> Earlier, Rabin visited the road in Gaza where Hamas gunmen killed an Israeli in one of two ambushes Sunday. In comments to reporters, Rabin threw the future of peace moves in doubt. </P>
<P> ``It is inconceivable we will continue the process without seeing on the part of the Palestinian Authority a serious effort to deal with those terrorist elements who are known for claiming responsibility for carrying out terror,'' he said. </P>
<P> Nabil Shaath, the PLO's chief negotiator in talks with Israel, pledged Palestinian police would find the men who killed 18-year-old Ron Soval. </P>
<P> Soval was the first Israeli civilian killed in Gaza since most of the strip was turned over to Palestinians in May. </P>
<P> ``We are taking this very seriously. Our Cabinet met all last night to take up measures that will take the perpetrators to justice and will prevent and pre-empt operations like this from happening in the future,'' Shaath told reporters. </P>
<P> Hamas is the PLO's chief rival in Gaza and an opponent of its peace accord with Israel. </P>
<P> In Damascus, Hamas, the Islamic Resistance Movement, vowed to fight on against Israeli occupation, saying that the crackdown by Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat and his self-rule authority would not stop it. </P>
<P> Hamas spokesman Mahmoud al-Zahhar told Reuters he had received a telephone call from PLO leader Yasser Arafat late Sunday asking him to put an end to Hamas military operations. </P>
<P> ``It was a negative step -- whether it was aimed at appeasing Israel or otherwise,'' Zahhar said of the roundup. ``How can we cooperate with the Palestinian Authority in light of these developments?'' </P>
<P> At the Dead Sea in Israel, Jordanian and Israeli negotiators held talks on Monday to hammer out obstacles to a full peace treaty, including border demarcation and water. </P>
