<P>  Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali recommended Wednesday continued deployment of a 1,113-member U.N. mission established after the 1991 Gulf War to patrol a demilitarized zone (DMZ) straddling the Iraq-Kuwait border. </P>
<P> In a written report to the Security Council, which reviews the operation of the U.N. Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission (UNIKOM) every six months, he said the border and the DMZ were generally calm, adding: ``I recommend that the mission be maintained.'' </P>
<P> He noted a ``period of tension in October 1994 in connection with reports about the deployment of Iraqi troops north of the DMZ.'' But he said there had been ``only a limited number of incidents and violations of the DMZ,'' mainly involving overflights by military aircraft and the carrying or firing of weapons other than sidearms. </P>
<P> ``Two civilians, one on each side of the border, lost their lives in shooting incidents,'' the secretary-general reported. </P>
<P> He also referred to a March 13 incident in which two United States citizens crossed the border from Kuwait into Iraq by mistake and were apprehended by Iraqi police. ``Efforts are being made by the United Nations to have the two men released,'' he said. </P>
<P> Giving details of the incident, he said: ``On their way to the border they crossed a Kuwaiti checkpoint at the edge of the DMZ, as well as a UNIKOM checkpoint at the border, which is marked by a berm (sand wall) and trench constructed by the Kuwaiti authorities. </P>
<P> ``They were allowed to pass the UNIKOM checkpoint because, with darkness having just fallen, the sentries on duty mistook the white vehicle for one belonging to the United Nations. The procedures at the checkpoint have since been tightened.'' </P>
<P> UNIKOM, which costs about $64 million a year, includes 244 military observers from 32 countries, a 775-man Bangladeshi infantry battalion, a 50-member engineering unit from Argentina and a 44-member Danish logistics unit. UNIKOM also has 214 civilian staff including 133 who were locally recruited. </P>
