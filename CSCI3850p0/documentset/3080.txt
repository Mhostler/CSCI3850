<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The decision by a Turkish state security court Thursday to sentence eight Kurdish lawmakers to up to 15 years in prison is certain to reverberate beyond the confines of the court. </P>
<P> European members of parliament at the trial were visibly shaken and angered after the verdicts were read. One said he would call for a continued freezing of relations with the European parliament, done after the Kurdish MPs' immunity was lifted. </P>
<P> ``We will ask for a freezing of relations with Turkish parliamentarians ... tis will be one reaction from this terrible morning,'' said Elsma Doeke, a Dutch MP. </P>
<P> Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller hailed the sentences as proof that the courts were unbiased and independent. </P>
<P> ``The parliamentarians are free to appeal in Turkey and in Europe ... Turkey is not the only European country in which parliamentarians are being tried and convicted,'' she said in a statement. </P>
<P> Five MPs were sentenced to 15 years for taking orders from the illegal Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which is waging a 10-year-old battle for control of the largely Kurdish southeast. </P>
<P> But the aftershocks are not likely to breach Turkey's relations with the West, no matter how many statements of regret international human rights groups issue. </P>
<P> Although in 11 days Turkey and the European Union will hold crucial talks on the expected customs union, a Western diplomatic source said there was unlikely to be a delay unless the issue is referred to the European Parliament. </P>
<P> While the United States and many European countries expressed ``concern'' over the proceedings, this is not the first time people convicted of separatist propoganda or aiding the PKK have accused Turkish courts of using false evidence or pandering to political will. </P>
<P> ``It's a great shame, of course, but let's be realistic, there are lots of alleged human rights abuses going on in Turkey,'' said a Western diplomatic source. </P>
