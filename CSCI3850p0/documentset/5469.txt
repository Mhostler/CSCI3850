<P>  Swazi Prime Minister Prince Mbilini Wednesday appealed for international drought aid for more than 90,000 people facing starvation in the southern African mountain kingdom. </P>
<P> ``The government has declared yet another severe drought situation and approximately 90,000 people are without enough food and water and their lives and that of their livestock are in peril,'' Mbilini said in a statement. </P>
<P> He said rains last month in the Lobomba and Shiselweni regions came too late to save crops and drought aid was needed there immediately. </P>
<P> Ben Nsibande, chairman of Swaziland's National Disaster Task Force, told Reuters, ``In some schools children have collapsed in class because of starvation.'' </P>
<P> The 11-member Southern African Development Community (SADC) has said several member countries were affected by the drought. </P>
<P> Lesotho had already declared an emergency while Botswana planned to. Large other areas of southern Africa were affected. </P>
<P> SADC comprises Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. </P>
