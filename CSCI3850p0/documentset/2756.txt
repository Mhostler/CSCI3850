<P>  The Federal Trade Commission said Monday that Haagen-Dazs Co. Inc. has agreed to settle agency charges it made false and misleading low-fat claims for its line of frozen yogurt products. </P>
<P> Haagen-Dazs, based in Teaneck, N.J., represented that its entire frozen yogurt line was 98 percent fat-free and its line of frozen yogurt bars contined 100 calories and one gram of fat per serving, the FTC said. </P>
<P> ``These claims were false for many items in each product line,'' the FTC said. </P>
<P> The settlement would prohibit Haagen-Dazs from misrepresenting the fat, saturated fat, cholestrol or calorie content of any of its frozen food products. </P>
