<P> The Berlin court's presiding judge, Gabrielle Eschenhagen, said the light sentence reflected the difficulty of reconstructing events 30 years after the fact. She suggested it might have been better for Germany to set up a tribunal to deal with this chapter of German history rather than leaving it to the courts. </P>
<P> At least 400 people were killed trying to cross the heavily fortified border around West Berlin and between the two Germanys during the Cold War. In the latest case, one defendant was convicted of manslaughter after admitting he fired six shots at the would-be refugee, 62, who died after being hit in the stomach. The guard's colleague and the company commander were convicted of incitement to manslaughter for the incident, which occurred in Berlin's Treptow district. </P>
<P> German courts have routinely declined to jail former East German border guards simply for shooting at escapees because they were following orders that conformed to laws in place at the time. Attempts to bring to book the leaders who drew up the shoot-to-kill order have so far had limited success. Former East German leader Erich Honecker avoided trial due to illness and died in exile. Three lesser officials have been convicted. </P>
