<DATELINE>KINSHASA, Zaire (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Zaire's new government has announced a sweeping set of decrees aimed at restoring law and order in the anarchic central African state and bringing the corruption-ridden security forces back under state control. </P>
<P> The measures, announced on national television Friday by Information Minister Masegabio Nzanzu and effective immediately, target Zaire's police, army soldiers, gardes civiles and intelligence services. </P>
<P> Accustomed to regarding themselves as above the law, Zaire's security forces habitually prey on the public. </P>
<P> Stationed at traffic lights, airports, docks or impromptu roadblocks, they level on-the-spot fines for imaginary offenses or demand outright bribes. Many hire themselves out as bodyguards to businessmen, restaurants and nightclubs to augment their tiny salaries. </P>
<P> Announcing the results of the government's first Cabinet meeting, Masegabio made it clear such behavior would no longer be tolerated. All soldiers not on active duty will be forbidden to carry a weapon in public or rent themselves out as bodyguards, he said. </P>
<P> Zaire's chaotic customs procedure at points of entry, a traditional money-earner for the security forces and the source of travelers' endless horror stories, will be slashed from 13 different services to just four, he added. </P>
<P> In a bid to rein in violent crime, Masegabio ordered all Zaireans with unlicensed firearms to hand them into the Defense Ministry by July 30 and those with expired arms licences to renew them immediately. </P>
<P> The measures were welcomed as a step in the right direction by diplomats in Kinshasa, though many wondered if new centrist Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo had the authority to enforce them given the security forces' traditional loyalty to President Mobutu Sese Seko. </P>
<P> Masegabio also announced a series of steps aimed at putting a brake on Zaire's spiraling economic decline. He said all checks, payment orders and bonds issued by the outgoing government of Prime Minister Faustin Birindwa were to be frozen and costly official trips abroad banned. </P>
