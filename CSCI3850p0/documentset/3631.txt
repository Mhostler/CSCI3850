<DATELINE>PORTSMOUTH, N.H., Jan 7 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The pipe Albert Einstein smoked and a game the Nobel Prize-winning physicist played as a child sold for $20,000 at an auction Saturday. </P>
<P> Auctioneer Jim Smith of Remember When Auctions of Portsmouth said he would not reveal the name of the buyer but said it was a private collector, not a museum or institution. </P>
<P> Einstein died in 1955 and is most famous for his discovery of the theory of relativity. He was often pitcured smoking the pipe and after his death his daughter gave it to friend and photographer Stanford Roth. </P>
<P> The game included 10 two-inch ivory pegs and a spinning top, authenticated by Christie's as a German 19th-century game Einstein played as a child. </P>
<P> He was born in 1879 in Ulm, Germany, and probably played the game there. He published four papers in 1905 while at the Polytechnic Academy in Zurich, Switzerland, one of which contained the theory of relativity. </P>
<P> It was verified in 1919 and he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1921. Einstein joined the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., in 1933. </P>
<P> The pipe was sold in its original leather case and was accompanied by a letter from Einstein's daughter, Margo, to Roth, saying, ``Thanks to you for the happy times spent with us.'' </P>
