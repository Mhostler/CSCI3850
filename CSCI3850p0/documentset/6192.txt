<DATELINE>PARIS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  French far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen refused Monday to throw his support to either of the candidates contesting Sunday's presidential run-off vote, dismissing them both as leftist traitors. </P>
<P> Le Pen, who won 15 percent of the votes in the first-round ballot, made his stand in a fiery speech to 8,000 followers in central Paris. The traditional May Day rally was later marred by the drowning of a Moroccan man in the River Seine. </P>
<P> Police said three skinheads had thrown the 29-year-old Moroccan into the river. Prosecutors were investigating. </P>
<P> Le Pen, whose National Front party campaigns on an anti-immigrant program, was quick to contest early reports that the assailants were Front supporters. </P>
<P> He told France Info radio that police had been unable to find the skinheads to determine their motives and suggested they could have been Communists rather than extreme rightists. </P>
<P> ``The police have confirmed that there is no firm link between the incident and the National Front,'' he added. </P>
<P> Earlier Le Pen had accused France's political establishment of refusing to acknowledge the Front's strength, and demanded recognition and respect for himself and his supporters. </P>
<P> ``They wanted us to disappear. But we are still here, and for a long time,'' he told the noisy crowd of supporters. </P>
<P> The far-rightist leader was angry that the two run-off candidates, conservative Jacques Chirac and Socialist Lionel Jospin, had refused to seek his backing before Sunday's vote to choose a successor to Socialist President Francois Mitterrand. </P>
<P> The far-right leader refused to endorse either of them, but said he would give them a final chance to court his support in their televised debate Tuesday night. </P>
<P> ``The millions of National Front voters have no desire to be scorned and excluded any longer,'' he said, expressing the ``modest hope'' that the political establishment would soon be forced to acknowledge his movement. </P>
<P> Before his speech in front of the old Paris opera, Le Pen led thousands of supporters through the city's center chanting ``Le Pen for president'' and ``France for the French.'' </P>
<P> Many waved French flags and some, marching behind 10 medieval-clad ``knights'' on horseback, carried royalist flags with the fleur-de-lys emblem. </P>
<P> Some in the crowd wore the insignia of neo-Fascist groups such as the Occident and Templiers movements. Others wore badges with the symbol of the Vichy regime which collaborated with Nazi German occupation during World War II. </P>
<P> At the rally, Le Pen denounced both Chirac and Jospin as unpatriotic leftists who had betrayed their country. </P>
<P> But his harshest rhetoric was for frontrunner Chirac who, though a conservative, has kept the National Front at arm's length throughout his political career. </P>
<P> ``Jacques Chirac has betrayed his people, his nation, his faith. He represents the foreign party,'' Le Pen told the crowd. </P>
<P> He told followers to make their own choice for Sunday ``according to your origins, your sympathies or your dislikes.'' </P>
<P> The rally's buoyant mood was dulled when a bright yellow banner proclaiming ``No to racism, no to fascism'' was unfurled from the opera house roof as Le Pen spoke. </P>
<P> An anti-fascist group Ras l'Front (''Fed up with the Front''), took credit for the banner, which was quickly taken down. </P>
<P> Following his third presidential bid at 66, Le Pen showed no sign of tiring in his crusade against immigration, European federalism, creeping Marxism and official corruption. </P>
