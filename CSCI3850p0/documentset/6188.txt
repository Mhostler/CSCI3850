<DATELINE>UMLAZI, South Africa (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Nelson Mandela was escorted from a rally in South Africa's Zulu heartland in an armored car after about 30 shots were fired in and around the stadium where he was speaking Monday. </P>
<P> ``I don't think he himself was scared but lots of shots were fired so we took him away in a Nyala (armored car),'' Maj. Robbie Cooke told Reuters at Durban's Umlazi stadium. </P>
<P> Police said about 30 shots were fired, mostly into the air, during the rally at which Mandela warned he could cut funding to KwaZulu-Natal province if the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party continued to threaten his central government. </P>
<P> Asked whether Mandela was in personal danger, Cooke said: ``I wouldn't say so. If that was the case he would have left sooner. It was his own security personnel's decision for him to leave in a Nyala.'' </P>
<P> An army officer said the president's helicopter had been unable to land near the Umlazi stadium because shots were being fired into the air. </P>
<P> The 76-year-old president was taken to a nearby airport where he boarded a helicopter which took him to his official residence in Durban. </P>
<P> Police said six people were shot and wounded during and after the rally. It was not clear whether they were members of Mandela's ruling African National Congress (ANC) or Inkatha, which holds regional power in the province. </P>
<P> Mandela told the rally, attended by about 20,000 people that his government held KwaZulu-Natal's purse strings. </P>
<P> ``They (Inkatha) should know that it is us that gives them money and they use the money against my government. Should they continue I am going to withdraw that money,'' the president said. </P>
<P> Referring to Inkatha's withdrawal from the Constitutional Assembly over a failed bid for international mediation on constitutional issues, Mandela said: ``They have withdrawn from the Constitutional Assembly. I am not going to ask them to come back.'' </P>
<P> But he said he was prepared to hold constructive talks to end confrontation and violence in the Inkatha-held province, heartland of South Africa's nine-million Zulus. </P>
<P> Thousands of people were killed in KwaZulu-Natal in turf wars between supporters of the ANC and Inkatha during the countdown to the April 1994 democracy elections. </P>
<P> The ANC won control of central government and seven of the regions in the elections, Inkatha and the former ruling white National Party taking power in the other two provinces. </P>
<P> Political violence has fallen off since the polls but fears have been expressed that a call by Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi for his party to resist central government could be translated into violence. </P>
<P> Mandela said he did not want to use force but the government would take action if violence became a destabilising factor. </P>
<P> ``Everyone who breaks the law should know I am angered. Those making violence should know I am in control here,'' he said to loud cheers. </P>
