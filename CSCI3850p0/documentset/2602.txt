<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Britain and Ireland mapped out the next phase of their Northern Ireland peace drive Monday in talks overshadowed by a politcal crisis that could topple the Irish coalition government. </P>
<P> Irish Deputy Premier Dick Spring, at the eye of the storm affecting the government, refused to discuss the likely impact of a coalition collapse on the year-old efforts to achieve peace in the British province. </P>
<P> ``I am not going to comment on that,'' Spring told reporters before starting talks with Britain's Northern Ireland secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew. </P>
<P> Spring, leader of the junior Labor coalition ally, has given Prime Minister Albert Reynolds until Tuesday to explain a dispute surrounding a Northern Irish extradition warrant for a Roman Catholic priest sought in connection with a child sex abuse case or risk bringing down the two-year-old coalition. </P>
<P> Labor wants to know why Irish Attorney General Harry Whelehan failed for seven months to deal with the warrant for the priest, Father Brendan Smyth. </P>
<P> A collapse of the government would seriously slow the pace of the Anglo-Irish push for peace which was launched on December 15 last year with a joint declaration blueprint. </P>
<P> Mayhew declined to comment on the government crisis and said the two ministers would be reviewing the drafting of a so-called framework document setting out the next phase of their plan. He said he was gladdened by an IRA statement at the weekend in which the guerrillas distanced themselves from a killing in an attempted robbery in Northern Ireland. </P>
<P> The IRA in a statement said none of its men was authorised to hold arms and the group stood by its Sept. 1 cease-fire. </P>
<P> The ministers are reviewing the drafting work of officials from both sides who have been seeking to formulate a set of principles in which to frame the next phase of the peace plan. </P>
<P> Officials from both sides say this could involve Britain and Ireland amending their claims to Northern Ireland to reassure the Protestant majority and Catholic minority that they are under no threat. It may also set up cross-border authorities in matters such as trade and tourism. </P>
<P> Prime ministers Reynolds and Britain's John Major hope to unveil the plan around the first anniversary of their Dec. 15 Downing Street agreement. </P>
