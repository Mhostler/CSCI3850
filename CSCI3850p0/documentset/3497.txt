<P>  Rock guitarist Eric Clapton, film producer David Puttnam and a roadsweeper were among 1,000 people honored Friday for their contributions to British life. </P>
<P> The New Year Honors List is studded with names from sport, showbusiness and the arts, like Richard Curtis, the writer of this year's film blockbuster ``Four Weddings and a Funeral'' and Alex Ferguson, manager of the Manchester United football team. </P>
<P> But in line with Prime Minister John Major's drive to break down Britain's class barriers, the list includes hundreds of ordinary people who have dedicated their lives to good causes. </P>
<P> Roadsweeper Richard Currie was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for keeping the roads of the southern English town of Alton clean even after he was hurt in a mugging. </P>
<P> MBEs also went to a woman now in her 90s who kept a war memorial in the western English town of Bristol tidy for 70 years and to another woman who set up a soup kitchen for homeless people in the central English town of Northampton. </P>
<P> The list is only the second under a new system introduced by Major that allows ordinary people to nominate award winners. </P>
<P> The change was intended to put more emphasis on voluntary service and to end the parade of leading military figures and civil servants given awards automatically. </P>
<P> Officials said the public proposed around 4,500 names, of whom some 400 were selected. </P>
<P> The list has a record number of women -- 347 of the 1,080 names. </P>
<P> Clapton became an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) along with actress Joanna Lumley, whose ``Absolutely Fabulous'' comedy series has been sold to 20 countries. </P>
<P> Sport stars honored included European and Commonwealth javelin gold medallist Steve Backley. </P>
