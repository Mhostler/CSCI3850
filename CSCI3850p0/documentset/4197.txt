<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The judge in the O.J. Simpson murder trial Tuesday dismissed an elderly woman from the 12-member jury that will decide the football legend's fate but gave no reason for his action. </P>
<P> After a two-hour delay in the morning's session, Judge Lance Ito announced to the panel that one juror, a 63-year-old white woman, had been removed and would be replaced with an alternate, a 54-year-old black man. </P>
<P> Ito's move followed a week of speculation in the news media over possible misconduct by one or more of the jurors, who have been sequestered for several weeks. </P>
<P> One Los Angeles television station reported last week that maps of Los Angeles and Chicago were found in one of the juror's rooms. Simpson flew to Chicago the night his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman were murdered. </P>
<P> After meeting in his chambers with prosecutors and defense attorneys, Ito gave no hint of the reason for dismissing the juror, except to say he had been dealing with some ``delicate matters.'' </P>
<P> But just before starting the lunch break, Ito issued a stronger-than-usual admonition to jurors not to discuss the case among themselves. </P>
<P> ``When I say not to discuss the case, I mean everything that goes on in the courtroom,'' Ito said, citing such matters as the attorneys' dress and the length of the trial. </P>
<P> As a result of the judge's decision, the jury is now made up of seven women and five men, among them nine blacks, one white, one Hispanic and one native American. </P>
<P> The woman who left the jury was a legal secretary. Her replacement is a postal service operations manager. </P>
<P> Two other jurors were booted off the jury in January, one a man who worked for Hertz rental cars and had met Simpson at a company function, the other a woman who had been a victim of domestic violence. </P>
