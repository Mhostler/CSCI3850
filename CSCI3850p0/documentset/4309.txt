<DATELINE>SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Snipers broke the relative calm Sarajevo Sunday, wounding a 16-year-old boy and a man, and Bosnian Serbs said Muslims shot a child in a Serb suburb. </P>
<P> Doctors and United Nations staff confirmed the first attack. Peacekeepers said they suspected the sniper fire came from Bosnian Serb positions overlooking the besieged city. </P>
<P> The Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA later reported that a child had been seriously wounded by a Muslim small arms attack in the Serb suburb of Cekrcici. No further details were available. </P>
<P> The shootings were the latest violations of a truce which has eased the danger to civilians in the city in recent days, allowing roads and a railway to reopen to civilian traffic. </P>
<P> Doctors in Kosevo hospital said 16-year-old Dzemal Karovic had been shot in the stomach. Mujo Klino, 43, was wounded when he went to help him. </P>
