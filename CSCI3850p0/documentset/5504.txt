<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Ga.(Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Rain is in the forecast for Thursday's opening round, but a softening of Augusta's rock-hard greens is not on everyone's wish list at the Masters. </P>
<P> ``I like conditions firm and fast,'' said Corey Pavin Wednesday. ``So far they are set up well for me.'' </P>
<P> An extended period of dry weather in Augusta left greens and fairways tournament tough during practice and led players to predict that par would be a good round at this year's opening major championship. </P>
<P> Pavin, a candidate for the dubious distinction of 'best player never to win a major championship,' prefers to take his chances on a course where par is a good score. </P>
<P> ``If it rains a lot, you'll see a lot of low scores,'' said Pavin, who figures receptive greens work in favor of less precise players and long hitters who can easily reach the par fives. </P>
<P> Pavin is a member of a seemingly vanishing breed -- Americans with a chance at winning the Masters. </P>
<P> He's finished third, tied for eighth and 11th place over the last three years and so counts as a threat to the European dominance that has accounted for six Masters victories in seven years. </P>
<P> Fred Couples, another American with the ability to wipe away the bad taste of last year's humbling whitewashing of Americans in the majors, was also rooting for no rain. </P>
<P> Couples, still finding his stride since aggravating a back injury earlier this year, said he thought it would be easier for him to match par on a difficult course than to fire a low round in easier conditions. </P>
<P> Pavin said the hard ground at Augusta reminded him of conditions at last month's windy Players Championship, where the inventive shot maker tied for third. </P>
<P> Players Championship winner Lee Janzen, who won the 1993 U.S. Open at Baltusrol, has proven himself formidable in testing conditions. </P>
<P> Janzen, who has not finished better than 30th in three previous Augusta visits, was touting fellow Americans as players to watch. ``I think Corey Pavin is a good one to pick. I think if Freddy (Couples) is feeling healthy he's got to be a pick, and I think Davis's game is very good.'' </P>
<P> Couples was also high on Davis Love, who earned the final berth in the Masters by winning last week in New Orleans. </P>
<P> ``I think Davis Love is going to get his act together this week,'' Couples said. ``He had to beg, borrow and cheat to get in (the Masters) and waited until the last tournament to make it. I think he's on a roll.'' </P>
<P> Love, a perennial disappointment in the majors, is a long hitter with a gentle touch on the greens -- the classic formula for Masters success. But his best result in four trips here is a tie for 25th. </P>
<P> U.S. Open champion Ernie Els of South Africa says American Phil Mickelson should win a major soon, and Couples points out that U.S. money leader Peter Jacobsen is also on a roll. </P>
<P> Still, when pressed to name three top picks to win the Masters, Couples spat out, ``Norman, Price and Faldo.'' </P>
