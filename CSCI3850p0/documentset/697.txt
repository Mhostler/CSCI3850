<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Clinton Wednesday urged businesses that support health care reform to ``to try to fix'' what they thought was wrong with legislation in Congress, as business leaders threatened to give up on reform and attempt to kill pending bills. </P>
<P> Several business groups, including some that have supported Clinton's call for employer-paid health benefits, have been meeting this week to plot their strategy. </P>
<P> They are sending a powerful message to Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, whose bill is currently being debated in the Senate, that if changes are not made they will unite to defeat legislation. </P>
<P> ``Each group favors health-care reform. Our bottom line is that no bill is better than a bad bill,'' said Jim Klein, executive director of the Association of Private Pension and Welfare Plans. </P>
<P> The groups have agreed that Mitchell's compromise bill, although touted by Democratic leaders as a modest, more palatable plan, is unacceptable, Klein said. </P>
<P> ``The decison has already been made that the Mitchell bill is unacceptable and the plug on it in its current form should be pulled,'' said Klein. </P>
<P> The business groups were scheduled to hold further discussions late Wednesday. </P>
<P> Klein said the gatherings were unsusual because normally at this stage in a debate on major legislation, business groups are splitting apart. The opposite is true on health reform, he said. </P>
<P> These groups have been apart and now are regrouping around their dislike for the Mitchell bill and a different plan now pending in the House. </P>
<P> In an interview with reporters, Clinton said those business groups that support health care reform should ``get into this debate with both feet.'' </P>
<P> ``My bottom line is what it has always been. We have to have a system that over a period of time will lead to universal coverage,'' Clinton said. </P>
<P> While business groups attacked the Mitchell bill, it and the House bill sponsored by Representative Richard Gephardt, Democrat of Missouri, won the support of the influential American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), which has 33 million members. </P>
<P> ``Although neither bill is perfect, after careful review we conclude that they provide the foundation for comprehensive health care for all Americans,'' AARP President Eugene Lehrmann told a news conference. ``Now is the time for us to strike. If either bill is defeated, health care reform will be dead for years to come.'' </P>
<P> But business groups want ``both bills changed dramatically'' before they can support them, said Johanna Schneider, a spokeswoman for the influential Business Roundtable, a group that represents 200 leading corporate executives. </P>
<P> She said the roundtable was not ready to pull the plug on health reform and would lobby to change the plan. </P>
<P> While each of the business groups that have been meeting this week has different concerns about the pending legislation, they all feel the bills will increase their cost of providing health insurance to employees, Schneider said. </P>
<P> Klein said the groups are concerned that the proposed tax increases and purchasing alliances in the Mitchell bill will hurt those firms that already provide insurance to their workers and take away their ability to negotiate the best price for insurance. </P>
