<P>  A Palestinian leader on Saturday urged Arab states to stop normalising relations with Israel in retaliation for plans to confiscate land in Jersualem -- an act he described as an Israeli declaration of war. </P>
<P> ``I believe that all the steps that have been taken by Arabs in order to facilitiate relations with Israel, these relations should stop,'' Palestinian negotiator Faisal al-Husseini told reporters as he arrived for an Arab League meeting in Cairo. </P>
<P> ``Israel has been trying to Judaise Jerusalem for many years. But this is a new attempt to seize from us what we have tried to preserve since 1967. This simply means that Israel is declaring a new war on us. I consider this as an official declaration of war,'' he added. </P>
<P> Husseini is in the Palestinian delegation to an emergency Arab foreign ministers meeting on Israel's plans to confiscate 53 hectares (131 acres) in Arab East Jerusalem for Jewish housing. </P>
