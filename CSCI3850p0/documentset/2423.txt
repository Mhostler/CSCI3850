<P>  A Montana prisons official, who caused an uproar by taking a jailed murderer out to dinner at a seafood restaurant, bowed to pressure and resigned Friday, officials said. </P>
<P> Mickey Gamble, an administrator of Montana's Corrections Division, came under fire after it became known that he had taken three women prisoners -- including a convicted murderer serving a life sentence -- out to the Red Lobster restaurant in Billings, Mont., as a reward for good behavior. </P>
<P> ``I made a serious judgement error and there are consequences for such action,'' Gamble wrote in a resignation letter to Republican Gov. Marc Racicot, who announced Gamble's resignation from his $63,000-a-year job. </P>
<P> Racicot said Gamble was given the opportunity to quit after he was told he would be fired. </P>
<P> Hundreds of people had called state offices, demanding Gamble's ouster. </P>
<P> Gamble said he used his own money to pay for the Oct. 20 dinner for the three inmates of the Women's Corrections Center near Billings. </P>
<P> One of the women was Becky Richards, 27, sentenced to life imprisonment last year for the shooting death of her husband. Another is serving a 40-year sentence for attempted murder after slashing the throat of a teen-age girl. </P>
<P> The dinner came to light because one of Richards' high school teachers spotted her in the restaurant. </P>
<P> Gamble said the dinner was a reward to the prisoners for helping other inmates and for telling young people about the realities of prison life. </P>
<P> Critics said he ignored the concerns of crime victims by taking the women out in public. </P>
<P> ``You don't take a convicted murderer out to lunch,'' said Bob Pavlovich, a Democratic state legislator. </P>
