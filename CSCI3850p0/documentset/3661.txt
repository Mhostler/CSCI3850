<DATELINE>GUANTANAMO BAY NAVAL BASE, Cuba (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Another 500 Haitian refugees were sent home against their wishes Monday, and U.S. officials said that most of the nearly 3,000 remaining Haitians held at a U.S. refugee camp could be back in their homeland within one week. </P>
<P> In Port-au-Prince, U.S. embassy spokesman Stanley Schrager said that with at least two boatloads of refugees returning to Haiti each day the refugee camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, should be cleared by next week. </P>
<P> ``Very early next week we should have them all back,'' Schrager said. </P>
<P> On Monday, the U.S. Coast Guard repatriated 500 Haitian refugees from the Guantanamo naval base aboard two ships. All were being repatriated involuntarily. </P>
<P> U.S. military spokesman Maj. Rick Thomas said the Haitians had left without violence but some had resisted. </P>
<P> ``We have had to pull some people out of their tents, `` he said. </P>
<P> The U.S. military plans to send between 300 and 500 Haitian refugees back to their homeland each day until the camp is emptied. The U.S. government opened the camp when tens of thousands of Haitians fled their homeland, fearing torture or political violence from a military-backed government. </P>
<P> With the peaceful intervention of a multinational military force.democratically-elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was restored to power last Oct. 15. </P>
<P> On Saturday some refugees physically resisted returning to their homeland, but Monday's groups cooperated fully. Still, some hid their faces from the waiting Bangladeshi and American soldiers and many were stony-faced as they stepped ashore. </P>
<P> All the refugees were given about $15 and a small Red Cross package containing food and other small items such as detergent before being dropped off at the local bus station. </P>
<P> About 18,000 Haitians, including those on Monday, have been repatriated from Guantanamo since Haitian refugee camps opened at the base in June. </P>
<P> Only about 2,700 are left from a peak of over 21,000 in August. </P>
<P> A handful of Haitian refugees accepted an offer from the U.S. government to return voluntarily to Haiti with the promise of a job and a payment of $80. </P>
<P> But the huge number who refused the offer are being interviewed by a team of U.S. Immigraton and Naturalization Service officials to determine if their fears of persecution in Haiti justify their staying at the base. </P>
<P> By Monday, only 74 out of more than 900 interviewed had been given permission to stay. </P>
<P> The only exception to the U.S. policy will be about 240 Haitians age 17 and under who are at the base without adult relatives, and 44 refugees -- most with tuberculosis or carrying the AIDS virus -- who were cleared to enter the United States but have not yet received visas. </P>
<P> There are also about 200 Haitians with tuberculosis who will return home after they complete six months of drug treatment. </P>
<P> The United Nations Human Rights Commission is determining whether the unaccompanied children will be returned to Haiti or will be sent to live with relatives in the United States. </P>
