<P>  Senegal has sent crack troops to the separatist Casamance region to search for two French couples missing since April 6, officials said Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``Unforunately there's no news of the missing French people,'' French consul Jean Yves Lemerlu said by telephone from the provincial capital Ziguinchor. </P>
<P> The government said last week it was baffled by their disappearance because tight security in the southern province, where an 18-month-old cease-fire between the government and rebels has collapsed since January, made it very safe for tourists. </P>
<P> Catherine and Claude Cave, and Jean-Paul and Martine Gagnaire from Saint-Etienne in central France have not been seen since April 6, when they set off in a hired four-wheel drive car for a day trip to Cap Skiring on the coast. </P>
<P> Officials said troops were searching the Lower Casamance national park near the border with Guinea Bissau by vehicle and on foot. </P>
<P> Diacoumane Senghor, a leader of the Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance (MFDC) said his rebels were in no way involved in the tourists' disappearance, which he described as an attempt by government forces to discredit the MFDC. </P>
<P> An official in Ziguinchor said he suspected it was a publicity stunt by the rebels. ``We think this disappearance is a plot to publicize the Casamance problem,'' he said. </P>
<P> The MFDC took up arms in 1982, accusing the government of neglecting the tourism province, which is virtually cut off from the rest of Senegal by English-speaking Gambia and produces most of the country's rice. </P>
