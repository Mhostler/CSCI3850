<P>  The Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday on whether an employer charged with illegally firing a worker is protected from a discrimination lawsuit if it later discovers another lawful reason for the dismissal. </P>
<P> In a case with important implications for the workplace, the high court also considered what remedy would be appropriate if the employer was found to have discriminated. </P>
<P> A Justice Department lawyer said during the arguments that the employer still should be held liable for discriminatory conduct, even if it later discovers another reason that would have justified the firing. </P>
<P> A Supreme Court ruling is due by the middle of next year. </P>
<P> The case involved Christine McKennon, who was 62 when she was fired in 1990 as a secretary at the Nashville Banner newspaper after working there 39 years. </P>
<P> She sued, claiming age discrimination. During the litigation, the company learned she had improperly removed confidential documents on the firm's finances and severance policy. </P>
<P> A federal appeals court ruled that the lawsuit must be dismissed because McKennon's misconduct would have resulted in her firing anyway. </P>
<P> But Michael Terry, representing McKennon, urged the justices to overturn the ruling, arguing that it contradicts the holdings of the courts and federal agencies for the past 30 years. </P>
<P> ``Wrongdoing by an employee does not remove that employee from the protections'' of the federal civil rights laws barring discrimination based on age, race or sex, he said. </P>
<P> Terry acknowledged that the employee would be entitled only to back pay, not reinstatement. ``Back pay is critical,'' he said. ``It is the backbone (of the law).'' </P>
<P> Justice Department lawyer Irving Gornstein said the key question was the employer's motivation at the time of the dismissal. </P>
<P> Justice Antonin Scalia asked about an employee who it later turned out had been engaged in criminal behavior. </P>
<P> Gornstein said the employee could be prosecuted, but the criminal acts were a separate issue that should not bar the claims for discriminatory treatment. </P>
<P> R. Eddie Wayland, an attorney for the newspaper, ran into a number of tough questions over his view that the misconduct requires dismissal of the lawsuit. </P>
<P> Scalia asked whether the suit would have to be dismissed if the company later discovered the employee was just incompetent. Wayland said that might well happen. </P>
<P> Justice Sandra Day O'Connor asked if Congress in adopting the law did not want firings based on discrimination. ``It also is a goal of the statute not to reward bad employees,'' Wayland said. </P>
<P> Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said Wayland's position ``seems just destructive of the claim Congress set up when it passed these anti-discrimination laws.'' </P>
<P> Wayland said discovery of the misconduct was a ``superceding event'' that takes precedence over the discrimination claim. ''The employee has no one to blame but themself,'' he said. ''On-the-job misconduct is relevant.'' </P>
