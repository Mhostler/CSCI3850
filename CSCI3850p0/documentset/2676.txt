<P>  The Security Council Thursday warned warring parties around Bihac to stop fighting, saying NATO aircraft might be sent in to counter any attacks on the Bosnian town or on Bangladeshi peacekeepers. </P>
<P> U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright, in her role as the current council president, told reporters that members ''expressed grave concern at the failure of the parties to stop hostile action'' and were particularly alarmed at cross-border firing by rebel Serbs in Croatia in the Krajina area. </P>
<P> A spokesman for the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in the Balkans said Thursday in Zabreb that shelling or missile attacks on U.N. personnel or civilians in Bihac town could prompt NATO air power. </P>
<P> ``Members noted UNPROFOR had warned that NATO close air support might be called in under authority given by existing Security Council resolutions,'' Albright said. </P>
<P> She said the council expected at least an oral report Friday from Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's office on what the U.N. proposes to ``stabilize the situation.'' </P>
<P> ``The council was also concerned particularly at the position of UNPROFOR personnel, the threat hostilities posed to their safety and at the restrictions imposed by the so-called Krajina Serbs on their freedom of movement and supplies that they need,'' Albright said. </P>
<P> Some 1,300 Bangladeshi peacekeepers in the Bihac pocket have been unable to get food, medicine or reinforcements and have been twice targeted by missiles fired by Bosnian Serbs. Albright said they were not being threatened at this time but only ``one in five Bangladeshis seems to have a rifle'' and that their supplies would run out in about a week. </P>
<P> Albright also told the council in closed consultations that Croatia had informed her Zagreb now had agreed to the use of Croatian air space for close air support, diplomats said. </P>
<P> But the envoys said there were still technical problems on air corridors as well as some political demands, such as empowering Zagreb to suspend NATO flights over its territory and call them in again whenever it wished. </P>
<P> Albright also confirmed that the United States was pushing within NATO for the Bihac pocket to be made an exclusion zone. This would allow the use of allied air power to prevent Serb forces from overrunning the enclave. </P>
<P> ``We are pursuing that along with other ways of trying to deal with the situation,'' she said. ``We do consider this as being very serious and we will pursue action at NATO.'' </P>
<P> ``We are concerned about the possibility of this spinning out of control.'' </P>
<P> A contingent of Dutch peacekeepers is to go to Bihac but it is not certain if Bosnian Serbs will let them through to augment 1,300 Bangladeshi troops there now. </P>
<P> Bosnia's ambassador Muhamed Sacirbey questioned whether there was a will to defend the Bihac pocket and the Bangladeshi forces there and again attacked the British-led U.N. command in Sarajevo, headed by General Sir Michael Rose. </P>
<P> ``We have to, of course, wonder if the response of the UNPROFOR commanders in Sarajevo would be different if in fact the UNPROFOR forces in Bihac were Europeans,'' he said. </P>
