<P>  United We Stand America, the grassroots political group formed by Texas billionaire Ross Perot, said Republican warnings that a third party would aid President Clinton were ``fear tactics.'' </P>
<P> ``UWSA members will not support or vote for a Republican out of fear that Bill Clinton will win re-election,'' the group's executive director, Russell Verney, said in a statement released late Monday. </P>
<P> ``USWA members will judge candidates based on their ethics, integrity and incorruptibility. Candidates who pass the personal qualifications will then be judged on their past performance in elected positions,'' he said. </P>
<P> Verney was responding to House Speaker Newt Gingrich's warning Sunday that ``The only person helped by a third party is President Clinton and the liberal Democrats.'' </P>
<P> United We Stand America has been holding meetings around the country to poll its members on whether a third party should be formed. The group has noted that several issues it focused on, including term limits and a balanced budget, have failed to pass Congress. </P>
