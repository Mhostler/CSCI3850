<P>  Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari demanded Friday that next month's key presidential and legislative elections be fraud-free. </P>
<P> Salinas, whose own victory in 1988 was marred by massive fraud allegations, told all the country's state governors and local mayors that they were ``obliged to be impartial'' and were responsible for guaranteeing a clean vote on August 21 . </P>
<P> ``The commitment is serious, decided and it will be exemplary. And I am demanding from each of you that you abide by the law and democracy,'' Salinas told his guests at a meeting in the presidential residence of Los Pinos. </P>
<P> ``We do not want to see in democracy any particular or predetermined result,'' he said. </P>
<P> Salinas' ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) has held power without break since 1929 and allegedly rigged votes on many occasions to maintain its grip on all levels of government. </P>
<P> More than 30,000 observers, including some foreigners, will be on hand to guard against fraud on election day. </P>
<P> Leftist opposition leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas insists the voting register is plagued with errors and accuses electoral authorities of lacking the will to guarantee a fair vote, but Salinas says the results will be respected. </P>
<P> ``Whoever wins the contest ... no matter what party he comes from, will be who assumes the presidency of the republic on December 1,'' Salinas said Friday. </P>
<P> The PRI's presidential candidate, Ernesto Zedillo, leads opinion polls but faces strong challenges from both Cardenas and conservative National Action Party candidate Diego Fernandez de Cevallos. </P>
