<P>  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin led several of his cabinet ministers into Israel's Lebanon security zone Thursday where he said a peace deal could be negotiated in nine months. </P>
<P> ``If the government of Lebanon will be guided only by serving the national interests of Lebanon, taking into account the combination of the population of Lebanon, I believe that it will be within nine months that we can achieve peace between Lebanon and Israel,'' Rabin told reporters. </P>
<P> Three-year peace talks with Lebanon and Syria, the main foreign power broker in Lebanon, have stalled, and Israel still occupies the border security zone it set up in 1985 to guard against attacks on the northern Israeli border. </P>
<P> Rabin said the Lebanese government must learn to cope with those he called the ``enemies of peace'' such as the Iranian-backed Hizbollah, a Muslim militant group in Lebanon which attacks Israeli targets. </P>
<P> Israeli army radio said Rabin and his ministers, under a heavy mantle of security, met men from the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army militia in Marjayoun, inspected strongholds in the security zone and held talks with senior commanders and field officers and troops. </P>
<P> It said Israeli soldiers at an outpost discussed their conditions, including the burdens the army places on them. Some 1,000 Israeli troops and 3,000 SLA men patrol the zone, set up when Israel pulled out its 1982 Lebanon invasion force. </P>
