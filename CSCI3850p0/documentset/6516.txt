<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Chelsi Smith of the United States won the 1995 Miss Universe crown Saturday, becoming the third American since 1980 to take the coveted title. </P>
<P> The 21-year-old Texan is the first African-American to win the pageant, which was held in an African nation for the first time in its forty-three-year history. </P>
<P> The five-foot-eight-inch student beat competitors from 81 other countries to win $200,000 and a baby elephant. </P>
<P> Wearing a tight-fitting, low-cut red ball gown, Smith looked visibly stunned when she was declared the universe's most beautiful woman. </P>
<P> Her eyes brimmed with tears as she accepted the rhinestone crown from Miss Universe 1994, India's Sushmita Sen and accepted congratulations from runner-up Mantreet Brar, also from India. Canada's Lana Buchberger was third. </P>
<P> Competition among the three was close. </P>
<P> In the main event, held in the Namibian capital of Windhoek, Smith scored highly in the swimwear and interview categories to pocket more than $200,000 in cash and prizes that go with the title. </P>
<P> She also wins a baby elephant from Namibia, but the organisers said that the animal would stay in the country's protected Ombego Safari Ranch. </P>
<P> Smith told told a news conference that she felt a crowning in Africa was significant coming on the heels of the end of apartheid in neighbouring South Africa and the achievement of independence in Namibia in 1990. </P>
<P> ``There was a reason for my being in Africa ... particularly, given the end of apartheid in South Africa and Namibia becoming a republic,'' she said. </P>
<P> She says during her reign she hopes to work with children to deal with issues of racism and to help disadvantaged people overcome emotional difficulties. </P>
<P> Smith will spend her year-long reign traveling throughout the world and appearing at commercial and civic events on behalf of the pageant's producers, Miss Universe, a division of Madison Square Garden, and its sponsors. </P>
