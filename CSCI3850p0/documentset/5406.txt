<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, April 3 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Christian nuns were beaten up inside their convent near New Delhi and four were hurt seriously in an apparent attempt to halt their work, newspapers said on Monday. </P>
<P> The papers said four people entered the convent in the town of Ghaziabad and beat up the nuns and their maid with sticks and iron rods. </P>
<P> They said four nuns suffered multiple head fractures. </P>
<P> ``The miscreants broke down the two sliding doors of the convent and first attacked the maidservant,'' Father Xavier Vadakkekara of the Maria Sadan Convent was quoted as saying by the Asian Age newspaper. </P>
<P> Mission members were quoted as saying the attack was apparently aimed at dissuading the nuns from working in the city. </P>
<P> ``They did not want to rob the house, their one and only motive was to kill us,'' the Pioneer newspaper quoted Sister Cicil, one of the attacked nuns, as saying. </P>
<P> The convent in Ghaziabad, just outside New Delhi, houses the north India headquarters of the Congregation of the Franciscan Sisters of St. Mary of Angels, an international missionary group. </P>
<P> Papers said police suspected a criminal tribe behind the attack. No arrests have been made, they said. </P>
<P> In 1990, two nuns were raped at a convent in the nearby town of Gajaraula town. </P>
