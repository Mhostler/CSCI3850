<P>  Pete Sampras is committed to defending his U.S. Open tennis championship title and the world's number one player will test out his ailing left ankle by playing doubles at next week's Hamlet Cup tournament, it was announced Friday. </P>
<P> ``The thought hasn't crossed my mind not to play,'' Sampras said of the U.S. Open which starts August 29 at the National Tennis Center. </P>
<P> ``The Open is the last Grand Slam of the year and I will do everthing I can to play. I will play the Open regardless, even if it hurts a little bit, I will have to get through,'' Sampras said of the possibility of a flare-up during the two-week tournament of the tendinitis that has sidelined him for the past five weeks. </P>
<P> Sampras decided to play doubles with his U.S. Davis Cup teammate Richey Reneberg to get some needed match competition without physically extending himself and risking further injury. </P>
<P> ``I haven't practiced too much in the past couple of weeks and I wouldn't be ready to play singles,'' Samprs said of taking a wild-card entry into the #313,750 tournament that features world number two Goran Ivanisevic and number four Stefan Edberg. ``I just needed to start serving and moving around some on the court and to get used to the pace of the ball from the other guys. </P>
<P> ``I feel the ankle is getting better, but it is not 100 percent. Doubles was the safest thing to do.'' </P>
<P> Sampras has his own doubts whether he can add the U.S. Open crown to the Australian Open and Wimbledon titles the 23-year-old has already won this year after beind idled for so long. </P>
<P> ``My expectations are up in the air,'' said Sampras by telephone from his Tampa, Fla., home. ``Obviously this is not the kind of preparation that I wanted going in the Open, but you have to make the best of it.'' </P>
<P> A half a dozen players, including Edberg, Boris Becker, Michael Stich and Michael Chang, could win, according to Sampras, who wouldn't completely rule out his own chances of repeating as champion. </P>
<P> ``When I won my first Wimbledon I didn't practice too much before the tournament and I got away with it,'' Sampras said of of shoulder injury prior to the 1993 Wimbledon fortnight. </P>
<P> Sampras has been out since playing against the Netherlands in a Davis Cup quarterfinal match. He has pulled out of tournaments in Washington, Toronto, Cincinnati and this week's ATP Tour stop in Indianapolis. </P>
<P> ``It's been a slow healing process,'' Sampras said of his treatment that has included ultrasound and anti-inflammatory pills. ``Sitting there and watching the other guys play made me realize how much I missed the game. I came to the conclusion that I had to play through it.'' </P>
