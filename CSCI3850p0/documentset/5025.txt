<DATELINE>HONG KONG (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A record low U.S. dollar sparked investor uncertainty and pared stocks throughout much of Asia Monday, brokers said. </P>
<P> In Tokyo, the yen's strength against the dollar depressed stocks, and the 225-share Nikkei average ended 121.27 points, or 0.75 percent, lower at 16,129.96 after briefly falling below a psychological support level of 16,000 in morning trade. </P>
<P> The dollar sank to a record low of 88.65 yen in early Asian trade before recovering to 89.45 in Tokyo in the afternoon on buying by the Bank of Japan, dealers said. </P>
<P> ``Worries about further appreciation of the yen against the dollar sent almost all individuals, corporate investors and dealers to the sidelines this afternoon ahead of the holiday tomorrow,'' a broker said. </P>
<P> Japanese financial markets will be closed Tuesday for a public holiday. </P>
<P> ``It is natural people don't want to buy stocks at a time when it is uncertain what financial policies the government will take, how currencies and interest rates will move,'' said Manji Ueda, general manager at Nomura Securities. </P>
<P> The Nikkei fell to an intra-day low of 15,980.39 some 20 minutes after the opening, falling below 16,000 for the first time since November 29, 1993. </P>
<P> Australian shares, pressured from the open by a falling Australian dollar and a weaker gold price, finished lower. </P>
<P> The All Ordinaries index ended 16.70 points, or 0.87 percent lower at 1904.50, just above its intraday low of 1902.30. </P>
<P> Dealers said the domestic currency's steep drop gave investors an excuse to take profits. </P>
<P> The Australian dollar has fallen more than one U.S. cent since Friday's close here. </P>
<P> Hong Kong stocks closed moderately higher, bolstered by a jump in index futures, brokers said. </P>
<P> The blue-chip Hang Seng Index ended 59.72 points, or 0.70 percent, up to 8,594.43. </P>
<P> ``The market was directionless overall and just consolidating,'' said Priscilla Ng, a senior sales manager at OCBC Securities. </P>
<P> ``It largely followed the movement of index futures, which jumped to a premium in late trade, so the cash market followed.'' </P>
<P> Spot March index futures climbed 114 points to end at 8,649, a hefty premium to the cash market, and April jumped 110 to 8,645 on combined volume of 11,540 lots, initial data showed. </P>
<P> In Hong Kong, gold tumbled on early Japanese selling in quiet trade. Bullion slid to $382.50 an ounce from New York's $383.20 close Friday. </P>
<P> North Sea Brent crude oil prices jumped 10 to 15 cents per barrel in Asia after Sunday talks between the Kuwaiti government and a trade union failed to resolve a strike by oil production and export workers. </P>
<P> By midafternoon in Singapore, North Sea Brent crude was bid around $16.73 per barrel with no firm offers, oil traders said. </P>
