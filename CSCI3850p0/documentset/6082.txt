<DATELINE>BANGKOK, April 27 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Angry Thai officials said on Thursday Burma must explain repeated violations of Thai territory and attacks on refugees in Thailand by its troops, and give assurances that such activities will stop. </P>
<P> Burmese troops and their allies have staged a series of attacks against refugee camps in Thailand housing Karen minority people from Burma. </P>
<P> ``The prime minister is giving high priority to this issue because the government sees it as a violation of our sovereignty,'' Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan told reporters. </P>
<P> ``It is a serious breach and unacceptable. They need to explain this to us and assure us that this sort of incident will not occur again,'' he said. </P>
<P> Surin said Thailand would lodge an official complaint with Burma against the most recent spate of attacks, including a raid on a refugee camp in Thailand on Tuesday night in which a combined force of Burmese troops and renegade Karen guerrillas allied to government forces set fire to some 300 buildings. </P>
<P> The attack on the camp was the latest in a series of such raids over recent months but relief workers and Karen guerrilla officials say the frequency of the attacks has picked up since April 19. </P>
<P> An unknown number of refugees have been seized and forced back into government-controlled parts of Burma. </P>
<P> In addition, several people have been killed in clashes between the raiders and Karen volunteers guarding the camps, Karen guerrilla sources said. </P>
<P> Senior Thai army officials were ``furious'' about the incursions and said the Thai military presence on the border would be beefed up, the Nation newspaper reported on Thursday. </P>
<P> Thai Army commander General Wimol Wongwanich, who visited the border on Wednesday, said the Karen living in a string of camps along the frontier might have to be moved to a safer location deeper in Thailand, the paper reported. </P>
<P> Relief workers say Burmese troops and members of the allied Karen splinter faction have launched a campaign of terror against the 70,000 Karen refugees in Thailand in an effort to force them back into government-controlled parts of Burma, which would deprive the guerrilla force of its civilian support base. </P>
<P> Burma's military government has said in the past that any intrusions were by members of the breakaway Karen rebel group, the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army (DKBA), not government troops. </P>
<P> The DKBA was formed late last year after several hundred Karen fighters mutinied against the main Karen guerrilla force and joined Burmese government troops. </P>
<P> The main force Karen National Union guerrilla group has been fighting Rangoon for greater autonomy since 1949, one year after Burma gained independence from Britain. </P>
