<P>  Argentina's Radical party hopeful in May's presidential election left the door wide open Friday to an alliance with leftist coalition FREPASO against President Carlos Menem if the vote goes to a second round. </P>
<P> With the latest polls giving Menem 41-43 percent compared to about 20 percent at most for the Radicals and FREPASO, Menem looks set to secure a second term in power at the first round, for which he needs 40 percent with a 10-point lead. </P>
<P> But if the contest does go to a second round -- and Menem's running-mate Carlos Ruckauf warned Friday against taking victory for granted -- a Radical-FREPASO joint front would give the Peronist president a good run for his money. </P>
<P> Beleaguered Radical candidate Horacio Massaccesi, fighting to restore his credibility after his campaign chief scored an own-goal this week by saying Menem looks unbeatable, ruled out an alliance for the first round of voting. </P>
<P> But he went on to stress the common concerns for Radicals and FREPASO -- unemployment, the provinces' blighted finances and the economy's over-dependency on foreign capital. </P>
<P> ``These are things that give voters for both the Radicals and FREPASO common ground,'' he told reporters, adding that the possibility of a common front against Menem ``will be decided ...by the electoral circumstances after the first round.'' </P>
<P> FREPASO, a young alliance of Socialists and Christian Democrats, has so far said it would only consider joining forces with the Radicals if their candidates stand down. </P>
<P> But FREPASO has had its mind on primaries Sunday that will choose between Peronist refugee deputy Carlos ``Chacho'' Alvarez and senator Jos Octavio Bordn for presidential candidate. The loser will join the race for vice president. </P>
<P> Otherwise, FREPASO's policy ideas seem little different from the Radicals, concentrating on the social cost of Menem's success in taming hyperinflation and fueling growth. </P>
<P> Neither party would reverse the widespread privatizations or tinker with peso-dollar parity, but blame Menem and Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo for record 12.2 percent unemployment and discontent in the provinces, including Ro Negro, governed by Massaccesi, where civil servants have taken to the streets. </P>
