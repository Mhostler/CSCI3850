<P>  A U.N. briefing paper on human rights abuses prepared for Jimmy Carter's peace mission catalogues systematic intimidation, incarceration and expulsion of Muslims and Croats this year by Bosnian Serbs. </P>
<P> The former president stunned foreign reporters in the Serbs' self-styled capital of Pale when he told Serb leader Radovan Karadzic: ``I can't dispute your statement that (the American people) have primarily heard one side of the story.'' </P>
<P> His assertion Monday was quickly countered by White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers who said in Washington: ``The Bosnian Serbs are the aggressors in this war. I think the American people have had an opportunity to see what's happening on the ground there and to see both sides of the story.'' </P>
<P> The briefing paper, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters, details the Serbs' forcible eviction of 6,000 women, children and elderly from the Bjeljina area of eastern Bosnia in an effort to create ethnically ``pure'' territory. </P>
<P> ``These expulsion were characterized by beatings, robbery of all material possessions, money and documents, and threat to life and personal integrity,'' the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees briefing paper said. </P>
<P> ``Some women were threatened with forcible internal examinations and physical mutilation if found to be hiding money or valuables on their person.'' </P>
<P> The former president is in Bosnia on a personal peace mission launched at the request of separatist Serbs. </P>
<P> Carter mediated international disputes in North Korea and Haiti earlier this year, but critics warn he runs a risk of failure in the Balkans, where political dissembling and intrigue have been elevated to art forms. </P>
<P> In addition to the 6,000 forced expulsions around Bjeljina in 1994 the briefing paper mentioned another 6,660 Muslims and Croats coerced from their homes in northern Bosnia. </P>
<P> ``Entire villages have been so terrorized that the village has been abandoned,'' the briefing paper said. </P>
<P> Minority Muslims and Croats have been stripped of their jobs, pensions and health insurance and in many instances forced to work in degrading and demeaning conditions for no pay, the document told Carter. </P>
<P> ``Minority males are forced into fulfilling front-line working obligations digging trenches or carrying corpses,'' the paper said. </P>
<P> ``Professionals are forced to fulfil working obligations such as cleaning streets, digging graves, working in logging camps and waist-deep in freezing water in fishing industries.'' </P>
<P> All Bosnian factions have been charged with serious human rights abuses at one time or another in the 32-month-old war, but Serb excesses have been singled out by international agencies as systematic and centrally controlled. </P>
<P> Confirmed reports of Serb death and rape camps in 1992 led to the creation of the first international war crimes tribunal since the post-World War II trials in Germany and Japan. </P>
