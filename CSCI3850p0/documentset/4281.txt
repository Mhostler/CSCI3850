<P>  Andre Agassi is hot on the trail of Pete Sampras but keeping his cool about the prospects of leapfrogging his compatriot into the No. 1 spot in world rankings. </P>
<P> Agassi, winner of the last two Grand Slam tournaments including last month's Australian Open title victory over Sampras, is continuing his winning run here and could grab the the top spot as early as April. </P>
<P> But second-ranked Agassi says he is not about to turn the pursuit into an obsession. </P>
<P> ``What's more fun than being No. 1 is winning the matches,'' Agassi said. ``Whether you're ranked No. 1 or No. 2, you don't feel good about yourself if you don't win the matches,'' said Agassi, whose victory over German Marc Goellner Thursday night put him into the quarterfinals here. </P>
<P> ``No. 1 is an accomplishment I'd be proud of but I've got to focus on every match.'' </P>
<P> Agassi's ranking dipped to 32 a year ago after battling injury but he has been on target since. His recent run has produced victories in 31 of his last 33 matches with Brian MacPhie his next likely victim in the San Jose Open. </P>
<P> ``The only pressure I feel is the level of expectation I put on myself and that's a healthy one,'' Agassi said. </P>
<P> ``I really allow myself to enjoy what I'm doing and the only person I'm fighting is the one on the other side of the net which is a good change. I used to fight myself.'' </P>
<P> Agassi said conquering adversity has taught him that success is worth fighting for. </P>
<P> ``I've had a few ups and downs and I've definitely experienced the extremes of both,'' Agassi said. ``It's nice now to be a lot more consistent. I can appreciate and enjoy the good times and yet the losses don't devastate me.'' </P>
<P> The harmony in both his professional and his off-court life has come about, Agassi says, through hard work. </P>
<P> ``I've emphasized striving on a personal level as well as a professional level my whole life,'' Agassi said. ``I can't live without it.'' </P>
