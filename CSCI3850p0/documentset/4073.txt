<DATELINE>LONDON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Ridley Scott, director of ``Alien'' and ``Blade Runner,'' and his brother Tony, who made ``Top Gun'' and ``Beverley Hills Cop II,'' bought the legendary Shepperton film studios Wednesday for $19.11 million and promised to attract blockbuster movies. </P>
<P> The British brothers said they wanted to transform Shepperton into a top world studio. </P>
<P> This will be a major boost to Britain's flagging film industry. In its heyday, Shepperton produced huge international hits like ``Oliver'' and ``The Guns of Navarone.'' A more recent success was ``Four Weddings and a Funeral.'' </P>
<P> Top British film directors and stars, frustrated by the lack of opportunities at home, have migrated to Hollywood. British actors and actresses like Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson have scooped coveted Oscars. </P>
<P> The Scott brothers said they planned to spend about $15.93 million over the next five years expanding facilities at Shepperton. They would actively promote Shepperton in both the United States and Europe. </P>
<P> The investment is led by Candover Partners Limited, a British company buyout specialist, along with the Scotts, Intermedia/Film Equities Inc of Beverly Hills and debt finance from Barclays Bank, a press statement said. </P>
<P> Intermedia spokesman Nigel Sinclair said: ``This is a cutting edge deal: British filmmakers who have achieved top success in Hollywood are bringing their expertise back to the UK's most venerable studio.'' </P>
