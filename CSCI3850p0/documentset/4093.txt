<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  After weeks of contentious debate, a bipartisan House voted Wednesday to curb Washington's practice of imposing expensive programs on the states without supplying the money to pay for them. </P>
<P> The change was long sought by state and local governments, and Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., hailed it as a ``significant achievement'' in the Republican effort to lift burdens on states. </P>
<P> The vote of 360 to 74 allows House Republicans to check off another item in their party's ``Contract with America'' legislative program for the first 100 days of the session. </P>
<P> The legislation requires Congress to either send states a check to pay for any new programs costing over $50 million, or take a separate vote to require states to pick up the tab without federal help. </P>
<P> ``We're not saying an unfunded mandate cannot be imposed on state and local governments,'' but the cost must be accounted for, said Republican David Dreier of California. </P>
<P> While many Democrats, including President Clinton, generally agree onerous financial burdens have been placed on state and local governments, many charged during debate that the unfunded mandates bill was being pushed through too quickly simply to meet the Republicans' speedy agenda. </P>
<P> They were also worried it would limit their ability to pass new laws dealing with health and safety. Major environmental rules are up for renewal this year. </P>
<P> Rep. John Dingell of Michigan, one of the most powerful Democrats until his party lost the majority last November, said Congress was acting ``carelessly'' in its speed on the Republican agenda.  ``As the debate concludes, it is becoming painfully clear that this House is responding not to the needs of the country but to the need of doing a bunch of things in a hundred days,'' Dingell said. </P>
<P> A similar bill passed the Senate last week with bipartisan support. The two must be reconciled before a final bill can go to the White House for signature into law. </P>
<P> The measure moving through Congress will apply only to future mandates. The costliest present mandates -- clean water and clean air laws, cleanup of toxic wastes, labor rules and protections for the disabled -- would not be lifted. </P>
<P> But opponents worried that it was the first step toward unraveling decades of laws passed to protect the environment and public health and could prevent passage of any new laws dealing with health and safety. </P>
<P> ``While Congress should carefully scrutinize any unfunded mandate, we must not totally hamstring our ability to pass laws that need to be passed. Unfortunately the bill as drafted may do just that,'' said Rep. Cardiss Collins, D-Ill. </P>
<P> House Government Reform and Oversight Committee Chairman William Clinger, R-Pa., acknowledged as much. ``What we have here is the first cut,'' he told the House. In the Senate, John Glenn, D-Ohio, said the next step will be to take a look at the costs of existing mandates. </P>
<P> For years states have complained bitterly to Congress that they were being forced to bankroll billions of dollars in programs and regulations imposed by Washington. Many complained that these were backdoor federal income taxes. </P>
<P> California estimated unfunded mandates cost the state $7.7 billion last year. </P>
<P> The last straw for many states was the motor voter bill, which required them to set up voter registration booths in every motor vehicle registration office. The federal government has three states which have refused to comply with the law, and 13 states have sued Washington over it. </P>
<P> The Congressional Budget Office would be in charge of estimating the cost of the mandates. The office would have to analyze the impact on business of mandates passed by Congress. </P>
