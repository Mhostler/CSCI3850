<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Hungary's president and prime minister, enemies during their country's 1956 uprising, stood shoulder to shoulder Sunday to mark the anniversary of the bloody revolt against communist rule. </P>
<P> President Arpad Goncz, once sentenced to death for joining the uprising that was smashed by Soviet tanks, and Prime Minister Gyula Horn, who once served in the militia that helped restore communist control, together laid a wreath at the cemetery where prominent victims of the revolt now lie. </P>
<P> Calls at the ceremony for past divisions to be set aside clearly rankled some and they expressed bitterness at the presence of pro-Moscow communists at the cemetery. </P>
<P> Goncz was flanked by Zoltan Gal, like Horn an official from the reform communist government ousted in 1990 who made the political evolution to social democrat and returned to power after a four-year hiatus of conservative rule. </P>
<P> Voters fed up with hardship during Hungary's transition to a market economy and disenchanted with the previous center-right government gave the revamped Socialists a parliamentary majority in May. </P>
<P> On a crisp autumn day, Gal, parilament speaker, urged Hungarians to strive for reconciliation and unity, saying martyrs of the 1956 uprising would not have wanted the country to remain divided by the past. </P>
<P> Horn has said he only guarded bridges and other key installations as a member of the militia that helped mop up resistance after Soviet tanks crushed the revolt. It was the second time he had placed a wreath at the plot. </P>
<P> At a ceremony in June, he and Erzsebet Nagy, daughter of Imre Nagy, the prime minister during the uprising and a prominent symbol of Hungarian resistance, paid their respects on the 36th anniversary of Nagy's execution at the hands of pro-Moscow communists. </P>
