<P>  Former Beatle Paul McCartney said Wednesday the three surviving members of the legendary rock group have secretly recorded new songs to be released at the end of 1995. </P>
<P> The new tracks which McCartney recorded with George Harrison and Ringo Starr in a London studio will be released along with their 10-hour TV documentary ``The Beatles Anthology.'' </P>
<P> McCartney's announcement was read for him at a New York press conference launching a talent drive for the Liverpool Institute for the Performing Arts, a school for talented youths in his hometown that he helped establish. </P>
<P> ``I'm sorry I can't be there with you but I've got the best possible excuse -- I'm working in the studio on a couple of tracks from a 60s beat group you may have heard of, The Beatles,'' McCartney said in the message, issued in London and read in New York by the school's chief executive Mark Featherstone-Witty. </P>
<P> ``These tracks will be released at the end of this year as a couple of cherries on the cake of The Beatles Anthology.'' </P>
<P> The three remaining Beatles recorded an unfinished John Lennon song, ``Free As a Bird,'' using the dead singer's voice last year. Until McCartney's announcement it was thought to be the only new Beatle track. </P>
<P> Lennon, who wrote many of the group's most popular songs with McCartney, was killed by a crazed fan in New York City in December 1980. </P>
<P> The Liverpool institute is holding auditions in New York for talented young dancers, musicians and singers and future managers. McCartney's brainchild was inspired by a similar school in New York and is due to open in September. </P>
