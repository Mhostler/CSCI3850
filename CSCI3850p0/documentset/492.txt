<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  India, the land of Kama Sutra, is going to crack down on the increasing use of sex and violence by its prolific film industry, a senior official said Saturday. </P>
<P> ``We'll finalize new guidelines in around ten days. We'll be more specific this time,'' Shakti Samanta, chairman of India's Central Board of Film Certification, told Reuters. </P>
<P> The guidelines are meant to help board members decide on what to let go and what to take out as they censor films before they are allowed into the cinema. </P>
<P> The authorities are reacting to public protests after a year of increasing sex, saucy songs and violence in the Indian cinema. </P>
<P> Film-makers are protesting the move. Film stars in the southern film center of Madras staged a march this month. </P>
<P> State government ministers assembled in New Delhi last month to chalk out a plan for the future for a cinema in what is a fairly prudish society and where explicit sex scenes are rare in movies. </P>
<P> ``The cinematograph law bans vulgarity, but doesn't say what it is,'' an Information and Broadcasting Ministry official said. ``The southern regional censors made rough guidelines so the producers won't waste money on things which won't pass.'' </P>
<P> The Indian film industry, operating mainly out of Bombay, commonly known in India as Bollywood, and Madras, churns out several hundred films every year. </P>
<P> An above-average production costs anything from $320,000 to $1.6 million. </P>
<P> Directors have been told to get scripts cleared in advance. </P>
<P> There is no official word, but southern film-makers were told not to shoot close-ups of female torsos, running of palms over bodies or men and women lying on top of each other. </P>
<P> They were also told not to show bloody violence, and to keep out fight scenes in front of temples and court buildings. </P>
<P> Such scenes have apparently been inspired by satellite television, which has brought daring videos from MTV and western soap operas to Indian homes. </P>
<P> ``Sex is something you are born with,'' said Hindi movie star Dev Anand. ``You can't be isolated from the world. Fifty years of independence is good enough.'' </P>
<P> ``That doesn't mean you can show nudity,'' Samanta said. </P>
<P> Authorities are also cracking down on song lyrics that have sexual double meanings. ``The CBFC has been told to have songs cleared by the board before songs are recorded,'' the ministry told parliament last week. </P>
<P> Samanta said the old guidelines were good enough but were not being followed properly, provoking a revision. </P>
<P> ``In spite of the guidelines you get those wretched dances,'' said Hrishikesh Mukherjee, a film-maker who once headed the censors, in reference to the dances that punctuate Indian films. </P>
<P> He referred to one in which a male and and female simulate the sex act with their clothes on. ``Were the censors sleeping then?'' he asked. ``If I did such a song, my parents would throw me out,'' said young movie star Faisal Khan. </P>
<P> The boldness has shaken even youngsters like Khan in a country where kissing scenes were banned till a few years ago. ``I don't mind kissing, but we Indians don't know how to do it. It is not in our culture,'' Khan said. </P>
<P> A lawyer lost a vulgarity suit against a song which asked, ``What lies beneath the blouse?'' The answer was, ``The heart.'' </P>
<P> The song provoked a debate on vulgarity. </P>
<P> ``What is Indian culture? It is a melting pot. Culture is always shifting,'' said Anand, who has produced, directed and acted in films for 40 years. ``Why are there nude paintings by great artists?'' </P>
