<P>  Japanese officials are becoming increasingly pessimistic about an early trade accord with the United States, which is threatening to slap sanctions on Japanese products if there is no agreement by September 30. </P>
<P> ``I am not optimistic, not at all,'' a top policymaker at Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) told reporters Thursday. </P>
<P> His comment followed two-day U.S.-Japan talks in Seattle that ended Wednesday on ways to open up insurance markets to each other, which produced little progress. </P>
<P> Negotiators from the two trade partners were tight-lipped about how the talks went and where they were going. </P>
<P> An official at Japan's Finance Ministry in Tokyo could only told reporters that Tokyo would take ``positive'' steps to reach early agreement with Washington on the insurance sector. </P>
<P> ``The Finance Ministry appears to be keeping pace with other sectors in the framework talks,'' a Foreign Ministry official said. </P>
<P> The two nations have made more progress in the insurance sector than in two other ``priority'' areas under the bilateral economic framework talks launched in July 1993 -- Tokyo's procurement of medical and telecommunications equipment and Japan's imports of auto and auto parts from the United States. </P>
<P> ``I don't think we can agree on government procurement in early September,'' the Foreign Ministry official said. </P>
<P> The two sides will resume talks on procurement in Los Angeles September 7. They are in a cooling off period following the U.S. decision to start sanctions proceedings over the procurement issue. </P>
<P> If no agreement is made by September 30, the United States may enforce higher tariffs on selected Japanese exports to the United States. </P>
<P> In a separate move, Washington may invoke the Super 301 clause of the U.S. trade act to force Japan to open up its market to U.S.-made cars and car parts. </P>
<P> In auto talks, no date has been fixed for a resumption and MITI has nothing new to offer to clinch a deal, the Foreign Ministry official said. </P>
<P> ``Japan's imports of cars are all up to consumer preference and private-sector plans, and there is little room left for the government to ease regulations.'' he said. ``The car sector could fall under Super 301.'' </P>
<P> Although Tokyo could negotiate with Washington on its trade practices declared unfair under Super 301 for 12 months, it wants to conclude auto talks by September 30, a deadline set by Washington to see if Japan's market is closed to U.S. exports. </P>
<P> The senior MITI official also said Japan is unlikely to propose any macroeconomic steps to satisfy the United States during the talks. </P>
<P> ``It is natural that the U.S. administration will adopt a tough attitude ahead of the U.S. Congressional elections in November,'' he said. </P>
<P> The two economic giants are far apart on what kind of yardsticks to use to measure the degree of market openness. </P>
<P> MITI Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto plans to meet U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor in early September in Los Angeles while the two are there to attend the September 9-11 meeting of trade ministers from the United States, Canada, Japan and the European Union. </P>
<P> Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono, who will got to the quadrilateral trade talks, is expected to meet Kantor around the same time, Japanese officials said. </P>
