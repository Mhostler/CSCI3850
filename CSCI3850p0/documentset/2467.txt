<P>  South Korea, moving swiftly to capitalize on last month's nuclear agreement between the United States and North Korea, said Tuesday it would immediately allow local firms to set up offices in North Korea. </P>
<P> Vice Unification Minister Song Young-dae said the decision to start ``pilot projects for economic cooperation'' was aimed at ending inter-Korean hostility and promoting co-prosperity. </P>
<P> ``First of all, we will allow businessmen's visit to North Korea and exchange visits by economic figures,'' he said. </P>
<P> Speaking to reporters after a meeting of top policymakers chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hong-Koo, he said South Korean companies could now send missions to explore investment opportunities and carry out feasibility studies. </P>
<P> ``Starting with the areas where we can contribute to improving the life of North Korean residents and to setting up a national commonwealth, the government will allow local companies to establish offices in North Korea along with small-scale pilot projects for economic cooperation,'' he said. </P>
<P> South Korea banned practically all economic contact with the North in late 1992 after a brief period of detente collapsed due to a bitter dispute over the North's suspected nuclear arms development. </P>
<P> Local businessmen can now invite North Koreans to South Korea for briefings on investment and tours of factories beyond the Cold War border, Song said. </P>
<P> There has been no reaction yet from North Korea. </P>
<P> South Korean companies can send experts to North Korea to transfer technology necessary for their business activities and can ship production facilities to the communist state. </P>
<P> They can also employ North Korean workers in construction and exploration projects in third countries where they can seek joint ventures, he added. </P>
<P> South Korean firms will still need approval from the government for such moves. </P>
<P> President Kim Young-sam announced the major policy switch Monday, lifting a ban on business contacts with North Korea and promoting isolated Pyongyang's economic links with the rest of the world. </P>
<P> In the most significant step since North Korean leader Kim Il-sung died on July 8, the president said Seoul would back applications by Pyongyang for regional economic groupings, such as the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. </P>
<P> Song also urged North Korea to resume dialog with the South to lay down principles for larger-scale investments. </P>
<P> ``The government, depending on progress in relations with North Korea, will provide for a basic framework for economic cooperation, such as investment guarantees and the avoidance of double taxation, through government-level consultations,'' he said. </P>
<P> But Song cautioned against ``excessive expectations'' for inter-Korean cooperation and sought help from South Koreans for step-by-step contacts with the North. </P>
<P> Deputy Prime Minister Lee and other Cabinet ministers also decided Tuesday to set up a task force to monitor and help North Korea's implementation of its accord with Washington to reshape its nuclear program. </P>
<P> Under the deal reached in Geneva, Pyongyang promised to dismantle its controversial nuclear program in return for more than $4 billion in international aid for new and safer nuclear reactors and interim energy supplies. </P>
<P> South Korean businesses already set out plans to break into the long-frozen North Korean market, with all major conglomerates saying top managers would cross the border as soon as possible to reopen trade and investment links. </P>
<P> ``South-North business relations have just been through a long hybernation,'' said Chun Woo-taik, a Daewoo Group spokesman. </P>
