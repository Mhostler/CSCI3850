<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  An Iraqi opposition group said around 20,000 Turkish troops backed up by tanks and heavy artillery were massing on Iraq's northern border Tuesday. </P>
<P> The Iraqi National Congress (INC) said the buildup was taking place directly across the border from the Iraqi city of Zakho where a bomb blast Monday killed 76 people and wounded more than 100. </P>
<P> Turkish officials were not immediately available for comment. </P>
<P> ``The troops have been moving very quickly and steadily since Sunday. They have tanks, armored personnel carriers and heavy artillery,'' the London-based INC said in a statement sent to Reuters in Ankara. </P>
<P> The group said the buildup was similar to movements by Turkish troops before they pushed over the border in October 1992 to strike Turkish Kurdish guerrilla bases in northern Iraq. </P>
<P> The Turkish army said it killed 1,800 Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) fighters in that operation. </P>
<P> ``The number of troops gathering is unprecedented since 1992,'' the INC said. The INC is an alliance of Iraqi groups opposed to the rule of President Saddam Hussein. </P>
<P> The Turkish media Tuesday blamed the bomb in Zakho, 12 miles from the Turkish border, on the PKK which still operates in northern Iraq. </P>
