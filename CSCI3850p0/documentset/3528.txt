<P>  President Clinton's national security adviser said Bosnian Serbs have not yet defeated the Muslim-led Bosnian government in Europe's bloodiest conflict since World War II. </P>
<P> ``The Serbs have not yet won the war. I shouldn't even say yet,'' Anthony Lake, the adviser, said in a taped interview on NBC televison's ``Meet the Press'' program aired on Sunday. </P>
<P> ``The fact is that in central Bosnia, for example, the position of the government forces is as good or is better than it ever has been,'' he said. ``It's much too early to write off Bosnia and I think not only that this administration, but the Congress and all of us ought to go on working on it.'' </P>
<P> Lake made his comments on Friday, before the Serbs and the Bosnian government agreed on Saturday to a four-month cease-fire during which they are to seek to negotiate a permanent peace. </P>
<P> As recently as late November, U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry had said that the Bosnian Serbs, who control about 70 of Bosnian territory, had demonstrated their superiority on the battlefield and that their gains may be irreversible. </P>
<P> Lake said the notion that the Bosnian government had lost the war unduly reflected pessimism over the besieged mainly Muslim enclave Bihac, a U.N. protected ``safe area'' in the northwest. </P>
<P> ``The terrible frustration over Bihac and the fighting over Bihac became in a way a symbol for all of Bosnia, and it shouldn't have done,'' Lake said. </P>
<P> President Clinton, a Democrat, has faced sharp criticism from Republicans over what they say is a feckless Bosnia policy. </P>
<P> Before the cease-fire set in motion last month by former president Jimmy Carter's trip to Bosnia, incoming Senate Majority leader Bob Dole had urged that NATO protect Bihac by withdrawing the 24,000-member U.N. peacekeeping force, bombing Bosnian Serb positions and arming the Muslims. </P>
<P> Dole said Sunday that even in the face of the announced cease-fire, he still favored lifting the arms embargo. </P>
<P> ``What we would do is to introduce a bi-partisan resolution to lift the arms embargo, make it effective whenever the cease-fire ends so we would not interfere with this four-month truce, if it is a four-month truce,'' Dole said on the CBS ''Face the Nation'' program. </P>
<P> ``We think Bosnia is an independent nation, they're a member of the United Nations, with a right to self-defense ... We're suggesting let's lift the arms embargo, let's send a signal to the Serbs, a strong signal that we're about to take this action ... I think you may have them sitting down at the peace table, talking seriously about peace,'' Dole said. </P>
<P> Lake warned against any Republican-led push to force the administration to unilaterally lift the arms embargo so that arms could be supplied to the Muslims, generally seen in the United States as the conflict's main victims. </P>
<P> ``We are certainly very vigorously opposed to a unilateral lifting of the arms embargo,'' Lake said, adding it would create perhaps the worst strains in the history of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. </P>
<P> France and Britain have warned the Clinton administration against arming the Muslims, threatening to pull their peackeepers out of Bosnia and demand thousands of U.S. ground troops to cover their retreat. </P>
