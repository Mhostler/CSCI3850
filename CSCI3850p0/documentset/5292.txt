<P> Kantor, in an interview on CNN from Atlanta, said one of the reasons the dollar had slid against the yen was ``closed economies in Japan.'' </P>
<P> Over the past 25 years, he said, Japan had exported 40 million cars to the United States, while the United States had sent only 40,000 to Japan. </P>
<P> ``That's not due to quality or not due to availability,'' Kantor said. ``That is due to discrimination.'' </P>
<P> ``The fact is the Japanese have a closed economy. When that happens, you have a skewed economic situation.'' </P>
