<P>  Officials with Britain's Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) said Saturday they would fly to Canada to check reports that a drug company is keeping mares cruelly locked up. </P>
<P> U.S. drug giant Wyeth-Ayerst has been accused of keeping an estimated 75,000 horses locked up in barns in North America, attached to a system of pouches and tubes that collect urine for the production of drugs used to treat symptoms of menopause. </P>
<P> The cruelty charge has come primarily from the international animal welfare group, PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals). </P>
<P> Premarin and Prempak-C, commonly used hormone replacement therapy (HRT) drugs, are prescribed to prevent osteoporosis and heart disease and other symptoms such as hot flashes, night sweats, memory loss and sexual problems. </P>
<P> But animal welfare groups say the horses are kept in tiny, dark stalls for months on end without exercise, are kept continually pregnant and their foals are taken away almost immediately and often killed, and that they have insufficient bedding. </P>
<P> Maggie Jennings, head of research at the RSPCA, said she and a team of veterinarians would fly to Winnipeg Monday to visit farms where the horses are kept. </P>
<P> ``I am keeping an open mind about this, but we are concerned about the quality of life of the horses. This is a system of husbandry and if they are keeping them for six months of the year without exercise, that is a very sad quality of life,'' she said. </P>
<P> Wyeth rejects claims that the horses suffer and says they have to be kept inside because of extremely cold temperatures in Canada and the northern United States. </P>
