<P>  The Algerian Armed Islamic Group (GIA) advised Algerian students and teachers to stay away from schools and universities on pain of unspecified punishment and said any which stayed open would be blown up or burned down. </P>
<P> In a statement carried by the international Arabic-language newspaper al-Hayat on Saturday, the group said that education was a hindrance to the task of jihad (holy struggle) and that it was unlawful to attend institutions run by apostate rulers. </P>
<P> The GIA, in an earlier statement to the newspaper, claimed responsibility for shooting dead five French government employees at an embassy housing complex in Algiers. </P>
<P> Saturday's statement said the Armed Islamic Group completely banned study and teaching. </P>
<P> ``No student may go to secondary school or university. All those who violate this order will be liable to reprimand and the deterrent punishment under Islamic law. </P>
<P> ``Any teacher who goes to work and any administrator who opens the doors of a secondary school or a university will be liable to punishment under Islamic law,'' it added. </P>
<P> ``The secondary school or the university which is open will be liable to be burnt or blown up so that all comply under the banner of the Armed Islamic Group.'' </P>
<P> Al-Hayat said the statement was signed by Abu Abd Ahmed, which it described as the commander of the group. </P>
<P> The hard-line group advocates total war to overthrow the Algerian authorities. Last year it gave foreigners a month to get out of the country or face death. </P>
<P> Three paramilitary gendarmes and two consular officials were shot dead Wednesday when nine gunmen disguised as Algerian police commandos attacked the French embassy housing compound and tried to detonate a car-bomb inside it. </P>
