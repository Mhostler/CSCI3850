<P>  Argentine police have detained the owner of a delivery van believed to have been used in the bombing of a Jewish community center, President Carlos Menem said Tuesday. </P>
<P> At least 96 people were killed in last Monday's attack against the headquarters of the Delegation of Jewish Argentine Associations (DAIA) and the AMIA Jewish benevolent society. </P>
<P> ``(The probe) is advancing quickly,'' Menem told a radio interviewer. ``We have good clues and good tips''. </P>
<P> An Israeli general who took part in the rescue effort here said that he believed a suicide bomber drove a Renault van packed with hundreds of pounds of explosives right up to the door of the building. </P>
<P> ``We've found parts of a vehicle with a corpse inside, which could be the driver's,'' General Zeev Livne told the daily Pagina/12. </P>
<P> ``The body was totally destroyed,'' added the general, who was due to return to Israel with his team Tuesday. </P>
<P> Menem, who did not identify the detained man but said he was due to be questioned by federal judge Juan Jose Galeano, who heads the investigation into the attack. </P>
<P> Galeano returned late Monday from Caracas where, according to local newspapers, he interviewed a former Iranian diplomat said to have information on the attack agains DAIA's building and the 1992 bombing of Israel's embassy in Buenos Aires. </P>
<P> Israel suspects Iran and the pro-Iranian Lebanese Hizbollah (Party of God) had a hand in both attacks. </P>
<P> However, another Lebanon-based group calling itself the Supporters of God claimed responsibility for the DAIA bombing. </P>
<P> According to Pagina/12, Argentina's and Israel's secret services were keeping close tabs on the Iranian embassy in Buenos Aires. </P>
<P> Intelligence documents quoted by the daily said Tehran's ambassador, Hadi Soleimanpour, was a high-ranking official in an Iranian government agency that assists foreign Islamic and revolutionary groups. </P>
<P> Pagina/12 added that in 1989 Spain had asked Soleimanpour to leave Madrid after its intelligence service said he was probably linked with bombing attacks in Europe. </P>
<P> Soleimanpour also was among the Islamic students who overran the United States' embassy in Tehran in 1979, the newspaper added. </P>
