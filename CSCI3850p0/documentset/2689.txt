<P>  A new Iranian law gives some women being divorced by their husbands the right to up to half the property gathered during their married life, Iran's top judge said Friday. </P>
<P> While the law is limited in scope and the actual award in each case is to be decided by court, the measure could still prove a significant advance for women in the face of Islamic family laws which give most rights to men. </P>
<P> Head of Judiciary Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi said the law was designed to protect women whose husbands, having climbed the social ladder, wanted to leave them for younger wives. </P>
<P> ``I know of such examples...couples who have gone through proverty and hardship together, but now that he has got a desk job or come into some money, and probably made acquaintance of a young woman...wants to divorce his wife and marry the other woman,'' he said in a prayer sermon broadcast on Tehran Radio. </P>
<P> ``The approved law says in such a case the court should appraise how much property they had gained since marrying and transfer up to half of it to the woman before he can divorce her,'' Yazdi said. </P>
<P> The new law was passed by the Expediency Discernment Council, a body of about two dozen mostly clerical officials which has special legislating powers. It applies only if the wife has not failed to carry out her marital duties, Yazdi said. </P>
<P> Complaints by divorced women who find themselves penniless with little recourse to law is a recurring theme in legal and social pages of Iranian newspapers. </P>
<P> While Iranian laws, in line with Islamic rules, do not question that divorce is only the husband's right, authorities have taken steps to discourage easy divorce. </P>
