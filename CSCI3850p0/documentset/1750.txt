<P>  Pope John Paul, opening a synod of bishops that will discuss the role of priests and nuns in the Catholic church, indirectly reaffirmed Sunday the church's ban on women priests. </P>
<P> The 74-year-old pope appeared relatively fit at the Mass in St Peter's Basilica, which he celebrated with 39 cardinals, 160 bishops and 80 priests. </P>
<P> The Polish pontiff walked the 100 yards of the main aisle of the basilica steadily with the help of his silver cross, a ceremonial walking staff. He appeared to limp less than in recent weeks and he spoke in a firm voice inside the largest church in Christendom. </P>
<P> There have been fears for the pope's health since doctors ordered him to cancel a trip this month to the United States and the United Nations so his right leg can fully heal from a fracture he suffered in a fall last April. </P>
<P> In his homily before some 10,000 people -- including Mother Teresa of Calcutta, the 1979 Nobel peace prize winner -- the pope said he hoped the month-long synod would be of ``special importance for all the sons and daughters of the Church.'' </P>
<P> The synod will discuss the life of priests, nuns and friars in the modern world and a crisis of vocations to the religious life, particularly in advanced countries. </P>
<P> Women's groups have said they want the synod to recognize the talents and contributions of women to the church. </P>
<P> They also hope the mostly male participants of the synod will support demands that qualified women be allowed to hold decision-making jobs in the Catholic Church around the world and in the Curia, the Vatican's central administration. </P>
<P> Fifty-nine of the synod's 348 delegates are women. </P>
<P> In his sermon the pope indirectly reaffirmed that the Catholic Church's ban on women priests will not be open to debate at the synod. </P>
<P> The pontiff did this by saying that the theme of the synod ``should be read in the light of'' two major Church documents he mentioned specifically. </P>
<P> One, from the 1962-65 Second Vatican Council, speaks of the hierarchical structure of the Church. The second, a 1988 letter by the current pontiff on the dignity of women, reaffirms their exclusion from the priesthood. </P>
<P> The 1988 document said the Church does not have the authority to approve the ordination of women because Christ willingly chose only men as his apostles. </P>
<P> The Vatican has rejected feminist arguments that Christ was merely conforming to the cultural norms of his times. </P>
<P> During the months of preparation for the gathering there has been growing interest in what its deliberations could mean for the role of women in the Church in the future. </P>
<P> A Vatican preparatory document on the synod published last June said there was an urgent need to meet growing grass-roots pressure for a more influential role for women in the Church. </P>
<P> It was published a month after a survey of Roman Catholic female religious orders said they wanted the Pope to give qualified nuns more power in the Church, better pay and some more senior jobs in the Vatican, a traditional male bastion. </P>
<P> This past year, the pope twice forcefully reaffirmed the Church's ban on women priests, saying the ruling was definitive. </P>
<P> But a number of Catholic women's groups have looked to the synod to improve the lot of nuns in the Church. </P>
<P> Sister Mary Ann Walsh, a Washington-based member of the Sisters of Mercy in the United States, wrote in America, the weekly magazine of the Jesuit order in the United States, that the synod could offer the Church a unique opportunity to address women's issues, such as gender-based discrimination. </P>
