<P>  The United Nations said Thursday that a team of eight international experts was on its way to evaluate the environmental damage caused by Russia's major oil spill in the Komi Republic, just below the Arctic circle, in the fall. </P>
<P> The team was being dispatched via Moscow following a formal request for U.N. assistance by the Ministry for Civil Defense, Emergencies and Elimination of Consequences of Natural Disasters, according to a U.N. statement issued in Geneva. </P>
<P> ``The United Nations have been asked to examine the extent and the environmental consequences of a major oil spill in the Republic of Komi,'' the U.N. statement said. </P>
<P> A joint unit of the U.N. Environment Program and U.N. Department of Humanitarian Affairs, formed last July, is organizing the mission, being headed by two staff members. </P>
<P> The eight scientific and engineering experts -- two each from Norway, Canada, the United States and European Union -- are to be briefed in Moscow by Russian scientists before heading to the city of Ousinsk, according to the U.N. statement. </P>
<P> ``The team will evaluate the extent of the spill, as well as the potential short, medium and long-term environmental implications, including the risk of transboundary pollution, and make recommendations to the Russian authorities accordingly,'' it said. </P>
