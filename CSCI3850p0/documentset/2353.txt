<DATELINE>BERLIN (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A wealthy East Berlin lawyer who organized a series of spectacular East-West spy swaps during the Cold War went on trial Wednesday for extortion and perjury charges. </P>
<P> The Berlin state court said Wolfgang Vogel, once a confidant of former East German communist leader Erich Honecker, was accused of extorting assets in 21 cases from people he helped emigrate to the West from the former East Germany between 1972 and 1989. </P>
<P> Vogel, who engineered the handover of about 34,000 political prisoners and 200,000 would-be-defectors from former East Germany, was also accused of making a false oath and embezzling $60,000 from a client. </P>
<P> Vogel, who held no official position but was in effect East Germany's chief negotiator for East-West humanitarian affairs, was released on bail last January after spending six months in custody. </P>
<P> His trial, in which he is defended by Wolfgang Ziegler, a former lawyer of Honecker, is expected to last 30 days. </P>
<P> In order to help raise funds for impoverished East Germany, Vogel negotiated the emigration of East German dissidents and people who had failed in escape attempts across the Iron Curtain in exchange for cash from Bonn. </P>
<P> He is accused of forcing several East Germans to sell off property and valuables for pittances in return for emigration papers he arranged with the approval of party and security police officials. </P>
<P> In 1962 Vogel helped arrange the swap of U.S. air force pilot Gary Powers, shot down on a secret reconnaissance mission over the Soviet Union, for Rudolf Abel, an imprisoned agent of the former Soviet Union's KGB secret service. </P>
<P> Vogel also negotiated the trade at Berlin's Glienicke border bridge of Soviet Jewish dissident Anatoly Shcharansky (now Natan Sharansky) in 1986 for Communist spies jailed in the West. </P>
<P> The lawyer is the latest member of East Berlin's former Communist elite to be put on trial since East Germans peacefully toppled their system in late 1989, paving the way for unification a year later. </P>
