<P> QUENTIN THOMAS, the man who will lead Britain's team, is a career civil servant who has played a vital role in behind-the-scenes negotiations. </P>
<P> The 50-year-old Cambridge university graduate has been deputy secretary at the Northern Ireland office since 1991 and is credited with having a deep knowledge and understanding of the problems in the province. </P>
<P> Conservatives, impressed by his credentials and almost 30 years in government service, believe Thomas is the ideal candidate to represent the government in the unprecedented talks with Sinn Fein. </P>
<P> MARTIN MCGUINNESS is one of the republicans' leading strategists, a veteran of their 25-year war and peace struggle respected by the foot soldiers of the IRA and throughout the political ranks of Sinn Fein. </P>
<P> Reputed IRA commander in his Londonderry city power base in the early 1970s, he dodged British security forces for 10 years remaining on the run in safe houses. Took part in 1972 IRA peace talks with Northern Ireland Secretary William Whitelaw. </P>
<P> McGuinness, 44, emerged as a major political force in the early 1980s, helping to fashion Sinn Fein as a campaigning political party with strong electoral foothold in its traditional support areas. </P>
<P> Elected with other Sinn Fein activists to Northern Ireland Assembly in 1982. Unapologetic hardline advocate of British withdrawal from Northern Ireland but helped sell current peace process to the IRA's leadership. A non-smoker and virtually tee-total, he is articulate and as much at ease in a television studio as on election hustings. </P>
