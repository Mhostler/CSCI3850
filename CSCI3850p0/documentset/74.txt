<P>  The Justice Department plans to seek the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy's dealings with a politically connected Arkansas poultry firm, federal officials said Tuesday. </P>
<P> Justice Department officials said Attorney General Janet Reno was expected to request that the special, three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals name an independent counsel to take over the Espy probe. </P>
<P> The Justice Department has been investigating whether Espy illegally accepted free travel, tickets to sporting events, including football playoff games, and other gifts from Tyson Foods Inc. </P>
<P> Tyson is the the biggest U.S. poultry processor and has longstanding ties to President Clinton. The company's owner, Donald Tyson, has been a strong supporter and political patron of Clinton. </P>
<P> At issue in the investigation is a 1907 federal meat inspection law barring anyone involved in meat inspection from accepting anything of value from meat processing firms. </P>
<P> Espy, a former Democratic congressman from Mississippi, has denied any wrongdoing, has vowed to cooperate in the probe and has predicted he would be cleared. </P>
<P> The Justice Department last month wanted to end the investigation without bringing any criminal charges, but the FBI persuaded senior Justice Department officials to keep the probe going and explore all possible leads. </P>
<P> The officials said the Justice Department planned to seek the appointment of the independent counsel now that the law has been reinstated after having expired in late 1992. </P>
<P> Clinton last week signed the independent counsel law that provides for the appointment of an outside lawyer to investigate allegations of wrongdoing by senior government officials. </P>
<P> As a Cabinet member, Espy is covered under the law. </P>
<P> The request for an independent counsel in the Espy case could be made soon, possibly this week, one Justice Department official said. </P>
<P> But another official declined to say when the request would be made, saying the matter still was under review. </P>
