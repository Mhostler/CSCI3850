<DATELINE>KHAYELITSHA, South Africa (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Britain's Queen Elizabeth moved from pomp to poverty Tuesday, visiting two sprawling dirt-poor black townships on the second day of her state tour of South Africa. </P>
<P> But she had to cut short her visit to Langa township by a few minutes when over-enthusiastic spectators at a sports ground swamped the royal party and police bundled her away for safety. </P>
<P> British officials said there was no change to her program despite the over enthusiastic response in Langa township. There were no fears for her security and ``it won't alter the program,'' one said. </P>
<P> Khayelitsha, a sprawling squatter camp of miserable tin shacks lacking water and sanitation, is one of the country's most violent areas, with unemployment and crime endemic among its estimated 700,000 population. </P>
<P> The sea of tiny tin-and-wood shacks lacking running water and toilets in the townships on Cape Town's outskirts stood in sharp contrast to the formality and pomp of her arrival Monday for the six-day visit with her husband Prince Philip. </P>
<P> ``The government is very far away from us, but with the media coming to see the queen here, maybe the government will know we're here and we can have water and toilets,'' said Khayelitsha resident Rogers Stayimeli. </P>
<P> Wednesday, the queen -- focusing on the concerns of South Africa's black majority, will look at education on the second leg of her six day tour. After her first visit to townships on the outskirts of Cape Town, she will see two more townships in Port Elizabeth. </P>
<P> She will visit the Centenary Hall community sports center and library in Port Elizabeth's New Brighton township and then lunch at the predominantly-black Vista University. </P>
<P> She will also visit a nutritional clinic in Missionvale township and Port Elizabeth's Center for Continuing Education before leaving for Pretoria's Waterkloof airbase. </P>
<P> Her husband Prince Philip, meanwhile, will fly to Kimberley to see South Africa's diamond mining center and then visit a rural development project near Ventersdorp in Northwest province. </P>
<P> Earlier Tuesday the queen and her husband attended a moving Anglican (Episcopalian) service of ``thanksgiving and reconciliation'' in St. George's Cathedral on South Africa's first Human Rights Day, commemorating the 1960 Sharpeville massacre that turned the country into an international pariah. </P>
<P> Apartheid's security forces shot down 69 black protesters in the Sharpeville township south of Johannesburg during a demonstration against the hated pass laws that restricted black movement in the country. </P>
<P> Security forces also gunned down 18 people on the same day protesting against the pass laws in Langa, Cape Town's oldest township with a population of about 40,000. </P>
<P> ``What happened 35 years ago in Sharpeville eventually led to South Africa leaving the Commonwealth (in 1961), because from then on she became the pariah of the world,'' Archbishop Desmond Tutu told the capacity congregation which included President Nelson Mandela. </P>
<P> The state visit will wind up in Durban, with the royal couple flying home Saturday night. </P>
