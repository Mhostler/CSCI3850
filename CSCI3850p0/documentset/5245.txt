<NOTES>(Adds Utah considering suit, 3rd graf, tobacco industry fails toget court order blocking Maryland smokinWASHINGTON (Reuter) </NOTES>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Massachusetts and Maryland will decide shortly whether to join four other states in their suits against the tobacco industry to recoup health care costs of smokers, the states' top lawyers said Monday. </P>
<P> Maryland Attorney General J. Joseph Curran Jr. told Reuters that his office could make a recommendation to the legislature as soon as next month. </P>
<P> Massachusetts Attorney General Scott Harshbarger said he expected a decision by June. Utah's Attorney General Jan Graham is also seriously considering a lawsuit, a spokesman said, but Graham wants to present the issue to the governor and legislature before deciding whether to proceed. </P>
<P> Their comments came as the tobacco industry tried to win a court order blocking Maryland's proposed far-reaching ban on smoking in public places, which was scheduled to begin Monday afternoon. Although the industry failed to obtain the stay, Maryland's governor and the state legislature reached a last-minute compromise weakening the original regulations. </P>
<P> A spokeswoman for Gov. Parris Glendening said he planned to sign the legislation Monday night. </P>
<P> Earlier, Curran and Harshbarger, who were attending a meeting of the National Association of Attorneys General in Washington, said they have been working closely with the four states that have previously sued the industry to recoup Medicaid costs spent on smokers. </P>
<P> Those states -- Florida, Minnesota, Mississippi and West Virginia -- formed a coalition earlier this month to share information and develop legal strategies. </P>
<P> ``We've benefitted a great deal from their research,'' Harshbarger said. Massachusetts passed legislation last summer that would allow him to sue the tobacco industry. </P>
<P> He said Massachusetts has been studying the lawsuit filed by Minnesota and Blue Cross and Blue Shield -- the first time a state and an insurer joined together to take on the tobacco industry. That case accuses cigarette companies of conspiring for decades to hide information about the dangers of smoking. </P>
<P> ``We expect to be meeting with the American Cancer Society and health maintenance organizations and others to see if we can build the same coalitions,'' Harshbarger said. ``I think a coalition is an important piece of this litigation.'' </P>
<P> He said the major problem in suing cigarette companies is that states are pitted against the seemingly unlimited financial resources of the tobacco industry. However, a partnership could be able to furnish the crucial funding, he said. </P>
<P> Harshbarger said the tobacco industry is often able to use its vast legal resources to defeat plaintiffs on early procedural issues before the merits of a lawsuit are ever heard. </P>
<P> ``The tobacco companies' strategy is knocking you out before you enter the arena. ... They may have their weakest case once you get to the substance,'' Harshbarger said. ``We know that this is a case where you can get outgunned more on resources than on merits.'' </P>
<P> Mississippi Attorney General Mike Moore said the fact that the states have joined together to pool resources has encouraged others to consider joining the battle. </P>
<P> ``I predict six to seven more states will join us very soon,'' he said. </P>
