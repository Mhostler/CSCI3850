<P>  Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia was formally elected speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday, the first Republican to hold the post in 40 years. </P>
<P> Gingrich was elevated to the high office -- second in line of succession to the U.S. presidency, after the vice president -- by fellow party members when the Republican-led House elected last November convened for a two-year term. His election was on a party-line vote of 228 to 202. Minority Democrats, who had run the House since 1955, supported their leader, Richard Gephardt of Missouri. </P>
