<P>  The Russian air force plans to use special laser-guided bombs against military targets in the capital of the breakway republic of Chechnya, a senior defense ministry official told Interfax news agency Tuesday. </P>
<P> The official said the air force had only been able to use the high-precision weapons sparingly so far against targets in Grozny because of bad weather hampering visibility. </P>
<P> President Boris Yeltsin earlier said on nationwide television that he had ordered a halt to air raids on Grozny, but it seemed possible he was only referring to attacks which could harm civilians. </P>
<P> ``The use of high-precision weapons means we can virtually exclude the chance of causing civilian casualties,'' the defense ministry official told Interfax. </P>
<P> The bombs were so accurate that they could be planted within two to three yards of their intended target, he added. </P>
