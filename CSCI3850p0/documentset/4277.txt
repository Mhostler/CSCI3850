<P>  George Foreman, the oldest heavyweight boxing champion in history, said Friday he may retire from the ring after his title fight against German Axel Schulz in April. </P>
<P> Foreman, 46, also said he hoped to settle a dispute with the World Boxing Association (WBA) over his planned match against Schulz, who is 20 years his junior. </P>
<P> ``There is a chance that I'd wait around for Mike Tyson to get out and get himself back into shape,'' Foreman, asked about the future, told reporters during a promotional trip to Oslo. </P>
<P> ``But, if he doesn't, probably the fight with Axel Schulz could be my last boxing match. I got things to do. I just can't hang around and box too long.'' </P>
<P> Tyson, the former undisputed heavyweight champion, is eligible to be released on parole in May from an Indiana prison where he is serving a six-year term for a 1992 rape conviction. </P>
<P> ``Let's hope he stays in (jail) a while,'' Foreman quipped, guffawing. ``We'll all be safe.'' </P>
<P> Foreman, who holds both the WBA and International Boxing Federation (IBF) versions of the title, looks in danger of losing his WBA belt for fighting the lowly-rated German instead of its highest-ranked available contender. </P>
<P> ``The IBF has already decided to sanction the fight with Axel Schulz,'' Foreman said. ``I heard there was some misunderstanding (with the WBA) and I haven't gotten it all straightened out. I think it will be worked out. I just haven't had time.'' </P>
<P> Foreman will be fighting for just the IBF version of the championship unless behind-the-scenes maneuvering can bring about a change of policy by the WBA, which has threatened to strip him of his title. </P>
<P> ``I don't think I'll be stripped,'' Foreman said. ``The belt did not fit anyway. It was too small.'' </P>
<P> Foreman, who first won the heavyweight title from Joe Frazier in 1973, lost it in a painful defeat to Muhammad Ali the following year and quit boxing in 1977. </P>
<P> Foreman returned to the ring 10 years later to launch a comeback, winning publicity and plenty of fans with jokes about his age, his girth and his passion for fast-food. </P>
<P> He stunned and delighted the boxing world in November when he knocked out WBA and IBF champion Michael Moorer to win the heavyweight crown he had lost 20 years earlier. </P>
<P> But Foreman said he no longer had quite the same motivation. </P>
<P> ``Once you've conquered something there is nothing else to do,'' he said. ``It was wonderful to get out there and say 'I am gonna do it.' All I can say now is: 'Bring food, I'm gonna celebrate.''' </P>
<P> ``My profession is as a preacher. That's what I do. I just can't make a lot of money at it. That's why I moonlight as a boxer.'' </P>
<P> The match against Schulz, not a big international name but known to be fast on his feet and with a good right hand, will take place in Las Vegas April 22. </P>
<P> ``I think I'll dance with him until I get tired,'' Foreman said. ``Then I'll club him.'' </P>
<P></P>
<P> ``No, but I'll fight. You don't have to be in shape to fight. Just have nine kids to feed, and you'll fight. They told me to go out, get beat up and bring them money.'' </P>
<P> Foreman said he did not worry about brain damage. </P>
<P> ``Anybody going into boxing already got brain damage,'' he grinned. ``I am the champion of the world. I am grateful. I am happy. All I got to do now is keep my stomach sucked in.'' </P>
<P> ``I got so many things to do. I am gonna try to do them all, before rigor mortis sets in. You don't have to give up dreaming just because you get older. You look in the mirror and you start seeing grey hair? Just cut if off and keep going.'' </P>
