<DATELINE>OKLAHOMA CITY (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A 15-year-old girl was rescued from the devastated federal building in Oklahoma City Wednesday and rushed to the hospital in critical condition as the official death from the bombing rose to 28. </P>
<P> The dramatic rescue provided a brief glimpse of optimism even as officials found more bodies buried in the rubble. </P>
<P> Assistant Fire Chief Jon Hanson said rescuers were having problems getting through the debris to bodies strewn about the federal building. </P>
<P> ``There's a lot of bodies in the building,'' he said, adding officials were limiting the number of rescue workers searching the building to 40 because of safety concerns. </P>
<P> ``We've got to limit the amount of people because of the structural integrity of the building,'' he said. ``It may collapse.'' </P>
<P> Officials said two people who were pulled from the wreckage earlier died from their wounds, bringing the official death toll to 28. The number was expected to climb higher.  CNN said rescuers working though the night were bringing out bodies at the rate of one an hour. </P>
<P> Workers were using a metal basket suspended from a construction crane to hunt for survivors. </P>
<P> Authorities said at least 300 people were still unaccounted for and that it could be days before all the victims were found. As night fell, rain hampered the work of rescuers digging through the rubble. </P>
<P> The New York Times said the Oklahoma bomb was believed to be a very simple model with only four components -- ammonium nitrate, a timer, a battery and a detonator to make a spark -- the same kind used in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing in New York that killed six people and injured 1,000.  Ammonium nitrate is a readily available substance easy to transport and relatively safe to handle. It is an ingredient in gardening fertilizer and often used in mining explosives. </P>
