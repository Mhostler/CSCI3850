<P>  An Air Force judicial investigator Wednesday recommended that a crew leader involved in the shoot down of two U.S. helicopters over Iraq in April be court-martialed, the Air Force said. </P>
<P> It said the investigator recommended court martial of Capt. Jim Wang, who was crew director of the Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) plane controlling allied air operations over Iraq at the time. </P>
<P> Two F-15 fighterplanes under the AWACS plane's control mistook the U.S. helicopters for Iraqi ones and shot them down, killing 26 U.S. and allied officers and civilian officials. </P>
<P> One of the F-15 pilots has been charged separately at his base in Germany with negligent homicide and dereliction of duty. </P>
<P> The Air Force had charged five AWACS crew members with dereliction of duty. </P>
<P> But the investigating officer recommended non-judicial punishment of one, and dismissal of all charges against the other three, according to an announcement by Eighth Air Force headquarters at Barksdale Air Force Base near Baton Rouge. </P>
<P> It said the investigator, Col. William Colwell, made the recommendation after an inquiry at Tinker Air Force Base near Oklahoma City. </P>
<P> He recommended non-judicial punishment of 1st Lt. Joseph Halcli, en route controller, and dismissal of all charges against Maj. Douglas Martin, Maj. Lawrence Tracey and 2nd Lt. Ricky Wilson, the Air Force said. </P>
<P> A separate Air Force investigation blamed the shootdown in part on defense spending cuts, saying they have forced longer working hours and high turnover on AWACS crews who are not used to working together. </P>
