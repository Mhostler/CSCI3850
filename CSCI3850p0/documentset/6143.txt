<DATELINE>LONDON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Archbishop of Canterbury said Saturday that Church of England bishops would not be stampeded into liberalizing their policy on homosexuality. </P>
<P> Archbishop George Carey, leader of the world's 70 million Anglicans (Episcopalians), dismissed as unfounded any suggestions that the church might soon allow practising homosexuals to be ordained priests or accept same-sex relationships as equal to marriage. </P>
<P> ``Such speculation is misleading and causes unwarranted suspicion and anxieties,'' he told a church conference. ``It (the church) will not be stampeded into changing its theological position or its pastoral practice.'' </P>
<P> Carey's comments followed the promotion to the church's second most senior post of Bishop David Hope, who recently described his sexuality as ``in a grey area'' but stressed he was celibate. </P>
<P> Several other senior churchmen have acknowledged their homosexual orientation following an ``outing'' campaign by the gay rights activist group Outrage, which accuses the church of hypocrisy. </P>
<P> Current Church of England teaching says lay people in a ``close, loving and faithful same sex partnership'' should be accepted by fellow-Christians. But homosexual clergy could not ``claim the liberty'' to enter into a sexually active relationship.'' </P>
<P> Outrage leader Peter Tatchell defended the tactics, telling a separate conference of the Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement that they had ``worked like a dream'' in the case of Hope. </P>
<P> He accused Carey of inconsistency and homophobia. ``In March, Dr. Carey said the church must reject homophobia. Now he is endorsing the church's homophobic policy of firing clergy in loving homosexual relationships,'' Tatchell said. </P>
<P> ``This inconsistency is further evidence of the church's muddle-headed morality. Anglican discrimination against homosexuals is a violation of human rights.'' </P>
