<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Editors and journalists from Italy's most prestigious newspapers sounded the alarm Tuesday over a potential threat to press freedom posed by the government of media-baron-turned-politician Silvio Berlusconi. </P>
<P> The meeting of leading newspaper chiefs was called by Indro Montanelli, the 85-year-old doyen of Italian journalism who broke away from the Berlusconi fold earlier this year to set up his own paper -- La Voce. </P>
<P> ``I don't yet know if the freedom of the press is in danger...but the notion is growing,'' Montanelli told some 1,000 journalists packed into a Milan theater. ``Threatening clouds are looming over the horizon,'' he said. </P>
<P> The meeting was attended by the editors of top daily newspapers La Repubblica, Corriere della Sera and Il Sole 24 Ore, as well as leading figures from television current affairs programs. </P>
<P> Berlusconi became prime minister after sweeping to power in March general elections, but was attacked for refusing to give up ownership of his vast Fininvest media empire, which has a stranglehold over Italy's commercial television. </P>
<P> He has dismissed doubts about a conflict of interest, but criticism grew last month when the government tried to give itself the power to fire the board of state broadcaster RAI, Fininvest's only serious television rival, by decree. </P>
<P> President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro said the move was unconstitutional and refused to sign the decree. But the RAI board, which is appointed by the heads of the two houses of parliament, resigned anyway. </P>
<P> ``The attempted blow against (RAI) on the part of the government and signs of intolerance on the part of Silvio Berlusconi...seem to be a prelude to more concrete action,'' Montanelli warned in an editorial in Tuesday's La Voce. </P>
<P> His newspaper has been outspoken in its call for Berlusconi to cut his links with his media interests, which besides the television stations also include Italy's largest publishing house and an advertising agency. </P>
