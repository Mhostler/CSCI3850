<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A California foundation said Friday it is awarding an environmental prize to a Nigerian minority rights activist who is on trial for murder. </P>
<P> The Goldman Environmental Foundation, founded in 1990 by two California philanthropists, announced that Ken Saro-Wiwa was this year's winner of its grassroots environmental prize for Africa. </P>
<P> The foundation had been due to announce the winners of its six annual grassroots environmental prizes -- one for each of the inhabited continents -- in San Francisco April 17. </P>
<P> But it said it broke with tradition by announcing Saro-Wiwa's prize early to draw international attention to his trial before a three-man tribunal in Port Harcourt, southeastern Nigeria. </P>
<P> Saro-Wiwa, 53, president of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), and four others are charged in the murder of four leaders in volatile Ogoniland. They deny the charges. </P>
<P> Saro-Wiwa is accused of inciting the murder of the leaders, killed at a rally last May. Human rights groups have said the charges are politically motivated. </P>
<P> On Thursday, the Nigerian court adjourned the trial until Monday to consider its own competence to judge the case. </P>
<P> ``Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have both raised great concerns about the fairness of this special military tribunal,'' said Duane Silverstein, executive director of the Goldman Environmental Foundation. </P>
<P> ``The Goldman prize jury felt the more attention given to the trial, the more likely it is to be fair,'' Silverstein told Reuters. </P>
<P> The Goldman Foundation said Saro-Wiwa could face the death penalty if found guilty. </P>
<P> Silverstein said the prize jury selected Saro-Wiwa for the $75,000 prize because of his ``outstanding grassroots environmental work''. </P>
<P> Saro-Wiwa has campaigned for years to have pollution caused by oil extraction in Nigeria cleaned up, he said. </P>
<P> MOSOP demands compensation for its people from the Anglo-Dutch oil giant Shell for what it says are decades of destruction of Ogoniland by the oil firm. </P>
<P> It also demands self-determination for the 300,000-strong Ogoni people in the River Niger delta region. </P>
<P> Shell has denied any wrongdoing in Ogoniland. </P>
<P> A Goldman Foundation statement quoted Ken Saro-Wiwa Jr., Saro-Wiwa's son who lives in London, as saying he was honored to accept the award on behalf of his family. </P>
<P> ``Ken will be tremendously proud to receive such a prestigious award, but above all we expect he would like to dedicate it to all Ogonis...,'' his son said. </P>
