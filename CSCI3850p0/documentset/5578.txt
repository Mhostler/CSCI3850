<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The juror dismissed from the O.J. Simpson trial, whose widely reported comments caused Judge Lance Ito to order an investigation into jury misconduct, denied Friday ever saying that panelists discussed the case among themselves. </P>
<P> ``I never said that I personally heard any of the jurors talking about the case. I have no knowledge of any jurors talking about the case. The only things that I said were possibilities, that the possibilities did exist,'' Jeanette Harris said on KCAL-TV. </P>
<P> The black 38-year-old employment counselor, who was booted off the jury Wednesday, said she had contacted Judge Lance Ito's office to tell him she had been misquoted in an earlier KCAL report. </P>
<P> Her denial came after the judge told attorneys he would order a two-pronged inquiry -- one into jury misconduct and the other into Harris' allegations that sheriff's deputies guarding the sequestered panel had promoted ``racial problems'' in the mixed-race group. </P>
<P> Testimony in the Simpson trial was on hold for the second straight day Friday as three jurors recovered from a bout of stomach flu, but Ito created a stir by issuing a critical evidentiary ruling. </P>
<P> In a written decision, Ito rejected an effort by the former football star's defense team to mount a new challenge to the admissibility of the prosecution's crucial DNA evidence. </P>
<P> Ito denied a defense request to halt the trial and hold lengthy hearings outside the presence of the jury on a battery of test results on blood and hair samples linked to last summer's murders of Simpson's ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman. </P>
<P> In early January, Simpson's attorneys had decided to forgo separate hearings on the admissibility of DNA evidence, saying they would instead challenge the scientific reliability of the test results. </P>
<P> DNA testing, a kind of genetic fingerprinting, is considered crucial to the prosecutors' case, providing what they say is a direct link between Simpson and the murder scene. </P>
<P> But Harris remained the focal point of the day's developments. She first surfaced only hours after her dismissal Wednesday, telling KCAL in an on-air interview that prosecutors had so far presented ``a whole lot of nothing'' and predicting that the trial would end with a hung jury. </P>
<P> KCAL reported that, following the interview, Harris told the station's reporters that jurors had discussed the case among themselves -- a serious violation of the judge's orders. </P>
<P> But Harris said Friday her remarks to the reporters had been ``misinterpreted.'' </P>
<P> Harris said she was describing in the off-air conversation how the jurors formed cliques among themselves, ``a group of five here, two here, three here, but that's not to say they talked about the case.'' </P>
<P> She also denied saying jurors had made up their minds as to Simpson's guilt or innocence. ``I never heard any jurors saying they had made their minds up,'' she said. </P>
<P> Harris said she had expressed her feeling that Simpson was innocent because it had been drummed into the jurors that the football legend was innocent until proven guilty, and the prosecution ``has not presented a case to me, myself.'' </P>
<P> Harris stuck by her assertion that some sheriff's deputies were promoting racial unrest by acting in an ``unprofessional manner,'' favoring white jurors over black. The panel is made up of eight blacks, three white and one Hispanic. </P>
<P> Harris initially spoke to KCAL after being dismissed from the panel by Ito for failing to disclose she was the victim of spousal abuse in 1988 -- an allegation she flatly denied. </P>
<P> Ito has asked KCAL-TV for a videotape of the interview with Harris so that he can review it. The jury is not due to return to court until Tuesday as Ito has other matters to attend to Monday. </P>
