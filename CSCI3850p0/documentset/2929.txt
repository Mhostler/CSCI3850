<P>  A delegation of U.S. academics left for Cuba Wednesday on what they said was the first of a series of ''illegal'' trips to protest U.S. government restrictions on travel to the communist-ruled Caribbean island. </P>
<P> The scholars left Washington, D.C. on a flight to the Bahamas, where they intended to board a flight to Cuba, said a spokeswoman for the Center for International Policy, which plans a number of acts of ``civil disobedience'' in coming months. </P>
<P> The delegation said it was challenging the constitutionality of currency restrictions which ``effectively ban travel to Cuba,'' as well as a rule requiring academics to obtain licenses from the Treasury Department in order to travel to the island. </P>
<P> The U.S. government on Aug. 20 tightened restrictions on scholars who travel to Cuba to do research. </P>
<P> The five-person delegation was headed by Dr. Wayne Smith, a former head of the U.S. Interests Section in Cuba and currently a visiting professor at Johns Hopkins University. </P>
<P> In a statement, Smith said the license requirement is ''tantamount to state censorship. </P>
<P> ``What right does the Treasury Department have to decide whether my research is valid?'' he said. </P>
<P> The protesters, also backed by the New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights, said they intend to send an ``illegal'' delegation to Cuba monthly until the restrictions are repealed. </P>
<P> The Treasury Department will look into whether the group violated U.S. regulations, a department spokesman said. </P>
