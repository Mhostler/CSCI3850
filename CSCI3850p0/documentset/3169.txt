<P>  Maj. Gen. Rupert Smith, who next month takes over as commander of U.N. forces in Bosnia, is a private man with a fine tactical mind who distinguished himself in the dash for Kuwait during the 1991 Gulf War. </P>
<P> The United Nations announced Monday that Smith would take over from Lt. Gen. Michael Rose on Jan. 24. </P>
<P> Smith, 51, known for his stamina and coolness under fire, has a fine military pedigree -- he joined the tough Parachute Regiment from Sandhurst military academy in 1964 and was appointed Colonel Commandant, an honorary position, in July. </P>
<P> Naturally reticent, Smith's style under the international media spotlight in Bosnia is expected to be more low-key than that of Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Rose who hands over to Smith on Jan. 24. </P>
<P> ``Smith was never one for the limelight,'' one serving army officer said of the incoming commander. ``He's got a sharp mind, (he is) firm and quietly spoken.'' </P>
<P> Like Rose, Smith has a reputation as a brave action man. He won the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in Kuwait and the Queen's Gallantry Medal for rescuing a fellow officer injured in a car bomb explosion in Northern Ireland. </P>
<P> Like Rose, Smith is a ``thinking man's soldier'' who can swiftly marshal the details of a complex plan. Military analysts say he would be an ideal organizer of any withdrawal of U.N. forces which might take place from Bosnia. </P>
<P> Smith's appointment in 1992 as Assistant Chief of the Defense Staff (ACDS) to oversee operational planning for all three armed services showed the high esteem with which he is held in the ministry of defense. </P>
<P> As ACDS, a post he held until November 1994, Smith was closely involved in Britain's role in former Yugoslavia and is said to have impressed U.N. and NATO officials with his clear presentation of options and his grasp of facts. </P>
<P> Smith, who has a lively sense of humor and a critical eye, is known to have played a crucial role in briefing the foreign ministers of the five-power Contact Group at their meeting in Geneva in July, military analysts said. </P>
<P> Born in World War II, Smith was a noted boxer at school and enlisted as a private in the Duke of Edinburgh's Regiment. He was commissioned into the Parachute Regiment in 1964. </P>
<P> He has served in Kenya, British Guyana, Australia, Malta, Libya, Cyprus, Malaysia, Belize, Zimbabwe, Northern Ireland, France and Germany. </P>
<P> Smith attended Staff College in 1975 and served with the British Military Advisory and Training Team in Zimbabwe. </P>
<P> He commanded the 3rd Battalion The Parachute Regiment between 1982 and 1985. He was promoted to Colonel and in December 1986 he took over command of 6 Airmobile Brigade. </P>
<P> Married with two children, Smith was appointed commander of 1st Armored Division on Oct. 29, 1990, and deployed with his headquarters to Saudi Arabia to lead the division during the Gulf War. </P>
