<P> Russia's proposed sale of nuclear technology to Iran to help it complete a nuclear power plant was one of the most sensitive questions facing the two men at their summit. </P>
<P> Yeltsin, answering questions at the same news conference, said the contract with Iran had been legal although there had been ``military and peaceful elements'' in it. </P>
<P> ``We have agreed to divide them and as far as the military part is concerned -- nuclear fuel, centrifuge -- we decided to exclude these questions, that means the military part falls away and only the peaceful part remains,'' the Kremlin chief said. </P>
<P> Clinton said he and Yeltsin had agreed to refer the question of Russia's sale of nuclear reactors to Iran to a commission headed by U.S. Vice-President Al Gore and Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. </P>
