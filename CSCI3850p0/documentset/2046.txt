<P>  At least 20 workers underwent medical observation after apparent exposure to a suspected cyanide leak Saturday at a chemical plant in nearby Deer Park, Texas, a plant official said. </P>
<P> Jack Coe, a spokesman with Rohm and Haas Co, said some contract employees working in a Rohm and Haas plant cyanide unit that was shut down for annual maintenance experienced ``classic exposure syptoms of cyanide'' Saturday afternoon. </P>
<P> The symptoms included vomiting and dizziness. Two of the workers lost consciousness. </P>
<P> The two workers and 12 others with exposure syptoms were sent to local hospitals for observation, Coe said. The symptoms were not believed to be life threatening. </P>
<P> Coe said the affected employees had been working in the cyanide unit and nearby areas of the plant. All but one were contract workers employed by other companies. </P>
<P> One Rohm and Haas employee was among those with exposure symptoms. </P>
<P> Six other workers went to the plant's medical clinic for observation, Coe said. </P>
<P> Rohm and Haas has not been able to confirm if there was a cyanide leak, said Coe, but he stated the company feels that ''cyanide had something to do with the first group of exposures.'' </P>
<P> The cyanide unit in the chemical facility produces between 200 million and 250 million pounds a year of acetone cyanide, a building block for chemicals used to manufacture car parts and other consumer products. </P>
