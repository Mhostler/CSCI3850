<DATELINE>LONDON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Prime Minister John Major, battling to keep the Northern Ireland peace process alive, assured the people of the British-ruled province Wednesday they had nothing to fear from controversial Anglo-Irish peace proposals. </P>
<P> Major used a rare broadcast to the nation to try to limit the political damage done by a report that London and Dublin were poised to impose cross-border economic bodies between Northern Ireland and Ireland with radical executive powers. </P>
<P> ``Judge our proposals as a whole. There is nothing for you to fear,'' said Major, in only his third televised broadcast since he became prime minister in November 1990. </P>
<P> The report, in The Times of London newspaper, infuriated pro-British Protestants in Northern Ireland. They read it as confirmation of their worst fears that the province would one day be reunited with the predominantly Catholic republic of Ireland after seven decades of partition. </P>
<P> ``My aim is lasting peace. For the first time in 25 years, we have a real chance of achieving this. It should not be thrown away by fears that are unreal and accusations that are untrue,'' Major said. </P>
<P> He said no political changes in Northern Ireland, which has been at peace for five months after rival republican and Protestant guerrillas called off a 25-year-old civil war, would occur without the consent of the province's Protestant majority. </P>
<P> ``Let me say to you tonight: nothing is going to be IMPOSED in Northern Ireland. Peace cannot be secured by coercion. New arrangements will only work if they are agreed by the people of Northern Ireland -- supported by them and operated by them.'' </P>
<P> Although Major ruled out ceding sovereignty, he said the peace plan would suggest areas for cooperation between Northern Ireland and the republic. </P>
<P> ``Cross-border cooperation is not a new idea. People on both sides of the border and both sides of the community can see the sense in this. </P>
<P> ``But there is one crucial point. Any North/South bodies must be accountable to the people of Northern Ireland. They will not be run by London, and they cannot and will not be overridden by the British and Irish governments,'' Major said. </P>
<P> Major's minority government is vitally dependent on the parliamentary support of Protestant Unionist politicians, who promptly warned Wednesday that they would withdraw their backing if the leaked plans became government policy. </P>
<P> ``This is completely unacceptable... If the government endorses this, there is no question of us being able to maintain any sort of relationship with them -- in fact quite the reverse,'' leading Unionist David Trimble told BBC Radio. </P>
<P> But Major, who has made Northern Ireland a personal priority, appealed to all sides not to throw away the chance for peace. Every honourable avenue to a settlement must be explored. </P>
<P> ``The government is working for a peaceful future in Northern Ireland. Tonight, I ask for time, And I ask for trust. And I promise to pursue a lasting peace,'' the prime minister said. </P>
<P> Earlier, both the British and Irish governments condemned the leak as extremely unhelpful to their 13-month-old efforts to cement peace after a civil war that claimed 3,000 lives. </P>
<P> Irish Prime Minister John Bruton said the leak could damage ``the entire process toward peace and reconciliation.'' </P>
<P> His foreign minister, Dick Spring, called the Times report tendentious and selective: ``Its manifest purpose is to alarm Unionists rather than to inform the public, and full allowance must be made for the blatant political agenda behind it.'' </P>
<P> Martin McGuinness, a senior member of Sinn Fein, the Irish Republican Army's political wing, blamed supporters of Northern Ireland's 300-year-old union with Britain for the leak. </P>
<P> ``It is an attempt to destabilise the peace process,'' he said after the latest in a series of exploratory talks with British officials in Belfast. </P>
