<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  National Hockey League commissioner Gary Bettman said Thursday that the season would not begin as scheduled October 1 unless an agreement is reached with the NHL Players' Association on a collective bargaining agreement. </P>
<P> Bettman said he feared that NHL players might follow the path of their professional brethren in Major League Baseball and interrupt the season with a strike if a contract was not signed. </P>
<P> ``In light of the experience of Major League Baseball, the NHL is not prepared to open a season that is subject to be lost prior to its conclusion,'' Bettman said in a telephone news conference. </P>
<P> ``We believe the prudent course of action is to put the season on hold and try to reach an agreement. We want a complete regular season with playoffs, and without distractions and most importantly without risk of a strike.'' </P>
<P> Representatives for the Players' Association and owners have been without a collective bargaining agreement since September 15, 1993 and the threat of a lockout has hung over the upcoming season. </P>
<P> ``The most unstable thing we could do would be to start the season without an agreement,'' the NHL commissioner said. </P>
<P> Union chief Bob Goodenow, in Las Vegas where he is briefing members of the Edmonton Oilers on the state of negotiations, held a teleconference of his own after Bettman's. </P>
<P> ``We played all last year without a contract,'' said Goodenow, who did not share Bettman's belief that a strike was a near certainty, and described a postponement of the start of the season as a ``lockout''. </P>
<P> ``We want to help to build and grow this game together. This is strictly a pressure play,'' he said. ``It was not unexpected.'' </P>
<P> Bettman said that he had not given up hope of reaching an agreement in time to begin the season as scheduled. </P>
<P> ``I'm prepared to meet 24 hours a day, seven days a week,'' he said. </P>
<P> Representatives for NHL players and owners are expected to resume full-scale negotiations Monday in Toronto. </P>
<P> Bettman said training camps will remain open even if the season openers are postponed. </P>
<P> Both sides met for over five hours Wednesday in New York but no progress was reported. That meeting followed a seven-hour negotiating session Tuesday. </P>
<P> Bettman said the NHL was determined to find a ``sensible system'' by which the game could grow and stressed again that it was not insisting on a salary cap -- the stumbling block that led baseball players to strike last month in an action that led to cancellation of the playoffs and World Series. </P>
<P> ``We are not asking for a cap on salaries. The Players' Association has concurred with that after reviewing our contract proposal,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``In fact, our proposal specifically says that it involves no limit on what a team can spend on either an individual player or a team as a whole.'' </P>
<P> Goodenow has said there will be no agreement that includes anything resembling a limit on salaries. </P>
<P> Bettman, also citing a brief NHL players strike in 1992, insisted it would be a mistake to start the season thinking the contract could be settled afterwards. </P>
<P> ``We saw what happened in baseball this year where the threat of a players' strike hung over the season and then a players' strike late in the year killed the season,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``You can turn a season into a complete disaster if you open without a collective bargaining agreement.'' </P>
<P> Both sides have proposed some form of ``tax'' be levied on the teams to deal with the rising costs of salaries for smaller market teams, but the percentages and system to be used are still in question. </P>
<P> Negotiations also involve rules on free agency. </P>
<P> ``If we work very hard there is enough time to make a deal by October 1,'' Bettman said. ``It will be difficult, arduous but not impossible.'' </P>
<P> Goodenow said the players were negotiating in good faith and that it would be a shame for the NHL not to build on the success the league achieved last year. </P>
<P> ``We're in training camp now. This is the owners' decision to postpone or lock out,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``There is an opportunity here, given the foundation that was laid by the exciting season and playoffs. Hockey is poised for a great season.'' </P>
