<P>  The State Department Wednesday said abuses will not end overnight in Haiti and urged patience as U.S. troops begin deploying there. </P>
<P> Defending the U.S. operation on the Caribbean island after U.S. troops Tuesday stood by while Haitian police attacked crowds of demonstrators, spokesman Mike McCurry said: ``Will those abuses end overnight? ... Obviously not ... I believe patience is required as we set up this operation and make it functional.'' </P>
<P> McCurry said the situation in Haiti did not yet amount to the kind of secure and stable environment the United States aimed to create there. He also said the violence Tuesday in Port-au-Prince, including an incident in which a coconut vendor was clubbed to death, was unacceptable. </P>
<P> But he said it was part of a pattern of abuse that has accelerated in Haiti under the military regime and that will not be finally halted until exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide is returned to power and democracy is established. </P>
