<P>  Bosnian Serb war leaders, disavowed and isolated by Yugoslavia, began to fight back Saturday in their power struggle with Belgrade. </P>
<P> The information minister of the self-styled Bosnian Serb republic said a speech by Yugoslav Federal President Zoran Lilic contained ``untruths and unseemly language.'' </P>
<P> Mirolsav Toholj, quoted by the Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA, said his people would not be bent from their opposition to an international peace plan. </P>
<P> In the mainly Muslim enclave of Bihac in northwest Bosnia, five children were killed and seven wounded when a shell landed on a crowd of students leaving a school. A U.N. spokesman said the shell came from a nearby Serb-held part of Croatia. Serb forces surround the Bihac enclave. </P>
<P> Serbian-led Yugoslavia, pressing Bosnian Serb hard-liners to accept a proposed territorial settlement with their Muslim and Croat foes, unleashed a scathing personal indictment of Karadzic and his government Friday. </P>
<P> Lilic accused the Bosnian Serb leadership of pursuing the war for personal gain, committing war crimes, sacrificing lives and deceiving their people. </P>
<P> He spoke in the name of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, who has turned against Bosnian Serb leaders in an attempt to end the Bosnian war and lift U.N. sanctions against Yugoslavia. </P>
<P> Lilic spoke contemptuously of the Bosnian Serb decision to hold a national referendum on the peace plan, which divides Bosnia in half after 28 months of fighting and requires Serbs to give up large tracts of territory. </P>
<P> Bosnian Serb leaders have already begun efforts to rally support for their battle against Belgrade. Radovan Karadzic, president of the self-styled republic, and his top officials met leaders of the rebel Serb Krajina enclave in Croatia. </P>
<P> The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said Karadzic met local Serb leader Milan Martic in Knin, capital of Krajina, to discuss the immediate unification of all Serb lands. </P>
<P> The Belgrade-based news agency Tanjug said the leaders signed a document calling for a unified Serb state but added that Martic, a Milosevic loyalist, said unification was not a realistic proposal at the moment. </P>
<P> Karadzic has planned a mass meeting in the north Bosnian town of Banja Luka on Sunday, to show Milosevic that he commands the loyalty of his people in his rejection of the peace plan. </P>
<P> A big, popular turnout would be a boost for Karadzic in his defiance of Belgrade, since Banja Luka is not normally regarded as one of his main centers of support. </P>
<P> Lilic singled out Karadzic for heavy personal criticism in his statement, which swamped the Belgrade press Saturday. </P>
<P> He also implied strong disapproval of Bosnian Serb Army (BSA) commander General Ratko Mladic by slamming the BSA attack on the Muslim enclave of Gorazde earlier this year. </P>
<P> The offensive was halted only after the United Nations threatened the BSA with NATO air attack, and senior Serb sources said it had been difficult to persuade Mladic to obey political instructions to pull back. </P>
<P> Belgrade's broadside against Karadzic laid down clear battle lines between the Bosnian Serb hard-liners and Milosevic, who has been accused by the West of fomenting the Bosnian war in pursuit of a Greater Serbia. </P>
<P> Lilic acknowledged that the peace plan drawn up by the five major powers was not perfect but said it was time for the Bosnian Serbs to sign even if Muslims and Croats were getting the better part of the deal. </P>
<P> In Bihac, U.N.-brokered talks between the Bosnian government and embattled rebel leader Fikret Abdic, who has lost much of the territory he held to a government assault, broke down over his refusal to declare his ministate null and void. </P>
<P> Abdic's defiance comes despite a U.N. assessment that his forces are no longer providing effective resistance and reports that thousands of refugees are fleeing his last stronghold, amid chaotic scenes, and are trying to enter nearby Croatia. </P>
