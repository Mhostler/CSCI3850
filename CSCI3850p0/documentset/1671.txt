<P>  A radical Nigerian lawyer, angry at the failure of his country's rulers to develop the west African nation, plans to launch a political party to vie for power, his aides said Thursday. </P>
<P> They said Gani Fawehinmi, a leading crusader against military rule, would launch his National Conscience Saturday, Nigeria's 34th independence anniversary. </P>
<P> ``On October 1st, National Conscience (NC), which at the moment is a human rights movement, will metamorphose and transform into a political party,'' Fawehinmi said in a magazine interview published this week. </P>
<P> If he goes ahead it will be the first political party to be launched openly and in defiance of military ruler General Sani Abacha's ban on political activity. </P>
<P> Fawehinmi, 56, has been in and out of jail more than a dozen times in close to 10 years for his uncompromising challenge to military authorities. </P>
<P> Anticipating that he may be arrested again to stop the launching, he has pre-recorded his declaration of National Conscience as a political party and sent tapes to the media. </P>
<P> Several activists are in detention over their campaign to oust Abacha and install Moshood Abiola, the businessman deemed to have won last year's annulled vote, who is in jail and on trial for proclaiming himself president last June. </P>
<P> ``The October 1 declaration will be in defiance of the military regime. It will be an unarmed confrontation to the junta,'' Fawehinmi said. </P>
<P> According to the Lagos-based lawyer, more than a quarter of a million people have registered as members of National Conscience, with nearly 4,000 coordinators in place nationwide. </P>
<P> ``The right to an enduring and true democracy based on the abolition of poverty,'' is the party's main objective, according to the constitution which has been printed and distributed. </P>
<P> Nigeria, ruled by soldiers for 24 out of its 34 years of independence, remains backward amid mass poverty despite being one of the world's biggest oil producers. </P>
<P> A Yoruba from the southwest like Abiola, Fawehinmi has one of the biggest law practices in Nigeria and is reputed to have spent much of his own money awarding scholarships to the poor. </P>
