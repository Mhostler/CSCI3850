<P>  A 14-year-old British boy, missing for five days after running away to Malaysia using his father's passport and credit card, is recuperating from his strange odyssey with a British family, the British High Commission said Monday. </P>
<P> Peter Kerry was found by Malaysian citizens in the northern town of Kota Baru, near the border with Thailand, and taken to the home of a British national there, a high commission spokesman said. </P>
<P> A number of British nationals live in the Kota Baru area because British companies are involved in building the huge Pergau Dam project 60 miles from the city, the state capital of Kelantan. </P>
<P> The spokesman said he ``didn't have a clue'' how Kerry made his way to Kota Baru. He left his home in Harrow, North London, without telling anyone Tuesday after a row with his father over a spilled can of spaghetti. </P>
<P> ``He must have had a nice smile and hitchhiked,'' the spokesman added. </P>
<P> Discussions were going on with the Malaysian authorities for Kerry's early return to Britain. </P>
<P> ``We hope they will treat the matter as sympathetically as possible,'' he said, adding that the boy was ``well but tired'' and that his parents have been told. </P>
<P> Kerry telephoned his parents from Malaysia Thursday to say he was broke and stranded after a hotel in the southern Malaysian city of Johor Baru refused to let him check in after his father's credit card was cancelled. </P>
<P> They said the boy, described as 5 feet 11 inches tall and well built, looked old enough to be on his own. </P>
<P> His father, John, has hit out at what he called lax passport controls that allowed Peter to flee Britain. </P>
<P> ``We don't look anything like each other,'' Kerry, 59, told Sky television Saturday, conceding his son was tall and well-built for his age but adding: ``There's a tremendous difference, obviously, in age. I'm dark, he's fair.'' </P>
