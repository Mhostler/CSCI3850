<DATELINE>DURBAN, April 20 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of South Africa's Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party, on Thursday dismissed speculation he would quit his cabinet post in protest at stalled foreign mediation on the country's constitution. </P>
<P> ``I don't know where they got that from. As far as I'm concerned there is no such thing on our agenda,'' Buthelezi told reporters in response to reports he might consider such a move. </P>
<P> But Buthelezi, home affairs minister in President Nelson Mandela's government, said South Africa was facing the same problems as it did a year ago, during the countdown to the country's first all-race elections. </P>
<P> ``I find it very painful to say that I find the position now that we are in is exactly the same position as we were in before the 19th of April last year,'' he said, commenting on the period before an agreement on international mediation brought Inkatha into the polls at the 11th hour. </P>
<P> Inkatha, which wants strong regional powers to be entrenched in the new constitution, accuses Mandela's ruling African National Congress (ANC) of ignoring the mediation agreement, which included the then-ruling National Party. </P>
<P> The ANC says foreign mediation cannot take place until parameters have been set. </P>
<P> ``It's exactly the same with all the dangers...the possibility of dangers and instability exactly as we were. This is what pains me very much,'' Buthelezi told reporters outside a KwaZulu-Natal prayer meeting. </P>
<P> Inkatha's decision-making national council is to discuss on Friday what to do in the wake of the party's pull-out from the assembly drafting the constitution two weeks ago in protest at the mediation crisis. </P>
<P> The ANC won overall control and seven out of nine regions in last year's polls. Inkatha holds power in KwaZulu-Natal and the National Party in the Western Cape. </P>
