<P>  Haiti's military-backed president Emile Jonassaint said Wednesday that the United States was pushing his country toward a civil war. </P>
<P> Jonassaint accused the U.S. government of failing to honor an agreement he signed September 18 with former U.S. president Jimmy Carter that allowed 18,000 troops to enter Haiti peacefully to pave the way for a return of democratically elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. </P>
<P> The 81-year-old former Supreme Court justice said in a statement that American troops were interfering with Haitian institutions and he accused U.S. diplomats of manipulating the country's political life. </P>
<P> ``I'm obliged to note the intolerable and unacceptable interference of members of the American military mission in the functioning of institutions of the Haitian state,'' he said in the statement read to a news conference. </P>
<P> Jonassaint also denounced the ``subversive'' activity of ''certain members of the American diplomatic mission, who manipulate the national political life, increasing the risk of a civil war.'' </P>
<P> Jonassaint's complaints came hours after the United States flew exiled parliamentarians back to the Caribbean nation to get its fractious legislature running again. </P>
<P> With hundreds of gun-toting U.S. soldiers ringing the building, Haiti's parliament met to debate an amnesty demanded by Haitian military rulers in the deal brokered by Carter that averted an all-out invasion. </P>
<P> Under the agreement, military leader Lieutenant General Raoul Cedras and two other leaders of the coup that ousted Aristide in 1991 must step down by October 15. </P>
<P> U.S. troops also sealed Port-au-Prince's City Hall with barbed wire fences and Thursday will reinstate the city's legitimate mayor Evans Paul to his office for the first time in three years. </P>
<P> American forces have extended their patrols throughout the capital and U.S. military police squads have visited Haitian police stations to oversee their operations. </P>
<P> Haitian security forces and paramilitary groups that terrorized the population have curtailed their activities since the American forces arrived. while Haitians have shed their fear and taken to the streets in increasing numbers to call for Aristide's return. </P>
