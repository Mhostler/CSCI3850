<P>  NATO aircraft flew over Bihac Friday but were unable to locate any targets and returned safely to base after being fired at by SAM-6 missiles, U.N. Under Secretary-General Kofi Annan said. </P>
<P> ``But I suspect the planes will be back tomorrow,'' he added. </P>
<P> Annan, who is in charge of U.N. peacekeeping, told reporters that, after a number of shells landed during the afternoon in the U.N.-designated ``safe area'' of Bihac, NATO planes were called in to provide close air support to protect U.N. troops and civilians in the Serb-besieged town. </P>
<P> ``The air flights were in the air for 60 minutes and they did not locate any of the targets. They were shot at by two or three SAM-6 missiles, which did not hit any of the NATO planes and all the planes returned to base,'' he said. </P>
<P> Air power had been called in ``to silence the shelling from close quarters to the city,'' Annan said. </P>
<P> ``We have not been able to hit any targets, but I suspect the planes will be back tomorrow. That in itself is an indication of the resolve of the international community,'' he added. </P>
<P> In reply to questions, he said that, because of the situation on the ground, air power could not be used to break the siege of Bihac. </P>
<P></P>
<P> ``That may be an option, but how would the Serbs react? Would they indeed withdraw? Would they take some of the (U.N.) troops hostages? Would they go for our soft targets -- unarmed military observers, aid workers and so forth ?'' </P>
<P> Annan said this was a highly complex and difficult situation ``and our poor commanders on the ground are required on almost an hourly basis to manage this fluid, ambiguous and unpredictable situation. </P>
<P> ``It is a situation that requires keen judgment and we cannot get into a tit-for-tat sort of reaction.'' </P>
