<P>  Former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi faces a fresh probe by anti-graft magistrates, newspapers reported Wednesday. </P>
<P> Unsourced press reports, which could not be confirmed, said ``Clean Hands'' investigators in Milan believed they may have grounds to proceed against the billionaire businessman on suspicion of running a slush fund for under-the-table payments. </P>
<P> Meanwhile, the media mogul's spokesman, Jas Gawronski said he was not sure if Berlusconi ``had the chance and the opportunity of going back to the prime minister's office he would do it.'' </P>
<P> Milan's chief prosecutor Francesco Saverio Borrelli denied Tuesday that Berlusconi, who resigned as prime minister last December, had been officially told he was under investigation. </P>
<P> But the newspapers said the ``Clean Hands'' office had taken a first step of registering Berlusconi's name on a list of people they may formally investigate for alleged false accounting. </P>
<P> The reports, which appeared in all leading dailies, said Berlusconi's younger brother and business associate Paolo and Salvatore Sciascia, an executive at Berlusconi's Fininvest holding company, were also on the list. </P>
<P> All three men are already under investigation for suspected corruption over payments totalling $205,000 which magistrates allege three Fininvest companies used to bribe finance police in return for favorable tax audits. </P>
<P> Berlusconi, who was advised of that investigation last November, has denied any knowledge of the payments at the time they were made. </P>
<P> He said after he was questioned last month that magistrates did not have any evidence to implicate him and were part of a political vendetta to topple him from office. </P>
<P> La Stampa newspaper said magistrates suspected that the payments, which Berlusconi says were extorted by rapacious finance police, may have come from a fund created in Switzerland using money from falsified Fininvest balance sheets. </P>
