<P>  Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy has ordered a relief package developed for the families of the 14 firefighters killed battling wildfires in Colorodo last week, a department official said Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``The secretary has instructed us to develop a relief package that would provide compensation and assistance to the families of the deceased,'' Jim Lyons, Agriculture Department assistant secretary for natural resources, told reporters. </P>
<P> Many of these were seasonal employees, Lyons said, pointing out they don't have health benefits or life insurance as any other federal employee would have life insurance. </P>
<P> He said there are limits to the amount of financial assistance we can provide for funerals, etc. </P>
<P> Thirteen of the 14 firefighters killed in the Glenwood Spring wildfire July 6 were employees of the department's U.S. Forest Service. The other firefighter worked for the Department of Interior's Bureau of Land Management. </P>
<P> The 14 firefighters, including four women, were burned to death on a mountain ridge when the fast-moving flames overtook them. </P>
