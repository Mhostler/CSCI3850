<DATELINE>CHICAGO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of Chicago Wednesday disclosed a moving year-end reconciliation meeting with the former seminary student who accused him of sexual abuse but later withdrew the charges. </P>
<P> ``Never in my 43 years as a priest have I witnessed a more profound reconciliation,'' he said. ``The words I am using to tell you this story cannot begin to describe the power of God's grace which was at work that afternoon.'' </P>
<P> Bernardin released a four-page statement detailing a meeting he had with AIDS victim Steven Cook in Philadelphia on Dec. 30, about 10 months after Cook dropped his abuse suit against the cardinal. </P>
<P> Cook, 34, had alleged Bernardin assaulted him in the mid-1970s when the cardinal was archbishop of Cincinnati. The 65-year-old Bernardin was the highest-ranking U.S. Catholic cleric ever accused of sexual improprieties. </P>
<P> In his statement Bernardin said he sensed that Cook wanted to see him, and he contacted the parish to which Cook's mother belongs to set up a meeting. The two met at St. Charles Borromeo Seminary in Philadelphia for two hours. </P>
<P> ``Steven's apology was simple, direct, deeply moving,'' Benardin said. ``I told him I had prayed for him every day and would continue to pray for his health and peace of mind. It was very evident that he was in precarious health.'' </P>
<P> He said he offered to celebrate Mass with Cook but Cook at first refused saying he was alienated from God and the church. </P>
<P> ``I reached into my briefcase and brought out a Bible which I had purchased for him the day before. I told him I would not be offended if he did not accept it. With tears in his eyes, he reached for the Bible and held it tightly to his chest,'' Bernardin said. </P>
<P> ``Then I took out of the briefcase a chalice which someone (whom I had never met) had sent with the request that I offer a Mass for Steven. I told Steven that even if I did not celebrate Mass on the occasion of our visit, I would do so later. </P>
<P> ``Again with tears in his eyes he said 'Please, let's celebrate Mass' ... it was a manifestation of God's love, forgiveness and healing which I will never forget.'' </P>
<P> Bernardin said he anointed Cook and in a brief homily during Mass in the seminary chapel said ``we cannot run away from our family,'' including the spiritual family of the church. </P>
<P> ``Before Steven left, he told me that a big burden had been lifted from him. He felt healed and was at peace,'' Bernardin said. </P>
<P> ``Steven is very realistic about his future. Happily our exchange and the celebration of the sacraments were the instruments God used to give him the peace and courage he needs in the time he has left.'' </P>
