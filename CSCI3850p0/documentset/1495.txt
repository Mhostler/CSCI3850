<P>  A Tamil separatist rebel suicide squad rammed a navy patrol boat off Sri Lanka's northwestern coast and at least 33 sailors were feared dead, a military spokesman said Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``Sixteen members of the crew have been rescued and have been evacuated to a hospital. There may have been between 40 to 50 sailors on board because it was a fairly large offshore patrol craft,'' said Brigadier Gemunu Kulatunga of the Defense Ministry's Operational Headquarters. </P>
<P> The body of only one sailor has been recovered so far, he said. Other military sources said seven bodies had been found and the crew numbered 60. </P>
<P> The sources said five rebels were also believed to have died in the evening attack in the waters between Mannar Island and Kalpitiya. </P>
<P> The rebels, from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, are fighting for a separate state for their 2.5 million minority Tamil community in the island's north and east. </P>
<P> The boat, M.V. Sagarawardene, was on a routine patrol when it was rocked by two explosions. It was then attacked by a flotilla of rebel craft, the military sources said. </P>
<P> The boat has partially sunk about five miles off the coast. Kulatunga said the explosions occurred when the craft had stopped, probably to inspect what was thought to be a fishing vessel. </P>
<P> Air force planes and navy gunboats combed the area for survivors and the attackers. </P>
<P> Last week the rebels seized three fishing boats and their 20 occupants off Kalpitiya. </P>
<P> The latest attack may jeopardize proposed peace talks between the new People's Alliance government and the rebels. </P>
<P> Prime Minister Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga's new administration has invited the rebels for talks to end their 11-year-old secessionist campaign, in which more than 30,000 people have died. </P>
<P> She also eased a four-year-old economic embargo on the rebel-controlled north. The rebels responded by freeing 10 policemen held hostage since June, 1990, when they broke off peace talks with the former United National Party government. </P>
<P> The rebels have accepted the invitation for new talks. </P>
