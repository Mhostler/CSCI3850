<P>  A U.S. Navy fighter plane crashed into the ocean off the southern California coast during routine training maneuvers Saturday night, and the pilot is still missing, Navy officials said Sunday. </P>
<P> This latest crash -- the second in two weeks -- occurred off the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln. The jet, an FA-18 single-seat fighter, is part of Strike Fighter Squadron 22 based at Lemoore Naval Air Station near here and assigned to the carrier. </P>
<P> The cause of the accident, which is being investigated, is unknown, officials said. </P>
<P> Navy spokeswoman Fely Schaible said a search for the pilot was launched immediately after the crash. The pilot's identity is being withheld pending notification to his family. </P>
<P> It is not known whether the pilot ejected before the plane hit the water, officials said. </P>
<P> They said the Lemoore-based jets were training in preparation for deployment, but no further details were available. </P>
<P> This latest jet fighter crash came just 15 days after two Navy F-14 Tomcats collided over the Pacific about 70 miles south of San Diego. All four crewmen involved in that mishap ejected safely and were pulled from the water. </P>
<P> In October, Navy Lt.KKara Hultgren, 29, was killed when her F-14A Tomcat also went down in the ocean during routine training. At that time, Hultgren was one of only two female Navy pilots trained for combat. </P>
