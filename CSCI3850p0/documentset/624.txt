<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Police on Friday were hunting for a man claiming to be the notorious ``Zodiac'' gunman who was linked to four 1990 shootings and now says he's on another rampage. </P>
<P> The gunman sent letters to the New York Post claiming to be Zodiac, but police were unsure whether he was in fact the shooter who killed one and wounded three others in 1990. </P>
<P> ``To say that these cases are related would be premature at this time,'' New York City Police Chief of Detectives Joseph Borrelli said at a news conference. </P>
<P> In the letter received this week, the writer provided details of five attacks that left two people dead and two others wounded. </P>
<P> ``We have verified four of the five incidents,'' Borrelli said. </P>
<P> He said detectives have not confirmed the fifth shooting incident, which took place June 11. </P>
<P> Police never captured Zodiac, who taunted them through letters boasting of their failure to find him after each attack in 1990. The letters contained signs of the zodiac, hence the nickname. </P>
<P> Borrelli said there were some obvious similarities about both cases but declined to go into details, instead urging the gunman to surrender. </P>
<P> Detectives who worked on the original Zodiac case were studying the latest letter in which the writer ridicules police for failing to find him. </P>
<P> Borrelli said there were some inconsistancies between the two cases. The original Zodiac always used a gun. In one of the latest attacks, a knife was used. </P>
