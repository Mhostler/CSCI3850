<P>  Police using horses and helicopters searched a cemetery for two missing South Carolina toddlers Thursday while a television report said the childrens' mother had failed a second lie detector test. </P>
<P> The search by central Georgia authorities was called off after failing to find any evidence of the missing boys, allegedly snatched more than a week ago in a South Carolina carjacking, Bibb County sheriff Robbie Johnson said. </P>
<P> The police search near Macon, Ga. was the latest in a long line of tips and leads investigated by authorities trying to find Michael and Alex Smith, ages 14 months and three-years-old. </P>
<P> An elderly man in the area told police he had seen a car matching the description of the one that was carjacked driving out of the Macon Memorial Cemetery a week ago. </P>
<P> FBI divers searched a murky pond at the cemetery, which was closely inspected by police on horseback and in the heat-detecting helicopters, but they came up empty handed. </P>
<P> The boys' estranged parents, Susan and Michael Smith of Union, S.C., insisted meanwhile that they had no idea of the childrens' whereabouts. </P>
<P> The two toddlers disappeared from a rural highway near Union on Oct. 25 when, according to Mrs. Smith, a man commandeered her burgundy Mazda Protege, forced her to drive several miles out of town, and then pushed her out and drove off with the two children in the back seat. </P>
<P> Cable News Network, citing unidentified sources close to the case, said Thursday that Mrs. Smith had now failed two lie detector tests, however, apparently prompting a search of her home. One of the tests was adminstered by the FBI and the other by state investigators. </P>
<P> CNN also quoted a source as saying the case was now being viewed as a ``50-50 proposition,'' meaning that there is a 50 percent chance that the answer to the boys' whereabouts lies within the Smith family. </P>
<P> In an interview on the CBS television show ``This Morning,'' Mrs. Smith said that she had agreed to allow authorities to search her home Wednesday, but she did not know what they were looking for. </P>
<P> Smith and her husband, David, both denied knowing anything about the whereabouts of their two sons. </P>
<P> ``I did not have anything to do with the abduction of my children,'' Mrs. Smith said in the interview. </P>
<P> ``I don't think that any parent could love my children more than I do, and I would never even think about doing anything that would harm them,'' she added. ``It's really painful to have the finger pointed at you when it's your children involved.'' </P>
<P> Union County Sheriff Howard Wells declined to comment on the search of Mrs. Smith's home. </P>
<P> ``I'm not going to comment on anything we did yesterday or we may do today,'' he said. </P>
