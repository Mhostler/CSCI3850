<P>  Cobblers in the Russian city of Chelyabinsk have found a new use for almost worthless rouble coins -- reheeling women's shoes, Itar-Tass news agency reported Wednesday. </P>
<P> The one-ruble coins, each worth less than 0.05 of a U.S. cent, guarantee long-lasting, high-quality repairs to stiletto heels, the agency said, quoting newspapers in the Urals city. </P>
<P> Shoemakers charge up to $1.40 for the repairs but offer a discount if paid in coins, Tass said. </P>
