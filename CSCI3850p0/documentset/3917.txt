<P>  Cuba, engaged in a process of reform as it tries to emerge from economic crisis, announced a government reshuffle Tuesday that switched a string of ministers in the economic area of the administration. </P>
<P> The reshuffle, announced without comment in the ruling Communist Party newspaper Granma, was the second in the economic sphere since mid-1993 and appeared to signal willingness by President Fidel Castro's government to press on with changes to the state-run economy. </P>
<P> In moves which generally brought in younger faces to replace people in their late 50s or 60s, the reshuffle of some eight posts included the replacement of the governor of the central bank, 59-year-old Hector Rodriguez Llompart. </P>
<P> Taking his place will be 50-year-old Francisco Soberon Valdes, president of maritime group Acemex for the last 12 years. </P>
<P> Some leading figures in the economic sector such as Finance Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez, named in the last reshuffle in August 1993, were left unchanged. </P>
<P> But another key move was the replacement of Antonio Rodriguez Maurell, 53-year-old minister for the economy and planning, by Osvaldo Martinez, current director for the center for world economy studies and head of parliament's economic affairs committee. </P>
<P> Martinez, an energetic reform-minded technocrat in his early 40s, takes over a ministry that was formed in place of an old Soviet-style state committee last year and whose role in economic decision-making has not been quite clear up until now. </P>
<P> Martinez has been one of the public voices explaining changes to the economy that began in mid-1993 with Cuba mired deep in crisis after the collapse of its old trade and aid partner, the former Soviet Union. </P>
<P> Other changes in Tuesday's reshuffle included the replacement of Jose Naranjo Morales, 64-year-old minister of government and a long-time senior aide of Castro, by Wilfredo Lopez Rodriguez, 42 and currently second-in-charge of the Cuban leader's coordination and support team. </P>
<P> Labor and Social Security Minister Francisco Linares, 58, was replaced by the second in command at the country's umbrella trade union, Salvador Valdes Mesa. </P>
<P> Valdes Mesa, 48, has solid union credntials, which could be important as a signal that workers' interests are being defended at a time when they face restructuring of the state sector that is bound to mean job losses. </P>
<P> Deputy Basic Industries Minister Jesus Perez Othon, who has overseen the successful if modest recent increase in Cuba's domestic crude oil production, moved to the top job at the Light Industries Ministry, a sector deep in trouble amid Cuba's current chronic lack of resources. He took over from Eddy Fernandez Boada. </P>
<P> Internal Trade Minister Manuel Vila Sosa was replaced by the current deputy light industries minister, Barbara Castillo Cuesta, while veteran Fisheries Minister Jorge Fernandez Cuervo-Vinent was replaced by the deputy transport minister, Orlando Felipe Rodriguez Romay. </P>
<P> A deputy president of the cabinet with no portfolio, Lionel Soto Prieto, was named to other unspecified ministerial functions. Soto Prieto had been involved in trade negotiations with the former Soviet Union. </P>
