<P>  United Nations military observers from six countries are monitoring the activities of the 14,000 U.S. troops that are in Haiti to restore democratic rule, a U.S. military spokesman said Monday. </P>
<P> Two are from France, four from Bangladesh, two from Ireland, four from New Zealand, two from Djibouti and two from Guatemala. </P>
<P> ``Their role will be to observe operations of the multinational force within the framework of U.N. resolution 940 and to report to the secretary general on its implementation,'' U.S. military spokesman Colonel Barry Willey. </P>
<P> A team of two observers will be attached to each of the six battalions deployed in Haiti, he said. </P>
<P> Another 44 U.N. monitors were scheduled to arrive later in the week. </P>
<P> U.N. resolution 940 authorized a U.S.-led multinational force to restore exiled president Jean-Bertrand Aristide, deposed in a 1991 coup. Forces from 14 other countries are meant to arrive in Haiti to join the Americans, but have not arrived yet. </P>
<P> In a second phase not expected to take place until early next year, a U.N. mission will take over the U.S.-led operation with blue-helmet peacekeepers and policemen to train Haiti's police to become a democratic force. </P>
