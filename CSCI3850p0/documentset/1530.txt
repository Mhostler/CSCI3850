<P>  The Mideast peace process is is moving irrevocably forward and it will turn the region into a new economic power, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amre Moussa said Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``We shall offer the world other economic tigers, and very soon,'' he said. </P>
<P> The peace process ``is moving steadily toward success. The Middle East will be entering into a new era of open borders, active inter-relationships,'' he added. </P>
<P> ``We are not going to let it go ... to leave that process to fade or even weaken. It is our responsibility to make it succeed.'' </P>
<P> Moussa made the comments in a speech to the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations and the Mid-America Committee. </P>
<P> ``Comprehensive peace is within reach,'' he said. ``It is possible that the Syria-Israeli track would move ... steadily toward agreement.''  In response to a question about the rise in political violence from militant Islamic groups in Egypt, Moussa said ``to have a fundamentalist current, this is normal.'' </P>
<P> But he said such forces ``cannot impose their way of life on Egyptian society.'' </P>
