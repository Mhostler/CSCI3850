<P>  President Clinton Thursday worked behind the scenes in an effort to pick up more votes in the House to unblock a sweeping crime bill. </P>
<P> ``We're still working very hard on the crime bill and the president will do whatever he needs to do today to get that done,'' White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said. </P>
<P> Clinton remained largely out of sight for the fourth day in a row as he worked in the Oval Office to resurrect a $30 billion bill that was defeated a week ago in a stunning 225-210 procedural vote. </P>
<P> ``He'll make more phone calls on the crime bill,'' Myers told reporters. She said some members of the House might visit Clinton as well. </P>
<P> Clinton picked up the support of three House members Wednesday. </P>
<P> White House chief of staff Leon Panetta was also expected to visit Capitol Hill to press the White House initiatives on crime and health care reform. </P>
