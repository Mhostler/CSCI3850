<P>  Hundreds of radical Muslims marched on Saudi Arabia's embassy in London Friday, saying the Gulf state does not properly implement the Islamic faith. </P>
<P> ``Muslim land is not for sale,'' chanted the marchers, members of the Hizb ul Tahrir, on their route from the Regent's Park mosque. ``Israel your fate is sealed -- we will have our victory on the battlefield!'' </P>
<P> They carried banners saying: ``Muslim armies, do your duty -- Jihad (holy war).'' </P>
<P> Hizb ut Tahrir, which was founded in 1953, calls for fully observant Islamic government headed by a successor of the Prophet Mohammad. It considers no MIddle Eastern government legitimate since the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire after World War I. </P>
<P> Friday's demonstration was peaceful. </P>
