<P>  Vice President Al Gore underwent surgery Saturday night to repair an Achilles tendon he tore while playing basketball with former colleagues in the House of Representatives, a Gore spokeswoman said. </P>
<P> Gore, 46, was put under general anesthesia for the hour-and-10-minute surgery at Bethesda Naval Hospital in suburban Bethesda, Maryland. Gore spokeswoman Heidi Kukis said the operation by two orthopedic surgeons was successful and uncomplicated. </P>
<P> ``He is alert and awake with his family by his side,'' she said, referring to Gore's wife, Tipper, and their three daughters and son. </P>
<P> Gore was to remain in the hospital at least 24 hours. Kukis said he would be under surveillance throughout the night and a decision would be made Sunday whether he would spend a second night in the hospital. </P>
<P> The trim and fit vice president tore the tendon on his left leg when he landed after a jump during a basketball game in the House gymnasium between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. EDT (1400 and 1500 GMT) with his friends. </P>
<P> The Achilles tendon joins the muscles of the calf to the bone of the heel. Extreme cases can take painful months to heal. </P>
<P> Kukis said Gore has a splint for now on the lower left leg but no cast, and doctors believe he will not need one. Crutches will be required initially, she said. </P>
<P> Gore's long-term prognosis will be determined later in the weekend, she said. </P>
<P> President Clinton telephoned Gore to express his sympathies in advance of the operation, the spokeswoman said. </P>
<P> Gore, a former member of the House and former senator from Tennessee, is active in sports. He is a frequent jogger. </P>
<P> ``He plays basketball a lot with his friends,'' Kukis said. She said that after the injury, Gore's military aide ``said he was doing fine but that it is painful.'' </P>
<P> After he was examined by a doctor at his home at the U.S. Naval Observatory, he was transported to Bethesda Naval Hospital, where it was determined his injury would require surgery, said Kukis. </P>
<P> Kukis said Gore was still planning to leave on a trip to the Middle East on September 3. </P>
<P> The vice president had planned to be away by now with his wife, Tipper, and their children for their summer vacation but decided to remain in town to help press for passage of Clinton's initiatives on crime and health care reform. </P>
