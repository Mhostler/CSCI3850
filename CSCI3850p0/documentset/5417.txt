<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Nelson Mandela's African National Congress has effectively ruled out coalition rule in South Africa beyond 1999, but only short-sighted politicians ever believed it was on the cards, analysts said Monday. </P>
<P> ``There was never anything to suggest the government of national unity would be a legislated thing beyond 1999 ... It should come as no surprise,'' said economist Tony Twine. </P>
<P> The ANC won outright victory in historic all-race elections last year. </P>
<P> It opted, however, for a five-year national union government with the former ruling white-dominated National Party (NP), which created and then dismantled apartheid, and the Inkatha Freedom Party of Mangosuthu Buthelezi. </P>
<P> But ANC Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa, one of the men tipped to succeed the aging Mandela, bluntly crushed NP hopes at an ANC policy-making conference at the weekend. </P>
<P> ``There will be no enforced coalition rule beyond 1999. The NP (National Party) can eat their heart out,'' he said. </P>
<P> Mandela, 76, has said he will not run again. </P>
<P> Twine, from economic consultancy Econometrix, said he believed an alliance beyond 1999 would do more harm than good. </P>
<P> ``When the ANC (has) 63 percent of the popular vote, it could be asked why it is taking these other guys along with it. I'm not sure how healthy it would be. </P>
<P> ``Any democracy needs strong opposition. If you suck the opposition into government you are destroying one of the pillars of democracy,'' he said. </P>
<P> Steven Friedman, from the independent Center for Policy Studies, said only the NP had believed it could perpetuate a coalition and it had been out-maneuvered by the ANC in constitutional negotiations. </P>
<P> ``The National Party's problem, if it doesn't like being an opposition party, is what is it going to do about it,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``The old argument was that the NP had to be in government because the NP was the gateway to business, the civil service and the military. The problem is that statement is no longer accurate.'' </P>
<P> All three parties are involved in drafting South Africa's post-apartheid constitution. </P>
<P> The NP is pushing for an extended period of coalition rule, perhaps as long as 20 years, and the conservative Inkatha is anxious to win stronger powers for regional governments in South Africa's nine provinces. </P>
<P> Inkatha is trying to get the upperhand in a dispute over the Zulu monarchy. It has vowed to leave the process unless international mediators are appointed to resolve differences with the ANC, which favors strong central government. </P>
<P> Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, another front-runner for the presidency, said, ``We have adopted a comprehensive set of constitutional policy guidelines ... to provide the framework for the building of a united, non-racial, non-sexist and democratic South Africa on which government is based on democratic majority rule.'' </P>
<P> South Africa's interim constitution, which advocates more central government intervention in the provinces, was completed in November 1993 and expires in 1999. The government wants the final constitution completed by June 1996. </P>
<P> Mandela has in recent months papered over cracks in the unity government, which was perceived as essential for the newly-democratic country's stability and job creation after decades of apartheid isolation and resistance politics. </P>
<P> Analysts said they hoped by 1999 the transition would be complete and the white-led civil service inherited by the coalition government from the old apartheid order would become more interested in serving the government. </P>
