<DATELINE>BONN, Germany (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Germany has nearly completed the vast task of selling, destroying or giving away military equipment Bonn inherited from the former East German army after unification in 199 hundred thousand tons of ammunition. </P>
<P> ``The German army has completed all the contractual requirements for disposing of NVA (National People's Army) material,'' the ministry said in a statement. </P>
<P> Most of the weapons were destroyed by companies that won tenders for the work. More than 90 percent of the NVA material to be scrapped under terms of the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty has already been destroyed. </P>
<P> The treaty, signed in 1990 by members of NATO and the now-defunct Warsaw Pact, provided for cuts in tanks, armored vehicles and heavy equipment. </P>
<P> Humanitarian and disaster relief organisations were given some 7,000 vehicles, 3,000 trailers, 19 million pieces of clothing and other material. </P>
<P> The German army has also kept some of the equipment for its own use, such as 24 MiG-29 fighter jets. </P>
<P> ``A large part of the NVA material taken over has been disposed of in sales to the government and assistance to other states and the United Nations in the form of defense and humanitarian aid,'' the ministry said. </P>
<P> Some of this aid to NATO allies has caused controversy in Germany. Deliveries to Turkey have come under special scrutiny because of alleged human rights violations there. </P>
<P> Opposition parties have criticized the sale of 39 ships to Indonesia, which has also been accused of human rights violations. </P>
