<P>  Big Ben, the famous clock which towers over Britain's parliament, has been given ecologically correct lighting. </P>
<P> From Thursday, the four faces of the central London landmark will be lit by special energy-efficient bulbs. </P>
<P> Ray Powell, chairman of the House of Commons works committee, said the switch from lamps installed in 1957 will save electricity and contribute to a drive to cut parliament's energy consumption by 15 percent. </P>
<P> Big Ben was lit by gas until 1906 when electricity was introduced with 10 ordinary 100-watt bulbs behind each face. </P>
