<P>  President Ernesto Perez Balladares said Wednesday he would not grant asylum to deposed Haitian strongman Raoul Cedras unless exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide formally asked him. </P>
<P> ``We have not agreed on anything yet,'' Perez Balladares told reporters before leaving Panama to attend a regional meeting on the environment in Nicaragua. </P>
<P> ``We have made it clear ... that only if President Aristide sends a formal request will we consider asylum,'' Perez Balladares said. </P>
<P> The United States has asked Panama to take in Cedras, who stepped down Monday to allow for Aristide's return after U.S. forces moved into Haiti three weeks ago. </P>
<P> Perez Balladares faced some domestic opposition to the idea of granting asylum to Cedras and appearing to bow to U.S. demands. </P>
<P> Panama is sensitive about U.S. incursions in other nations since U.S. forces invaded it in 1990 and ousted its military ruler, Gen. Manuel Noriega, who was subsequently convicted on drug charges and jailed in Florida. </P>
<P> Cedras remained in a Port-au-Prince mansion early Wednesday, guarded by U.S. troops. </P>
