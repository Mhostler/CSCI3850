<P>  Is one of your New Year's resolutions to quit smoking? </P>
<P> If so, a Duke University researcher says using a combination of nicotine patches and a blood pressure medicine may give you a better chance at succeeding. </P>
<P> Dr. Jed Rose, head of Duke University Medical Center's Nicotine Research Lab, said a new treatment using nicotine patches plus daily doses of meclamylamine is about eight times more effective in keeping smokers away from cigarettes than the patches alone. </P>
<P> In a hospital trial, Rose found that meclamylamine blocks the receptors in the brain which respond positively to nicotine. The medication has largely been discontinued for use against hypertension due to side effects of dizziness and disorientation. </P>
<P> But when meclamylamine is taken in small doses together with the nicotine patch, the side effects of the two drugs effectively cancel each other out, he said. </P>
<P> Patients need to undergo the treatment for only two months, while smokers using just the nicotine patches sometimes stay on that treatment for years while trying to break the cigarette habit, he said. </P>
<P> Both drugs have already been approved separately by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and Rose said he hoped that their use together would be approved within a year or two. </P>
<P> In hospital trials, the nicotine patch plus the meclamylamine treatment successfully kept 37 percent of patients off cigarettes for one year. The combined success rate of patches alone or other treatments is between 5 and 15 percent, said Rose, who helped invent the patch several years ago. </P>
