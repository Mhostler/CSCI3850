<NOTES> (Updates, Burmese forces reportedly cross into Thailand)</NOTES>
<DATELINE>MAE SOT, Thailand (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Burmese troops crossed into Thailand Wednesday during an intensive attack on the rebel Karen National Union's (KNU) last major border stronghold, a Thai army officer said. </P>
<P> The officer, who declined to be identified, said Thai forces, determined to prevent any spillover of fighting onto their territory, fired mortar bombs at the estimated 50 Burmese soldiers who waded across the Moei river which forms the border. </P>
<P> The Karens' Kawmoora camp is located on the Burmese side in a loop of the river, with Thai territory on three sides. The Burmese troops were reportedly trying to break through the camp's more vulnerable rear defenses. </P>
<P> A Reuter reporter at the scene said an estimated force of 1,000 KNU and Burmese dissident fighters were exchanging heavy small arms fire with Burmese government troops including the 50 who crossed into Thailand. </P>
<P> ``The situation looks very difficult but we are still confident we can hold Kawmoora,'' one Karen guerrilla told Reuters. </P>
<P> Burmese forces crossed into Thailand in 1989 in an earlier attempt to seize the base and were only pushed back when Karen guerrillas also crossed over and fought them on Thai soil. </P>
<P> A Thai village opposite Kawmoora was burnt down in the 1989 battle. </P>
<P> Burmese artillery pounded Kawmoora for the second day running Wednesday and more than 100 artillery shells or mortar bombs, including white phosphorus rounds, fell on Thai soil. </P>
<P> Thai forces, who had earlier fired smoke shells as a warning, Wednesday retaliated by firing artillery and mortar bombs at the Burmese positions. </P>
<P> The assault began with a pre-dawn bombardment of Kawmoora. Hundreds of Thais have been forced to abandon their villages as the fighting intensified. </P>
<P> A Karen guerrilla told Reuters Wednesday the military situation for the KNU had worsened after about 300 guerrillas of the splinter Democratic Kayin (Karen) Buddhist Army (DKBA) had taken position on two hills overlooking the guerrilla camp. </P>
<P> The DKBA is the armed wing of a Buddhist faction within the KNU which mutinied against its Christian leadership and later formed its own organization. </P>
<P> DKBA fighters joined Burmese government troops in their capture of the KNU headquarters of Manerplaw, 75 miles north of Kawmoora, late last month. </P>
<P> The Karen source said about 100 women porters were carrying ammunition for the combined force of 3,000 Burmese and DKBA fighters at Kawmoora. </P>
<P> The current dry-season offensive by the Burmese army is the heaviest since April 1992 when Burma's ruling miltary body said it was suspending a large but unsuccessful offensive against the KNU for the sake of national reconciliation. </P>
<P> Government forces have also been attacking KNU positions to the south in Tenassarim Division to make way for a natural gas pipeline between Burma and Thailand, the guerrillas say. </P>
<P> The latest offensive has sent more than 6,000 refugees into Thailand, where there are already more than 60,000 displaced Karen people in a string of border camps. </P>
