<DATELINE>FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Rebels have massacred at least 150 people in the west African country of Sierra Leone, according to reports reaching the capital, Freetown. </P>
<P> ``RUF rebels in the early hours of the 29th of April attacked Koidu town and massacred about 150 people,'' state television said in a filmed report. On Thursday, witnesses fleeing to Freetown put the number of dead much higher. </P>
<P> The witnesses, interviewed in the capital, said up to 200 people died in Koidu but one suggested the figure may have included those killed during fighting in a counter-offensive by government troops and civilian volunteers. </P>
<P> According to the witness accounts, rebels numbering about 50 entered Koidu town, 200 miles east of Freetown, and attacked the secretariat of the military government's National Provisional Ruling Council there. </P>
<P> Government soldiers guarding the building fled, leaving behind large quantities of arms and ammunition. </P>
<P> ``The rebels were on a killing spree. They killed anyone they came across in Koidu, especially when they were retreating from the town,'' a witness told Reuters. </P>
<P> Another witness offering a different account said: ``While the rebels were busy preparing their defences on the newly gained ground, a joint force of the military and civilian volunteers counter attacked, hence the resulting carnage and loss of life.'' </P>
<P> Sierra Leone's civil war, which began in 1991, has devasted much of the countryside, and the rebels have recently attacked the heavily defended approaches to the capital. Rebels and government troops trade accusations of who has killed civilians and destroyed homes and businesses. </P>
<P> RUF spokesman Ibrahim Jalloh called Reuters in Abidjan earlier to say the rebels were in control of Kono district, of which Koidu is the capital. He denied RUF had been driven out of the area but made no mention of fighting. </P>
<P> RUF's foreign affairs coodinator Alimamy Sankoh dismissed the television report and witness accounts as lies. </P>
<P> ``There is only one road from Kono district to Freetown and this passes through Waterloo. We are in control of all areas around Waterloo and there is no way the witnesses could have travelled from Koidu to Freetown,'' he told Reuters in Abidjan. </P>
<P> He confirmed there was fighting in Kono district on April 29, the third anniversary of the military coup in Sierra Leone, and said 65 government soldiers surrendered with their weapons. </P>
<P> Military ruler Capt. Valentine Strasser, speaking on the anniversary day, offered the rebels a cease-fire and peace talks. RUF rejected the offer, repeating its previous condition that West African troops helping the government must first go. </P>
<P> Strasser seized power three years ago vowing to end the rebellion started by former army corporal Foday Sankoh. </P>
<P> Rebel attacks on the country's lifeblood foreign-owned mines and seizure of foreign hostages, since freed, changed the character of the war, forcing the military to seek a solution. Strasser has also offered elections for a civilian president before next January. </P>
