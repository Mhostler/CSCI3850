<P>  Kuwait may buy more weapons from Russia following a purchase of vehicles and missiles announced this week, and will sign an unspecified agreement with China later this year, newspapers reported Wednesday. </P>
<P> Defense Minister Sheikh Ahmad Hamoud al-Sabah was quoted as saying Tuesday that he had sent a new delegation to Moscow to discuss the possibility of buying more weapons. </P>
<P> Russian state arms trading company Rosvooruzheniye is supplying Kuwait with BMP-3 armored personnel carriers and the Smerch multilaunch rocket system under an agreement Sheikh Ahmad signed with Russian Ambassador Petr Stegny on Monday. </P>
<P> The accord provides for Kuwaiti technicians to be sent to Russian factories to monitor the manufacture of the systems and Russian experts to come to Kuwait to teach Kuwaiti troops how to use them, Sheikh Ahmad was reported as saying in remarks published by several newspapers. </P>
<P> They are Kuwait's first major arms purchases from Russia since the 1991 Gulf War. </P>
<P> The United States and Britain have won most of the big defense contracts awarded by the tiny Persian Gulf oil-exporting emirate since its liberation from Iraq's seven-month occupation. </P>
<P> Kuwait has signed defense pacts with the United States, Russia, France and Britain in recent years to try to build an alliance to counter any threat from a still-hostile Iraq. </P>
<P> It wants a similar accord with China. </P>
<P> Sheikh Ahmad said he would visit China at Beijing's invitation later this year and planned to sign an agreement during his stay. He gave no further details about the trip. </P>
<P> He said last month that China and Kuwait were discussing a draft defense agreement and he hoped it would be approved before his visit to Beijing in the last three months of the year. </P>
<P> Sheikh Ahmad said Tuesday he would make a private trip to France later this year during which he would discuss possible purchases of French weaponry with defense officials. </P>
<P> France, Britain and Germany are competing for the supply of eight fast patrol boats to Kuwait. A decision is expected some time this year. </P>
