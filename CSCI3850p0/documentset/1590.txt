<P>  A detachment of 150 Jordanian police held a farewell ceremony Sunday before leaving for Haiti to join the U.S.-dominated force occupying the Caribbean nation. </P>
<P> King Hussein, reviewing the men before they went to the airport, said that Jordan ranked fifth in worldwide contribution of army and police personnel to United Nations peacekeeping operations. They serve in trouble areas from Bosnia and Croatia to Mozambique. </P>
<P> ``You will help maintain peace and security, and with the experience you developed, you will help train (local police) cadres to enable them to continue their role in the future,'' the king told the men, clad in dark blue uniforms and anti-riot helmets. </P>
<P> U.S. Ambassador Wesley Egan and senior Jordanian officials watched under a blazing sun as King Hussein inspected the 30 officers and 120 privates. Most of the men, who shouted ``long live the king,'' speak either English or French. </P>
<P> Earlier this month, President Clinton asked Jordan to send police to Haiti, drawing condemnation from Jordan's anti-American Muslim fundamentalist party and its leftist allies. </P>
<P> Israel was also to send troops Sunday to join the force in Haiti, which is to restore the democratic government ousted by the Haitian army. </P>
