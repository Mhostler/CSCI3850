<P> As the crowd called out, a tired-looking Arafat, dressed in his olive-green military uniform and trademark black-and-white chequered headdress, took the microphone and switched the chant to ``With blood and soul, we will redeem Palestine.'' </P>
<P> ``Abu Ammar said it (a Palestinian state) is a stone's throw away and they did not believe him. He said we will pray in al-Aqsa (in Jerusalem) and they did not believe him... he said we will return, they did not believe him,'' said Saeb Erekat, one of the administrators of the self-rule area. </P>
<P> ``Here he is with you. Believe, believe, believe. It's the first step on the road to statehood,'' he shouted at the crowd before Arafat's speech. </P>
<P> The crowd began to rise in numbers as Palestinians rushed from the center of the Jordan Valley oasis town near the Dead Sea, but thousands of Arabs were believed stranded by protests by Jewish settlers. </P>
<P> The settlers, opposed to Israel's peace deal with the PLO, blocked a main road by burning tires and lying down to stop traffic. Troops used bulldozers to remove the tires, which sent a thick column of black smoke into the air. </P>
<P> Erekat said Israeli forces had kept buses from entering after settlers placed spikes on the road. </P>
<P> ``Arafat will not pass through here,'' said Giora Shoshan of Naama, a settlement of 125 Jews near Jericho, at another settler protest. ``Arafat is one of the biggest murderers ever.'' </P>
<P> Settler leaders, hoping to curb the Jericho celebrations, said they had blocked roads at 19 points in the West Bank, home to about 100,000 Jews living in protected settlements scattered among about a million Palestinians. </P>
