<P>  Canada's Progressive Conservative Party on Friday met for the first time since it was virtually eliminated in the country's 1993 federal election to map out a comeback. </P>
<P> The defeat was the worst suffered by a national party in the history of the country. It went from ruling the government with 152 of the 295 seats in the House of Commons to only two after the election. </P>
<P> ``Over the past 15 months... I have repeatedly stressed the importance of getting our house in order and the need to restructure the PC Party of Canada, party leader Jean Charest said in welcoming the 1,700 delegates to a convention. </P>
<P> Faced with the enormous popularity of Liberal Prime Minister Jean Chretien and the deep-seated resentment of many Canadians towards Conservative former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, Charest admits it is not an easy task. </P>
<P> ``Leading one of Canada's national political parties after the party's 1993 defeat is not something for which I was prepared,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``No experience, education nor training -- in fact, nothing prepares you to take a party and jumpstart its rebuilding.'' </P>
<P> But that is exactly what his party is trying to do in time for the next federal elections, which must be held by 1998. </P>
<P> The three-day convention in Hull, across the river from the national capital Ottawa, is meant to approve a new party constitution. Party members hope this will bring the party back in touch with the mainstream of Canada's electorate. </P>
