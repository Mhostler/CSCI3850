<P>  The chairman of the House International Relations Committee said Friday he has introduced legislation to bar the lifting of economic sanctions against Serbia until human rights issues in the Serbian province of Kosovo are resolved. </P>
<P> ``Recent events in Bosnia have demonstrated how little the Serbs regard the view of the international community,'' Rep. Ben Gilman, R-N.Y., said. </P>
<P> ``Their plan for an ethnically cleansed 'Greater Serbia' raises concern'' for Kosovo, he said. </P>
<P> Under Gilman's bill the president would have to certify that mostly ethnic Albanian Kosovo has self-government and a separate identity, or that an international protectorate has been established for it. </P>
<P> Gilman said Kosovo's autonomous status under the former Republic of Yugoslavia had been eliminated and Albanian personnel in the educational, health and law enforcement fields had been replaced with Serbs. </P>
<P> Economic sanctions are in place against Serbia because of its role in supporting Serbs in the Bosnia conflict. </P>
