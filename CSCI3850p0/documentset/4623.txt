<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  An anti-abortion group Tuesday said it was filing a petition to try to block fast-track approval of a drug used to cause abortion. </P>
<P> Americans United For Life (AUL) said it was filing a citizen petition with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to stop fast-track approval of the French abortion drug RU-486. Several Republican congressmen known for opposing abortion signed the petition. </P>
<P> The drug is in use in several foreign countries, and under fast-track procedure the FDA will accept European data and some relatively brief clinical trials in the United States. </P>
<P> Paige Cunningham, president of AUL, which serves as the legal arm of the anti-abortion movement, told a news conference, ``This petition documents the grizzly truth about how RU-486 hurts women. </P>
<P> ``AUL will send this petition to drug manufacturers throughout the country to tell them that if they are thinking about manufacturing this harmful drug for women, they'd better think again,'' she said. </P>
<P> Roussel Uclaf developed and marketed RU-486 overseas but, largely because of the heated U.S. abortion controversy, the Population Council is handling the trials in licensing stage in the United States. </P>
<P> The anti-abortion group said the safety and effectiveness of the drug has been exaggerated and the risks understated. </P>
<P> Abortion rights advocates say RU 486 gives women in the early weeks of pregnancy an alternative to surgical abortion. </P>
