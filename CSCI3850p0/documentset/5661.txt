<P>  Seven Cuban refugees who said they were fleeing religious and political persecution have arrived by raft on Jamaica's north coast, officials said Tuesday. </P>
<P> The men, ranging in age from 18 to 46, told officials they would accept asylum in any ``free country'' that would accept them, the officials said. </P>
<P> The refugees said they were from Manzanilla in Granma province in the south of Cuba and had departed Saturday. They landed east of the resort town of Montego Bay late Monday. </P>
<P> The group included a hotel administrator, a veterinary student, a fisherman and several tradesmen, the officials said. They were the third group of Cuban refugees to arrive in Jamaica in the past year. </P>
<P> In the past, Jamaica has handed over Cuban rafters to local representatives of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. </P>
