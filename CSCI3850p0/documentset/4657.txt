<P>  Haiti's fragile democracy needs urgent international aid to survive and grow, a U.N. uman rights expert said Wednesday. </P>
<P> Marco Tulio Bruni Celli, the U.N. Human Rights Commission's special rapporteur on Haiti, said aid and technical support had to be given to the Caribbean state before democratic institutions were tested by parliamentary and presidential elections this year. </P>
<P> ``Democracy in Haiti will depend on how the democratic, legitimate government may answer the urgent expectations of the people now,'' Bruni Celli told a news conference. </P>
<P> ``The problem is that the vacuum always has to be filled and if democracy has no answers then some other system will have an answer,'' he added. </P>
<P> In his report to the Commission, the U.N.'s highest human rights forum, Bruni Celli said a number of factors had contributed to the restoration of rights to Haiti since President Jean-Bertrand Aristide returned in October from three years' exile. </P>
<P> Among them he listed the dismantling of paramilitary units, the reduction in size of the Haitian armed forces and government efforts to collect weapons. </P>
<P> ``These factors have created a new climate of relative tranquility and hope in which there has been a real decrease in the number of abuses and violations of human rights,'' Bruni Celli said. </P>
<P> ``I was in Haiti in January and I saw the population feels more secure, shops have opened and schools have begun to function,'' he added. </P>
<P> But Bruni Celli said there was still a worrying amount of delinquency, usually linked to poverty and unemployment. </P>
<P> Paramilitary groups continued to terrorize the population in remote areas and large numbers of weapons had not been collected. </P>
<P> ``In rural areas more than in the towns acts of violence and abuses of human rights continue to take place,'' he said. </P>
<P> Justice authorities were ``virtually at a standstill.'' Prisoners were going hungry and basic services such as water, electricity, transportation and health were in a shambles. </P>
<P> Bruni Celli said international organizations had development programs prepared to improve water or electricity supplies, for example, but bureaucratic delays were preventing implementation. </P>
<P> ``In my opinion the government and the international community has done their best to resolve many of the problems created by the dictatorship,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``But the program is at the very beginning and the international community must take many other steps to help Haiti develop democratic institutions and human rights.'' </P>
<P> Bruni Celli said parliamentary elections in June and presidential elections in December, in which Aristide cannot stand, would be an important test. </P>
<P> ``Until now everything has been right on paper but nothing has begun to be done in reality,'' Bruni Celli said. </P>
<P> ``The legitimate government is going to have a confrontation, an electoral confrontation, with nothing in their hands.'' </P>
