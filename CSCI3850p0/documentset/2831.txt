<P>  A committee studying possible changes in the U.N. Charter would be asked to consider deleting references to World War II ``enemy states'' under a resolution adopted Friday. </P>
<P> The resolution was adopted by the General Assembly's legal committee, 117-0, with only North Korea abstaining. It now goes to the full General Assembly. </P>
<P> Articles 53 and 107 of the U.N. Charter, drawn up right after the war, would have permitted allied powers to take action against any renewal of aggression by enemy states without first referring the issue to the United Nations. </P>
<P> The resolution adopted by the legal committee says these provisions are obsolete and that the states they refer to ``represent a valuable asset in all the endeavors'' of the United Nations. </P>
<P> But a North Korean representative disagreed, saying Japan, which was one of the so-called enemy states, had neither repudiated past wrongdoing nor made a political commitment that it would never repeat them. </P>
<P> A Japanese representative called the North Korean remarks anti-Japanese propaganda and said Japan, remorseful about the suffering caused during the war, had on many occasions declared its commitment to see there was no repetition. </P>
<P> Japan was admitted to the United Nations in 1956, Italy in 1955, and East and West Germany in 1973. The two Germanys were united in 1990. </P>
