<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Orlando Canizales will play the unfamiliar role of challenger when he steps into the ring Saturday to fight Wilfredo Vasquez for the World Boxing Association junior featherweight title. </P>
<P> Canizales is moving up in weight after making an all-time record 16 successful defenses of the International Boxing Federation bantamweight title. </P>
<P> The 29-year-old Canizales, who has a record of 38-1-1, will be cheered on by a partisan crowd expected to travel in from his hometown of Laredo, Tx. </P>
<P> Vasquez, who has made eight successful defenses in the last 32 months, carries a 41-6-3 record into the bout. The 33-year-old, power-punching Puerto Rican has finished 32 opponents off within the distance. </P>
<P> The card also features World Boxing Council featherweight champion Kevin Kelley defending his crown against Mexican Alejandro Gonzalez. </P>
<P> Kelley, 27, will be making the third defense of the title he won 13 months ago from another Mexican, Goyo Vargas, and trying to improve on his unblemished record of 41-0 -- the best of boxing's world champions. </P>
<P> The 21-year-old Gonzalez, who has nine knockouts in his last 12 wins, has a record of 34-2. </P>
