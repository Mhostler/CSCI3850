<P>  A Frenchman on a solo swim across the Atlantic achieved his goal Thursday, reaching the eastern Caribbean island of Barbados 56 days after setting off from the Cape Verde Islands off Africa, French television TF1 reported. </P>
<P> Guy Delage, 42, touched land after a 2,420 mile crossing plagued by mishaps. </P>
<P> ``It has been difficult,'' Delage told TF1 by telephone from Barbados. </P>
<P> Delage began his swim Dec. 16, spending about six to eight hours in the water a day and the rest on a 13 ft long raft, where he rested and slept while prevailing winds and currents carried him west. </P>
<P> He admits he has swum well under half the distance and normally travels slower when swimming than resting. </P>
<P> A flying instructor and adventurer, Delage has defended his trip both as a feat of endurance and as helping scientific research. During the swim, he had been harassed by sharks, plagued by equipment failures and tossed about by waves. </P>
