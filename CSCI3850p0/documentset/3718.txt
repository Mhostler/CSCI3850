<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Sen. Edward Kennedy Tuesday warned Democrats they must stand up for their party's traditional liberal principles or risk becoming ``pale carbon copies'' of Republicans and will deserve to lose again in 1996. </P>
<P> As his party regroups after its crushing November loss, Kennedy said they must support President Clinton and vigorously resist being drawn into a bidding war with Republicans on cutting taxes and slashing federal programs. </P>
<P> Rather, he said Democrats need to renew their image in voters' minds as the party of the middle class, of working families and stress their support for such policies as health care reform, an increase in the minimum wage, aid for education and welfare for needy children and mothers. </P>
<P> ``If Democrats run for cover, if we become pale carbon copies of the opposition and try to act like Republicans, we will lose -- and deserve to lose,'' he said in an address at the National Press Club. </P>
<P> ``Democrats must be more than warmed-over Republicans. The last thing this country needs is two Republican parties,'' he said. </P>
<P> Kennedy, who won re-election in Massachusetts with a 17-point lead, castigated Democrats who ran away from Clinton and allowed Republicans to seize the issues. He urged them to work with Clinton instead of trying to distance themselves from him. </P>
<P> ``Blaming Bill Clinton by some in our party comes with ill grace from those who abandoned him on critical votes in the last Congress,'' he said. </P>
<P> As one of the senior Democratic senators, Kennedy's influence in the now minority leadership remains strong. He supports Clinton's middle class tax cut but opposes a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget. </P>
<P> Kennedy predicted Clinton will be re-elected in 1996 but warned the president needs to stress his allegiance with the middle class. </P>
<P> He outlined several policy goals he would recommend Democrats pursue -- a health reform package, reform of job training programs, aid for higher education and reform of lobbying and campaign finance laws. </P>
<P> And he issued a challenge to Republicans: They should commit to passage of a health care bill that guarantees all Americans the same health insurance coverage newly-elected members of Congress are given. </P>
<P> The November election gave Republicans control of the House and Senate for the first time in 40 years and gave the political limelight to the new conservative House Speaker Newt Gingrich. </P>
<P> Kennedy said Republicans did not win a mandate and predicted the higher turnout of Democrats in the 1996 presidential election will return his party to power. </P>
<P> ``We should be who we are. We can't try to out Republican Republicans,'' Kennedy said later in an interview on CNN's ''Inside Politics'' program. </P>
<P> As Democrats return to what he called their core values, he indicated they will also attempt to define Republicans as they have tried to do in the past as the party of the wealthy and special interests. </P>
<P> He pointed to the Republican-sponsored capital gains tax cut which he said will benefit the wealthy and warned Republicans will cut health care for the poor and elderly. </P>
