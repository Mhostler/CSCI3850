<P>  A French investigating magistrate is probing two former aides of President Francois Mitterrand and three other people over the wiretapping of politicians and journalists in the mid-1980s, French radio said Friday. </P>
<P> State-run France-Info radio said Gilles Menage, former head of Mitterrand's private office; Christian Prouteau, former chief of the presidential palace anti-terrorist unit; and three of the unit's former members were formally placed under investigation on suspicion of infringing privacy. </P>
<P> No official confirmation was immediately available. Placing a suspect under formal investigation is the first step toward trial, but does not automatically lead to one. </P>
<P> Judge Jean-Paul Valat is probing accusations that the anti-terror group in the Elysee Palace tapped the telephones of politicians, journalists -- including an investigative reporter for Le Monde -- and actress Carole Bouquet in 1985-86. </P>
<P> The left-wing Liberation newspaper published transcripts of some of the tapes last year. The National Commission on Security Intercepts confirmed in its annual report last February that the since-dissolved unit had bugged private citizens in what it called ``serious abuses.'' </P>
<P> Prime Minister Edouard Balladur last March cleared the way for a judicial probe into the alleged wiretapping, saying it was not protected by official secrecy legislation. </P>
<P> But Menage and Prouteau have declined to answer the judge's questions, saying they were bound to secrecy. </P>
<P> Menage is chairman of state company Electricite de France. Prouteau, a former chief of the elite GIGN anti-terrorist squad, was the head of security for the 1992 Olympic Winter Games in the French Alps. </P>
