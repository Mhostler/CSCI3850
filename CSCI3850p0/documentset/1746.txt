<DATELINE>BELFAST (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Some 150 names are etched in gold on a wall plaque at the tiny garden of remembrance beside Sinn Fein's office in Ardoyne in embattled north Belfast. </P>
<P> They are local Roman Catholics who have died in Northern Ireland's 25-year troubles -- guerrillas of the Irish Republican Army, members of its political arm Sinn Fein and ordinary civilians. </P>
<P> All are victims of what the IRA and Sinn Fein call ``the long war'' to end British rule in Northern Ireland and reunite it with the Irish republic. </P>
<P> There is space for more names but everyone in the area prays the shiny black marble will now forever remain undisturbed. </P>
<P> One month after the outlawed IRA issued a historic cease-fire announcement, Catholic and Protestant communities across Northern Ireland are savoring the first taste of what peace could mean for the province. </P>
<P> Trade has increased in Belfast city's center, economic analysts forecast a peace dividend with new investment, tourism promoters are ``talking up'' the province. </P>
<P> Peace hasn't struck in a tidal wave yet. More a steady trickle. A drip feed of what it could be like. </P>
<P> There has been no political breakthrough pending new Anglo-Irish talks on the next phase of their peace drive sometime in October or November. </P>
<P> But there has been a dramatic drop in violent incidents -- none by the IRA has been reported -- and a feeling of what the word peace might mean is taking hold. </P>
<P> Troops still patrol, weapons at the ready. But they have swapped their camouflage helmets for coloured regimental berets, unthinkable when IRA snipers lurked in street shadows. </P>
<P> Traffic flows more quickly through road checkpoints and there has been an easing of town centre restrictions and a more relaxed climate in most areas. </P>
<P> The IRA called the ceasefire in the hope it would catapult Sinn Fein into talks with Britain about a united Ireland. </P>
<P> British Prime Minister John Major is refusing talks, demanding proof the ceasefire is genuine. But he has said Sinn Fein could come in from a 25-year cold by Christmas if the IRA truce is for good. </P>
<P> Catholics in Belfast are firmly behind the cease-fire. They are demanding ``positive responses'' from London such as economic initiatives and a dramatic scaling-down of army and police activity they say has blighted their daily lives. </P>
<P> They say ``the jury's still out'' on whether there has been a reduction of security patrols, a frequent source of friction. </P>
<P> Protestants, who mostly want Northern Ireland to remain part of Britain, say they have been on the receiving end of the IRA's campaign to create a merger of the province with the predominantly Catholic republic. </P>
<P> There is distrust and skepticism among the Protestants but they, too, want to believe the cease-fire is for real. </P>
<P> East Belfast community worker Sammy Douglas says Protestants initially found it hard to accept the cease-fire at face value. However, as the peace holds, there seems to be ``a tremendous sense of hope that it is permanent.'' </P>
<P> In Catholic west Belfast, community development activist Ruth Taillon says: ``We are looking for the real peace dividend -- reconstruction particularly for this community. We suffered from the conflict, now we want the benefits of peace.'' </P>
<P> John O'Hanlon did not live to enjoy the change in atmosphere. On the first night of the IRA cease-fire Protestant guerrillas shot and killed him as he helped a friend repair a car. </P>
<P> He was the first post cease-fire Catholic victim of gunmen fighting to retain the Protestant community's treasured links with Britain. </P>
<P> They are demanding concrete assurances that Northern Ireland will remain British as the price for giving up their violence. There is speculation they could announce their own limited cease-fire sometime in October. </P>
