<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres Wednesday applauded a Palestinian crackdown on militants threatening a peace deal with Israel, saying authorities in Gaza had now begun to take serious action. </P>
<P> ``Over the last few days the Palestinian Authority started to take seriously the danger of terror coming from Gaza,'' he told reporters. ``I believe they have the capacity to handle it and I think that is a replacement for our presence there.'' </P>
<P> His remarks came amid reports from Gaza that Palestinian police had arrested nearly 90 militants. PLO leader Yasser Arafat has vowed to fight ``fanatic and extremist forces'' and has set up a military court to try ``national security'' cases. </P>
<P> The moves followed a Cairo summit last week between Egypt, Israel, Jordan and the PLO where Israel again demanded that the PLO take tougher action against guerrillas who have launched a series of deadly attacks on the Jewish state. </P>
<P> In a bid to revive the flagging peace process, foreign ministers of the same four parties will meet in Washington Sunday, while Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin are due to meet in Gaza Thursday. </P>
<P> Peres, speaking before talks with Secretary of State Warren Christopher, admitted that Israel might have lost intelligence information as a result of turning Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho over to the PLO last year. </P>
<P> ``Maybe this is one of the results but not the only one,'' he said in reply to a question. ``I don't know any party in Israel...that suggested Israel should go back to Gaza.'' </P>
<P> Those arrested by the Palestinians this week came from the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Islamic resistance movement Hamas as well as Islamic Jihad, which killed 21 Israelis in a suicide bombing last month. </P>
<P> Peres is spending a week in the United States in advance of Sunday's meeting pressing his government's case that the peace process must continue despite the guerrilla attacks and other obstacles. </P>
<P> ``We are not going to stop negotiating,'' he said Wednesday. ``We are not blind to the difficulties but we are not overwhelmed by them.'' </P>
<P> Both Peres and Christopher skirted round questions about the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which Israel has not signed and which has led to friction with Egypt ahead of a key NPT review conference in New York in April. </P>
<P> The United States wants the treaty to be renewed indefinitely but Egypt and other Arab states are reluctant to foreswear nuclear weapons for ever while Israel, they say, possesses them. </P>
<P> Christopher, noting that the Cairo summit had called for the Middle East to be free of weapons of mass destruction, said he was ``going to be talking to the parties about that'' on Sunday, but did not elaborate. </P>
<P> ``We hope and expect that the treaty will one day be universal and we're working to that end,'' he said. </P>
<P> Peres focused attention instead on Iran, which has signed the treaty but which the United States says is engaged on a ''crash program'' to acquire nuclear weapons, something Tehran denies. </P>
<P> Declaring that Islamic fundamentalism was ``after communism...the greatest threat to peace'', Peres said: ``The combination of a fanatic approach with modern weapons is the worst that can happen. I think we have to contain the danger, preferably with economic means.'' </P>
<P> Christopher, who has made repeated peace shuttles to the Middle East, said he had no fixed plans for a new trip but expected ``to be out there again before long''. </P>
