<P>  Queen Elizabeth arrived in Moscow Monday on a ground-breaking visit meant to bury Anglo-Russian Cold War enmity. </P>
<P> Wrapped in a brown mink coat to shield her from the icy autumn air, the queen was met at Vnukovo VIP airport by Russian officials, national anthems and a military parade. </P>
<P> With her husband Prince Philip and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd she rode to Moscow in her private Rolls-Royce and passed inside the ancient walls of Russia's seat of power, the Kremlin. </P>
<P> President Boris Yeltsin, who is to pay the 68-year-old queen a rare tribute for visitors by accompanying her to the old imperial capital St. Petersburg at the end of the four-day visit, welcomed his guests in the ornate St. George's Hall. </P>
<P> Next on the schedule for the royal party was an evening watching the ballet Giselle at the first royal performance for years at Moscow's Bolshoi Theatre. </P>
<P> There was some embarrassment around the visit after Charles, in a biography serialized Sunday, was said to blame his domineering father for childhood misery and for forcing him into a loveless union with Princess Diana. </P>
<P> British newspapers said the queen was so vexed by the Charles biography, which portrays his marriage as a charade from its glittering start in 1981, that she had taken the rare step of authorizing officials to make public her irritation. </P>
<P> The queen's acceptance of Yeltsin's 1992 invitation was seen by both governments as the formal seal on their countries' rapprochement. </P>
<P> But protocol wrangles dogged the Russian royal debut. </P>
<P> British and Russian officials dismissed British media reports that the royal pair had been snubbed by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin who, on vacation in the Crimea, sent a deputy to greet them at the airport. </P>
<P> Russians, intrigued by the royal family's woes but curious about a queen whom many respect, eagerly awaited the visit which will reintroduce them to royal pageantry unseen since the 1917 Bolshevik revolution ended the 300-year Romanov dynasty. </P>
<P> Fading facades have been repainted, bridges cleaned and roads resurfaced to give the queen a smooth ride. She will stay in the imposing Kremlin state apartments and, in St. Petersburg, on her own yacht Britannia. </P>
<P> Russia's own monarchists, some of whom have called for Charles' brother Andrew to be imported as the next czar, are an anarchic political fringe despite a newspaper poll purporting to show 18 percent of Russians favor restoration. </P>
