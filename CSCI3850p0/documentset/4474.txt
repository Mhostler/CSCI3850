<P>  Oscar nominee Tom Hanks reprised his ``Chopsticks'' solo from the movie ``Big,'' jumping on an oversized cardboard piano before being presented with Harvard University's Hasty Pudding award Tuesday. </P>
<P> To earn the ``Pudding Pot'' from Harvard's Hasty Pudding Theatricals troupe, Hanks, who has been nominated as best actor for ``Forrest Gump,'' also had to play ``Nail the Nominees,'' throwing darts at pictures of fellow best actor nominees including Paul Newman and John Travolta. </P>
<P> Hanks, clad in a black tuxedo, then donned a red wig, blue satin dress. </P>
<P> ``Not bad for a guy who didn't even make it through Sacramento State University,'' said Hanks, the theatrical company's 28th man of the year. </P>
<P> Last year Hanks won an Oscar as best actor for his role as Andrew Beckett, a lawyer suffering from AIDS, in the movie ''Philadelphia.'' </P>
<P> ``This is quite an experience, a thrill and an honor,'' Hanks said upon receiving the pot. The Hasty Pudding is the oldest acting company in the United States, and has presented man and woman of the year awards since 1951. </P>
<P> Hanks joins a long list of distinguished actors, including Tom Cruise, who have won the ``Pudding Pot.'' Last week actress Michelle Pfeiffer accepted this year's ``Woman of the Year Award.'' </P>
<P> Asked what Forrest Gump would say about the award, Hanks said, ``Where's the pudding?'' </P>
<P> Hanks said he is ``incensed'' at people who say ``Forrest Gump'' is a conservative diatribe. ``I don't think there is a moral or message (in the movie) except love your kids,'' Hanks said. </P>
<P> Hanks, who has earned a reputation as a nice guy, said ``it is a big burden and a big responsibility'' to be considered one of the sexiest men alive. </P>
<P> A family man who takes his wife and children on movie shoots lasting two weeks or longer, Hanks said he would love to act in the theater but won't because it would take him away from home for too long. </P>
<P> Hanks said he plans to put his ``Pudding Pot'' between a copy of ``Apollo 13,'' the book on which his next movie is based, and his daughter's horse-riding ribbons. </P>
