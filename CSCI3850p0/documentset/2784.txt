<P> Croatian aviation sources told Reuters a group of about 20 aircraft was spotted over Bihac. Croatian radio said the target was a missile emplacement which fired Tuesday at two NATO Sea Harrier aircraft of the British Navy over Bosnia. </P>
<P> Western military sources told Reuters that NATO aircraft were engaged in a fresh strike against the Serbs in Bosnia Wednesday, but it may have been retaliation for an earlier missile attack against British planes rather than a strike near the enclave of Bihac. </P>
<P> Two British Sea Harriers were fired on by surface-to-air missiles over central Bosnia Tuesday. The missiles narrowly missed the planes, which returned safely to their aircraft carrier in the Adriatic. </P>
<P> NATO's southern command headquarters in Naples would neither confirm nor deny a raid was in progress Wednesday. Monday, NATO warplanes blasted an airfield in a Serb-held region of Croatia and pressure has been growing for fresh alliance action to protect Bihac, a U.N.-designated ``safe area'' which is under Serb assault and where Bangladeshi peacekeepers are trapped. </P>
