<P>  The U.S. Postal Service will issue a stamp in May honoring American veterans captured during past wars and those who remain missing in action, Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., said Wednesday. </P>
<P> Smith, a veteran and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee who has been pushing for issuance of such a stamp, said he had been invited to speak at a ceremony unveiling the new stamp Memorial Day, May 29, 1995. </P>
<P> No confirmation was immediately available from the Postal Service. </P>
<P> ``I am pleased that thousands of men and women who fought for their country, and in some cases paid with their lives, will be honored with the POW/MIA stamp,'' Smith said in a statement. ``This recognition is long-awaited and well-deserved.'' </P>
