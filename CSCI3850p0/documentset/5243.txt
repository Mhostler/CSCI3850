<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The White House said Monday it opposes repeal of a tax break for businesses selling broadcast properties to minorities, which is likely to scuttle Viacom's planned $2.3 billion sale of its cable systems. </P>
<P> The Office of Management and Budget said in a statement it would be willing to consider modification to the tax break as part of its review of affirmative action programs. It could possibly accept a cap on the amount of gain companies could defer from taxes and changes in the ownership and holding period requirements. </P>
<P> The House and Senate have both approved legislation to repeal the tax break as a way to pay for a permanent tax deduction for health insurance premiums paid by the self-employed. The previous law allowing a 25 percent deduction expired in 1993. </P>
<P> Viacom said in a statement earlier this month that the deal to sell its cable systems would not make financial sense without a tax deferment. </P>
<P> The White House said it supports the health insurance tax break. It also supports a provision in the bill that would permit taxing expatriate citizens on their capital gains. Regarding a limit on the earned income tax credit eligibility, the cap on investment income should be indexed for inflation. </P>
<P> According to OMB, the entire legislation would raise $2.5 billion over the 1995-2000 period. </P>
<P> The Senate version would permit a 30 percent health insurance deduction while the House would allow a 25 percent break back to 1994 and raise it to 30 percent in later years. </P>
