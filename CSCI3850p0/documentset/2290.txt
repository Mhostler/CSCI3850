<P>  U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright said she will introduce at the United Nations Friday a resolution to lift the arms embargo against Bosnian Muslims in six months' time. </P>
<P> U.S. allies have been opposed to such a move but Albright, in a wide-ranging speech on foreign policy, said Washington had cooperated with its allies on Bosnia policy in the past and reciprocal cooperation also ``must be serious.'' </P>
<P> Albright, speaking at a forum at the State Department, said the international community's failures in Bosnia had been ''amplified by our collective slowness to back promise with action.'' </P>
<P> The United States and its allies earlier this year put forward a peace plan for Bosnia and warned that if Bosnian Serbs did not accept the deal, lifting the arms embargo on Bosnian Muslims would become unavoidable. </P>
<P> France, Britain and Russia continue to oppose such a move. </P>
<P> Albright said that in addition to introducing the arms embargo resolution, the United States in the next few weeks will be pushing hard for ``joint strategies to make the Bosnian Serbs understand that settlement is their only option.'' </P>
<P> This would include continuing to drive a wedge between Serbia and Bosnian Serbs and encouraging a stronger federation between Bosnia and Croatia. </P>
<P> She argued that progress toward peace in Bosnia ``can be maximised by using NATO power more effectively to enforce U.N. rules and by maintaining diplomatic unity to isolate the Bosnia Serbs.'' </P>
