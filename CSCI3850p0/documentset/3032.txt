<P>  A bomb planted by a left-wing extremist group damaged state taxation offices in central Athens Tuesday but no one was hurt, police said. </P>
<P> Police earlier reported there had been two bombs but later said there was only one. </P>
<P> ``We had a bomb blast in the first tax office and a warning telephone call by allegedly the same guerrilla group about a second bomb in another tax office nearby,'' a police official said. </P>
<P> ``As we were heading for the second location a loud noise led us to believe that the second bomb went off but apparently it was a car exhaust or something else and the call was a hoax. There is only one bomb explosion and no injuries.'' </P>
<P> The extreme left guerrilla group Revolutionary Popular Struggle (ELA) claimed responsibility for the blast through a phone call to an Athens newspaper. </P>
<P> The time bomb shattered the windows of the tax office and other buildings near Omonia Square in downtown Athens. </P>
<P> ELA has carried out dozens of similar attacks against state offices and foreign companies in the past decade. </P>
