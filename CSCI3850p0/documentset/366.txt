<P>  President Clinton said Saturday he thought next week's congressional hearings on the Whitewater affair would be ``just a rehash'' but he was prepared to cooperate with the Capitol Hill investigation. </P>
<P> ``I feel quite confident that the hearings will be seen as just a rehash of what's already been looked into in detail,'' the president told reporters at this Arkansas town where he was attending his 30th High School class reunion. </P>
<P> He said he thought special Whitewater prosecutor Robert Fiske had already covered most of the territory that would be probed in the public hearings, which start in the House Banking Committee Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``I think the American people are going to wonder why the Congress is spending so much time and money on something that's already been looked into in great detail, excruciating detail, at great cost to the taxpayers for the special counsel (Fiske),'' he said. </P>
<P> Fiske was appointed in January to investigate the tangle of accusations against Clinton and his wife Hillary centering on the Whitewater housing development and links with a collapsed local financial institution in his home state of Arkansas. </P>
<P> He has already reported on two aspects of the affair -- on the suicide one year ago of White House deputy counsel Vincent Foster and on contacts between Treasury Department and White House officials concerning an official investigation into the failure of a savings and loan company that was at the heart of the Whitewater tangle. </P>
<P> Fiske, in a lengthy report on June 30, concluded that Foster, a close friend of Clinton from Arkansas, had committed suicide at a time of depression and drew no parallel to Whitewater. </P>
<P> He concluded that there was insufficient evidence to show that anyone in the White House or Treasury Department acted with any intent to corruptly influence the official probe. </P>
<P> But he added: ``We express no opinion on the propriety of these meetings or whether anything that occurred at these meetings constitutes a breach of ethical rules or standards.'' </P>
<P> Media reports at the weekend indicated that revelations of so-far undisclosed Treasury-Whitehouse contacts would be made at the House hearing, which will be followed by a Senate Banking Committee hearing starting Friday. </P>
<P> They said this would include testimony from the Treasury's top lawyer that could challenge Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen's stance that he did not know of the contacts until they were disclosed in the media. </P>
<P> The New York Times said Saturday Treasury general counsel Jean Hanson had recently testified secretly that she had briefed Bentsen about the contacts in February. </P>
