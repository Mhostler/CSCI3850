<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A senior U.S. envoy held talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak Monday on the faltering Middle East peace process and ways to defuse a crisis between Egypt and Israel over the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. </P>
<P> U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Pelletreau refused to give any details but Egyptian officials said the envoy tried to persuade Cairo to sign the treaty without Israel and end a crisis that has soured the two countries' relations. </P>
<P> The same sources said Cairo remained determined not to sign the treaty when it comes up in April in Geneva unless Israel, widely believed to possess nuclear warheads, signs. Israel has said it would not sign as long as it faces potential danger from Syria, Iraq and Iran. </P>
<P> Pelletreau stressed the United States' strong relations with Cairo, put in doubt by a series of articles in U.S. newspapers criticizing Egypt's close relations with Libya and asking for an aid cut. </P>
<P> ``The relationship between Egypt and the United States is a strong and excellent relationship,'' Pelletreau told reporters. </P>
<P> ``We, on our side told the president we are committed to make this relationship even stronger because Egypt and the United States need to stand and work together to bring about a complete and comprehensive and just peace in the Middle East,'' he said. </P>
<P> Pelletreau said after his meeting with Mubarak that Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa would visit Washington in a few weeks for more talks. </P>
<P> Pelletreau and Mubarak also discussed Mubarak's visit to Washington in the spring during which he will try to rally support from Congress to retain the annual $2 billion in U.S. aid Egypt has received since it signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979, official sources said. </P>
<P> Official sources said the two men examined the Syrian and Israeli peace track, which has failed to yield any progress despite three years of negotiations, as well as the Palestinian self-rule deal with Israel. </P>
<P> The United States, saying the biggest threat facing the world was nuclear, has voiced dissatisfaction with Egypt's stubborn stand on the non-proliferation treaty. </P>
<P> Sunday Mubarak's top political advisor Osama al-Baz warned Israel that its refusal to sign the treaty might prompt reactions by other countries and a vicious circle and syndrome of escalation could develop in the region. </P>
<P> Pelletreau arrived in Cairo Saturday to take part in the steering committee of the multilateral Middle East peace talks which began its two-day meeting Sunday. </P>
