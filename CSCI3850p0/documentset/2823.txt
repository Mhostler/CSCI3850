<DATELINE>ROME (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, weakened by a corruption probe but vowing to stay in office, seemed close Friday to striking a deal with unions on his unpopular budget. </P>
<P> Meanwhile, the embattled lira fell to a record low against the German mark Friday as Italy's chaotic politics continued to take their toll on investors' nerves. </P>
<P> The lira touched 1,037.70 against the mark, below its previous record of 1,037.40 reached Tuesday. </P>
<P> Berlusconi's political future is in jeopardy after Milan magistrates said this week they were investigating him over bribes alleged to have been paid by his Fininvest business empire to finance police to ensure favorable tax audits. </P>
<P> Friday he again rejected opposition calls for his resignation. </P>
<P> ``I can guarantee you that as far as the prime minister is concerned, I have a firm desire to carry on,'' he said on television. </P>
<P> But he repeated he would step down if his six-month-old coalition, split by in-fighting, failed to pledge its support. </P>
<P> ``There will be an immediate decision to quit if it were to become clear that the governing majority cannot hold, cannot give the country what it needs,'' he said. </P>
<P> Berlusconi met President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro Friday to discuss the situation and the future of his five-party alliance. </P>
<P> Berlusconi has urged his partners to back him, calling for a review of the coalition - effectively a test of loyalty. </P>
<P> Ministers have said the next cabinet meeting, scheduled for Tuesday, will be devoted entirely to an examination of the cloudy political picture. </P>
<P> An opinion poll published Friday by the magazine L'Espresso said 53 percent of Italians did not believe Berlusconi should resign but showed voters split over whether his stormy coalition should survive. </P>
<P> The Northern League, Berlusconi's biggest and most troublesome ally, has said the review should be delayed until after parliament has passed next year's budget, a step which under Italian law must be taken by the end of the year. </P>
<P> Berlusconi and union leaders have agreed to meet next Wednesday amid signs they are close to an agreement to detach contentious pensions reform from the budget. </P>
<P> ``It (a deal) looks probable, let's say between probable and possible. If I had to bet I would say it is more than 50 percent,'' Berlusconi's spokesman Jas Gawronski told Reuters. </P>
<P> Planned cuts in spending on pensions and health have sparked mass protests in Italy in recent weeks and badly undermined the standing of media magnate Berlusconi, who took office in May. </P>
<P> Unions plan an eight-hour general strike against the budget on Dec. 2. </P>
<P> Success at the meeting could avert the strike and smooth the budget's passage through the Senate (upper house), where the government is short of an absolute majority. </P>
<P> The prospect of a compromise with the unions is the one bright spot in a dismal week for Berlusconi, whose Forza Italia party was trounced in local elections last Sunday. </P>
<P> The possible deal emerged at a meeting between Berlusconi and union leaders Thursday night, the first time the two parties had met since talks broke down two months ago. </P>
<P> The unions have bitterly opposed coupling radical pensions reform to the budget, saying it would not give parliament enough time to consider the measures. </P>
<P> ``The important thing is to carry out the pensions reform swiftly. The government is open to dialog as long as the budget figures remain intact,'' said Treasury Minister Lamberto Dini. </P>
<P> Berlusconi's spokesman Gawronski said any deal would not involve any great changes to the financial targets of the budget, which aims to cut next year's deficit by some $30 billion. </P>
