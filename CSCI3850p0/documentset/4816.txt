<P>  Burly Vladimir Smirnov of Kazakhstan overcame a fall early in the race Thursday to capture the 30-kilometer cross country title on the first day of the Nordic World Championships. </P>
<P> Smirnov, who was leading at the time of his tumble, went down on a tricky corner midway through the first 15-km lap. But he got up and widened his lead as he finished in one hour, 15 minutes and 52.3 seconds. </P>
<P> World Cup leader Bjorn Daehlie of Norway, the defending 30-km champion, fell moments later on the same corner. He held on to take the silver medal in 1:16:52.4 with Alexei Prokurorov of Russia, surging at the end to claim third in 1:17:35.6. </P>
<P> ``I was a little anxious before the race,'' Smirnov said in the sun-splashed finish area. ``I was a little unsure because it's the first day of these championships.'' </P>
<P> Smirnov was Olympic silver medalist in the 30-km classical technique behind Prokurorov in 1988 and world champion at the same distance in 1989. He also is the reigning World Cup champion but stands second to Daehlie this season. </P>
<P> A small but enthusiastic crowd of several hundred spectators watched as the nordic championships returned to North America for the first time since 1950. </P>
<P> Smirnov said he went down on a turn near the 8-km mark known as Albarello Corner -- so-named because Italian star Marco Albarello took a nasty fall there a year ago -- and his skis became stuck under an advertising sign. He estimated it cost him ``only 15 or 20 seconds.'' </P>
<P> When he got back on his feet, Smirnov powered through the rest of the first lap and the second 15-km loop. </P>
<P> ``I felt strong. I was unsure of the speed of the race but I am in good form,'' he said. </P>
<P> Daehlie shook his head and noted, ``It is unbelievable how fast Vladimir skied from one to seven ks. I couldn't believe he had taken that many seconds on me. </P>
<P> ``After five or six kilometers, I was sure Vladimir would be the winner.'' </P>
<P> Daehlie had been expected to miss the opening race because he'd been battling a virus for most of the past two weeks. However, he decided Wednesday, after two strong training days, that he would defend the crown he won at the 1993 World Championships in Falun, Sweden. </P>
<P> ``Right now, I'm 100 percent,'' he said, ``but for 14 days I was having problems.'' </P>
<P> The championships continue Friday with the women's 15-km classical technique race and the the jumping portion of the nordic combined, a two-day event that concludes Saturday with a 15-km race. </P>
