<P>  The International Monetary Fund said Monday that it approved a $201 million loan for Lithuania to help the Baltic country further reform its economy and bring down inflation. </P>
<P> ``Lithuania has made impressive progress in building a modern market economy in a difficult market environment,'' the IMF said in a news release announcing the loan. </P>
<P> The money will be made available over the next three years under the IMF's extended fund facility. </P>
<P> Lithuania is aiming to cut inflation to 20 percent in 1995 from an estimated 71 percent this year by keeping a tight grip on the government budget and pegging the value of its currency at four litai per dollar, the IMF said. </P>
<P> Economic growth is projected to increase to 65/8 percent next year from an estimated 1 3/8 percent in 1994, it added. </P>
<P> ``The authorities' objectives are ambitious, and their program is a strong one, with a high probability of success,'' the IMF said. </P>
