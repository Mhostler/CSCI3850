<P>  One of the 29 Canadian gray wolves released into the Northern Rockies earlier this month was found shot to death in Idaho, lying near the body of a dead newborn calf, the Lemhi County sheriff's office said Monday. </P>
<P> ``The wolf was found by the landowner who was moving cattle from one pasture to another,'' said Sam Slavin, chief deputy of the Lemhi County Sheriff's office. </P>
<P> Next to the female wolf the landowner found a dead calf and according to a local veterinarian, black hair and flesh from the calf was found in the wolf's stomach, Slavin said. </P>
<P> According to a controversial plan to reintroduce wolves into the American west, ranchers can kill a wolf if the animal is found attacking livestock. </P>
<P> ``He has not admitted or denied'' shooting the wolf, Slavin said, although the rancher has said the calf belonged to him. </P>
<P> The wolf could have been shot by a coyote hunter in the area, Slavin said. </P>
<P> Defenders of Wildlife, an environmental group, reiterated that its Wolf Compensation Fund would compensate producers at full market value for any livestock losses verified by qualified state or federal officials. </P>
<P> The fund, established in 1987, has paid approximately $17,000 to more than 20 ranchers as part of a campaign to shift economic responsibility for wolves ``away from individual livestock producers and toward the millions of people who support wolf recovery,'' the group said. </P>
<P> Sharon Rose, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFW) said investigators and wolf experts were also in the area. USFW biologists said during a routine radio-collar check, the wolf ``B-13'' was located Saturday evening and was still alive. </P>
<P> Earlier this month, 15 wolves were released into the central Idaho wilds and another 14 were sent to Yellowstone National Park. </P>
<P> But ranchers have severely criticized the plan, fearing the wolves will attack and kill livestock. The American Farm Bureau has filed a lawsuit in federal court to stop the plan, which calls for releasing 30 wolves a year for the next three to five years. </P>
