<P>  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Tuesday he would not pass judgement on Republican Sen. Jesse Helms' comment that the Israel-Syria peace effort is a fraud, saying peace efforts will continue. </P>
<P> ``I wouldn't pass a judgement,'' Rabin told Reuters when asked about Helms' comment. ``We (will continue) our policy of peace whenever and wherever it is possible to negotiate.'' </P>
<P> Rabin said pointedly that the latest Middle East Peace effort was initiated by former Republican President George Bush with the Madrid Peace Conference, and said ``we believe that we should continue.'' </P>
<P> Helms, who is line to become chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a weekend television interview that the Israel-Syria peace effort is a fraud, saying Syria does not want peace and only wants the Golan Heights and access to U.S. aid. </P>
<P> The North Carolina Republican also said he would oppose including U.S. troops in a peacekeeping force on the Golan Heights to monitor such a peace accord. </P>
<P> Rabin said the effort to work out a peace agreement with Syria is only part of Israel's overall peace negotiations. </P>
<P> ``We negotiate with various Arab partners,'' Rabin said. ``Syria is one part, the Palestinians a different one. There is no real linkage between the two.'' </P>
<P> He made the comments after a one-hour meeting with Defense Secretary William Perry. He would not say what he and Perry discussed. </P>
<P> President Clinton said Monday that the Middle East peace process was not a fraud. </P>
<P> ``The prime minister has already said the process is not a fraud,'' Clinton said after a meeting with Rabin. ``It's been quite successful. It's been the most successful process since Israel became a nation.'' </P>
<P> Clinton indirectly criticized Helms for making the comment about using U.S. troops in a peacekeeping force on the Golan Heights if Israel and Syria are able to agree to peace. </P>
<P> ``I don't think I should say or do anything ... that would undermine the possibilty of the parties reaching a peace,'' Clinton said. ``I think that ought to be the position that all Americans take.'' </P>
