<DATELINE>PARIS, April 24 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  French commentators expressed surprise on Monday at Socialist Lionel Jospin's unexpected win in the first round of the presidential election and the scattering of votes away from mainstream parties. </P>
<P> ``Jospin: the surprise,'' said both the conservative daily Le Figaro and the independent InfoMatin in banner headlines. </P>
<P> Disproving forecasts which doubted he would make it to the May 7 run-off, Jospin won the first round with 23.21 percent of the vote to 20.47 percent for conservative Paris mayor Jacques Chirac who had been widely tipped as the front-runner. </P>
<P> Conservative Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, third with 18.54 percent, failed to reach the run-off. </P>
<P> Newspapers said the first round vote had set the stage for a classic Left-Right run-off. </P>
<P> It had also produced a strong performance by leftist and rightist fringe groups which pointed to scepticism about the ability of the main parties to curb unemployment, the newspapers said. </P>
<P> Far-rightist Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the anti-immigrant National Front, gathered 15.27 percent of the vote. Communist leader Robert Hue and Trotskyite Arlette Laguiller polled 8.73 and 5.37 percent respectively. </P>
<P> ``The good performance of the far left and far right shows that a neo-populism is rising over the traditional Left-Right divide,'' said Le Figaro editor Franz-Olivier Giesbert. </P>
<P> ``(Voters) are seeking irrational solutions... They cannot wait: they want everything at once. They look towards parties living on the fringe of society.'' </P>
<P> Serge July, editor of the left-wing newspaper Liberation, said Chirac was better placed for the run-off with a theoretical 60-40 lead over Jospin. </P>
<P> But the far right's strong showing would force Chirac to review his platform after leaning to the left with social promises in the first round to beat Balladur. </P>
<P> July said Chirac would have to perform ``a fresh turn-about in his platform'' and if he won the run-off it would be with the weakest support a president has enjoyed in the 37-year-old Fifth Republic. </P>
<P> ``He will be a fragile president in a France wavering between authoritarianism and social democracy,'' July added. </P>
<P> The business newspaper Les Echos noted that Le Pen refused to say who he would back in the run-off and it said alliances to be made over the next few days were unpredictable. </P>
<P> Another business newspaper, La Tribune, said social unrest about unemployment and the fate of millions of ``socially excluded'' destitutes would dominate the run-off. </P>
<P> Newspapers also asked questions about the future of Balladur, long the election's runaway favourite. </P>
<P> Liberation said Balladur would have vanished from the political scene if he had been squarely beaten, but his narrow defeat to Chirac could prompt him to lead a rival trend within the Right. </P>
