<DATELINE>STARKE, Fla.(Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The state decided not to seek the death penalty against an ailing, wheelchair-bound killer because the elderly man probably would not outlive the appeals process, a state prosecutor said Thursday. </P>
<P> James ``Pop'' Agan, 67, was sentenced Wednesday to two concurrent life prison terms on two murder counts in the north Florida town of Starke, where he has been serving time at a state prison for another murder. </P>
<P> ``This man is going to leave the institution in a pine box. He's going to get the death penalty. He's just going to get it long before I could give it to him,'' said Rod Smith, the state attorney for Bradford County, where the state prison is located. </P>
<P> ``The reality is he was not going to be executed because he would not live through the appeals process,'' said Smith. </P>
<P> Appeals in Florida death penalty cases usually take eight to 10 years. </P>
<P> Agan, an Alabama native, pleaded guilty to stabbing another inmate to death in 1980 and no contest to committing a similar killing last October. He already is serving a life term for a third, unrelated murder. </P>
<P> He was wheeled into court Wednesday and needed help from his lawyer when asked to raise his right hand to take an oath to tell the truth. </P>
<P> Agan suffers from two different forms of cancer, Smith said, adding that he would probably spend the rest of his life in a prison hospital wing. </P>
