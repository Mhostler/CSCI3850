<DATELINE>OKLAHOMA CITY (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  An Oklahoma attorney said Monday he had been appointed to defend bombing suspect Timothy McVeigh, replacing two attorneys who asked to leave the case. </P>
<P> Stephen Jones, a well-known defense attorney from Enid, Okla., said he had been asked by U.S. Chief District Judge David Russell to represent McVeigh. </P>
<P> McVeigh is the only person so far charged with the April 19 bombing of Oklahoma City's federal building in which 167 people, including 19 children, died. He is being held at a federal prison near Oklahoma City. </P>
<P> ``I did not seek or request the appointment, or encourage it in any way. I have been drafted,'' Jones, 54, said in a statement. ``However, I will do my duty, and I deem it my duty...to accept,'' he said. </P>
<P> Jones replaces court-appointed attorneys John Coyle and Susan Otto, both of Oklahoma City, who had asked to be replaced as McVeigh's attorneys because they knew people who died in the bombing. </P>
<P> Jones said that, in light of ``this great and unprecedented tragedy'', it was important ``that the rule of law prevail, and that the orderly administration of justice proceed to a resolution.'' </P>
<P> ``No greater insult could be visited upon the victims of this bombing than to proceed in a lynch-mob or a feeding frenzy atmosphere,'' he said. </P>
<P> Jones said he realized that not everyone would understand his appointment as an attorney who must provide a vigorous defense ``in what has been described as the largest mass murder in our nation's history.'' </P>
<P> But he said any defendant in a death-penalty case had a right to ``effective assistance of counsel.'' </P>
<P> During his only appearance in public since his arrest, McVeigh, a 27-year old Gulf War veteran, was jeered by a crowd shouting ``baby-killer''. </P>
