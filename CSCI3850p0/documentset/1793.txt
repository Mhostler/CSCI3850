<P>  Emperor Akihito, on the first state visit to France by a Japanese emperor, won backing for his country's bid for a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council. </P>
<P> ``Japan plays an increasingly important role on the world stage and France won't be the last country to recognize this,'' French President Francois Mitterand told Akihito in a speech at a formal dinner Monday, the first day of the visit. </P>
<P> ``Given the influence your country has gained, we think it is desirable that, in a reform of the Security Council, Japan should have a permanent seat on a par with its rank, its activity and its means,'' Mitterrand said. </P>
<P> France holds one of five permanent seats on the council, with Russia, Britain, the United States and China occupying the others. Both Germany and Japan have long been pushing for permanent representation on the council. </P>
<P> The six-day visit by Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko was intended to improve Japan's international image and boost already friendly bilateral ties. </P>
<P> Both the French and the Japanese were anxious that the trip, devoid of official business, should serve to improve the sometimes negative image the two countries have of each other. </P>
<P> Akihito was accorded full military honors on his arrival at Orly airport, south of Paris, ahead of a full schedule of cultural and political events in Paris and southern France. </P>
<P> Their visit, the second stop on a three-nation European tour that began Sunday in Germany, was meant strictly to deepen ``friendly relations and mutual understanding,'' Japan's new ambassador to France, Koichiro Matsuura, said ahead of the trip. </P>
<P> On Tuesday, the emperor is to lay a wreath at the tomb of France's Unknown Soldier, meet Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac, and visit members of the 15-20,000-strong Japanese community in France. </P>
