<P>  The Senate Friday voted 94-0 to bar U.S. aid for Colombia unless the president certifies that the Colombia government is fully cooperating in counter-narcotics operations. </P>
<P> The president would also have to certify that Bogota is investigating alleged government corruption and is taking steps to disrupt the Cali drug cartel under the amendment adopted to a U.S. foreign aid bill by North Carolina Republican Jesse Helms. </P>
<P> The vote is another strain on U.S.-Colombia relations. Those strains include U.S. concerns about allegations that President-elect Ernesto Samper accepted drug money for his campaign. He won a close victory June 19. </P>
<P> On Monday, the Drug Enforcement Administration cancelled a meeting with the head of the Colombian National Police and the Colombian delegation abruptly returned home. </P>
<P> Frank Shults, a DEA spokesman, said the agency learned belatedly that Major General Octavio Vargas-Silva was seeking to resolve drug policy differences that have put U.S. intelligence-sharing with Colombia on hold rather than simply paying a courtesy call. </P>
<P> ``A meeting with such a political and diplomatic agenda requires substantial preparation,'' Shults said. ``Because this cannot be accomplished on such short notice, we had to unfortunately cancel the meeting.'' </P>
<P> But Colombia's Defense Ministry said the meeting had been arranged for weeks and there was no confusion over the issues to be discussed, progress in Colombia's war on drugs. </P>
