<DATELINE>NEWPORT, Tenn.(Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  One deputy sheriff was killed and one wounded during a shootout Tuesday with two prison escapees holed up in a relative's home here. </P>
<P> At least one of the convicts died later when the besieged house went up in flames. </P>
<P> The slain officer was identified as Scott Miller but no other information on the officers, both with the Cocke County Sheriff's Department, was immediately available. </P>
<P> Miller was shot in the head, the other officer in the hand, according to District Attorney General Al Shchumtzer Jr.. </P>
<P> The escapees appeared to have been waiting in ambush for the officers, Schmutzer reported.'' They just opened up on them,'' he said. </P>
<P> The slain officer's body was recoverd from inside the house by a SWAT team from the neighboring Knox Country Sheriff's Department. </P>
<P> After officers lobbed tear gas into the house, it caught fire and burned to the ground. One body, tentatively identified as that of escapee Curtis Eugene ``Pickle'' Jones, 46, was recovered. </P>
<P> The house in this small East Tennessee mountain community was the home of Jones' aunt, Esther Lee Crumbley, 70, who came out when the fire started. </P>
<P> Authorities, who said it was impossible for anyone to have escaped the inferno, continued their search for the body of the second fugitive, Donald Nolan, 47 of Nashville.. </P>
<P> The pair escaped from Oct. 6 from Turney Center Industrial Prison a state prison near Nashville about 230 miles west of Newport. Jones was serving 114 years for rape, kidnapping and robbery. Nolan was serving 40 years for aggravated robbery and kidnaping. </P>
<P> After authorities received tips that the two escapees were hiding in the house, officers from several police agencies went there to investigate. Details are sketchy, but the first shots were fired at the officers from inside a bedroom as the oficers entered the house Tuesday morning. </P>
<P> The officers retreated. More officers arrived and shortly after noon, several officers again entered the house. During another exchange of gunfire, the deputy was hit and apparently died instantly, authorities said. </P>
