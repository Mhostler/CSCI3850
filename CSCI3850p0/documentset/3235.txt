<P>  President Fidel Castro, the only leader from the region not invited, heaped scorn on last weekend's Summit of the Americas, saying that behind the plans it produced was the ``imperial power reorganizing the world''. </P>
<P> In a speech late Wednesday at Havana University, the Cuban leader said the problems discussed at the Miami meeting such as corruption, drug trafficking and low standards of health and education were caused by ``colonialism, neocolonialism and imperialism''. </P>
<P> The summit documents talked a lot about democracy and human rights when it was ``the United States that spawned the worst regimes in the world, from intervention in Guatemala to the imposition of military dictatorships in Nicaragua, Chile, Argentina, Brazil and other places,'' he said. </P>
<P> The United States taught the dictatorships the methods of torture they used, added Castro, whose remarks were quoted by the ruling Communist Party newspaper Granma. </P>
<P> The goals of the summit in areas such as health and education had been achieved by Cuba years ago, he said. </P>
<P> The Cuban leader, who was not invited to President Clinton's summit on the grounds he was not democratically elected, was speaking at an event in honor of Hugo Chavez, the Venezuelan ex-military officer who led a coup attempt in 1992. </P>
<P> Chavez, who was leaving Cuba Wednesday after a two-day visit in his capacity as leader of a leftist organization, has been given a top-rank reception. </P>
<P> His visit has provided the setting for radical discourse in marked contrast to the thinking prevalent at the Miami summit. </P>
<P> Castro met Chavez in person when he arrived in Havana Tuesday -- a gesture more usually reserved for heads of state -- and then accompanied him to events Wednesday, including a tough political speech given by the Venezuelan. </P>
<P> Chavez said he did not want to take up arms again, but warned that current problems in Venezuela could lead to a popular uprising while the armed forces could divide into those repressing the people and those behind them. </P>
<P> This could lead to civil war, said the former lieutenant colonel, who was jailed for his coup attempt against former president Carlos Andres Perez and later released. </P>
<P> Castro was in attendance as Chavez laid a wreath to the 19th century Latin American liberation hero Simon Bolivar who inspired Chavez's movement, and then in the front row as the Venezuelan gave his talk at the nearby Simon Bolivar House in old Havana. </P>
<P> He later accompanied Chavez to an event staged in his honor at the Havana University. </P>
