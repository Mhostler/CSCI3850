<P>  Tibet is being battered by its worst snowstorm in half a century, with livestock freezing to death and nearly 1,000 people cut off in the remote Himalayan region, China's Xinhua news agency said Thursday. </P>
<P> The disaster-stricken areas are the grasslands of northern Tibet, where snow has been falling since mid-February, Xinhua quoted local officials as saying. </P>
<P> In Nagqu prefecture alone, 906 people and their 14,300 head of livestock have been cut off from contact with the outside, and more than 130,000 local residents and over 2.87 million livestock have been affected, officials said. </P>
<P> The number of people and livestock suffering from frostbite is rising, and in some areas animals have frozen to death, officials said. </P>
<P> The storm was more serious than blizzards in 1989, they said. </P>
<P> Xinhua described the storm as the worst in Tibet for 50 years. The blizzard comes as Tibetans begin celebrations on Thursday to mark their new year. </P>
<P> In some areas, snow is more than 8 inches deep and blankets some places to a depth of 4 feet, Xinhua said. </P>
<P> Snow was still falling in some areas and one official warned that the situation could deteriorate. </P>
<P> Officials have left for the affected areas to help with relief work, Xinhua said. </P>
