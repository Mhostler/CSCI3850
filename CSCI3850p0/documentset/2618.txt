<DATELINE>LUSAKA, Zambia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  African leaders who had planned to witness the signing of an Angolan peace accord in Lusaka Tuesday instead held talks to save it. </P>
<P> The signing ceremony has been postponed until Sunday after UNITA rebels backed out in response to the government capture of their headquarters in Huambo. </P>
<P> The planned start Thursday of a cease-fire in the 20-year-old war is also receding. </P>
<P> Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe chaired a meeting in the Zambian capital to salvage the pact, diplomats said. South African President Nelson Mandela and Zambia's President Frederick Chiluba were also taking part. </P>
<P> South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki has already said the leaders would take unspecified action should the latest peace bid crumble as others have before it. </P>
<P> A 1991 peace agreement led to elections the next year but UNITA chief Jonas Savimbi took his forces back to war after disputing their defeat at the polls. </P>
<P> At least 100,000 civilians were killed in the conflict since then, according to a new human rights report. </P>
<P> Diplomats were pessimistic the signing could even take place Sunday so deep is the distrust between UNITA and Angolan government negotiators. </P>
<P> The pact should have been signed Tuesday but UNITA said it could not discuss peace while the army was trying to wipe it out on the battlefield. </P>
<P> In the past two weeks, after both sides had initialled the pact, the government army overran the rebel stronghold Huambo in central Angola. </P>
<P> Government and rebel military delegations met in Lusaka on Monday night to work out the details of implementing a truce. </P>
<P> They were joined later by U.N. mediator Alioune Blondin Beye, chairman of the peace talks, apparently after some disagreements, government sources said. </P>
<P> Angola's war broke out on independence from Portugal in 1975 and has killed hundreds of thousands of people, displaced millions and ruined the economy of a country rich in oil and diamonds. </P>
<P> The U.S.-based Human Rights Watch said Tuesday about 100,000 civilians had been killed since the war resumed in 1992. </P>
<P> It said in a report that both sides were guilty of torture, summary executions and the recruitment of child soldiers. It accused both sides of committing atrocities against civilians. </P>
<P> Government forces indiscriminately bombed towns, killed and robbed civilians during military operations and restricted the activities of international relief agencies, it said. </P>
<P> UNITA had also committed ``systematic and horrendous violations of the laws of war,'' it said. </P>
<P> The report said the government had become the biggest arms importer in Sub-Saharan Africa, buying more than $3.5 billion of military equipment over the past two years. </P>
<P> It named the government's main military suppliers as Russia, Brazil, North Korea, Spain, Portugal, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. </P>
<P> It said UNITA had also bought large quantities of arms from Russia and Zaire with the revenue from diamonds mined illegally in rebel-held territory. </P>
