<P>  North Korea Wednesday warned that the United States' insistence on providing South Korean-type nuclear reactors would ``totally destroy'' negotiations to solve the Korean peninsula nuclear dispute. </P>
<P> ``The U.S. had better take an honest stand with the never- to-be-missed last chance of negotiations, clearly mindful that if the negotiations are totally destroyed, it may endanger (sic) perilous consequences,'' said state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). </P>
<P> The statement, monitored in Tokyo, was issued just hours before U.S. and North Korean delegations were slated to open a first round of talks later Wednesday at North Korea's mission in Berlin. </P>
<P> North Korea customarily issues truculent threats and demands to set the tone for tough negotiations, analysts say. </P>
<P> North Korea blamed the United States for causing the last series of meetings in Berlin to be cut short March 27 by insisting that South Korea supply light-water nuclear reactors under the nuclear agreement signed by Washington and Pyongyang last October. </P>
<P> Under the accord, the United States agreed to provide Pyongyang with $4.5 billion in new nuclear technology and alternative energy supplies until the plants are operational. </P>
<P> For its part, North Korea pledged to halt and eventually dismantle its nuclear program, which Washington and its allies suspected was attempting to develop a nuclear bomb. </P>
<P> The United States insists that South Korea, Pyongyang's longtime enemy, should be the North's main reactor supplier because it is the only state that agreed to pick up most of the multibillion-dollar price tag. </P>
<P> North Korea fears the South Korea reactors would work as a ``Trojan horse'' to pry open its closed society and overturn its communist political system. </P>
<P> ``If the U.S. attempts to test our will, forcing us to accede to its unreasonable stand even at this juncture, this cannot be construed otherwise than an attempt to totally drive us out of the negotiation table,'' KCNA warned. </P>
<P> North Korea has threatened to resume its nuclear programme if no agreement is reached by April 21, but U.S. officials have called that stance a negotiating tactic by Pyongyang. </P>
<P> Robert Gallucci, the chief U.S. negotiator, Monday said however that Washington will resume its request for United Nations sanctions against North Korea if it breaks the deal. </P>
