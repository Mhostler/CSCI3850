<DATELINE>CHERBOURG, France (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  French navy police early Thursday stopped Greenpeace anti-nuclear protesters trying to block a British vessel which was preparing to ship nuclear waste from France to Japan. </P>
<P> A Navy spokesman said some 20 militants were intercepted as they sailed three rubber dinghies toward the Pacific Pintail entering the Channel port of Cherbourg at 3.45 a.m. (local). </P>
<P> The protesters were were taken to Navy headquarters for questioning. </P>
<P> ``It was all very calm. These are non-violent people,'' the spokesman said. </P>
<P> A court in Cherbourg had barred members of the environmental campaign group from approaching the vessel, warning them they would be fined the equivalent of about $60,000. </P>
<P> A Greenpeace ship, the Moby Dick, and the trawler Les Deux Amis -- chartered by another ecologist group -- were escorted to another part of the port by a navy ship and told to dock. </P>
<P> The Pacific Pintail was to load nuclear waste during the morning for shipment to Japan. Greenpeace opposes what it calls a ``nuclear garbage barge,'' saying a fire on board could release the waste. </P>
<P> It has denounced the court ruling, sought by shipper Pacific Nuclear Transport Ltd, a unit of Britain's state-owned nuclear power company British Nuclear Fuels. </P>
<P> Japan, with no reprocessing facilities of its own, sends spent fuel to Europe to be turned into fuel-grade plutonium. The Pacific Pintail will be carrying 14 tons of waste from this process encased in glass and weighing a total of 112 metric tons. </P>
<P> The shipment will be the first of several to Japan in the coming decade after reprocessing by French state-run nuclear power company COGEMA. Greenpeace has demonstrated several times over the shipments in recent days. </P>
<P> COGEMA has said the Pacific Pintail was specially designed with a double hull for such waste and the transport complied with the latest international safety rules. </P>
<P> Tokyo plans eventually to ship 7,100 tons of spent fuel to France, yielding 30 tons of fuel-grade plutonium. </P>
