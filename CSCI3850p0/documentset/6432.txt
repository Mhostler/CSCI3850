<P>  Jordanian newspapers on Wednesday lambasted U.S. Senate Republican leader Bob Dole for introducing legislation setting a timetable for moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem by 1999. </P>
<P> ``The Middle East peace process that is facing unlimited difficulties only needed such a move to receive another blow that could be fatal,'' wrote the Arabic daily ad-Dustour. </P>
<P> ``This rash American move will have dangerous repercussions not only on the fragile peace process, but also on its image in the region and its future role in the area and the world.'' </P>
<P> It said the move was humiliating for Arabs and would provide ``extremists'' with a pretext for more violence. </P>
<P> Most Jordanian newspapers linked Dole's bill, put forth on Tuesday and quickly denounced by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, to American and Israeli elections in 1996. </P>
<P> ``Moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem would be a sure recipe for derailing the whole peace effort,'' the liberal English-language newspaper Jordan Times said. </P>
<P> Under Dole's plan groundbreaking for the new embassy would take place by the end of next year and the mission would officially open no later than May 31, 1999. </P>
<P> Israel's capital is Jerusalem, but the United States and most other countries maintain embassies in Tel Aviv, on grounds that Jerusalem's status has yet to be decided in peace talks. </P>
<P> Israel seized the eastern half of Jerusalem from the Arabs in the 1967 Six-Day War and proclaimed the whole city its eternal capital. But Palestinians hope that one day they will have a state with East Jerusalem as its capital. </P>
