<DATELINE>CHICAGO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Michael Jordan's return to basketball may not have matched his standards but it won cheers from a country yearning for signs of promise in a pro sports world where business threatens to smother fun. </P>
<P> ``As usual, his timing is perfect, lending a gentle, refreshing sentiment to a sports landscape otherwise gone awry,'' remarked Chicago Sun-Times columnist Jim Mariotti. </P>
<P> Jordan's comments to reporters following the Chicago Bulls 103-96 loss to the Indiana Pacers Sunday drew almost as much attention as the superstar's lukewarm 7-for-28 shooting. </P>
<P> ``I'm only back for the love of the game. I'm not back for extra money,'' Jordan said at the post-game briefing. </P>
<P> Fans, rivals and seasoned observers alike embraced Jordan's explanation and reveled in having him back on court. </P>
<P> ``The Beatles and Elvis are back,'' said Pacers coach Larry Brown. </P>
<P> ``He was back for love of basketball, conceding that baseball's dismal impasse affected his decision to switch sports,'' the New York Times' George Vecsey wrote of Jordan, who earlier this month quit his pursuit of a baseball career. </P>
<P> ``Michael Jordan has launched his second coming simply because he loves basketball. There is no other scheming impetus, he swears, except the heart,'' Mariotti added. </P>
<P> Jordan said his $4 million annual salary with the Bulls would remain the same. He earns an estimated $30 million annually from commercial endorsements. </P>
<P></P>
<P> ``I wanted to instill some positive things back in the game. There's a lot of negative things that have been happening ... the young guys are not taking care of their responsibility for maintaining that love for the game. </P>
<P> ``They shouldn't let it waste to where it's so business-oriented that the integrity of the game is at stake ... I just think you should respect the game itself, certainly not take advantage of it,'' Jordan said. </P>
<P></P>
<P> ``Don't waste time analyzing Michael Jordan's 7-for-28 shooting or the fact that his return wasn't victorious -- according to the scoreboard in Market Square Arena. </P>
<P> ``But a guy walked in, basically off the street, and put energy into a building, into a team, into a game, into a sport, even into the entire sports-crazed Midwestern region in a way only Michael Jordan could.'' </P>
<P> Terry Pluto, of Akron, Ohio's Beacon Journal, wrote: ``Once again, Michael Jordan gave the NBA a lesson in greatness. </P>
<P> ``Virtually every shot was contested and points were earned. But it was a clean game. No cheap shots. No taunting and finger-pointing. Nothing approaching a fight ... you know that Jordan and Reggie Miller were talking to each other during much of the game. But it was done between them ... man-to-man ... neither player out to embarrass the other. </P>
<P> ``There has always been some sort of trash-talking on the NBA soundtrack, but it only is the recent group of so-called stars that has turned it into a form of Gangsta rap.'' </P>
