<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Los Angeles District Attorney Gil Garcetti says his office will try football legend O.J. Simpson a second time if his murder trial ends in a hung jury or a mistrial, according to a Thursday broadcast report. </P>
<P> ``If it's a hung jury ... we will retry this case,'' Garcetti told CBS television's ``This Morning'' show. </P>
<P> There is also a chance that more jurors will be excused before the jury gets the case, Garcetti said on the program. </P>
<P> ``I think the probability is very high that the 12 (jurors) that are sitting right now are not going to be the 12 who will ultimately make the decision. </P>
<P> ``I anticipate there will be jurors excused for various reasons ... it's going to happen. It looks like it's going to be June, maybe even July (before the case ends),'' Garcetti said. </P>
<P> Simpson is accused in the brutal stabbing deaths last year of his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman, outside Nicole Simpson's home. </P>
<P> When asked if he thought the defense was appropriately bringing out the issue of race in the trial that started January Garcetti said: ``Remember the role of the defense ... do everything and anything you can to make sure your client is not convicted of the crime.'' </P>
<P> Simpson, who has pleaded not guilty in the murders, is a former winner of the Heisman Trophy, symbolizing the highest achievement in college football and is a member of professional football's Hall of Fame. </P>
<P> Once a fleet and elusive running back, he went on to gain national recognition as a sportscaster, television advertising spokesman and actor. </P>
