<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Howard Cosell, the trail-blazing broadcaster who made ``Monday Night Football'' the most popular TV sports series in history, died early Sunday, ABC colleagues said. </P>
<P> Cosell, who worked for ABC radio and television for 38 years, died from cancer in New York at the Hospital for Joint Diseases Orthopedic Institute. He was 77 years old, colleagues said. </P>
<P> His official retirement went almost unnoticed in 1991 and his final years were spent in his New York apartment, a virtual recluse, suffering from cancer, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease. </P>
<P> His wife, Emmie, died in 1990. </P>
<P> Cosell was best known for his 14 years as the ``tell it like it is'' color commentator on ``Monday Night Football,'' the weekly pro football broadcast that took sports into the arena of regular prime-time television for the first time. </P>
<P> With his staccato voice and tough stance, Cosell was so controversial that in a TV Guide poll taken in the mid-1970s he topped the list of ``most hated sportscaster'' and the list of ''most loved sportscaster.'' </P>
<P> ``He was regarded as one of a kind, feisty, a legend. There is nobody else like him, no one ever will be,'' said an ABC colleague who asked not to identified. </P>
<P> Cosell was one of the best-known television personalities in America because of his visibility on ``Monday Night Football,'' which started in the fall of 1970 in an attempt by ABC to raise its moribund Monday ratings. </P>
<P> He was inducted into the television Hall of Fame in 1994, but was too ill to attend the ceremonies. </P>
