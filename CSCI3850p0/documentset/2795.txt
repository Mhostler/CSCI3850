<P>  Democratic President Bill Clinton and Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole announced on Wednesday an accord enabling Dole to support the GATT trade pact when it comes to a Senate vote next week. </P>
<P> ``I'm pleased to announce that we're one step closer to getting broad, bipartisan support for GATT,'' Clinton said at a White House ceremony announcing his meeting of minds with Dole, whose support is crucial to Senate approval for the pact lowering worldwide trade barriers. </P>
<P> ``An understanding has been reached with Senator Dole to reaffirm our United States sovereignty and to make sure that reaffirmation will be protected in the GATT process,'' he said. ''That means that the WTO (World Trade Organization, created by the pact) will be accountable and fair and will meet our expectations.'' </P>
<P> The WTO is the mechanism for arbitrating international trade disputes under the new accord, a prospect that caused Dole and some other members of Congress to question whether U.S. sovereignty and interests would be adequately protected. </P>
<P> White House officials said Clinton had agreed to Dole's demand that a special U.S. review panel will be set up to oversee decisions of the WTO and provide the trigger for a congressional vote on U.S. withdrawal from GATT if too many WTO decisions go against the United States. </P>
<P> ``I will be writing a personal letter to each of my Republican colleagues in the Senate, enclosing all of this material, asking them to read it very carefully, and suggesting that in my view, we ought to be all in support of GATT when it comes up next week,'' Dole said. </P>
<P> ``There should be a big, big vote, not a narrow vote but a big ... bipartisan margin as we've always had when it came to votes on trade.'' </P>
