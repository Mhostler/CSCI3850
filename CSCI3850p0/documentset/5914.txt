<P>  Philippine police rounded up eight Moslems in an intensified hunt for extremists as the government considered legislation to combat political violence, officials said on Friday. </P>
<P> They said police seized guns and drugs from three of five houses they searched on Thursday night. </P>
<P> Police were preparing to charge the eight with illegal possession of guns and drugs and would investigate whether they had links with the radical Abu Sayyaf group that has been sowing fear in the south. </P>
<P> The officials said police originally detained 12 people, one of them a Pakistani, but later freed him and three others after finding no strong evidence linking them to guerrillas. </P>
<P> President Fidel Ramos ordered the Justice Department to study possible legislation that would impose stiff penalties on acts of terrorism. </P>
<P> His directive followed a meeting of the National Security Council (NSC) Ramos convened to discuss the rising threat of extremism in the Philippines as well as other security issues. </P>
<P> The proposed ``anti-terrorism law is designed to improve the substantive provisions of existing penal laws that will directly address terrorism, including the control of the entry of suspected foreign terrorists and their funding support into the country,'' a presidential palace statement said. </P>
<P> Top Manila policeman Jewel Canson said he had deployed more men around foreign embassies, shopping centres and government buildings to head off possible extremist attacks. </P>
<P> The alert was prompted by the raid by alleged Abu Sayyaf rebels on the southern town of Ipil on April 4 in which at least 53 people were killed and the town centre razed. </P>
<P> The military said some of the attackers eluded a long army chase and reached safety. </P>
<P> On Thursday, soldiers bombed and rocketed an island near Zamboanga city believed to be a rebel hideout. </P>
<P> ``The bombing sorties are part of our pursuit operations. We have to do this to deny the enemy their traditional lair,'' Southern Military Command chief Major-General Edgardo Batenga told reporters in Zamboanga. </P>
