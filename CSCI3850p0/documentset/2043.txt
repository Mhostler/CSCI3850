<DATELINE>BRIDGEPORT, Conn (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Clinton attacked the Republican leadership of Congress Saturday, saying they sought to return the country to the politics of the ``enemies' list'' of the 1970s as they campaigned to take control of Capitol Hill in fall elections. </P>
<P> The president's remarks were an apparent swipe at Georgian Representative Newt Gingrich, the second ranking Republican in the House who privately told lobbyists last week that Democrats were the ``enemy of normal Americans.'' </P>
<P> Clinton told a political rally in Bridgeport that the Republicans showed where they wanted to take the country with their ``Contract for America'' in which Republican members of Congress and candidates promise tax cuts and deficit reduction. </P>
<P> ``They have told us what they are going to do. They are going to give us a trickle-down economics of the 1980s. They are going to give the politics of the enemies' list of the 1970s,'' the president said, in a reference to the political ``enemies list'' kept by former President Richard Nixon. </P>
<P> Clinton, who is enjoying a bump up in the public opinion polls -- especially on foreign policy -- also accused Capitol Hill Republicans of killing off reform legislation for the sake of special interests. </P>
<P> He said the Republican congressional leadership ``got all the lobbyists together and they said, it's quoted in the Washington Post, 'We killed campaign finance reform for you. We killed lobby reform for you. We share your values. So give us money and don't you give the Democrats money, or else.' </P>
<P> ``That's what they did. Now what will they do if we give them power?'' the president said as the crowd at Bridgeport's Sikorsky airport cheered under the sunny fall sky. </P>
<P> Clinton, who has watched some Democratic candidates avoid him this year because of his relative unpopularity, got to hear one candidate gush over him Saturday. </P>
<P> Bill Curry, a Democrat running for governor of Connecticut against Republican John Rowland -- for the seat being vacated by the retiring Lowell Weicker -- said he was thrilled to be on the same platform with the president. He said he wished his father were still alive to see it. </P>
<P> ``I am honored and proud to be standing on this podium with someone who has fought for everyone of us, the President of the United States, Bill Clinton,'' Curry declared. </P>
<P> Clinton later attended a fundraiser for Curry, who is trailing Rowland by a few percentage points, that raised $300,000, administration officials said. </P>
<P> Clinton was to fly to Miami Saturday afternoon for an appearance with the younger brother of his wife Hillary Rodham Clinton. Democrat Hugh Rodham trails incumbent Republican Connie Mack in the race for the Senate. </P>
<P> Mrs Clinton is accompanying her husband on the trip in their first joint appearance of the fall congressional campaign. The Clintons were to go to a fundraiser for Rodham, then join Democratic Senator Bob Graham of Florida for another fundraiser for senatorial candidates expected to raise $700,000. </P>
<P> A new poll Time Magazine/CNN poll released Saturday found support for Clinton on the rise for the first time in weeks. </P>
<P> The poll, which has a 3.5 point margin of error, found Clinton's general approval rating up two points to 44 percent. Although 47 percent still disapprove of his handling of the presidency, the rating is his best level since mid-August. </P>
<P> It also revealed a general increase of support for the president's policies in both Haiti and Iraq. </P>
