<P>  Coalition deputies brawled in parliament Thursday, starkly illustrating the disarray within Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's fraying two-month government. </P>
<P> Members of Berlusconi's Forza Italia party and deputies from the federalist Northern League had to be separated by guards when stormy exchanges on a decree limiting magistrates' powers of arrest turned into a scuffle. </P>
<P> Berlusconi's authority suffered badly Tuesday when he gave in to a revolt by partners in his three-party coalition and scrapped the unpopular decree billed by critics as a whitewash for corrupt old-guard politicians. </P>
<P> Two deputies, Francesco Formenti of the League and Giuseppe Lazzarini of Forza Italia, were pulled away from each other by guards as they grappled to opposition cheers. </P>
<P> Two ministers in the squabbling coalition, portrayed by Berlusconi when it was installed as a recipe to end political instability, forecast Thursday it would not last a year and early general elections could follow. </P>
<P> ``Given today's climate, I think it will be impossible for the government to get beyond next spring,'' said Transport Minister Pubblio Fiori of the coalition party, the National Alliance. </P>
<P> Accusing the League of torpedoing the decree to weaken Berlusconi, Fiori said the rivalry was so intense that ``the next time there's a cabinet meeting we're going to go with a lawyer.'' </P>
<P> Labor Minister Clemente Mastella, a member of the small center-right CCD party, also forecast that the coalition would fall apart by the spring. </P>
<P> ``These are 10 fundamental months to establish a political majority that does not now exist. It's either that or hell,'' he told La Stampa newspaper. </P>
<P> The chaos erupted as the assembly prepared to vote to reject the decree. A rejection allows the cabinet to submit amended measures on preventive custody to restore bribery and corruption to a list of offenses for which suspects can be detained pre-trial. </P>
<P> Forza Italia deputy parliamentary leader Pietro Di Muccio said he would abstain because it was ``better to have a thousand delinquents free than a single innocent man in jail.'' </P>
<P> That drew jeers and catcalls from members of the League. </P>
<P> The decree debacle was Berlusconi's first serious defeat in a lightning seven-month political rise and has cast deep doubt on his coalition's ability to tackle contentious issues, including Italy's huge budget deficit. </P>
