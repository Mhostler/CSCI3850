<DATELINE>VANCOUVER, Canada (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The mighty American gun lobby is taking aim at Canada by threatening a tourism boycott if the government goes ahead with new firearms controls. </P>
<P> The U.S. National Rifle Association, which claims 3.5 million members, and hunters groups in several states are warning politicians, including Prime Minister Jean Chretien, that Canada will suffer economically if it enacts the reforms. </P>
<P> The new law requires registration of all guns. </P>
<P> ``An overwhelming negative reaction can be anticipated and it could seriously erode revenue into Canada generated by visiting U.S. sportsmen and women,'' Tanya Metaksa, executive director of the NRA's lobbying arm, wrote to Chretien. A copy of letter was provided to Reuters. </P>
<P> The League of Kentucky Sportsmen said it asked its 75,000 members not to hunt or fish in Canada in 1995. </P>
<P> ``Should this legislation pass, we will continue our efforts to boycott all future hunting and fishing in Canada,'' wrote executive director Robert Smith. </P>
<P> Hunting and fishing vacations are among Canada's most popular visitor attractions. Gun activists say U.S. hunters and fishers spend about $440 million Canadian ($314 million U.S.) a year in Canada. </P>
<P> They are outraged at a new law requiring all guns to be registered. It will also ban most rifles and handguns not used for hunting or sport and impose longer jail sentences for crimes in which guns are used. </P>
<P> The reforms were approved in principle by the House of Commons this week but face several more legislative hurdles before becoming law. </P>
<P> Passage is considered likely but Canada's nascent gun lobby hopes it can defeat the bill with the support of its more powerful U.S. counterpart. The Saskatchewan Wildlife Federation which represents hunters and similar groups have asked U.S. gun activists to write to Canadian politicians. </P>
<P> ``We've had responses from the NRA, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Texas and many more are coming,'' said Edward Begin, executive director of the Sakskatchewan group. </P>
<P> Critics point out that tourism revenue from U.S. hunters represents only a small portion of the C$25 billion Canadian ($17.8 billion U.S.) spent in total by tourists in Canada. </P>
<P> They also note that foreign visitors are already required to register their guns with customs authorities when they enter Canada. </P>
<P> Wendy Cukier of the Coalition for Gun Control predicted the new laws would actually boost, rather than hurt, tourism. </P>
<P> The U.S. boycott campaign ``is a sign of desperation. They're trying to bring in the heavy hitters,'' she said. </P>
