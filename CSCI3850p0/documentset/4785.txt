<P>  Jordan questioned Washington's commitment to Middle East peace Wednesday and said there were only six months left for progress before Israel and the United States become preoccupied with 1996 elections. </P>
<P> Foreign Minister Abdul-Karim al-Kabariti, speaking as U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher arrived in Cairo to begin a regional tour, said this period would show the intentions of Washington and Israel. </P>
<P> Kabariti criticized the United States, which has angered Arabs by failing to press Israel in peace talks and upset Jordan specifically by failing so far to honor a pledge to cancel its debt to Washington. </P>
<P> His comments were the harshest against Israel and the United States by Jordan since it made peace with Israel last October, becoming only the second Arab state to sign a peace treaty. </P>
<P> ``If there is no tangible progress on the peace track in this limited period, then it would be very difficult to achieve anything because of the election pressures that will face the Israeli government and later the U.S. administration,'' he said. </P>
<P> Israel faces a general election in 1966 when the United States holds its presidential election. </P>
<P> ``If there is to be something that can continue on its own, regardless of election developments in Israel and America, it has to be established now,'' he told Reuters. </P>
<P> Israel this week sent a similar warning to Syria, setting this summer as a deadline for ending the impasse in their peace talks. But Kabariti focused blame for the problems in Middle East peace talks on Israel. </P>
<P> ``I am not very happy with the general atmosphere of the peace process and I think that what is happening on the Palestinian track is very frustrating,'' Kabariti said. </P>
<P> Israel refuses to redeploy its troops in the West Bank and allow Palestinian elections in line with its peace deal because of what it says is lax security in Palestinian self-rule areas. </P>
<P> Kabariti said the next months would ``test Israel's intentions'' and a failure to carry out its 1993 agreement with the Palestinians would also undermine peace efforts with Syria. </P>
