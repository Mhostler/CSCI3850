<P>  U.S. Army officials said Wednesday that bad judgement, inadequate supervision and poor communications led to the deaths of four Ranger trainees last month at a training camp in northwestern Florida. </P>
<P> Maj. Gen. John Hendrix, commanding officer at Fort Benning, said in a statement that a number of steps would be taken to prevent similar incidents in the future. </P>
<P> The Army's six-week investigation concluded that ``failure in supervision and judgement, lack of situational awareness and lack of control placed Ranger students in water too cold, too deep and too long for safe operations,'' he said. </P>
<P> The Army post, which is the headquarters for the Ranger Training Brigade as well as the 75th Ranger Regiment, will develop new medical-rescue procedures and more effective training for swamp maneuvers, the general said. </P>
<P> The elite special forces unit will reassess the ``buddy'' system which Rangers employ in the field. </P>
<P> Hendrix also said the Army could decide to equip medical helicopters with global positioning systems that would use orbiting satellites to locate missing soldiers. </P>
<P> Four men who were training to become Rangers died of hypothermia at the Florida Ranger training camp near Pensacola during maneuvers Feb. 15 and 16. </P>
<P> Meanwhile, the chairman of the House of Representatives' National Security Committee said Congress will evaluate the Army's investigative report in detail and follow the steps taken to implement remedial measures. </P>
<P> ``My initial view is that the Army conducted a thorough investigation into the cause of the deaths, and has not shied away from identifying the circumstances that led to this tragic loss of life,'' Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., said in a statement released in Washington. </P>
<P> In November 1993, the chairman said, his staff learned about concerns for the safety of Ranger students that were due partly to a shrinking number of officer positions for overseeing training. ``The Army was unable to fill even the reduced number of slots,'' he said. </P>
<P> The House Military Personnel subcommittee will hold a hearing next Tuesday to examine the adequacy of manning levels across the Army. </P>
