<DATELINE>ZAGREB, Croatia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Heavy fighting continued for the fifth day running around the Croat-held Orasje pocket bordering a vital Serb corridor in northern Bosnia, local and United Nations sources reported. </P>
<P> The U.N. military observers in the area recorded some 2,000 detonations and said Bosnian Croats fired 60 rockets on the Bosnian Serb territory since the morning. </P>
<P> The Croatian news agency HINA said Bosnian Serb forces shelled the town of Zupanja and the village of Bosnjaci in eastern Croatia, causing much damage. It said there were no reports of casualties. </P>
<P> The Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA said that Croatian forces had been shelling the Bosnian Serb port town of Brcko from their positions in Rajevo Selo and Podgajci Posavski in Croatia. It said Orasje Croats fired six rockets on the town. </P>
<P> SRNA said Brcko sustained ``substantial damage'' but reported no casualties. </P>
<P> The Bosnian Croat news agency, quoting local military sources, said Bosnian Serbs were shelling civilian targets in Orasje and were attempting to pierce through the Croat defense lines on the western edge of the pocket. </P>
<P> The Orasje pocket forms a troublesome Croat bridgehead south of the river Sava, close to a vital Serb corridor linking separatist Serb enclaves in Croatia and Bosnia with Serbia, their only source of supply. </P>
<P> Bosnian Serbs apparently want to widen the corridor in preparation for decisive battles elsewhere in Bosnia and Croatia, local Croat and U.N. sources said. </P>
<P> The corridor, reported closed for a brief period of time on Saturday due to fighting, reopened Sunday, SRNA said. </P>
