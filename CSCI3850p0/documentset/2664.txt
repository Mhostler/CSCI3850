<P>  Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, the fiery Egyptian cleric charged with plotting to bomb the United Nations and other landmarks, was hospitalized Thursday suffering from complications from pneumonia, an aide to the cleric said. </P>
<P> ``He's in very bad shape,'' said Ahmed Sattar, the sheik's paralegal. </P>
<P> Sattar said he had spoken with Abdel-Rahman late Wednesday night. </P>
<P> ``He really couldn't talk. His breathing was very heavy. He was coughing and spitting up blood and running a high fever,'' Sattar said. </P>
<P> The cleric was removed from his two-room cell at the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center in lower Manhattan shortly after 5 a.m. EST Thursday and taken to an unidentified hospital, Sattar said. </P>
<P> The last time Abdel-Rahman needed medical treatment, he was taken to Bellevue Hospital's prison ward. </P>
<P> Abdel-Rahman, 56, who is blind, has diabetes, a heart condition and asthma. He was diagnosed Tuesday with pneumonia that was being treated with antibiotics. </P>
<P> Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark and Lynne Stewart, who plan to represent Abdel-Rahman at his conspiracy plot trial set to begin on Nov. 28, were unavailable for comment. </P>
<P> A spokeswoman from the federal prison said Abdel-Rahman had been removed from the prison by U.S. Marshals, but she would not say where he had been taken. </P>
