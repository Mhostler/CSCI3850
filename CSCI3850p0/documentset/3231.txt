<P>  Avions de Transport Regional (ATR), maker of the commuter plane which crashed in the United States in October killing 68 people, said Thursday it would start icing tests on its planes Friday in California. </P>
<P> The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) last week ordered ATRs grounded in icy weather in the wake of the Oct. 31 crash of an American Eagle ATR 72 in Indiana, which killed all on board. </P>
<P> An official inquiry into the accident is under way. U.S. safety officials suspect icing on the plane's wings may have caused it. </P>
<P> The company, seeking to prove that its plane flies safely in freezing conditions, sent an ATR 72 plane Tuesday to the Edwards Air Base in California. </P>
<P> A spokeswoman for ATR, a joint venture between French state-owned Aerospatiale and Alenia SpA of Italy, said the aircraft would begin a series of 10 high-altitude test flights Friday. </P>
<P> During these tests, each lasting about three hours, the ATR would fly in below-zero temperatures while an NKC 135 tanker plane sprayed water on its surfaces. </P>
