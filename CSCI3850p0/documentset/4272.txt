<P>  Investment bankers and venture capitalists are buying up auto dealerships, which have mostly been family businesses, and consolidating them, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday. </P>
<P> About 22,000 auto dealerships in the United States are split up among 16,000 different owners, the paper said. </P>
<P> But the industry, with $350 billion in sales, is expected to shrink to 8,000 owners within a decade, the paper said, citing an estimate from auto industry consultants J.D. Power & Associates. </P>
<P> Firms like former advertising executive Carl Spielvogel's United Auto Group bought up 39 dealerships in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut and is expected to add enough to push its $800 million in annual sales to $2 billion in sales within a year, the paper said. </P>
<P> Distribution and marketing costs account for 25 percent to 30 percent of the retail price of a new car, the paper said. </P>
<P> These costs could fall from consolidation, however. </P>
<P> The investment bankers anticipate buying advertising in bulk, consolidating parts and service operations and installing systems that would cut clerical staff, the paper said. </P>
<P> Car sales are cyclical and the dealerships need additional capital to expand and provide broader service operations, the paper said. </P>
<P> Many auto dealers entered the business after World War II and are thinking about retirement, industry consultants told the paper. </P>
