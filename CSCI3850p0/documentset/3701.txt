<P>  Angola's main air base, Catumbela, was rocked by several explosions Tuesday night, a government source said Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``There was a huge fire and we could hear explosions all night. Everyone could hear it in Benguela,'' he said by telephone from the western coastal city of Benguela. </P>
<P> The cause of the explosions was not immediately known. </P>
<P> Catumbela is 20 miles north of Benguela and most of Angola's estimated 130 operational MiG and Sukhoi fighter aircraft were based there, the source said. </P>
<P> But he quoted firefighters as saying they believed none of the aircraft had been damaged in the explosions. </P>
<P> ``The firemen were working all through the night and it seems to be under control now,'' he said Wednesday morning. </P>
<P> An Antonov transport aircraft landed at Catumbela Tuesday evening and the explosions started soon afterwards, he said. </P>
<P> The aircraft based in Catumbela were used in bombing raids against UNITA rebel positions before the signing of a ceasefire between the Angolan government and UNITA two months ago halting nearly 20 years of civil war. </P>
