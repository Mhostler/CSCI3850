<P>  Muslim fundamentalists chanted ``Death for blasphemists'' outside Lahore High Court in Pakistan Thursday as it heard an appeal by two Christians against death sentences for blasphemy. </P>
<P> More than 50 demonstrators outside the court also damaged the car of main defense lawyer Asma Jehangir, witnesses said. </P>
<P> But one of two judges hearing the case said: ``The court will not be impressed by any pressure built up outside and will strictly go by law.'' </P>
<P> A lower court convicted the two Christians, 40-year-old Rehmat Masih and 14-year-old Salamat Masih, last week on the charge, which they denied, of blasphemy against Islam's prophet Mohammad. </P>
<P> One of a group of lawyers wanting the court to uphold the death sentences made abusive remarks as Jehangir, a human rights activist, stood up to argue her case. </P>
<P> ``I am pleading this case of a very particular nature in a difficult atmosphere,'' she told the court, which later adjourned for the two-day weekend. </P>
<P> On the first day of the hearing, one lawyer filed an application accusing Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of committing contempt of court by expressing shock over the death sentences. </P>
<P> Rehmat and Salamat Masih were arested in May 1993 after a village imam, or prayer leader, accused them of throwing pieces of paper bearing blasphemous statements into his mosque. </P>
<P> A domestic human rights commission said there appeared to be local personal grievances in the case. </P>
<P> Rehmat and Salamat Masih were wounded and a third Christian accused of blasphemy was shot dead as they left a Lahore court in April 1994. </P>
<P> The village imam, Hafiz Fazal-e-Haq, and two others were charged with murder. Fazal-e-Haq is out on bail. </P>
<P> The death sentences were the second imposed by any court since parliament amended the penal code in July 1992 to raise the penalty for blasphemy from life imprisonment to death. </P>
<P> An earlier conviction of a Christian by a court in the Punjab province town of Sargodha was overturned last November by the Lahore High Court, which acquitted the defendant. </P>
