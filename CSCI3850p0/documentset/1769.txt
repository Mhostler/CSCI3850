<P>  Israeli diplomat David Dadon has arrived in Morocco to head the Israeli liaison office due to be opened in Rabat soon under an accord between the two countries to establish formal links, an official source said Monday. </P>
<P> The source said Dadon, former director of relations with Arab states at the Israeli Foreign Ministry, arrived in the Moroccan capital Sunday. </P>
<P> Morocco is also due to open a similar office in Tel Aviv, making the kingdom the second Arab country after Egypt to establish formal ties with the Jewish state. </P>
<P> ``He will not have full diplomatic status. He is not an ambassador and will not be presenting his credentials at the foreign ministry,'' the official source said. </P>
<P> Diplomats said the liaison office's premises would be located on embassy row near the British and U.S. embassies. </P>
<P> They said the Rabat office was expected to be opened before the start of the Middle East and North Africa economic summit October 30 in Casablanca. Senior Israeli and Arab leaders are attending the summit. </P>
<P> Dadon was born in the southern Moroccan city of Marrakesh in 1947. He served as an Israeli diplomat in Panama and Mexico and was head of the Scandinavian department at the foreign ministry before moving to head the department dealing with Arab states. </P>
