<DATELINE>MAPUTO, Mozambique (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Mutinous Mozambican soldiers demanding immediate demobilization blocked all traffic between Maputo and the South African and Swaziland borders Friday. </P>
<P> U.N. peacekeepers said the mutiny, the latest of a series, erupted Friday morning but roadblocks came down after about five hours. </P>
<P> The soldiers were stationed at the country's largest barracks at Boane, about 18 miles west of Maputo, the capital. </P>
<P> They were disgruntled over delays in deciding who will be demobilized and who retrained for a new unified army being created under 1992 peace accords which ended 16 years of civil war with Renamo rebels. </P>
