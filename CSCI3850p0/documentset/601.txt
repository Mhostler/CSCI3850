<P>  Former Prime Minister Giovanni Spadolini, a highly respected Italian politician, historian, journalist and author, died Thursday at age 69, his office said. </P>
<P> Spadolini, a former leader of the Republican Party who became postwar Italy's first non Christian-Democratic prime minister in 1981, died of respiratory failure after an operation on his stomach last month. </P>
<P> A native Florentine who had a lifelong love affair with Tuscany, he was one of a handful of post-war Italian politicians untouched by corruption scandals that have devastated many careers in the past three years. </P>
<P> ``He will be remembered as one of the most eminent figures of the young Italian Republic, which he helped to build with his deep cultural and human contribution,'' said Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. </P>
<P> Spadolini's girth and balding head made him an irresistible target for Italy's merciless editorial cartoonists who often depicted him nude with a bulging belly and fig leaf. </P>
<P> But he was a serious politician, combining an even temperament with a talent for diplomacy and negotiation. </P>
<P> A newspaper editor for 17 years before he entered politics in 1972 as a senator for the tiny Republican Party, Spadolini served in various ministerial posts and became party leader in 1979, after the death of one of its founders, Ugo La Malfa. </P>
<P> He started his professional life in academia in 1947, when he became a professor of political science at Florence University. </P>
<P> He left academia for journalism in 1955, becoming chief editor of Bologna's Il Resto del Carlino newspaper. </P>
<P> He capped his journalism career in 1968 when he took over the top editorial slot at Milan's Corriere Della Sera, one of Italy's most respected papers. </P>
<P> He became premier in June 1981 following the fall of Christian Democrat Arnaldo Forlani in the P-2 scandal -- an illegal masonic lodge which investigators portrayed as a secret society trying to create a ``state within a state.'' </P>
<P> He benefitted during his premiership from two events that electrified Italian pride -- the liberation by police of U.S. General James Dozier from captivity by Red Brigades urban guerrillas, and the Italian World Cup soccer victory in Spain. </P>
