<P>  A clothing maker said Friday it filed a lawsuit against Yoko Ono and the estate of the late John Lennon, claiming it was defrauded into believing it had bought an exclusive license to use his picture and drawings on clothing. </P>
<P> The lawsuit seeks $51 million in damages. </P>
<P> St. Louis-based Leggoons Inc. said it was damaged when the defendants -- Ono, who is Lennon's widow, and Bag One Arts Inc., a New York company representing the estate -- signed other, similar licensing agreements. </P>
<P> Leggoons said it was defrauded into signing what it believed to be an exclusive license to use the picture, signature and drawings of the late Beatle. </P>
<P> ``Leggoons paid a fortune for the exclusive right to use the John Lennon name and pictures, and then invested even more developing a high-class line of John Lennon clothing,'' the company said in a statement. </P>
<P> ``After their line was approved by the defendants, Leggoons discovered the market was flooded with cheap competing products -- all approved by Yoko Ono,'' it said. </P>
<P> The suit, which seeks $1 million in actual damages and $50 million in punitive damages, was filed in federal court in Missouri, the company said. </P>
