<P>  The sheriff of Florida's Palm Beach County said Friday his department had sued four investment firms in an attempt to recover $8 million lost in derivative investments. </P>
<P> Newly appointed Sheriff Charles McCutcheon said in a statement the civil suits were filed in U.S. District Court against PaineWebber, Westcap Securities, Kemper Securities and Meridian Securities. </P>
<P> The lawsuits accused the firms of improper and illegal solicitation, breach of fiduciary duty, common-law fraud and violation of state and federal securities laws. </P>
<P> It seeks compensatory and unspecified punitive damages against the firms, alleging they knew the investments were inappropriately risky for public funds. </P>
<P> The suits were filed on the department's behalf by former Palm Beach County prosecutor Zell Davis Jr., who is now in private practice in Florida, and a Philadelphia law firm involved in a similar suit filed by Orange County, Calif. </P>
<P> The sheriff estimated the drop in market value at about $8 million. His attorney, David Berger, said the loss has not been realized and could be as high as $11 million. </P>
<P> ``These securities are so complicated that at this junction we can only make estimates,'' Berger said. </P>
<P> The mortgage-backed investments included inverse floaters and principle-only securities that dropped in value as interest rates rose, Berger said. It would take at least 20 years to recoup their full value. </P>
<P> The investments were made by Sheriff Richard Wille, who retired in February. Wille had put $22.4 million of reserve funds in the risky investments. </P>
<P> A spokesman said previously that the sheriff's department would not cut services because of the loss, but may have to seek an advance from the county commission or take out a loan. </P>
<P> Palm Beach County has strict rules that bar risky investments but a spokesman said previously the sheriff's department is separate from county operations. For that reason, he said, the investment will not affect the county's debt service or credit rating. </P>
