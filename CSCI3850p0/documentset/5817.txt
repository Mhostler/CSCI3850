<DATELINE>LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A 12-year-old Pakistani Christian boy who won a U.S. award for his part in the movement against child labor has been murdered, police said Tuesday. </P>
<P> Iqbal Masih, given the Reebok Human Rights Award in December at the age of 11, was the president of the children's wing of the Bonded Labor Liberation Front of Pakistan (BLLFP). </P>
<P> Police said an employee of a local landlord shot and killed him in his hometown of Muridke, near the Punjab provincial capital of Lahore, while he was on his way home on Easter Sunday. </P>
<P> Liaqat Masih, the boy's 16-year-old cousin, was slightly wounded in the shooting. </P>
<P> Iqbal was among 3,000 bonded children freed from work in the handknotted carpet industry in 1992 as a result of a movement launched by the BLLFP, a pressure group against bonded labor in brick kilns, carpet-making and agriculture. </P>
<P> He was then admitted to a BLLFP-run primary school in Lahore where he completed a five-year course in half the time. </P>
<P> ``Iqbal was a brilliant student and a committed Front worker who became the target of feudal landlords and carpet industry owners,'' BLLFP President Ehsanullah Khan alleged Reuters. </P>
<P> ``He had been receiving threats to his life in the last few days,'' Khan told Reuters. </P>
<P> He said the landlord suspected of ordering the killing had felt threatened by the movement against bonded labor in agriculture and feared Iqbal's potential influence. </P>
<P> The BLLFP says it has engineered the liberation of about 11,000 children in the past three years and placed them in BLLFP primary schools around the country. </P>
<P> The Front plans to stage a day of protest against Iqbal's murder throughout Pakistan Friday. </P>
<P> Iqbal's relatives said Boston's Brandeis University had promised him a four-year scholarship once he completed his schooling. </P>
