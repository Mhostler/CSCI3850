<P>  International athletics chief Primo Nebiolo Friday pledged financial support for track and field in the United States and said he would help make the 1996 Atlanta Olympics the greatest ever staged. </P>
<P> ``We hope to embark on a serious support program for track and field athletics in the United States so that the marvelous athletic talents of U.S. athletes can receive the publicity and recognition they deserve, especially in the United States,'' Nebiolo said in a speech to the general assembly of the Ibero-American athletics association in Mar del Plata, Argentina. </P>
<P> Extracts from the speech were issued by the International Amateur Athletic Federation here. </P>
<P> The IAAF president said the federation would do everything possible to ensure that the 1996 Atlanta Olympics ``are nothing short of the greatest ever staged in Olympic history.'' </P>
<P> He added: ``Just as we have done for other nations around the world, I think the IAAF can be of concrete assistance to U.S. athletes, especially in light of the Atlanta Games.'' </P>
<P> Although the United States remains the world's top track and field nation, the sport has been struggling for both recognition and money at home. </P>
<P> A weakened team finished sixth in the eight-team men's World Cup at London's Crystal Palace last month while the women's team were a humiliating last. </P>
