<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, Germany (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The German Foreign Ministry said Singapore officials will hand over Wednesday the formal extradition request for former Barings Bank trader Nick Leeson. </P>
<P> The Singapore ambassador has announced that he will deliver the official extradition request from the Singapore government to the German foreign ministry this afternoon,'' a spokeswoman for the ministry told Reuters. </P>
<P> The government ministry spokeswoman repeated earlier public statements from a German prosecutor in Frankfurt that the document would not be released to the public. </P>
<P> The request will soon be handed over by Bonn officials to a German regional appeals court in Frankfurt which will rule on the legality of the request. </P>
<P> Singapore had until next Tuesday to file the request for the 28-year-old Briton, who was detained in Frankfurt on March 2. Leeson has been blamed for more than $1 billion in bank losses from Japanese stock futures trading. </P>
