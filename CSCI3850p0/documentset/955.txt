<P>  A fictional character who once symbolized the achievements of disabled athletes has become the subject of a legal battle between organizers of the Paralympic Games and the U.S. Olympic Committee. </P>
<P> Organizers of the event asked U.S. District Court on Tuesday to decide if they or the USOC can claim ownership to Blaze, the mascot for the 1996 Paralympic Games. </P>
<P> The USOC won a trademark licensing agreement from the Atlanta Paralympic Organizing Committee last November and is seeking royalties and rights to the phoenix-like bird. </P>
<P> But Blaze is owned by the U.S. Disabled Athletes Fund Inc, which licenses the character to APOC. Organizers say they cannot relinquish the rights or royalties, seen as critical to the Games' success. </P>
<P> ``We have been working to resolve this issue with the USOC since February and, regrettably, have been unable to do so,'' APOC President G. Andrew Fleming said in a statement. </P>
<P> ``The limited licensing agreement with the USDAF to use BLAZE as the Paralympic mascot is vital to our ability to generate revenue to stage the 1996 Paralympics,'' it said. </P>
<P> The motion filed in federal court by the APOC and the Disabled Athletes Fund asks for a declaratory judgement on the ownership question. </P>
<P> The Atlanta Paralympic Games, which will be held for the first time in the United States, will include more than 4,000 athletes from 100 countries. The event is scheduled for two weeks in August 1996. </P>
