<P>  Coming soon to a computer screen near you: The body of a 39-year-old man whose cadaver was frozen and cut crosswise into 1,800 wafer-thin slices. </P>
<P> He's the latest traveler on the Internet, the National Library of Medicine said Monday; but to access the entire body -- something only medical schools and researchers are likely to do -- will require two weeks of uninterrupted Internet time and a whopping 15 gigabytes of computer storage space. </P>
<P> The project, called the Visible Man, was to be formally unleashed into the computer network Monday during the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America. </P>
<P> ``This is the first time such detailed digital information about an entire human body has been compiled,'' said Donald Lindberg, director of the library. </P>
<P> The body is that of a Texas man who had willed his remains to science. Images of the body were recorded from head to toe using computed tomography, magnetic resonance and X-rays. </P>
<P> The body was then embedded in gelatin, frozen and sliced crosswise into more than 1,800 micro-thin slices. The slices were removed one by one and the surfaces photographed. The digital photos were then stacked and programmed into an imaging computer along with the data from the radiology images. </P>
<P> ``Reconstructions of the data can be rotated in space, viewed in any plane, dissected and reassembled,'' said Victor Spitzer of the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver where the work was carried out. </P>
<P> ``In the future, any anatomical part can be extracted from the body and viewed separately. Structures such as blood vessels can be followed throughout the body and their relationship to other structures, such as organs and bones, can be seen,'' he said. </P>
<P> The researchers said the result is a ``powerful educational tool'' that could even be used by cancer researchers if they introduce a mathematical model of abnormal cell growth into the body and follow it to see how cancer grows. </P>
<P> The Visible Man will soon have company in cyberspace. The researchers said the the second phase of the project, the Visible Woman, will be completed next year. </P>
