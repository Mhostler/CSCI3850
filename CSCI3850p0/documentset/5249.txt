<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  An estimated one billion people around the world tuned in to Monday' night's Academy Awards, but the jurors in the O.J. Simpson murder trial were not among them. </P>
<P> Sequestered at a secret hotel location, the 19 jurors and alternates are cut off from loved ones, restricted from what they can read and limited as to which shows cross their television screens. </P>
<P> One or more of the jurors had asked to watch the annual event, according to the Los Angeles sheriff's department. But officials worried that with talk show host David Letterman and other comedians scheduled to appear, O.J. jokes would fill the airwaves and taint the jury. </P>
<P> It was not known whether Simpson tuned in to the star-studded event as he was restricted to watching what other prisoners on his cell floor wanted to tune in, a spokesman at the sheriff's department said. </P>
<P> Simpson, though, did win an award this year -- a Golden Razzie for one of the worst performances of 1994 in his supporting actor role in ``Naked Gun 33-1/3.'' </P>
<P> That movie was filmed before Simpson was arrested and jailed for the June 12 double murder of his former wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman. Simpson has pleaded not guilty to the charges and is on trial. </P>
