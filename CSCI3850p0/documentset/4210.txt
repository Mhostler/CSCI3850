<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A white female juror in the O.J. Simpson double-murder trial who has the same doctor as the football legend was dismissed by Superior Court Judge Lance Ito Tuesday and replaced by a 54-year-old black male alternate. </P>
<P> Court spokeswoman Jerrianne Hayslett said the juror, a 63-year-old legal secretary, was excused because she has the same personal physician as Simpson. The doctor is likely to be called as a witness for the defense. </P>
<P> Her replacement is a postal service operations manager. </P>
<P> More tears were shed on the witness stand as testimony on events leading to the deaths of Simpson's ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, 35, and her friend Ronald Goldman, 25, began after two weeks of evidence relating to the couple's stormy relationship. </P>
<P> Karen Crawford, duty manager at the Mezzaluna restaurant in the upscale Los Angeles neighborhood of Brentwood where Nicole Simpson had her last meal June 12, broke down as she identified the white shirt and black pants Goldman, a waiter at the restaurant, wore that night. </P>
<P> The clothes were retrieved from Goldman's apartment, where he had changed before going to Nicole's home to return a pair of prescription eyeglasses dropped outside the restaurant by Nicole Simpson's mother, Juditha Brown. </P>
<P> Nicole Simpson and nine other members of her family, including her mother, had eaten at the restaurant that night. </P>
<P> Asked by prosecutor Marcia Clark if she recognized Goldman's clothing, Crawford broke into tears as she said, ``Yes.'' </P>
<P> She said Goldman, a friend of Nicole Simpson, left to return the glasses after she telephoned the restaurant and asked him to bring them to her. </P>
<P> Crawford identified the envelope in which she sealed the glasses before giving them to Goldman to take to Nicole Simpson. </P>
<P> Ironically, the envelope was marked ``people's exhibit 32'' -- the number worn by Simpson during his illustrious career as a running back with the University of Southern California and the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League. </P>
<P> Crawford also identified a photograph of a bloodstained envelope containing the glasses lying at Goldman's feet at the murder scene as the one she had given him. </P>
<P> Simpson, who became a famous sportscaster, actor and TV pitchman for the Hertz rental car corporation, has pleaded not guilty to the murders of his ex-wife and Goldman, who were stabbed to death outside her condominium. </P>
<P> Crawford said Goldman had left the restaurant at 9:50 p.m. June 12 to deliver the glasses to Nicole Simpson. </P>
<P> The prosecution has estimated the pair were killed at about 10:15 p.m. to 10:20 p.m. that night. Their bodies were found in the early hours of June 13. </P>
<P> Crawford's tears followed those of Nicole Simpson's sister, Denise Brown, who sobbed frequently during two days of testimony Friday and Monday as she told the jury Simpson had beaten and humiliated her sister on a number of occasions. </P>
<P> After a delay of more than two hours in starting the morning's proceedings, Ito apologized to the jury and the alternates, saying, ``There were some very delicate matters that I had to inquire into this morning. It became necessary for me to excuse one of the jurors in this case.'' </P>
<P> Court sources who asked not to be named said an investigation was still continuing into possible misconduct by another juror over possession of maps of Los Angeles and Chicago. </P>
<P> Simpson flew to Chicago the night Nicole Simpson and Goldman were murdered. His attorneys say he was at home waiting for a limousine to take him to the airport at the time of the killings. </P>
<P> Members of the jury are not allowed to carry out independent investigations and must rely only on the evidence presented to them in court. </P>
<P> As a result of the judge's decision, the jury is now made up of seven women and five men -- nine blacks, one white, one Hispanic and one Indian. </P>
<P> Two other jurors were dismissed from the jury in January -- a black Hertz car rental employee who had met Simpson at a company function, and a Hispanic woman who was in a continuing abusive relationship with her boyfriend. </P>
<P> The panel's composition is seen as important because of the case's racial overtones. Simpson is black and the two people he is accused of killing are white. </P>
