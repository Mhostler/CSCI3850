<DATELINE>SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Bosnian Serbs Sunday reneged on a pledge to unblock U.N. relief convoys as Muslim-led Bosnian army forces reported gains against their separatist foes near Sarajevo and Mostar. </P>
<P> Serb forces said they had repulsed an alleged Muslim offensive south of Sarajevo within the 12.4-mile radius around the government-held capital from which heavy weapons are banned by NATO-U.N. decree. </P>
<P> U.N. observers had no immediate information on the fighting reports. </P>
<P> Serb troops blocked seven U.N. convoys which tried to cross their territory on their way to Muslim enclaves a day after Serb political leaders agreed to lift a blockade imposed over a punitive NATO air strike on a Serb position 10 days ago. </P>
<P> ``The general reaction is that this is disappointing. There was an undertaking yesterday and we expected these convoys would be on the road today,'' Claire Grimes of the U.N. Protection Force told Reuters. </P>
<P> ``For the time being we're on hold and hoping (further) negotiations will enable these convoys to go through,'' she said. But it had been impossible for UNPROFOR to track down Bosnian Serb leaders ``to sort this out.'' </P>
<P> The seven convoys were a British column carrying fuel for the Serb-encircled Muslim enclave of Gorazde, four Danish resupply convoys bound for Sarajevo and two Dutch convoys stuck in another Muslim pocket, Srebrenica. </P>
<P> Grimes said earlier that Serb commanders may not have passed down orders to regional road checkpoints to let convoys move. But the prolongation of the impasse into Sunday night suggested the problem was more political than technical. </P>
<P> The Serb military did not sign Saturday's accord between Bosnian Serb political chief Radovan Karadzic and U.N. commander Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Rose to free up U.N. logistics and humanitarian aid convoys. </P>
<P> It was not immediately known whether the agreement might have unravelled from the fresh fighting south of Sarajevo. </P>
<P> The Bosnian Serbs on Saturday also accepted ``immediate'' talks on restarting a vital U.N. airlift to Sarajevo grounded by retaliatory Serb gunfire after the NATO air raid. </P>
<P> Karadzic aides told Reuters on Sunday the date for the talks had not yet been set but could take place on Monday at the U.N.-controlled Sarajevo airport. </P>
<P> The anti-U.N. blockade posed a potential humanitarian emergency for government enclaves with winter nearing and NATO shying from tougher action against the Serbs. </P>
<P> Sunday's setback on the convoy agreement coincided with reports from sources close to the Bosnian army that government troops had advanced against Serbs near Sarajevo and Mostar. </P>
<P> They said Bosnian forces had taken Mount Treskavica, a highland area east of Mounts Igman and Bjelasnica. </P>
<P> But the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug quoted a Bosnian Serb Army (BSA) statement later as saying a Muslim offensive on the three peaks had been crushed and front lines were unchanged. </P>
<P> Serb leaders had accused the government side earlier of launching attacks on their positions within the exclusion zone south of Sarajevo -- near Igman and Bjelasnica. </P>
<P> The Bosnian sources said Treskavica had been a target in a Muslim push to re-establish a corridor eastwards to Gorazde lost in a lightning Serb offensive in the summer of 1993. </P>
<P> They said Bosnian troops also took control of the important Kiser hill south of Konjic on the main road to the Adriatic coast west from Sarajevo and were advancing further south. </P>
<P> Serb army sources said hundreds of government projectiles of all calibres crashed onto Serb lines and villages in the Konjic area. </P>
<P> For their part, Serb forces in mountain lairs shelled the road between Konjic and Mostar to the west, killing a woman in the village of Potoci on the edge of the demilitarized zone around Mostar, which has been placed under European Union rule. </P>
<P> U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry was to meet the U.N. special envoy for former Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi, on Monday in Croatia to discuss strained relations between NATO and U.N. peacekeepers in the Balkans. </P>
<P> Washington is dismayed by UNPROFOR's reluctance to call in more NATO air strikes to punish Serbs for attacks on U.N. peacekeepers or Muslim safe havens under U.N. protection. </P>
