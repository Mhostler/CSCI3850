<DATELINE>JAKARTA, May 9 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Suharto said on Tuesday Indonesia must respect the government's decision to appeal against a court decision in favour of the banned Tempo magazine. </P>
<P> ``He (the president) said that in order to uphold justice and rights the process of appeal must be respected,'' Information Minister Harmoko told reporters after meeting President Suharto. </P>
<P> ``This process is not final yet. I have signed an appeal. The president has agreed to the steps that have been taken by information Ministry for appeal,'' Harmoko added. </P>
<P> The Jakarta Administrative Court last week upheld suits by Tempo founder Goenawan Mohamad and Tempo employees, saying the publishers had not been allowed to defend themselves against a ban last June that affected two other weeklies. </P>
<P> Harmoko closed down the three political weeklies because he said they had endangered national stability. </P>
<P> Indonesia's media, largely muzzled for the past year, was euphoric over winning at least a symbolic victory with the decision that suprised most academics and journalists. </P>
<P> But few expect an immediate rebirth for Tempo or sudden easing up on existing publications now. </P>
<P> There is also a growing fear among journalists Harmoko's appeal will succeed. </P>
<P> A different court on Monday rejected a suit filed by Tempo employees against Harmoko seeking $420,000 in compensation for lost wages. The Central Jakarta Court said it had no jurisdiction over the matter. </P>
<P> The media has long been a key voice for change in Indonesia, firmly ruled by former general Suharto since the chaotic 1960s. </P>
