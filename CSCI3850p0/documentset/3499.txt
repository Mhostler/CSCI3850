<P>  Connecticut police Friday found four people dead of gunshot wounds at a public housing complex that has been the site of numerous gang-related crimes. </P>
<P> A police spokesman said a woman returning home Friday morning found two bodies in her apartment and called for help. </P>
<P> Detectives found a note near the victims that led them to a second apartment where two partially decomposed bodies were discovered. </P>
<P> Lt. John Bowen said ``all of the victims appear to have been shot.'' </P>
<P> ``We have made no identities of any of the victims and no arrests,'' Bowen said. </P>
<P> The apartment complex, called Charter Oak Terrace, was the scene last summer of a special federal investigation sparked by several robberies and shootings, including a drive-by shooting in which a seven-year-old girl was killed. </P>
<P> Demands that police do something to stop the violence poured in from residents of the complex. State and local police officials met with Charter Oak Terrace residents at a gymnasium at the complex. </P>
<P> U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen attended the meeting and said he would use Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents to investigate of how weapons were finding their way into the hands of teen-age gang members believed responsible for much of the violent crime in the neighborhood. </P>
<P> Results of that investigation have not been disclosed. </P>
