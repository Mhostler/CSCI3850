<P>  The University of Minnesota's School of Social Work said Wednesday it has banned students and faculty from using perfumes, colognes, shampoos and other smell-good products that might trigger allergic reactions. </P>
<P> ``Anything that is strongly scented'' is not permitted, said Nancy Johnston, associate director of the graduate school. </P>
<P> ``We're trying to make people know there are products out there which are less strongly scented. The response has really been very good,'' she said. </P>
<P> The school has 250 students and 35 faculty members. </P>
