<P>  The chief prosecutor of the U.N. war crimes tribunal on the former Yugoslavia said Friday he fully intended to prosecute those who gave orders to commit genocide and other grave human rights abuses.  Richard Goldstone, a former South African judge, told reporters, ``We are intent on bringing charges at the earliest time against the people who gave the orders, who conceived the policies.'' But he did not give a timetable. </P>
<P> Goldstone came from The Hague, seat of the tribunal, to New York to testify before a General Assembly committee considering his request of $28 million for the tribunal. He said he was still functioning with two-thirds of the staff required. </P>
<P> Last Monday, the tribunal for the former Yugoslavia charged 21 Serbs with committing atrocities at the notorious Omarska prison camp in northwestern Bosnia in 1992, including the camp commander, Zeljko Meakic. </P>
<P> The tribunal, which expects to begin trials this spring, is the first of its kind since the Nuremberg war crimes trials after World War II. </P>
<P> So far only one of the 21 indicted Serbs is in custody, in Germany. Those in Serb-held parts of Bosnia have little chance of facing trial unless they leave the country. Goldstone said the tribunal had made arrangements to give safe haven to key witnesses. </P>
