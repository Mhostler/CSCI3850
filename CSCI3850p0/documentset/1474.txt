<DATELINE>ASSIUT, Egypt (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Egyptian police Monday shot and killed three gunmen who refused to stop at a checkpoint in the southern province of Assiut, security sources said. </P>
<P> They said police had set up the checkpoint in the town of al-Qusiya, 186 miles south of Cairo, to trap a group of Muslim militants in the area. </P>
<P> The police in Qusiya said the driver of a car ignored orders to stop and passengers inside the vehicle opened fire injuring a plainclothes policeman, the sources said. </P>
<P> Security officers on the scene returned fire killing all three passengers, who were found to be carrying unlicensed weapons and ammunition. </P>
<P> The sources quoted police as saying they did not suspect the three men belonged to militant groups active in the area. They believe the three gunmen opened fire to avoid arrest for carrying illegal weapons for use in a feud against a local family. </P>
<P> Qusiya has been the scene of many bloody clashes between the police and the militant group the Gama'a al-Islamiya, which is fighting to overthrow the Egyptian government. </P>
<P> More than 400 people have been killed in Egypt since 1992 when militants launched their campaign to install a strict Islamic government. </P>
