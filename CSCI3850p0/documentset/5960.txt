<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Howard Cosell, the staccato-voiced broadcaster who brought ``Monday Night Football'' to thousands of American homes and bars, died early Sunday, his colleagues at the ABC Radio network said. </P>
<P> Cosell, who worked for ABC radio and television for 38 years, died in New York at the Hospital for Joint Diseases Orthopedic Institute after a long battle with cancer. He was 77 years old. </P>
<P> ``He was one of a kind, he brought a new dimension to sports reporting,'' said Shelby Whitfield, his producer at ABC, who last lunched with Cosell two weeks ago. </P>
<P> Cosell's final years were spent in his New York apartment a virtual recluse, suffering from cancer, heart disease and Parkinson's disease. His official retirement in 1991 went almost unnoticed. </P>
<P> Cosell was best known for his 14 years as the ``tell it like it is'' color commentator on ``Monday Night Football,'' the weekly pro football broadcast that took sports into the arena of regular prime-time television for the first time. </P>
<P> With his staccato voice and tough stance, he was so controversial that in a TV Guide poll taken in the mid-1970s he topped the list of ``most hated sportscaster'' and the list of ''most loved sportscaster.'' </P>
<P> ``He was a showman and a journalist, always sensitive to the underdog ... A lot of people liked him, and a lot of people didn't. He stepped on a lot of toes,'' Whitfield said. </P>
<P> ``He would like to be remembered as someone who told it like it was. That would make him the happiest. He loved the streets, and he loved it when cabbies waved at him,'' he added. </P>
<P> Cosell was one of the best-known television personalities in America because of his visibility on ``Monday Night Football,'' which started in the fall of 1970 in an attempt by ABC to raise its moribund Monday ratings. </P>
<P> ``He was regarded as one of a kind, feisty, a legend. There is nobody else like him, no one ever will be,'' said an ABC colleague who asked not to identified. </P>
<P> He was inducted into the television Hall of Fame in 1994, but was too ill to attend the ceremonies. </P>
<P> He is survived by two daughters, Jill and Hillary, both of Stamford, Conn., and seven grandchildren. His wife, Emmie, died in 1990. </P>
