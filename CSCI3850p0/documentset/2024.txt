<P>  Swiss Finance Minister Otto Stich, who is also head of state this year under the country's rotating presidency, was hospitalized Friday after collapsing twice in parliament, the government press office said. </P>
<P> It said Stich, 67, had suffered a circulatory collapse but that doctors managed to stabilize his circulation and other vital functions. He would remain in the hospital, where his breathing was being artifically maintained, for further observation, it added. </P>
<P> Rosemarie Simmen, chair of the upper house of parliament's Economics and Spending Committee, said lawmakers laid Stich on the ground after he first slumped in his chair and lost consciousness during a morning session of parliament. </P>
<P> ``He regained consciousness and could not be stopped from getting back into his chair and continuing the discussion. He said it was nothing,'' she told a news conference. </P>
<P> But he fell unconscious again for a short time and, after that episode, allowed himself be carried out on a stretcher. ``He smiled and said good-bye,'' Simmen added. </P>
<P> ``He's doing quite well. He's stable,'' a finance ministry spokesman told Reuters, adding that Defense Minister Kaspar Villiger would deputize for Stich as president and finance minister during his absence. </P>
