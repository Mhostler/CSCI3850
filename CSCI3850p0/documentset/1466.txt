<DATELINE>LONDON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A spurned British housewife took revenge on her husband by leaving 15 wading pools filled with rotting food in the home she had to leave, a newspaper reported on Monday. </P>
<P> Dee Knight, 36, dished up the treat for her 60-year-old husband, John, who asked for a divorce just two months after they married and walked out a year later, The Sun reported. </P>
<P> In a story illustrated with photographs of Dee and the pink plastic pools, the newspaper said the angry wife took a week to prepare the food before the date set for handing over the house keys to lawyers representing her husband. </P>
<P> The pools were filled with, among other things, 300 cans of chicken soup, two dozen rotting prawns, 50 stinking fish heads, 180 lbs of mashed potato, two dozen apples, a gallon of custard and more than 1,300 tea bags. </P>
<P> Dee told the newspaper before she left the $390,000 house on the British island of Jersey in the English Channel she spent more than $470 on her revenge. </P>
