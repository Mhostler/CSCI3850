<DATELINE>MONTERREY, Mexico, Dec 10 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Frankie Randall retained his World Boxing Association junior welterweight title by stopping fellow American Rodney Moore in the seventh round Saturday. </P>
<P> Randall had wobbled the challenger with a straight right and Moore was draped up against the ropes when referee Kenny Bayless of the United States waved off the fight at 1:43. </P>
<P> ``I hit him with a lot of solid shots and knew it was just a matter of keep throwing punches,'' said Randall, 51-3-1. ``Of course it was justly stopped. Why should anybody take unecessary punishment?'' </P>
<P> Randall was making the first title defense of the 140-pound title he had won by outpointing Argentine Juan Coggi three months ago. </P>
<P> Moore went down in the first round and had a bloody nose in the fourth round from a straight right. </P>
<P> ``I don't know what happened in there,'' said Moore, 34-9-2. ''He threw way too many punches in there. The bottom line is that Frankie Randall is an excellent fighter.'' </P>
