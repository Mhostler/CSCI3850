<DATELINE>TIRANA, Albania (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Albania protested to Greece Sunday over what it said were territorial violations after a Greek plane flew over southern Albania, dropping leaflets saying the government in Tirana should go. </P>
<P> Greece said the plane was stolen by a pilot who has been suspended and described his action as irresponsible. </P>
<P> In Tirana, Alabanian television said: ``From six in the morning on Sunday a Greek propeller plane coming from the island of Corfu flew over Albanian territory for one hour, scattering provocative leaflets calling for the overthrow of the current institutional order in Albania.'' </P>
<P> It showed samples of the leaflets bearing the blue and white Greek flag and quoted the text as saying: ``(President Sali) Berisha and (Prime Minister Aleksander) Meksi, you will go before dawn.'' </P>
<P> Greek government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said in a statement: ``This kind of irresponsible and foolish acts have no relation with the Greek state or Greek foreign policy.'' </P>
<P> Greece's Defense Ministry said the pilot, who stole a crop-spraying plane from his unit on the island of Corfu, was suspended pending an investigation. </P>
<P> ``Albania considers it a serious premeditated provocation, like others before it. The leaflets with the Greek flag and the calls for overthrow of order show this clearly,'' Albania's Foreign Ministry said in a statement. </P>
<P> ``The Greek government bears full reponsibility for such acts and their consequences,'' it added. </P>
<P> In a separate declaration, Albanian Foreign Affairs Minister Alfred Serreqi accused Greece of using violence in its expulsion of Albanian migrants, saying Athen's actions were in retaliation for the current espionage trial in Tirana of five ethnic Greek Albanian citizens. </P>
<P> Albania on Saturday said Greece had expelled some 1,500 Albanian migrants in the past 24 hours. </P>
<P> ``The deportations from Greece are resulting in criminal killings and woundings ... Special Greek police squads open fire without warning on the Albanian refugees in the streets of Athens and elsewhere,'' Serreqi said. </P>
<P> He cited the alleged killing of Ormen Hysen Gjoka, 23, by Greek police Tuesday and the maiming of Ali Murat Reci, 24, as an example of the violence. </P>
<P> Serreqi appealed to international bodies and the European Union to put pressure on Greece to stop ``such criminal acts and the massive deportation of Albanian refugees working in Greece.'' </P>
<P> Greece on Saturday denied it had stepped up what it called the routine expulsion of illegal Albanian aliens. It said a man who had been shot dead by police was a criminal who had tried to seize a policeman's gun. </P>
<P> Tense relations between the Balkan neighbors worsened last week when Albania, ignoring Greek protests, put on trial five ethnic Greek men. It accused them of collaborating with Greek intelligence in an area of southern Albania that, according to Tirana, is witnessing a rise of ethnic Greek separatism. </P>
<P> A year ago, in a related dispute, Greece expelled over 22,000 Albanians in a week. </P>
