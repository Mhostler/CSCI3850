<P>  Top models from around the world pranced down Rome's Spanish Steps Tuesday in an extravagant fashion show produced by one of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's three private television channels. </P>
<P> German supermodel Claudia Schiffer, carefully negotiating the 137 marble steps, showed off a snug black evening gown by designer Valentino, and Canadian model Eve Salvail wore spike heels and wild zebra prints by Gianni Versace. </P>
<P> Both made it safely down the slippery marble steps, but others were not so lucky, tumbling at the last minute and hopping off stage with their spike heels in hand. </P>
<P> Pop stars whose careers peaked in the 1970s and 80s, including Deborah Harry and Paul Young, danced and moved their lips to old songs and Boy George made a cameo appearance. </P>
<P> Pre-recorded applause added to the surreal atmosphere. </P>
<P> The three-hour show, which included designs by Missoni, Lancetti, Byblos and Max Mara, was broadcast live to 13 countries around the world. </P>
<P> ``There are billions of people out there watching us,'' said Gerry Scotti, who co-hosted the show. ``My legs are trembling with excitement.'' </P>
<P> The directors of Berlusconi's Channel Five, who packaged the three-hour production, called it ``the most prestigious event in the history of Piazza di Spagna.'' </P>
<P> The audience thought it was wonderful. </P>
<P> ``Only Italians know how to do it up like this,'' said Stella Delli Quadri who watched the show with her boyfriend. ``It is just stupendous.'' </P>
<P> To show the strength and durability of Wolford fabrics, Grace Jones rolled down the 18th century marble steps in a tight-fitting black and white outfit. </P>
<P> Fashion officials said they hoped the international exposure would give Italy's sagging high fashion industry -- which has taken a back seat to the country's booming ready-to-wear business -- a lift. </P>
<P> ``The world is becoming more and more interested in Italian high fashion because of this annual broadcast,'' said Giuseppe della Schiava. ``We are hoping for the best.'' </P>
<P> Models showed off both high fashion and less expensive ready-to-wear designs at the show, which was broadcast during the week when high fashion designers present their autumn and winter collections. </P>
<P> Berlusconi's three Fininvest channels, dominated by low-brow variety and games shows, have 45 percent of Italy's television audience. </P>
<P> The prime minister has been under fire from the opposition and members of his own coalition over a perceived conflict of interest with his public office. </P>
