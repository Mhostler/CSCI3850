<P>  Former U.S. diplomat Felix Bloch, who had sought seclusion after his removal from the foreign service on suspicions of spying, recently resurfaced to plead guilty to shoplifting charges, according to court records. </P>
<P> Bloch, 59, slipped into obscurity before pleading guilty Thursday to stealing two bottles of aspirin, pepperoni and pita bread from a local grocery store in December. </P>
<P> He represented himself in court, pleaded guilty and told the judge that he was seeking psychiatric help. </P>
<P> The judge fined Bloch $100 and court costs and ordered him to undergo a psychiatric evaluation and treatment if recommended. </P>
<P> Until then, few in this college town knew the balding, bespectacled man who once bagged their groceries had been a senior U.S. diplomat suspected of being the highest-ranking Soviet agent in the U.S. Foreign Service. </P>
<P> Bloch has consistently refused to speak out. </P>
<P> A career foreign officer, Bloch was recalled to Washington in 1987 from his post as the No. 2 officer at the U.S. Embassy in Vienna to answer charges of aiding a spy. </P>
<P> Government agents had videotaped Bloch passing an attache case full of secret material to a man they said was an agent of the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB. </P>
<P> Ultimately the government declined to prosecute, but fired Bloch as a security risk and stripped him of his pension. With his dismissal, the media furor subsided, and Bloch dropped out of sight. </P>
<P> He reappeared nearly three years later, not living in exile in Moscow but bagging groceries at a Harris Teeter supermarket in Chapel Hill, and driving a town bus. </P>
<P> According to his managers at the supermarket, he did not list his career as a diplomat on his application for bagboy. </P>
<P> Bloch's status as a local curiosity became even more pronounced when in January 1993 he was arrested for shoplifting more than $100 in groceries from his employer. Prosecution was deferred when Bloch agreed to perform several hours of community service for the local Red Cross. </P>
<P> Bloch seemed to find his niche at the Red Cross, volunteering more than 1,500 hours after completing the required community service. </P>
<P> According to Kathryn Barber, director of Emergency Services, Bloch worked at the office nearly every day, answering telephones and helping the office manager keep records updated. </P>
