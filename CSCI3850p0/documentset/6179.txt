<P>  Iran, which has urged its pilgrims to hold an anti-U.S. rally during the annual Muslim pilgrimage, said Saudi troops Monday pulled down a placard from the headquarters building of Iranian pilgrims in Mecca. </P>
<P> ``About 80 Saudi commandos directly took part in the operation, while 2,000 military forces equipped with clubs were stationed in front of the headquarters,'' the official Iranian news agency IRNA, monitored here, said. </P>
<P> Saudi Arabia said last week it was determined to prevent political rallies at this year's haj and reminded pilgrims that all signs, pamphlets, leaflets and books were banned. </P>
<P> Iranian officials have vowed to hold a rally to denounce the United States and Israel. </P>
<P> IRNA quoted Iranian haj officials as saying the move was a sacrilege since the placard was adorned with verses of the Koran, the Moslem holy book. </P>
<P> It did not say if it also carried political slogans. </P>
<P> In 1987, a total of 402 people, most of them Iranians, died in clashes with security forces after such a rally in Mecca. </P>
<P> Saudi Arabia says the haj is a religious affair that should not be politicized. Iran insists that rallies denouncing what it calls enemies of Islam -- the U.SS and Israel -- should be held. </P>
<P> The argument between the regions two richest oil countries has resurfaced before every haj since 1987. </P>
