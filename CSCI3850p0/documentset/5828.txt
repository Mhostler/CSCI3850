<DATELINE>NIAMEY, Niger (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  An epidemic of meningitis sweeping the West African state of Niger has now killed 2,491 people but its spread seems to be slowing, the health ministry said Tuesday. </P>
<P> The ministry said 26,736 cases had been reported. Last week, the death toll was 2,344, and the week before 1,965. </P>
<P> Niger's neighbors in the arid Sahel region have reported lesser outbreaks of meningitis. Spread in the air, the disease is common in the dry season on the fringes of the Sahara desert and disappears when the rains start. </P>
<P> Aid officials say political uncertainty and economic crisis in Niger in recent years mean immunization was at an unusually low level. </P>
