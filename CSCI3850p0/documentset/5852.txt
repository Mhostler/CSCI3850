<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, April 19 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Coffee drinkers who consume six or more cups daily may reduce their chances of cancer of the colon, according to a Swedish medical study. </P>
<P> Those who prefer tea also benefit, the study said. Drinking more than two cups a day reduced the incidence of rectal cancer. </P>
<P> ``Coffee consumption appears to be protective against colon cancer and tea against rectal tumors,'' the report entitled ``Coffee, Tea, Tobacco, and Cancer of the Large Bowel'' stated. </P>
<P> Research in Stockholm under the approval of Karolinska Hospital over a two-year period also said smoking did not affect the incidence of cancers studied. </P>
<P> ``In summary, our findings indicate that cigarette smoking, even long-term, does not have a substantial association with the risk of colorectal cancer,'' it added. </P>
<P> Swedes are avid coffee drinkers, and a substantial number consume more than six cups daily, the report said. </P>
