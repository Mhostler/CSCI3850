<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (Reuter)</DATELINE>
<P>  The husband and wife battle for the Peruvian presidency became official Tuesday when Susana Higuchi registered her candidacy for a run against her estranged husband, President Alberto Fujimori.  Higuchi, looking calm amid pandemonium at the National Electoral Board as the filing deadline neared, personally handed in the petition signatures and other documents of her Harmony 21st Century movement. </P>
<P> In mid-September Higuchi said she intended to run for president, but it was unclear if she would register after her spokesman said tens of thousands of supporters' names were erased from the computers at her movement's headquarters. </P>
<P> It was not clear if sabotage was involved, but Peru had suffered a blackout that week. </P>
<P> Higuchi's protest in July of an electoral law barring relatives of the president from running for office led to her estrangement from Fujimori and the unprecedented husband-and-wife rivalry for the presidency. </P>
<P> It remains to be seen whether the electoral board will allow Higuchi's candidacy to stand, but she said in a press conference that she would go to international forums to appeal her case if she was barred from running.  Fujimori went to a Lima shantytown over the weekend to announce he would seek re-election, saying he needs a second five-year term to complete a process of ``national reconstruction'' begun in 1990. </P>
<P> The 56-year-old son of Japanese immigrants, Fujimori rose from obscurity to beat renowned novelist Mario Vargas Llosa in 1990 elections. More than four years into his five-year term, he has a popularity rating of about 65 percent. </P>
<P> Higuchi, 44, whose parents also are Japanese immigrants, was one of 22 candidates who filed to run for president for next April's elections. A second round will be held in June if no candidate wins an absolute majority. </P>
<P> Former U.N. chief Javier Perez de Cuellar, who opinion polls say is Fujimori's strongest rival, also was registered as a presidential candidate Tuesday by a representative of his Union for Peru movement. </P>
