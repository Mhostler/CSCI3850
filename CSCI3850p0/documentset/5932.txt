<P> Clinton spoke shortly after Attorney General Janet Reno announced that one of two bombing suspects being sought by the Federal Bureau of Investigation had been arrested in Oklahoma. She identified him as Timothy McVeigh, aged 27. </P>
<P> Clinton expressed pride in the speed at which law enforcement officials had apparently traced the rented truck involved in Wednesday's lethal car-bombing of a federal building, and added: ``Their continued vigilance makes me sure that we will solve this crime in its entirety and that justice will prevail.'' </P>
<P> At least one suspect at possibly more remain at large but Clinton said: ``We will find them, we will convict them and we will seek the death penalty for them.'' </P>
<P> He declined to speculate on reports the suspects might be members of a U.S. white supremacy group based in Michigan. But, asked about initial speculation the attackers were from the Middle East, he commented, ``We should not assume that any people from beyond our borders are involved in it.'' </P>
