<DATELINE>DUBLIN, July 6 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Jack Charlton, English manager of the Irish football team, bowed to a transatlantic clamour on Wednesday and agreed to attend an on-off Dublin party for Ireland's homecoming World Cup heroes. </P>
<P> ``I've spoken to him (Charlton) in the last five minutes and he's going to attend,'' the chief executive of the Irish Football Association (FAI) told Irish radio from his base in America. </P>
<P> Charlton said earlier that he would not be coming because of television commentary commitments but was persuaded to take part in the event after the government intervened to overturn its cancellation and host what is billed as the party of the year. </P>
<P> The event, in Dublin's Phoenix park, was called off when it appeared that few of the leading players or Charlton would be coming but Prime Minister Albert Reynolds' government urged the organisers to think again. </P>
<P> Charlton and about 19 of the 22-man squad are due to fly into Dublin airport on Thursday to be met by Reynolds and thousands of fans -- much to the disappointment of employers weary of stay-away or hungover World Cup fans. </P>
<P> The employers' association IBEC said it was sorry that the event had been arranged for midday because hundreds of thousands of people would abandon their places of work early -- as they have done for the past three weeks of Irish World Cup action. </P>
<P> But the Irish Congress of Trades Unions urged employers to allow their staff to attend the gala and promised that lost hours could be made up at a later date. </P>
<P> Between 100,000 and half a million people are expected to pack Phoenix park. </P>
<P> Ireland's progress through the early rounds of the World Cup before its 2-0 knockout defeat by the Netherlands on Monday night has turned normal life on its head, created a de facto four-day week and caused widescale absenteeism, employers complain. </P>
<P> They had hoped life would return to normal after Ireland's exit but the Phoenix park gala could mean a slow wind-down to another long weekend, IBEC officials said. </P>
<P> Charlton had earlier told Irish radio, which was deluged with calls urging him to come to Dublin, that his TV work had been arranged for weeks in advance and organisers were aware. </P>
<P> ``I can't change my mind. I'm contracted to work for TV, I've been doing it for two months and when I finish in the World Cup I go to Dallas,'' he told Irish radio earlier on Wednesday. </P>
<P> Several key players including captain Andy Townsend had said they would not be coming to Dublin -- it is home to few of the players because most are members of English or Scottish clubs and live in Britain. </P>
<P> But most will now attend, organisers said, and Charlton denied that they had been paid to do so. </P>
<P> ``I am hurt by suggestions that I am opting out of the homecoming -- even more by snide suggestions that, if players were getting paid for it, they would go to Dublin,'' he told the Irish Times. </P>
<P> The team's World Cup progress, which included an historic 1-0 win over Italy in the opening game on June 18, united Ireland in a show of national pride. </P>
<P> Beer consumption was reported to have risen by 20 per cent, the festivities even survived a short-lived bar staff strike and the mood of euphoria overshadowed a mounting list of labour and political disputes facing the government. </P>
