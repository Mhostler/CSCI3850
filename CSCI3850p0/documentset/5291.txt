<P>  An upcoming visit to Manila by King Juan Carlos I signals Spain's renewed interest in the Philippines, a Spanish colony for 300 years, President Fidel Ramos said on Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``The arrival here of the King and Queen of Spain on my invitation signifies a renewal of Spain's interest in the Philippines which may have waned in the last many years,'' Ramos told a weekly news conference. </P>
<P> King Juan Carlos, who visited Manila in the 1970s when he was crown prince, will be the first reigning Spanish monarch to visit the former colony. </P>
<P> The king and Queen Sofia are to arrive on Saturday for a four-day visit, Ramos said, adding he hoped Spanish and Filipino businessmen would sign agreements for expanded economic, trade and cultural ties during the visit. </P>
<P> The Spanish brought Roman Catholicism to the Philippines when they arrived in the 16th century. It remains the nation's dominant religion and a strong influence on daily life here, making the Philippines Asia's only mainly Christian nation. </P>
<P> The United States drove out the Spaniards in 1898 and the Philippines gained its independence in 1946. </P>
