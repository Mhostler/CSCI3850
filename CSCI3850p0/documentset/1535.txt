<P>  China, continuing its close military links with Pakistan, has delivered six jet trainer aircraft to the Pakistani Air Force, the official China Daily said Thursday. </P>
<P> The handover of the jets worth more than $20 million marked the export debut of the K-8 trainer, designed, made and tested at China's Nanchang Aircraft Manufacturing Co. </P>
<P> China has built 21 of the K-8s so far, and Pakistan is interested in buying more of the planes, which were developed under a 1986 pact between the two countries, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> Pakistan has openly bought Chinese arms since the 1960s, but both sides have firmly denied U.S. allegations that Beijing may have sold M-11 missiles or their components to Islamabad in violation of the Missile Technology Control Regime. </P>
