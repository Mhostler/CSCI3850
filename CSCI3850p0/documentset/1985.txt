<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Two Australian bank accounts containing a total of A$100,000 (US$75,000) and opened by the dead leader of the doomsday Order of the Solar Temple cult, Joseph di Mambro, are being investigated, officials said. </P>
<P> The accounts were opened at the Commonwealth Bank's St James branch in Sydney's central business district in September 1993, a bank spokeswoman told Reuters Thursday. </P>
<P> The accounts were opened by di Mambro and his secretary, identified as French national Odile Dancet. </P>
<P> ``We are looking at bank accounts belonging to di Mambro and other people connected with di Mambro,'' an Australian Federal Police spokesman said Thursday. </P>
<P> Last week, 53 Solar Temple sect members in Switzerland and Canada, including di Mambro, who was called the ``pope,'' died in a bizarre murder-suicide pact. Many of the sect members in Switzerland were murdered with a rifle fitted with a silencer. </P>
<P> But while di Mambro and other leaders have been identified as among the dead, di Mambro's sidekick, Belgian Luc Jouret, is still missing and police believe he holds the key to their investigations. </P>
<P> Di Mambro had rented several luxury properties on Australia's Gold Coast and the Swiss media say Jouret made a large number of telephone calls to Australia in recent weeks. </P>
