<P>  Honduras will accept 5,000 Haitian refugees and put them on a remote cluster of islands if the United States helps resolve a severe energy crisis and pardons some or all of the nation's bilateral debt, officials said Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``The Haitians would be installed on the Swan Islands and we have put a ceiling of 5,000 refugees for a period of six months,'' Foreign Minister Ernesto Paz told reporters. </P>
<P> The Swan Islands, off the Atlantic Coast and some 325 miles northeast of the capital Tegucigalpa, are home to only a small Honduran naval base and a U.S. government radar installation. </P>
<P> Diplomats say they were used by Washington throughout the 1980s as a base for undercover operations against the leftist Sandinista government in Nicaragua, which neighbors Honduras. </P>
<P> ``The Haitians are going to be totally isolated from the rest of the Honduran population,'' Paz said. </P>
<P> He said negotiations with Washington were focused on Honduras' $150 million debt with the United States and ways of easing an energy crisis that has led to power cuts of up to 10 hours a day. </P>
<P> ``We want the collaboration that Honduras will provide to be translated into effective aid in solving our country's multiple crises,'' Paz added, warning that Honduras could grind to a halt within 30 days unless heavy rains provide water to power the country's main hydroelectric dam. </P>
<P> President Carlos Reina, in separate remarks, distanced his government from any overt demands in return for helping Haitian refugees but said negotiations did include talks on U.S. assistance. </P>
<P> ``The talks are not necessarily about asking for something in return, because these are human lives,'' Reina told a news conference. ``We cannot condition a humanitarian act on a price, but instead on the terms of how it would work.'' </P>
<P> The U.S. government has been urging countries in the Caribbean and Central America to accept Haitian refugees who flee their homeland in rickety boats while President Clinton tries to force Haiti's military rulers into giving up power. </P>
<P> Honduras had refused to accept Haitian refugees but formally reversed its position Monday. </P>
<P> U.S. Ambassador William Pryce said Washington appreciated Honduras' ``generous offer'' but did not say what conditions were under discussion between the two countries. </P>
