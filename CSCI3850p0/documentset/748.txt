<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA, Pa (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A quadriplegic who is a psychologist on a radio talk show is suing American Airlines for what he said was a humiliating flight last spring. </P>
<P> Daniel Gottlieb of Cherry Hill, N.J., said American Airlines stranded him in a manual wheelchair for nearly an hour at the terminal curb upon his arrival in April at Philadelphia airport from Dallas. </P>
<P> On the return flight, the airline lost his motorized wheelchair, and when it was returned it was disassembled, Gottlieb said Saturday. </P>
<P> American Airlines declined immediate comment.  ``I knew when the woman looked me in the eye in Philadelphia and said they'd lost my chair that I would sue,'' said the psychologist, who has a talk show on National Public Radio. </P>
<P> In federal court papers filed Friday, Gottlieb is seeking $500,000 for ``pain and humiliation.'' He is claiming the long wait in an manual chair aggravated body sores, requiring surgery and a six-week recovery. </P>
<P> Gottlieb, who is paralyzed from the neck down, needs a motorized wheelchair. </P>
<P> Gottlieb said he encounters problems 70 percent of the time he flies. </P>
