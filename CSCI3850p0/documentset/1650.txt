<P>  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe Wednesday said a greater realism in defining U.N. peacekeeping missions did not mean depriving the United Nations of the means to carry them out. </P>
<P> ``It is for the United Nations and this organization alone to ensure international equilibrium by having the power to decide in the last resort on measures of enforcement or on the use of force,'' he said in his address to the 49th General Assembly session. </P>
<P> ``In the face of challenges to the international community, realism consists not in lowering our ambitions but in ensuring that we have the means to achieve them to the full,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``Our ambition should not be limited to achieving what seems possible. It should also be to make possible that which is clearly necessary.'' </P>
<P> In contrast to President Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Juppe as well as other European leaders strongly defended the United Nations, saying much of the harsh criticism of the world body was unmerited if member states did not supply standby peacekeeping forces and pay dues promptly. </P>
<P> ``We know that the criticial situation is not just the result of outlays.'' he said. </P>
<P> ``The real source of our financial crisis is well known. It lies in the negligence of states which fail to pay or do not pay their contributions properly.'' </P>
<P> The United States currently owes over $600 million for peacekeeping and regular dues while Russia is in arrears for $568 million. </P>
<P> Juppe said that the scarcity of U.N. troops meant the world body now needed to develop a ``network of standby forces.'' </P>
<P> But he was the only speaker to date to go out of his way to compliment the United States ``for its commitment and sense of international solidarity'' in intervening in Haiti, which followed France's excursion into Rwanda. </P>
<P> Juppe also indirectly criticized Washington's position on Iraqi sanctions, without mentioning the United States by name. </P>
<P> He said that when the Security Council imposes sanctions on a member state its resolution should state ``explicity what actions the targeted states should take for the sanctions to be lifted.'' </P>
<P> Iraq has frequently criticized the United States for digressing from a post-Gulf War resolution and changing its conditions for lifting sanctions on oil exports, imposed in 1990 when Baghdad's troops invaded Kuwait. </P>
<P> France, in contrast, has said the oil embargo should be lifted after Iraq complies with disarmament demands and recognizes Kuwait. </P>
