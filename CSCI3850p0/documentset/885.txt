<P>  Israel will begin extending elements of Palestinian self-rule to the rest of the West Bank next week, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said Friday after meeting PLO chairman Yasser Arafat in the Gaza self-rule zone. </P>
<P> ``The first step in implementing the early empowerment will take place next week, when Israel will hand over to the Palestinian Authority the responsibility for education in all of the territories, the Palestinian part of it,'' Peres said, referring to the transfer of authority in the West Bank beyond the small Jericho self-rule enclave. </P>
<P> On Wednesday Israel, pressed by the PLO to set a date for handing over powers to Palestinians in the still-occupied West Bank, said it would transfer education to their control by the start of the school year on September 1. </P>
<P> Peres, making the first visit by an Israeli cabinet minister to Arafat's Gaza headquarters, was speaking at joint news conference with the PLO leader and Norwegian Foreign Minister Bjoern Tore Godal, marking the first anniversary of the secret Norwegian-brokered talks that led to the Israel-PLO peace deal. </P>
<P> Education is the first of five spheres of authority being transferred in ``early empowerment,'' diplomatic shorthand for an interim phase of the Israeli-PLO agreement. </P>
<P> Nearly one million Palestinians live in the West Bank, the final status of which will be negotiated at a later stage. Israel has occupied the West Bank since capturing it from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war. </P>
