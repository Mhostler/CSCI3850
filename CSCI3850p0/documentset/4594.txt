<P> Judge Lance Ito last Friday ordered Lopez not to leave the country and instead return to testify before the jury Monday morning. </P>
<P> But Deputy District Attorney Marcia Clark said the prosecution had reconsidered its position over the weekend and believed that it would be ``very disruptive'' if Lopez is allowed to suddenly interrupt the state's case and testify out of order. </P>
<P> She said Lopez' testimony would ``highlight the witness' testimony and afford her undue importance.'' </P>
<P> Defense attorney Johnnie Cochran objected to Clark's proposal and asked the judge to allow Lopez to take the stand with the jury present. </P>
