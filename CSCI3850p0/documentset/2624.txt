<P>  Germans must be reminded clearly about the Nazi past when the country marks the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II next May, President Roman Herzog said Tuesday. </P>
<P> Herzog, who will be a key speaker on the anniversary, said he would have to capture the attention of Germans born after the war, who had no memory of the Nazi era. </P>
<P> ``Those born in my year, 1934, are almost the last witnesses to the times, those who saw the concentration camps and the ethnic Germans expelled from eastern Europe (after the war),'' he said in a briefing for foreign journalists. </P>
<P> ``Those who came after us did not experience these things and they have to be presented with the past much more clearly than has been done so far.'' </P>
<P> The German president's role is largely ceremonial. The greatest influence of the president is at state commemorations. </P>
<P> Herzog declined to detail his plans for a speech on May 8, anniversary of the day when Nazi Germany surrendered to the wartime Allies. </P>
<P> But he said the need to impress younger Germans with the past meant his address would differ in style from the widely praised speech of his predecessor, Richard von Weizsaecker, on the 40th anniversary in 1985. </P>
<P> ``I will not argue differently than Weizsaecker did, but I have to speak differently so that the lessons we have learned are carried over to the next generations,'' Herzog said. </P>
<P> Weizsaecker, who stepped down in June after serving two five-year terms, won broad popularity at home and abroad by speaking directly of Germany's war guilt and responsibilities. </P>
<P> In his 1985 speech he called May 8 a day of liberation rather than a day of surrender. </P>
