<P>  A daughter of a former top Mafia boss who has renounced his life of crime has taken over his old post to become Cosa Nostra's newest ``godmother,'' investigators in Sicily said Thursday. </P>
<P> They did not release the identity of the woman but said she was believed to be one of three daughters of Giuseppe Pulvirenti, the once-powerful boss of a Mafia clan based in the eastern Sicilian city of Catania. </P>
<P> Investigators say women have taken more active roles in the Mafia since a crackdown following the bombing deaths of judges Paolo Borsellino and Giovanne Falcone in 1992 put hundreds of Mafiosi behind bars. </P>
<P> They say women, who have access to former Mafia bosses through jailhouse visits, have assumed more power in part because they have been able to convey messages and orders from their husbands, fathers and brothers. </P>
<P> Earlier this month, police in Catania said they arrested the first so-called ``godmother,'' 26-year-old Maria Filippa Messina, who was said to have become a ``woman of honour'' two years ago after her Mafia boss husband was jailed for murder. </P>
<P> Known as ``U Mappassotu,'' from the old name of his home town Belpasso near Catania, Pulvirenti was arrested in June 1993 after 11 years on the run and has since become a so-called Mafia turncoat cooperating with anti-Mafia investigators. </P>
<P> He has also publicly urged other Mafiosi in jail to turn state's evidence, saying the state had won the war against the Sicilian mob. </P>
<P> But according to investigators, one of his own daughters has stepped in to his old position as head of the ``Mappassotu'' clan, which has been accused of hundreds of murders and arms trafficking. </P>
<P> They said the information surfaced during an investigation leading to the arrest on Tuesday night of 35-year-old Concetto Di Maggio, who allegedly was a Pulvirenti liuetenant. </P>
<P> Investigators said Di Maggio was helping reorganise the clan's hierarchy under one of Pulvirenti's daughters. </P>
<P> Two of his daughters are married to former reputed lieutenants of the clan who are in jail, they said. </P>
<P> Last October, Pulvirenti issued a letter from his cell urging the Mafia to give up the fight. </P>
<P> ``Lay down your arms, the state is stronger than us and has won the war. Surrender and cooperate with the law,'' he wrote. </P>
<P> Pulvirenti's brother and two sons also are in jail but have refused to join the growing band of Mafia turncoats. His wife has disowned him. </P>
<P> In an interview on Thursday with the Italian L'Unita newspaper, Pulvirenti appealed to his family to quit the Mafia. He did not refer to the reports that one of his daughters allegedly had taken up the leadership of his old clan. </P>
<P> ``They have said bad things about me, things that have hurt me...but I love them just the same and hope they understand what I am doing,'' he said. ``I hope one day they, too, will follow me down this new road.'' </P>
