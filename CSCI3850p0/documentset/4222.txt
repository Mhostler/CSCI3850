<DATELINE>NGENDA, Rwanda (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  As U.N. agencies organize the return home of Rwandan refugees and close camps for the displaced, Hutu militiamen responsible for genocide in Rwanda are heading the other way -- away from Rwanda. </P>
<P> Officials from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said the first mission from Burundi, ferrying 87 Rwandans Tuesday from a refugee camp to their homes, was so successful another convoy would leave Burundi Thursday. </P>
<P> Peasants and ordinary Hutu Rwandans are gradually being persuaded to return home, despite fear of reprisals by the Tutsi-dominated government for last year's genocide of up to a million people, who were mainly Tutsis or their Hutu allies. </P>
<P> As the convoys start in Burundi, the United Nations is closing camps in southwest Rwanda where Hutus fled from other parts of the country, and where the notorious Interahamwe militia established itself after the Hutu-led government fled last July. </P>
<P> And in eastern Zaire, where more than over a million refugees live in squalor, the United Nations expects to deploy military advisers this week to help the Zairean army impose order and help repatriation. </P>
<P> Officials say that faced with a repatriation program that is finally gaining steam, cutting their power base of frightened refugees, Hutu militiamen are fleeing. </P>
<P> In southwest Rwanda, more than 30,000 displaced from two of the biggest camps have returned home and the camps were closed. But up to 20,000 more moved to other sites and as many as 5,000 others have crossed into Burundi. </P>
<P> ``They have blood on their hands and don't want to go home. But refugees in Burundi are largely innocent peasants and for them the lure of the land is strong,'' said one U.N. official. </P>
<P> ``It's coming up to planting time and they want to get home to their crops.'' </P>
<P> ``I am coming back because UNHCR have told me it is safe,'' Euphrasie Nyirabenda, one of the 87 who returned from Burundi on Tuesday, told Reuters. ``Also, in Magara, I did not have enough food and was treated badly.'' </P>
<P> Shepherded off trucks inside Rwanda, the group lined up with their meager belongings -- cans to carry gas, cooking pots and bags of clothes -- as Rwandan troops searched them for arms. </P>
<P> The border procedures took two hours. Returnees then boarded more trucks and drove 13 miles through desolate countryside of untended fields to Ngenda, their home commune. </P>
<P> A U.N. spokesman in Geneva incorrectly said Tuesday 97 went home. </P>
<P> UNHCR officials remain concerned about the security of the returnees but said growing international troops and monitors and the cooperation of local authorities were reassuring. </P>
<P> Most of the estimated two million Rwandans still in camps say fear of reprisals from Rwanda's Tutsi-dominated army is the main problem stopping them going home. </P>
