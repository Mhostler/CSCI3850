<P>  Egypt's 125-year-old Suez Canal faces greater competition from existing world trade routes than from plans for new transportation networks following peace between Israel and Jordan, a senior official said Saturday. </P>
<P> Mohammad Ezat Adel, chairman of the Suez Canal Authority, said new waterways or roads in the region could not challenge the Canal's pre-eminent position as the main link between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean. </P>
<P> Proposals for canals linking the Dead Sea with the Red Sea or Mediterranean would be used only for power generation and irrigation, he added. </P>
<P> Adel told Reuters the Suez Canal faced greater threats from land trade routes farther afield, such as Siberian and Chinese rail links carrying goods from the Far East to Europe. </P>
<P> He said shippers were also considering using icebreakers to open all-year Arctic shipping routes linking the Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean. Now the routes are navigable only in summer, he said. </P>
<P> Suez Canal revenues fell three percent in the first nine months of 1994 to $1.421 billion. Canal authorities blame changing patterns in world trade but say they are well-placed to capitalize on increased regional trade following progress in the Middle East peace process. </P>
