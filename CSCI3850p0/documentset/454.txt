<P>  Up to 25 percent of people who become infected with the HIV virus will survive without developing AIDS for two decades, researchers said Thursday. </P>
<P> Their study, published in the British Medical Journal, studied hemophiliac men who had been infected with HIV by transfusion with blood products. </P>
<P> The researchers developed a model to predict when, and if, subjects would develop AIDS. The men were followed up for at least 10 years after they became HIV positive, and the model correctly identified most of those who developed AIDS in that time. </P>
<P> The model showed that older people tended to develop AIDS more rapidly after HIV infection than younger people. </P>
<P> The proportion of those remaining free of AIDS was nearly a third in those who were aged below 15 at infection, a fifth in those aged 15-29, and an eighth in those aged 30 or more. </P>
<P> The reasons why some people developed AIDS more quickly than others were still unclear, the researchers said. </P>
