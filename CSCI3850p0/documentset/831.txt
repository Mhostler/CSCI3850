<P>  A U.N. inspection team has returned to Bahrain from Baghdad after examining dozens of cameras installed in missile sites in Iraq as part of long-term monitoring expected to start next month. </P>
<P> Team leader Sam Liburdi told reporters Wednesday that his mission was to test and validate the capabilities of cameras installed in July to monitor Iraq's missile facilities. </P>
<P> The nine-member team spent around 10 days in Baghdad before returning on Tuesday to Bahrain, the field headquarters of U.N. missions stripping Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction in accordance with the 1991 Gulf War cease-fire terms. </P>
<P> The U.N. Security Council has banned Iraq from acquiring nuclear, chemical or biological weapons as well as ballistic missiles with a range of more than 90 miles. </P>
<P> Liburdi, an American, described his mission as ``very productive'' but declined to give further details. </P>
<P> Another U.N. team went to Baghdad Wednesday as the United Nations prepared the ground for a possible start of long-term monitoring next month. </P>
<P> U.N. teams are preparing the program to monitor Iraqi facilities related to its banned weapons systems, which is a prerequisite to the easing or lifting of the crippling oil and trade embargo imposed on Iraq in 1990 for invading Kuwait. </P>
