<DATELINE>BASTIA, France (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A small bomb damaged the home of a Corsican mayor whose district is the focus of a manslaughter trial over the deaths of 17 people in a 1992 soccer stadium disaster, police sources said Tuesday. </P>
<P> No one was hurt in the blast just before midnight Monday which blew out the doorway of the home of Eugene Bertucci, mayor of Furiani in the north of the French Mediterranean island. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack. </P>
<P> Furiani is an area on the outskirts of the town of Bastia where a hastily built soccer stand collapsed in a tangle of metal in 1992, killing 17 people and wounding more than 2,300 -- and now the subject of a manslaughter trial. </P>
<P> Many of the survivors had wanted Bertucci in the dock with 13 defendants currently on trial for manslaughter over the disaster, which struck minutes before kick-off in a French Cup semifinal between Bastia and Marseille. </P>
<P> The explosion adds to mystery around the trial following the death of a key witness, Jean-Francois Filippi, president of the Bastia Football Club at the time of the disaster, who was shot dead outside his home Dec. 26 by unknown gunmen. </P>
<P> The island, where separatist guerrillas are fighting for greater independence from Paris, already has a reputation for underworld killings and banditry. The murder rate is six times that in mainland France. </P>
<P> Monday, screaming relatives demanding tough jail sentences disrupted the highly-charged trial, which began Jan. 4. The victims represent about one percent of the island's total population. </P>
