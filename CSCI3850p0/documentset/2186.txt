<DATELINE>SEATTLE (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Clinton said Sunday he is not advocating cuts in Social Security and Medicare as he defended himself against a fresh Republican attack against his economic policies. </P>
<P> Clinton told reporters after a campaign speech here that a memo by White House Budget Director Alice Rivlin outlining possible spending cuts and tax increases to deal with the deficit were merely options and not policies advocated by the administration. </P>
<P> ``There is nothing in that memo and nothing in the record which should indicate that I have changed my position on these two fundamental issues,'' Clinton told reporters after a campaign rally speech. But he added that the deficit will ''explode'' in the future if nothing is done to cut government medical care costs, which he planned to do in his failed health care reform effort. </P>
<P> At a rally for Democratic candidates, Clinton ticked off the steps he and Congressional Democrats have taken to reduce the budget deficit, cut the federal work force and create jobs and that Democrats were not getting credit for those accomplishments. </P>
<P> ``What is going on here that they say these people are the apostles of big government and they are wildly liberal,'' Clinton said. </P>
<P> Clinton was on a weekend campaign swing to support Democrats including Senate candidate Ron Sims, who is running against Republican incumbent Sen. Slade Gorton. Conspicuously absent from the forum was Speaker of the House Thomas Foley, who is in an uphill battle against his Republican opponent George Nethercutt. </P>
<P> While Clinton defended his policies, Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Georgia, attacked the White House memo, saying Clinton and his fellow Democrats of planning deep spending cuts and tax increases, while criticizing Republican budget policies. </P>
<P> ``We've seen the most cynical two weeks from this president and his administration,'' the conservative Republican said in an interview with CBS's ``Face the Nation'' show. ``For two weeks they've attacked Republicans. ``They've lied about Social Security cuts.'' </P>
<P> The memo had been released to news organizations over the weekend by conservative Republican strategist William Kristol, a former to Vice President Dan Quayle. </P>
<P> Clinton has been trying to boost his popular support by convincing skeptical Americans that his economic policies are slowing the flow of federal red ink while at the same time creating more high-paying jobs for workers. </P>
<P> ``Mr. Gingrich has leveled a charge which is not right,'' Clinton told reporters. The president challenged Gingrich and Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole of Kansas to support his pledge to leave Social Security untouched by budget cuts and to use savings in Medicare to advance health reform. </P>
<P> ``Will they say they don't support cuts in Social Security and they won't support using Mecicare savings for anything other than helping health care?'' he said. </P>
<P> Gingrich and other House Republican candidates are running on an economic and social agenda they call a ``Contract with America,'' which calls for tax cuts, higher defense spending and balanced budgets. </P>
<P> Democrats feel they have improved their chances by accusing Republicans of returning to the economic policies of the 1980's that led to record budget deficits and higher interest rates. </P>
<P> The Republican program would cost a trillion dollars, Clinton told supporters. He said it would mean a 30 percent across-the-board cut in every government program. </P>
<P> ``What will happen is what happened before,'' he added. ``It will explode the deficit, it will lead to unwise cuts ... and it will lead to shipping our jobs overseas,'' Clinton said. </P>
<P> Clinton and his fellow Democrats are fighting to limit the damage in the Nov. 8 congressional elections from an anti-incumbent mood sweeping the country. At stake are all 435 seats in the House of Representatives, 35 U.S. Senate seats and 36 of the 50 state governors. </P>
