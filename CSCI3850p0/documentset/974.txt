<P>  The Atomic Energy Commission purposely caused a nuclear reactor ``accident'' that produced a low-intensity radioactive cloud over Los Angeles in 1965, according to government documents made public Wednesday by a member of Congress. </P>
<P> Representative Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, said the now defunct commission caused a reactor accident that ''vaporized a significant portion of the nuclear core'' as part of its test program in Nevada for a nuclear-powered rocket. </P>
<P> Documents showed the intensity of radioactivity that passed over Los Angeles and into the Pacific Ocean was low -- well below levels considered acceptable for annual exposure from commercial atomic power operations. </P>
<P> But Markey, who for years has prodded the government to disclose the secrets of it nuclear experiments, said in a letter to Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary: ``An intentional reactor accident releasing a radioactive cloud should not be considered prudent public policy.'' </P>
<P> Markey said a presidential committee studying the government's Cold War-era human radiation experiments should view this incident as a radiation test on humans. </P>
<P> The panel is weighing whether and how subjects of once-secret government radiation experiments should be compensated, and the Energy Department has been making volumes of formerly classified documents available to the panel. </P>
<P> Markey said the 1965 ``radioactive cloud extended over a longer distance and exposed considerably more people than some operations already being considered as human experiments.'' </P>
<P> He also said the panel should consider a case raised by government documents in which B-57 military planes were sent through the radioactive exhaust from a nuclear rocket being tested in 1960, and doses to aircrews were measured. </P>
<P> The Atomic Energy Agency halted the nuclear rocket program in 1972. </P>
