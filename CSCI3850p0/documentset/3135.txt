<DATELINE>BEIJING (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  China set Monday an ambitious target of keeping the urban unemployment rate next year at about 3 percent, despite 10 million new job-seekers and 30 million migrant workers seeking jobs. </P>
<P> China faces a herculean task to meet this target and to satisfy the need for new jobs, the Economic Daily quoted Labor Minister Li Boyong as telling a national work meeting. </P>
<P> He said 10 million new people would enter the urban job market in 1995, while 10 million in state companies have no actual work to do and the number of rural workers seeking jobs in the cities will increase to 30 million. </P>
<P> The jobless total will be further swollen by broader implementation of the bankruptcy law, which will close more money-losing state firms, Li said. </P>
<P> The official urban unemployment rate at the end of 1993 was 2.6 percent out of the 150.4 million in regular urban jobs. </P>
<P> Asked where the new jobs would come from, an official of the Labor Ministry's legal department said firms would have to retrain workers, diversify into new fields and co-operate with other companies. </P>
<P> The service sector must be further developed, he said by telephone. </P>
<P> After those in work -- but with nothing to do -- are taken into account, actual urban unemployment is 16.7 percent, while in rural areas it is 37 percent, official figures published last week showed. </P>
<P> Li's remarks coincide with a national campaign to try to improve control of the flood of rural labourers into cities. </P>
<P> State television at the weekend showed pictures of trains overcrowded with rural laborers travelling from inland provinces to coastal cities. Those interviewed said they had no job to go to but were travelling in hope. </P>
<P> Official figures published Sunday show Beijing alone has 3.4 million residents from outside the capital, equal to one third of the capital's permanent population. </P>
<P> The city government is working on emergency measures to control this flood, officials announced. </P>
<P> Monday marks the start of a weeklong propaganda campaign on the streets of Beijing, where 2.4 million explanatory leaflets will be distributed, to publicise the new Labor Law that comes into effect next year. </P>
<P> The new law aims to put relations between worker and employer on a legal basis, spelling out the rights and obligations of both sides. </P>
<P> It is part of the government's long-term plan to turn state firms into independent companies that are not administratively part of the government and have no welfare obligations. </P>
<P> Minister Li told the meeting that part of the new law includes wider implementation of the contract system, which already applies to 40 million workers in areas where the economy is more advanced. </P>
<P> Li said the new contract system, which replaces the previous job-for-life system, should be applied next year in all areas where the economy is sufficiently developed. </P>
<P> In less advanced areas, 80 percent of firms would be required to implement the new system by the end of 1995. </P>
