<DATELINE>TIRANA, March 25 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  About two hundred Albanian police guarded the area around the U.S. embassy in Tirana as crowds of young people gathered after a report that the United States would welcome Albanians as workers. </P>
<P> Police estimated that about three hundred young people turned up outside the embassy on Friday to find out if the report was true and if they could escape Europe's poorest country. </P>
<P> ``Will America take immigrants on Thursday?'' Albania's Meteor newspaper had declared in a report. </P>
<P> No comment was immediately available from the U.S. State Department in Washington. </P>
<P> Albania's security chief Fatjon Sofka said: ``Most of the people coming near the embassy were aged from 12 to 18, from different towns, badly dressed, and lured by the claims or curiosity.'' </P>
<P> Some of the young people huddled around fires as night fell in the hope that a small number would be allowed into the embassy. </P>
<P> In July 1990, about 4,000 Albanians broke into foreign embassies in Tirana in an attempt to escape the economic hardships of decades of hardline communist rule. Several European countries accepted them. </P>
<P> About half a million of Albania's 3.3 million population work in nearby countries such as Italy and Greece. </P>
