<P>  Rescuers, refusing to abandon hope, combed 3,000 square miles of the blustery North Atlantic Monday for 22 crew from a Ukrainian-registered cargo ship that sank Friday in a violent storm. </P>
<P> ``We remain optimistic that there will be more survivors out there,'' said U.S. Coast Guard spokesman Dennis Uhlenhopp, adding that bad weather remained a major obstacle. </P>
<P> ``We're facing 15-foot seas (waves) and 40-knot winds,'' Uhlenhopp said. ``Visibility and weather are just very poor.'' </P>
<P> Two survivors have been rescued. Seven bodies have been spotted in the water by merchant vessels, four of which have been recovered, Uhlenhopp added. </P>
<P> The 450-foot Salvador Allende, with 31 crew members aboard, sank Friday morning 1,200 miles east of the New Jersey coast. </P>
<P> ``We have three aircraft flying a search pattern,'' Uhlenhopp said, a Canadian Forces C-130 Hercules spotter plane, a Coast Guard C-130 and a U.S. Navy P-3 Orion spotter plane. </P>
<P> ``Just the fact that we're out there looking makes me optimistic,'' he said, although the missing crew members had been exposed for three days to the elements -- including treacherous 30-foot waves and 65 mph winds Friday evening. </P>
<P> Uhlenhopp said six merchant vessels were assisting the search effort Monday. </P>
<P> A 36-year-old Ukrainian sailor rescued Saturday, Alexander Paranov, remained in stable condition at a Halifax hospital Monday, the Coast Guard said. </P>
<P> Another sailor, the 37-year-old Ukrainian second mate, was rescued by the merchant ship Torungen Friday. The Coast Guard said he was ``safely on board'' the vessel headed for Norway. </P>
<P> Some of the Salvador Allende's 31 crew members were wearing survival suits when they abandoned ship and took to lifeboats and rubber rafts. </P>
<P> No cause has been determined for the sinking. </P>
