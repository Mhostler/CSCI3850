<P>  Sen. Barbara Boxer Tuesday called on Defense Secretary William Perry to adopt strict new safety standards for private aircraft leased to the military, saying the military's current policy was at best ambiguous and at worst dangerous. </P>
<P> The move follows the fatal crash in Fresno, Calif., last week in which a Lear jet leased to the California Air National Guard crashed into an apartment building, killing the pilot and co-pilot and injuring 16 civilians. </P>
<P> In a letter to Perry, Boxer, who was in Fresno when the tragedy occurred and visited the crash site, said, ``When I looked into the Fresno crash, I was informed by FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) officials that they believed the military was responsible for the safety of the aircraft involved. </P>
<P> ``I was informed by DoD (Department of Defense) staff that they believed the FAA was responsible. At the least, current policy appears to create confusion and ambiguity, and at the worst, we have a dangerous situation.'' </P>
<P> Boxer pointed out that in 1986, 256 U.S. soldiers were killed when their chartered aircraft crashed shortly after takeoff from Newfoundland. </P>
<P> ``When I spoke with Air Force personnel on Friday, I was pleased to be informed that a decision had been made to ground the other similar aircraft under contract, pending an investigation of the (Fresno) incident. </P>
<P> ``When the investigation is complete, let us not return to a flawed policy,'' Boxer wrote. </P>
