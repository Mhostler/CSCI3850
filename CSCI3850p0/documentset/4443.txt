<P>  Massachusetts and India's southern state of Karnataka Monday signed an agreement to become sister states. </P>
<P> Weld said Saturday that he expected joint ventures to flourish between Massachusetts, which has numerous high-technology companies, and Karnataka, known as India's Silicon Valley for its growing software firms. </P>
<P> The agreement also provides for educational and cultural exchanges. ``I see a tremendous scope for business and cultural ties between the two states,'' Weld said. </P>
<P> Two joint ventures involving Massachusetts companies were announced after the signing of the agreement between Weld, who is leading a 22-company business delegation, and H.D. Deve Gowda, the chief minister of Karnataka. </P>
<P> One of them would build a 100 mile expressway to link Bangalore, Karnataka's capital, with Mysore, another of the state's important cities. The other is a software venture. </P>
