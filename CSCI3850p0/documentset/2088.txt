<P>  A United Nations aid convoy came under fire near the eastern Bosnian town of Gorazde Tuesday and one driver was believed killed and another wounded, a U.N. spokesman said. </P>
<P> U.N. spokesman Col. Tim Spicer said the casualty reports were not confirmed and he could not say who fired at the convoy operated by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. </P>
<P> British U.N. peacekeeping troops returned fire but there were no reports of their inflicting casualties. </P>
<P> Gorazde is a Muslim enclave in eastern Bosnia surrounded by Bosnian Serb forces. Spicer said Tuesday's incident took place on the southern edge of the enclave. </P>
<P> Bosnian Serbs launched a heavy attack on the town last April but were deterred by NATO air strikes. Several hundred U.N. peacekeeping troops have since been stationed in Gorazde with the aim of policing a heavy weapons exclusion zone around the town but they have been frequently exposed to hostile fire by both sides. </P>
