<P>  Scientists at a London hospital said Tuesday they had discovered a brain abnormality in anorexic children which may be linked to the eating disorder. </P>
<P> Researchers at Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital, led by consultant psychiatrist Bryan Lask, noticed a reduced blood flow in a small part of the brain in anorexic children. </P>
<P> Lask told reporters: ``We have found a very clear-cut abnormality not previously discovered on one side of the brain only and this has to have some meaning.'' </P>
<P> Six children aged between seven and 11 were tested over the past three months. Five showed the abnormality. </P>
<P> Although it is too soon to say whether the link is conclusive, Lask said: ``I believe we will find that this brain abnormality is a predisposing factor of anorexia. </P>
<P> ``There must be some reason why children who are exposed to the same socio-cultural factors develop different disorders.'' </P>
<P> If the research is positive, it could result in the treatment of anorexia nervosa. </P>
<P> ``If the abnormality is reversible or if it is treatable, that would be wonderful because we could reverse the anorexia,'' said Lask. ``If it is untreatable then that is not so helpful, but would go a long way to explaining causes of the disorder.'' </P>
<P> The disclosure came at the Eating Disorders '95 conference in London, which also heard that girls as young as nine are consciously dieting and being made more vulnerable to eating disorders. </P>
