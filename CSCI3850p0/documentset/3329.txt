<P>  The Air Force said Monday that Capt. Jim Wang will face a court martial for his role as chief of the crew on the AWACS plane that failed to warn off two F-15s that shot down two U.S. helicopters over Iraq last April, killing 26. </P>
<P> Charges against four other AWACS officers were dismissed. The Air Force had earlier dropped charges against the pilots of the F-15s that blew the two helicopters out of the air over northern Iraq. The accident killed 15 Americans, six military officers from Britain, France and Turkey and six Kurdish workers. </P>
<P> Wang will be tried on three counts of dereliction of duty by a military judge at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma at an undecided date, Lt. Gen. Stephen Croker announced from Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana. </P>
