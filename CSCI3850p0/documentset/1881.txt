<P>  Mexican police offered a reward Saturday for a fugitive lawmaker and his alleged accomplice in the assassination last week of a top ruling party official. </P>
<P> The attorney general's office released posters, flagged ''Wanted for Murder,'' displaying photographs of ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) legislator Manuel Munoz Rocha and accused co-conspirator Fernando Rodriguez Gonzalez. </P>
<P> The attorney general's office did not say how big the reward was for information leading to the apprehension of the two men. </P>
<P> Both are charged, along with 10 other people already detained, with plotting the September 28 assassination of PRI Secretary-General Francisco Ruiz Massieu. </P>
<P> The killing, coming just seven months after the slaying of PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, rocked Mexico and gave rise to fears of a bloody power struggle between the party's pro-democracy reformers and old-guard strongmen known as ``dinosaurs.'' </P>
<P> Deputy Attorney General Mario Ruiz Massieu, the dead man's brother who is leading the investigation, said Friday that two ''very well-known politicians'' may have been behind the latest killing. </P>
<P> He did not name them but reiterated his belief that Munoz, who allegedly planned the hit, had been ordered to do so by figures higher up in the political system. He has also said he does not rule out the involvement of drug-traffickers. </P>
<P> Munoz, as a member of the lower-house Chamber of Deputies, enjoyed immunity from prosecution but gave his immunity up in a fax to the Chamber from an unknown location last week in order to be able to answer the charges against him. </P>
<P> Munoz has denied masterminding the killing but, in letters published in Mexican newspapers, has admitted going along with the plot because he feared reprisals if he refused. </P>
<P> In the past, the attorney general's office has offered rewards of $1 million each for information leading to the arrest of drug barons, including Juan Garcia Abrego, the suspected head of the ``Gulf'' or ``Matamoros'' cocaine cartel. </P>
<P> Garcia Abrego's brother Humberto was detained by police last week for questioning about the cartel's possible links to the killing of Ruiz. </P>
<P> Radio station Radio Red reported Saturday that Humberto had been released after questioning. The report could not immediately be confirmed. </P>
