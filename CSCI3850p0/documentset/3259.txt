<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  White House press secretary Dee Dee Myers has formally notified President Clinton she will leave her job at the end of the year, the Washington Post reported Friday. </P>
<P> The paper quoted Myers as saying her last day would be Dec. 31, but she would leave the White House next week for Christmas with her family and would not return. </P>
<P> Myers told the paper she had not decided what she would do next, although she had held discussions on several job offers. </P>
<P> Myers, the first woman to hold the prestigious White House post, most likely will be replaced by State Department spokesman Michael McCurry, the paper said, quoting unnamed sources. </P>
<P> Myers' decision to leave the White House follows a failed attempted by chief of staff Leon Panetta earlier this year to replace her as part of a staff overhaul. </P>
<P> It also comes on the heels of a series of other recent departures, including the resignation earlier this month of Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and the firing last week of Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders. </P>
<P> Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy will also leave the administation Dec. 31, and there have been rumors of other shifts in the Cabinet. </P>
