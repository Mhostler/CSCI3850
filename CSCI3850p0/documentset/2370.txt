<P>  House incumbents running for re-election have raised five times as much money as their challengers and have an enormous 15-1 advantage in political action committee contributions, a study said Wednesday. </P>
<P> The report by the public interest group Common Cause found that as of Sept. 30, House incumbents had $214 million in total resources, compared to $43 million for challengers. </P>
<P> Further, incumbents had raised nearly $79 million from special interest political action committees compared to $5 million for their challengers, the study said. </P>
<P> ``Public anger at Congress hasn't fazed special-interest campaign contributors who continue to provide the same enormous financial advantage for House incumbents ... as they have in past elections,'' said Common Cause President Fred Wertheimer. </P>
<P> The average incumbent had nearly $560,000 in total resources, even though Common Cause said 86 percent of House incumbents were either unopposed or running against challengers who lagged far behind in fund raising. </P>
<P> Thirty-seven House candidates, including 32 incumbents, had over $1 million in total resources, including leftover funds from 1992 plus money raised since January 1993. </P>
<P> The incumbent with the most money at $2.54 million was Illinois Democrat Dan Rostenkowksi, who has been forced to step aside as chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee due to a federal indictment on fraud charges. </P>
<P> Other incumbents with over $2 million include Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, California Republican David Dreier, Texas Republican Eugene Fontenot -- who donated $2.4 million of his own fortune -- and New York Democrat Charles Schumer. </P>
<P> House Speaker Thomas Foley, a Washington Democrat in a close race, had $1.84 million in total resources. In addition, 21 House candidates raised more than $1 million since Jan. 1, 1993 led by Fontenot and Gephardt. Gephardt was also the leading recipient of political action committee funds. </P>
