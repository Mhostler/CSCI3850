<P>  Two leading Cambodian human rights groups on Thursday praised the government for the arrests of a police official and an army commander suspected of involvement in the killing of two civilians earlier this year. </P>
<P> But the groups urged the government to bring to trial ``all of those responsible'' for the torture and killing of Neth Thong and Mov Ving, both 28, in northwest Battambang province. </P>
<P> ``The human rights organisations Adhoc and Licadho commend the government of Cambodia for the recent arrest of a military officer and a police captain for complicity in the murder of two men,'' the groups said in a statement. </P>
<P> ``They are believed to be among the leaders of the group of 30 soldiers, police and militia who had arrested Neth Thong and Mov Ving shortly before their murder.'' </P>
<P> According to an initial investigation by human rights groups earlier this year, both men had been severely beaten and tortured before being handcuffed and shot at close range. </P>
<P> A police report justified the killing on the grounds that the two men were members of the Khmer Rouge guerrilla faction. </P>
<P> But villagers said the murders could have been in revenge for the January killing of a relative of one of the officials who allegedly participated in the killing. </P>
<P> The rights groups said the police official and the army commander ``reportedly have been charged with complicity in the February 5, 1995, killing.'' But they said that the militia chief ``who witnesses believe is responsible for ordering the two men killed, is said to have run away.'' </P>
<P> The statement also said: ``Adhoc and Licadho remain concerned for the safety of the family members of the victims. Since the killings the family members have received threats from those believed responsible.'' </P>
