<P>  House Republicans have drafted legislation that would bar most legal immigrants from 60 federal programs, The Washington Post reported Saturday. </P>
<P> The proposal would prohibit them from receiving free childhood immunization, housing assistance, Medicaid, subsidized school lunches and many other federal benefits, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> The measure is part of the Republicans' welfare reform plan and is designed to save almost $22 billion over five years which would be used to finance work programs for welfare recipients, according to the Post. </P>
<P> The newspaper said the legislation would exempt two groups of legal immigrants from the prohibition on receiving services -- refugees during their first six years in the United States and legal immigrants over 75 who have been in the country for at least five years. </P>
<P> ``This is not a departure from traditional immigration policy because we have always required that people come here because they can get ahead through hard work, not because they can go on welfare,'' the Post quoted Rep. Clay Shaw, R-Fla., as saying. </P>
<P> Voters in California last month approved Proposition 187, which would deny many public services to illegal immigrants. The measure has been challenged in the courts. </P>
