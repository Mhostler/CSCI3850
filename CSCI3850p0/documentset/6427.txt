<P> Burns said the two men, whose meeting was attended by U.S. National Security Adviser Anthony Lake, reviewed ``what they hoped might be the outcome'' of Yeltsin and Clinton's discussion of the Iranian question. He did not elaborate. </P>
<P> Christopher had also mentioned Chechnya, where Russian troops are fighting separatist rebels. He told Kozyrev he hoped a ceasefire declared by Moscow could be extended. </P>
<P> Burns said the United States did not see the prospect of Moscow achieving a military victory in the north Caucasus territory. He said there had not been ``much of a substantial reaction'' from the Russians on this. </P>
<P> The two sides also discussed European security, including plans for NATO expansion. Lake and Christopher had ``reviewed how we see that issue playing out,'' he said. Kozyrev had been non-committal in his response, Burns added. </P>
