<DATELINE>CHICAGO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A 13-day sit-in by black students at the student newspaper at Chicago's DePaul University ended Monday after school officials reached an agreement with the protesters. </P>
<P> The sit-in was triggered by a story in the newspaper that quoted a police report on an incident at a party organized by black students. The report referred to ``M/Bs throwing chairs'' and other mentions of the police shorthand for black males. </P>
<P> The university said the students, who had been camped out in the basement of the newspaper building, agreed to ``redirect their criticism ... into participation on university committees that are working to bring about positive changes on a host of multicultural initiatives.'' </P>
<P> Publication of the DePaul newspaper had been suspended during the sit-in, which involved about 20 students. </P>
