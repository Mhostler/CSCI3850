<P>  South African President Nelson Mandela and exiled Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide met briefly Thursday but postponed the longer talks they had planned to have about their countries. </P>
<P> Aristide stopped by Blair House, the guest house across from the White House, where Mandela is staying and met the South African president for a few minutes in the afternoon. </P>
<P> The two men emerged together from Blair House. Aristide had no comment and Mandela, who had returned from an appearance at Congress later than anticipated, said only that he hoped to be able to schedule a talk about Haiti later in his U.S. visit. </P>
<P> Mandela spent 27 years in prison under apartheid and was elected president this year in South Africa's first all-race democratic elections. His message of reconciliation has made him an international hero. </P>
<P> Aristide was elected president of Haiti in 1990 on a surge of support from his country's impoverished masses. But he was overthrown in a bloody military coup just a few months later. </P>
<P> The United States last month negotiated an agreement with the military leaders to step down by October 15 and dispatched troops to Haiti to enforce that pact, and to help keep the peace so that Aristide can return to Haiti this month. </P>
