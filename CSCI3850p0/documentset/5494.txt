<P>  A former top official with American Honda Motor Co testified Wednesday he was ``stretching for a defense'' when he said earlier he believed his Japanese bosses were taking bribes from dealers. </P>
<P> Stanley Cardiges, who earlier this week testified in federal court that he had ``heard'' of gifts of golf clubs, expensive cars and free air travel for Japanese officials of the Honda company, was unable to verify a single instance. </P>
<P> Cardiges is the government's key witness at the trial of his former boss, John Billmyer, and former colleague, Dennis Josleyn. </P>
<P> Cardiges, 49, of Laguna Hills, Calif., pleaded guilty Feb. 7 to racketeering and other charges in one of the biggest bribery schemes in the history of the American car industry. </P>
<P> Once the most powerful sales executive with American Honda, Cardiges said Wednesday he was not sure how much he received in cash and gifts but said it could have been as much as $6 million, including interest payments on the mortgage on his house, a piano, furnishings, stereo and video equipment and a swimming pool.  Attorneys for Billmyer and Josleyn are trying to prove that Koichi Amemiya, chief executive of Honda's American unit, and other Japanese officials condoned management gift-taking and even accepted gifts themselves. </P>
<P> American Honda has said all along that it was defrauded and is a victim of the scam. </P>
<P> Chief prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Connolly, asked Cardiges repeatedly to ``tell the jury everything you know'' about his allegations of illegal gifts. </P>
<P> ``First hand, I know nothing,'' Cardiges said. ``I was stretching, trying to build a defense.'' </P>
<P> ``Can you think of a single Japanese manager who received a single item of value from a Honda dealership?'' Connolly asked. </P>
<P> ``No,'' Cardiges replied. </P>
<P> ``You were trying to get the jury to not like the Japanese as part of your defense?'' Connolly asked. </P>
<P> ``Yes,'' Cardiges answered. </P>
<P> Cardiges admitted last Friday that he lied to company management in 1992 when they confronted him about payoffs he took from car dealers and later lied to the FBI. </P>
<P> Prosecutors have charged that between 1979 and 1992, Cardiges and other former American Honda officials received $15 million in cash and merchandise kickbacks for granting franchises of coveted Honda cars, particularly the Acura. </P>
<P> Billmyer, a former senior vice president and Cardiges' boss, is charged with conspiracy and faces five years in jail if convicted. Josleyn faces 35 years if found guilty of racketeering and other charges. Cardiges also faces 35 years. </P>
