<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Labor Secretary Robert Reich, in a major economic policy speech, said Tuesday that billions of dollars could be freed for worker re-employment programs by ending special tax breaks for some industries. </P>
<P> ``Since we are committed to moving the disadvantaged from welfare to work, why not target corporate welfare as well and use the savings to help all Americans get better work?'' Reich said in an address to the Democratic Leadership Council. </P>
<P> Reich's speech to the council, a moderate-to-conservative partisan group with close ties to President Clinton, was part of a series of policy addresses dealing with what he calls a new ''anxious class'' of workers. </P>
<P> This class of workers, Reich said, has seen its compact of hard work in exchange for a secure job broken by corporate America amid a second industrial revolution of automation, global competition and a decline in union representation. </P>
<P> Because the federal budget is already strained, Reich suggested ending special tax benefits for certain industries as one way to pay for training and re-employment programs for displaced workers. </P>
<P> Calling for a renewed debate on the issue, Reich cited a report by the council's Progressive Policy Institute that identified $114 billion in spending subsidies and $111 billion in tax breaks that could be saved over a five-year period for this purpose. </P>
<P> The report, written by institute vice president Robert Shapiro and issued last January, lists dozens of potentially expendable subsidies and tax breaks for the energy, mining, agriculture, transportation, aerospace, high-tech and financial industries. </P>
<P> Asked about the proposal at a news conference, Clinton lauded it in concept, but declined to endorse it. </P>
<P> ``Conceptually, it's an attractive idea,'' the president said. ``I have to have time to review the details in the context our budget. I have made absolutely no decision about any of the specifics in Secretary Reich's proposal.'' </P>
<P> A Labor Department spokesman also stressed that Reich was not necessarily endorsing the institute's report, but was instead using it as a way of urging research groups that reflect the thinking of the new Republican majority in Congress to come up with their own examples of business subsidies that could be eliminated. </P>
<P> Reich declined to take questions after the speech. </P>
<P> But he did not mince words over what he called the administration's central mission of providing workers with the means of earning their way into a more secure middle class. </P>
<P> ``We are eager to cooperate with the new leadership in Congress on how best to rebuild the middle class,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``But there will be no compromise in our commitment to this mission,'' he added, defiantly paraphrasing the words of House Republican leader Newt Gingrich shortly after his party swept the Nov. 8 congressional elections. </P>
<P> The ``anxious class'' -- a large group of workers whose living standards have stagnated and who live in almost daily fear of losing their jobs -- was cited by Reich in an Aug. 31 speech. Above the ``anxious class'' are well-educated workers who are prospering and below them are the unskilled, whose fortunes are sinking fast, he said. </P>
<P> With companies no longer willing to offer job security as part of their compact with workers, Reich said workers need to be trained to make their own way through the economy and to learn new skills throughout their careers. </P>
<P> Although he cited several steps the administration has already made, such as school-to-work apprenticeships and job retraining centers, Reich said much of the responsibility for creating a new middle class rests with private industry. </P>
<P> ``It won't happen unless companies invest heavily in training their workers to use new technologies, and give them authority to make decisions,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``If American industry fails to forge such a compact with their workers, it will jeopardize American competitiveness in decades to come,'' he added. </P>
