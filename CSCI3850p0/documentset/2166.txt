<P>  Corruption and smuggling are rife in Vietnam despite tougher punishments for offending officials, according to a government briefing to parliament reported in newspapers Saturday. </P>
<P> A total of 919 violations in the first eight months of this year caused losses of $39 million. </P>
<P> More than 1,600 officials received ``administrative punishment'' and 430 were prosecuted on corruption charges, said the report presented to the National Assembly Friday. </P>
<P> The number of violations was almost identical to the figure for the first 10 months of 1993 announced last December, when Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet called for tougher punishment of corrupt officials and less use of administrative penalties as opposed to prosecution. </P>
<P> In the latest publicized case, Kiet sacked the chairman and vice-chairman of the People's Committee of the wealthy southern province of Ba Ria-Vung Tau, where Vietnam's offshore oil industry is based, for unspecified offenses involving land. </P>
<P> The report said there had been 4,300 cases of smuggling, 2,600 cases of trading in banned goods, and a similar number involving ``related illegal business activities.'' </P>
<P> Police seized one ton of opium, 22 pounds of heroin, several hauls of arms and two tons of explosives. </P>
<P> Tax evasion through under-invoicing by foreign and Vietnamese companies was rife, the report said. </P>
<P> Opening a new assembly session this week, Kiet listed corruption and smuggling among the obstacles to Vietnam's ambition of catching up with wealthier Asian countries. He stressed the need for administrative reform. </P>
