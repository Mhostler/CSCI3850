<DATELINE>BELFAST, May 10 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Irish republican party Sinn Fein, on the threshold of historic talks with Britain, said on Wednesday all guns, not merely those of its IRA supporters, had to be removed from Northern Ireland. </P>
<P> Sinn Fein's national chairman Mitchel McLaughlin said this view would be conveyed to British Northern Ireland Minister Michael Ancram by party strategist Martin McGuinness at the first official talks between the two sides in 23 years. </P>
<P> He accused Britain of ``posturing'' by insisting that Sinn Fein show willing to take weapons and explosives used by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) out of service in order to gain full entry into the Northern Ireland peace process. </P>
<P> ``There is a considerable amount of posturing on the British government side but Martin McGuinness will, I think, convince the British minister of Sinn Fein's sincerity in relation to the removal of all weapons from the political equation in Ireland.'' </P>
<P> His statement suggested Sinn Fein would try to equate the decommissioning of IRA weapons with the disarming of Britain's 18,000 troops in Northern Ireland, a link Britain has repeatedly dismissed. </P>
<P> Britain says the arms held by the guerrillas, who declared a ceasefire last September, cannot be put on the same basis as those held by security forces to protect the province's 1.5 million people from the threat of guerrilla violence. </P>
<P> McLaughlin was speaking to BBC radio a few hours before McGuinness was due to arrive at Belfast's Stormont parliament buildings for the first official talks between the two sides since a secret 1972 meeting. </P>
<P> McLaughlin said: ``There will be a considerable amount of realism on all sides...a degree of humility on all sides...will help us to make a better job of it in the future.'' </P>
<P> Britain says the talks are only exploratory and refuses to treat Sinn Fein as a fully fledged partner in its two-year search for a lasting Northern Ireland settlement until progress is made towards disarming Europe's best-equipped guerrilla army. </P>
<P> It will be the highest-level contact between the two sides since the IRA called a ceasefire last September to a 25-year war to end British rule of Northern Ireland. </P>
<P> The talks, which are expected to last a few hours, mirror those Ancram has been holding for weeks with so-called Loyalist politicians close to Protestant gunmen who fought to keep the province British until their own ceasefire last October. </P>
<P> Britain says neither group will be treated on the same level as the province's predominantly Protestant and pro-British Unionist mainstream parties while the IRA holds arms that could be used to restart their war at any time. </P>
<P> Ancram said on Tuesday the talks would have a ``very wide agenda,'' suggesting Britain would show willingness to discuss all matters with Sinn Fein, not just arms. </P>
<P> But British Prime Minister John Major, speaking at Moscow celebrations marking the end of World War Two in Europe, said arms had to be close to the top of that agenda. </P>
<P> ``Clearly this means dealing with a range of issues, most obviously the decommissioning of arms,'' Major said after talks in Moscow with his Irish counterpart and partner in the quest for a Northern Ireland settlement, John Bruton. </P>
