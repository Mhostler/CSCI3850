<P>  A coalition of health, consumer and insurance groups Tuesday said that a mood against government regulations should not obliterate the role federal agencies have played in improving people's safety. </P>
<P> ``Agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and Consumer Product Safety Commission have made significant contributions,'' said Stephen Brobeck, chairman of the Coalition for Consumer Health and Safety. </P>
<P> The coalition of 41 consumer, health and insurance groups issues a status report every two years on preventable deaths, injuries and illnesses. </P>
<P> This year's survey, released Tuesday, showed that deaths from car accidents, drunk driving and household accidents have declined significantly. Alcohol and tobacco use have also dropped. </P>
<P> But much more needs to be done, the coalition said. It estimates there annually are still nearly one million preventable deaths, and millions more preventable injuries and illnesses. </P>
<P> In addition to the human suffering, those avoidable tragedies also cost hundreds of billions of dollars, the coalition said. </P>
<P> In some areas, the federation reported clear progress. </P>
<P> Bob Gary, president of personal lines at Allstate Insurance Co., said that alcohol-related traffic fatalities have declined nearly 21 percent in the past 10 years. Among 16 to 21 year olds, the decrease was a striking 60 percent. </P>
<P> ``The bad news is, we still have a lot of work to do. More than 43 percent of all fatal motor vehicle crashes still involve alcohol,'' he said. </P>
<P> But home safety is still ``an enormous challenge,'' the report said. The death rate per 100,000 from injuries caused by consumer products at home rose from 8.2 in 1992 to 8.7 in 1993. </P>
<P> Some of the injuries involved common baby and toddler products, including cribs, baby walkers, strollers, infant carriers and high chairs. </P>
<P> Congressional Republicans have proposed legislation that would roll back many federal regulations and significantly slow down new ones affecting health, the environment and other areas. </P>
