<P>  Two top editors at Gannett Co.'s Des Moines Register have resigned, spotlighting the conflict between corporate pressure for profits and quality journalism, the New York Times reported Wednesday. </P>
<P> Geneva Overholser, one of the nation's best known editors, and her managing editor, David Westphal, resigned Monday, the Times said. </P>
<P> Overholser and Westphal told the Times that they had decided to seek new opportunities and that they were worn down by the responsibilities of running a newspaper. </P>
<P> The two would continue in their jobs until Charles Edwards Jr., the Register's publisher, finds replacements, the paper said. </P>
<P> News professionals told the Times that Overholser made no secret of her growing frustration and disillusionment with the impact of business concerns on the newsroom. </P>
<P> Overholser told the Times that no single incident has pursuaded her to resign, but has spoken publicly about newsrooms facing business pressures during her six-and-a-half-year tenure. </P>
