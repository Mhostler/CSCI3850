<P>  Five British prisoners have formed a pop group called Shredder with hopes of hitting the big time with their brand of jailhouse rock when they are released. </P>
<P> The group was set up under the guidance of prison officer and drummer Graham Burgoyne at Dartmoor prison in southwest England. </P>
<P> The five want to keep the group going when they all get out of prison and they hope to negotiate a record contract. Two of them are due to be released later this year. </P>
<P> ``They won't all get out together but they are hoping to team up gradually. They have done a lot of work which is to their credit and they deserve a chance,'' said Burgoyne. </P>
<P> ``There are no murderers or rapists (among the group), a lot of it is drug offenses and burglary,'' he added. </P>
<P> The group has performed for prisoners in other jails and has also raised $20,000 for charity through concerts. </P>
<P> Burgoyne, who has supplied much of the group's equipment, said the musical venture was good therapy for prisoners. </P>
<P> ``They learn to work together, they learn tolerance and respect for other opinions and the discipline of doing a show,'' he said. </P>
<P> The current line-up is lead singer Zero, who gets out in September, Mark on bass, due out in October, Chris on lead guitar, Jamie on keyboards and Stumpy on rhythm guitar, plus Burgoyne on drums. </P>
