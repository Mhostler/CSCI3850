<P>  The United States is keeping the pressure on North Korea for information about two U.S. Army pilots whose helicopter was forced down after it crossed into that country's airspace. </P>
<P> A visiting congressman acting as a conduit between Washington and Pyongyang on the issue, cancelled scheduled discussions on a recent U.S.-North Korea nuclear pact to press for access to the detained pilots. </P>
<P> North Korea said it shot down the OH-58 reconnaissance helicopter and that the pilots were being questioned for intrusion. </P>
<P> The Defense Department said it was unclear whether the helicopter was shot down or made an emergency landing. </P>
<P> ``We do not know at this time what exactly did take place,'' White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta said on CNN's ``Evans & Novak'' program following Saturday's incident. </P>
<P> He conceded it was extremely unusual for a helicopter to stray over the border -- one of the world's most tense trouble spots for decades. </P>
<P> The Pentagon said the OH-58 was unarmed and on a routine training mission when it strayed over the border with South Korea and went down Saturday about three to four miles north of the demilitarized zone (DMZ) dividing North and South Korea. </P>
<P> Secretary of State Warren Christopher contacted the North Korean U.N. mission and U.S. officials had also talked with Democratic Representative Bill Richardson of New Mexico, who arrived in Pyongyang shortly after the incident for a previously scheduled visit, the Pentagon said. </P>
<P> A spokesman for Richardson, who is a personal friend of President Clinton, said the congressman had asked for ''immediate access'' to the two pilots and stressed that failure to return them ``would have a serious impact on U.S.-North Korean relations.'' </P>
<P> Richardson cancelled all other discussions that were to have taken place on a recent U.S.-North Korea nuclear agreement, said Stu Nagurka, the congressman's spokesman. </P>
<P> Under the agreement signed in Geneva Oct. 21, meant to lessen fears the North was developing nuclear weapons, North Korea promised to halt its nuclear program and replace its graphite reactors with imported modern light-water models. </P>
<P> The United States says the fuel from the new reactors is virtually impossible to divert for bomb-making, unlike the old reactors which the CIA says have already produced enough plutonium for one or two weapons. </P>
<P> Panetta said he could not confirm that the helicopter was carrying reconnaissance equipment but said: ``Normally, helicopters along the DMZ are used for reconnaissance.'' </P>
<P> He said it was ``obviously not'' normal for a U.S. helicopter to be over North Korea. </P>
<P> The Pentagon said that the pilots were on ``a routine training mission'' when they strayed into North Korean airspace and went down. </P>
<P> ``We have indicated very serious concerns to the North Koreans about the welfare of these pilots. We want them returned,'' Panetta said. </P>
<P> The Pentagon identified the helicopter crew as Army Chief Warrant Officers David Hilemon of Clarksville, Tenn., and Bobby Hall of Brooksville, Fla. </P>
<P> The October nuclear agreement ended a two-year crisis over Pyongyang's alleged arms production plans that had led to threats of economic sanctions and warnings of possible military action. </P>
<P> North Korea keeps about 1 million men under arms, some 60 percent of them deployed near the border with the South. The United States has 37,000 troops in South Korea. </P>
