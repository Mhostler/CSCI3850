<P>  A man caused a stir at a U.N. crime conference Saturday when the closed circuit camera system transmitted lifesize pictures of him kissing a woman in the back seats of the main conference hall. </P>
<P> For two minutes the scene appeared on giant banks of television screens dotted around the complex. </P>
<P> ``There was a fat man sitting next to a woman in a dress. First he put his hand on her leg and then he kissed her once. Then the camera moved away,'' one witness said. The names and nationalities of the couple were not available. </P>
<P> ``In general we'd like the participants to stick to the debate,'' U.N. spokesman Tim Wall said. </P>
