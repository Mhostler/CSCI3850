<DATELINE>JAKARTA, May 20 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Indonesia's powerful military, facing a reduced role in the country's parliament, will replace 25 existing legislators in a mid-term reshuffle, the official Antara news agency reported on Saturday. </P>
<P> Brigadier-General Taheri Noer, the military's spokesman in the House of Representatives, was quoted as saying the reshuffle would occur next month. </P>
<P> ``The is a routine rotation. There is no other reason for it,'' Antara quoted Noer as saying. </P>
<P> Five of the new faces would hold the rank of major general, he added. </P>
<P> Armed forces chief General Feisal Tanjung said last month the military was planning to reduce the number of its representatives in parliament to 75, from the current 100 appointees in the 500-seat parliament. </P>
<P> The remaining seats are held by members of the three political parties that contest five-yearly elections. </P>
<P> State Secretary Murdiono has said it was time for Indonesia to cut the number of military legislators and that the government would propose a law to effect the move. </P>
<P> Diplomats have said it was unclear if the planned cut in military seats indicates a further widening in a rift between President Suharto, himself a former army general, and the mainstream armed forces. </P>
<P> Suharto, who has led Indonesia since the 1960s, started courting Islamic interests several years ago as his relationship with sections of the armed forces strained. </P>
