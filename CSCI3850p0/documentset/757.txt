<P> Dole and other Republicans have said they are exercising their right to give opening statements and try to explain to Americans the contents of the 1,400-page Democratic proposal with vast implications for Americans health and economic security. </P>
<P> Dole said it is not a filibuster. But he was asked three times at a news conference when votes would begin and he replied ``soon enough'' ``probably sometime'' and ``not soon.'' </P>
<P> But Democrat Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, who has been trying to get a vote on a two-page amendment on children's health, said the Republicans were undertaking ``a good old fashioned filibuster.''  Mitchell said if he and Dole do not reach an agreement on voting on amendments, he would insist on procedural votes late Monday. </P>
