<P>  Moscow will not decide whether to push ahead with a deal to sell nuclear technology to Iran until a joint Russian-U.S. commission reports on the issue, Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev said Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``For now, a final decision is not being taken and discussion is (still) under way,'' Kozyrev told reporters at the headquarters of Russia's Interfax news agency. </P>
<P> Kozyrev's remarks contrasted with comments made Friday by Nuclear Energy Minister Viktor Mikhailov which suggested Russia was moving forward with plans to sell nuclear reactors to Iran despite a decision to refer the deal to the joint commission. </P>
<P> But Kozyrev played down differences with the Nuclear Energy Ministry over the decision, taken at last week's summit between President Clinton and Russian leader Boris Yeltsin. </P>
<P> ``The Nuclear Energy Ministry has some expertise and why shouldn't it express its opinion? I see no drama here,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``At the Foreign Ministry we have our own approach. I also express this approach. From our point of view, any threat of the spread of nuclear weapons must be ruled out entirely.'' </P>
<P> Kozyrev said the final decision would rest with Yeltsin. The joint commission, headed by Vice President Al Gore and Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, is due to report its findings by July 7. </P>
<P> The United States says the $1 billion deal to help Tehran build a nuclear power station at Bushehr on the Persian Gulf coast would help Iran acquire atomic weapons. Kozyrev again denied this. </P>
<P> Washington has particularly opposed plans to sell Iran a gas centrifuge system that could be used to enrich urnaium. </P>
<P> Yeltsin agreed at the summit to scrap any sale of the centrifuge, although Moscow had not previously said it was planning to sell this particular equipment to Tehran. </P>
<P> Kozyrev told a closed parliamentary hearing earlier Tuesday that the Nuclear Energy Ministry had made a deal of its own over the gas centrifuge system, a legislator who attended the hearing told Reuters. </P>
<P> The legislator, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Kozyrev had told the Foreign Affairs Commission nobody outside the Nuclear Energy Ministry had known about the separate deal. </P>
<P> ``Andrei Kozyrev underlined that nobody outside the Nuclear Energy Ministry was aware of this plan -- not even Boris Yeltsin,'' the legislator said. </P>
