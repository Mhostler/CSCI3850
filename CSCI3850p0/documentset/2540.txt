<P>  Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, calling for a gradual easing of United Nations sanctions on Baghdad, demanded an ``adequate'' U.N. response to Iraq's decision to recognize Kuwait. </P>
<P> ``Russia will work so that the U.N. Security Council will at its next session react adequately to the real, strong political step taken by Iraq,'' Itar-Tass news agency quoted Kozyrev as saying late Thursday after leaving Baghdad. </P>
<P> Kozyrev, speaking to reporters during his return flight to Moscow after attending the session of parliament at which Iraq recognized Kuwait, said it would take time for mistrust of Iraq to fade. ``But the sun is already shining and its rays give hope that warmer days are to come,'' he said. </P>
<P> He reiterated that Russia, which led international efforts to persuade Iraq to recognize Kuwait, wanted sanctions eased and offered Russian support for Iraq. </P>
<P> ``In the case of Iraq, it should be quite possible to lift the blockade step-by-step,'' Tass quoted him as saying. </P>
<P> ``Under present conditions, Russia is prepared to offer its support to Iraq, now that Baghdad has changed its policy and confirmed this by specific constructive steps in complying with the U.N. resolutions.'' </P>
