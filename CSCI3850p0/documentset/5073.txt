<DATELINE>ABUJA, Nigeria (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter met Nigeria leader Gen. Sani Abacha on Tuesday amid expectations he was to press for the release of Nigeria's former military ruler Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo. </P>
<P> Carter, who is in Nigeria on a program to eradicate guinea worm disease, flew to the capital Abuja Monday and met foreign ministry officials Tuesday ahead of talks in the afternoon with Abacha, official sources said. </P>
<P> Obasanjo is being detained in the wake of a plot to overthrow Abacha. </P>
<P> ``He (Carter) served notice of his willingness to intervene when he met government functionaries last night,'' one official said, adding ``I believe he will be taking that up when he meets Abacha today.'' </P>
<P> No details were immediately available on Carter's meeting with Abacha. But Carter was due to hold a news conference Wednesday morning in Abuja. </P>
<P> Obasanjo's arrest last week has been widely condemned abroad, especially in the United States where the influential African-American lobby group TransAfrica has called for his freedom and a quick return to civil rule. </P>
<P> The Transafrica campaign, which includes leading African-Americans, includes a call to stop buying Nigerian oil. </P>
<P> Analysts said the move by TransAfrica to pressure Abacha into restoring democracy was likely to make the already difficult job of attracting foreign investors to Nigeria even tougher. </P>
<P> Washington-based TransAfrica, which boasts politicians, actors and writers as members, in 1984 played a major role in building U.S. public sentiment in favor of sanctions against the white-minority government in South Africa. More recently it heightened public awareness of conditions in Haiti. </P>
<P> Abacha seized power in November 1993 during the crisis triggered by the annulment of the election, which was widely believed to have been won by Moshood Abiola, a wealthy businessman now in detention. </P>
<P> The government is yet to announce a timetable for its promised transition to civilian rule. It says it is waiting for the report of a constitutional conference framing a new charter. </P>
<P> Local newspapers quoted Randall Robinson, TransAfrica's executive director, as saying the group was pressing the U.S. government to impose economic sanctions on Nigeria, including an embargo on the country's crude oil. </P>
<P> Oil accounts for more than 90 percent of Nigeria's foreign exchange income and the United States is its biggest buyer. </P>
