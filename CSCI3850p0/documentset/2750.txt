<P>  South Africa's black police minister Sydney Mufamadi said Monday that two white traffic officers had apologized for being rude when they fined him for illegal parking. </P>
<P> The officers, apparently unaware of who he was, ticketed the minister in the traditional Afrikaner bastion of Pretoria last month when he double-parked to go into a fast food outlet. </P>
<P> Mufamadi at the time accused the officers of insulting him and brought charges against them. </P>
<P> But he said in a statement that the officers and a senior representative of the Pretoria traffic department had apologized during a meeting Monday. </P>
<P> ``I was given the undertaking there would be no repeat of similar conduct by members of the Pretoria traffic department.'' </P>
<P> Mufamadi said he would still pay the $60 fine for illegal parking, but hoped a second fine of $90 imposed for his alleged refusal to disclose his address would be dropped. </P>
