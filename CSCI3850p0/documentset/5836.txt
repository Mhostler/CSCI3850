<P>  Japanese trade negotiators warned on Tuesday they might pull out of talks with the United States over car trading if their U.S. counterparts announce retaliatory action as a lever in negotiations. </P>
<P> Both U.SS and Japanese negotiators indicated there had made little progress in two days of apparently divisive talks over the huge Japanese car market. </P>
<P> ``If the U.S. government should announce retaliation against Japan in an effort to create negotiating leverage, we may be forced to suspend negotiations and proceed immediately to the WTO (World Trade Organization),'' a Japanese position paper released to reporters, said. </P>
<P> However, the Japanese officials said that while there had been little progress and they remained neither pessimistic nor optimistic about the outlook, the talks at a lower level would continue until at least Thursday. </P>
<P> But it was clear that the two sides remained far apart on the main issues -- car dealerships and the sale of parts in Japan -- which the Japanese argue are open to foreign competition already. </P>
<P> At a separate but simultaneous U.S. briefing, U.S. Commerce Undersecretary Jeffrey Garten said there had been no breakthrough in the talks and the two sides still had ``a long way to go.'' </P>
