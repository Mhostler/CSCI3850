<P>  Vice President Al Gore began a three-day visit to Moscow Wednesday to discuss joint efforts in space, energy and other development projects. </P>
<P> There was no indication whether Gore discussed the fighting in the breakaway region of Chechnya, where Russian troops are engaged in their biggest military operation since the 10-year Afghan conflict. </P>
<P> Gore said he was optimistic before the fourth meeting of the Russian-American Commission on Economic and Technological Cooperation which he jointly heads with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. </P>
<P> ``We are well prepared to work and in a very optimistic mood,'' Gore was quoted as saying by the Itar-Tass news agency after being met by Chernomyrdin. </P>
<P> ``During the previous sessions we managed to achieve positive results in the interests of both the Russian and the American people. And we are looking forward to continuing this work.'' </P>
<P> Gore wants to work out final details of long-planned U.S.-Russian joint efforts in space during his trip. </P>
<P> Plans include the launch in February of an American shuttle which will maneuver close to the Russian space station Mir and sending up an American astronaut in a Russian rocket in March to work on Mir. </P>
<P> U.S. officials have said they expect problems over Russian customs controls and questions about safety to be worked out and plan to discuss joint unmanned exploration of Mars. </P>
<P> Other issues for discussion will include energy, health, defense conversion and the environment, U.S. officials said, but gave no details. </P>
<P> Gore hopes also to meet President Boris Yeltsin but said the meeting depended on whether the Russian leader had recovered from a minor operation on his nose. </P>
