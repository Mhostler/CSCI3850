<P>  A British transvestite lost his bid to wear a skirt at work Friday when an industrial tribunal rejected his claim that his employers' dress code was discriminatory. </P>
<P> ``I feel oppressed, I feel denied the liberties to which I am entitled to in this country,'' Paul Cara, a London social work official, told British radio. </P>
<P> Cara, who is married, was able to wear leggings, tights and blouses to work but his bosses drew the line when he turned up in a skirt. He said their objections were discriminatory as women were allowed to wear pant suits and ties to the office. </P>
<P> ``We don't feel that having a male employee dressed in women's clothing in a building which our visitors and partners are coming to presents the council in the way we want to,'' Ian Wilson, deputy director of the London borough of Hackney's social services department, said. </P>
<P> The tribunal said women's pants suits remained female clothing, even though they were modeled on male attire. </P>
<P> Cara described himself as a man with some female characteristics rather than a man who wanted to be a woman. </P>
