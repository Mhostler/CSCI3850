<DATELINE>DAVAO, Philippines, April 24 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A Russian circus has been stranded in the southern Philippines after their Filipino sponsor abandoned them, a Roman Catholic priest said on Monday. </P>
<P> Jack Walsh, director of a Catholic centre for seafarers in Davao province, told reporters the group has been living on donations for more than a week. </P>
<P> The group of 15 Russians and its 20 circus animals could not leave because they had no money and their Filipino promoter is holding their travel documents. </P>
<P> The group's leader, Boris Fedotov, said they have not been able to contact the promoter since April 11. The promoter owes them at least $63,000, he said. </P>
<P> Fedotov's group arrived in Davao city, 970 km (600 miles) south of Manila, last month. They have been in the country eight months. </P>
<P> Their animals -- two camels, seven bears, an elephant, a puma, a kangaroo, a pony, two Saint Bernard dogs, a llama, a python and three trained chickens -- are being kept in a gymnasium outside the city. </P>
