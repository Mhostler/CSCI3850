<DATELINE>DURBAN, South Africa (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Nine people were shot and killed in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province on Thursday's Freedom Day, but police said Friday it was not clear whether any of the murders were politically motivated. </P>
<P> Five people were killed in three separate incidents in Durban's Umlazi township and four in other areas of the province, police said, adding the motives were not known. </P>
<P> ``Five people were killed and five were wounded in Umlazi,'' police spokesman Lt.-Col. Bala Naidoo told Reuters, adding the township was calm Friday. </P>
<P> Police said the number of killings was not unusually high for the province, heartland of South Africa's nine million Zulus where Zulu chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party holds political power. </P>
<P> About 20,000 Zulus loyal to Inkatha marched peacefully through Durban on Freedom Day, the anniversary of South Africa's first all-race elections, in protest at the ruling ANC's failure to honour a deal over international mediation on the country's post-apartheid national constitution. </P>
<P> Political violence has fallen dramatically since Nelson Mandela was elected president a year ago after 10,000 people were killed in the preceding four years. </P>
<P> But criminal violence, in which 50 people were killed very day in 1994, has soared. </P>
