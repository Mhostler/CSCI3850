<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Declaring that he was not some foreign predator, media baron Rupert Murdoch threatened Monday to act like any true-blue American and sue like crazy if the Federal Communications Commission tried to strip him of his Fox TV empire. </P>
<P> Murdoch, the chairman of News Corp. Ltd., an Australian company, and a former Australian citizen, told a news conference that he never misled U.S. regulators over foreign equity ownership of Fox. </P>
<P> He said that he, as an American citizen, had control of Fox even though its profits would go to News Corp., which put up the capital in 1985 to finance the establishment of a fourth U.S. television network. </P>
<P> ``I am an American. You may not like it but you'd better accept it,'' Murdoch said as he brushed aside challenges to the legality of News Corp. ownership of the fourth U.S. network. </P>
<P> ``I am an American, and I am very much in control of our stations,'' he said.  Caught up in an FCC inquiry into whether or not News Corp. misled U.S. regulators on the fact it was 99 percent foreign-owned, Murdoch said it was stated repeatedly in its decade-old filings with regulators that most of the money for the Fox network would come from the Australian company. </P>
<P> U.S. rules limits foreigners to owning not more than 25 percent of a U.S. television station. </P>
<P> Murdoch said control, and not economic benefit, were the main concern of the FCC and he produced statements from past FCC employees saying that was made clear at the time. </P>
<P> Murdoch said he expected the FCC was unlikely to move beyond a preliminary staff study but that if it did hold a hearing, the proceedings could last years and he would fight every step of the way. </P>
<P> ``If the FCC wants to hold a kangeroo court, we will go to a real court. We could get our revenge by making Fox No. 1,'' Murdoch said. </P>
<P> Murdoch produced an outside lawyer's analysis of his 1985 filings that stated they were frank and proper. </P>
<P> Murdoch and News Corp. last week suffered a setback in their FCC dispute when a top regulator involved in the 1985 proceedings said in a sworn statement that he had not been aware that the money for the venture had come from an Australian company. </P>
<P> Murdoch said the official, Roy Stewart, had made no accusation that News Corp. had misled the FCC. The official may not have seen the documents spelling out News Corp.'s financial role, Murdoch said. </P>
<P> Murdoch said he feared an extended FCC fight could slow Fox's expansion but said business had not yet been affected. </P>
