<P>  More than 22 million people have been killed in conflicts since World War II ended in 1945, a book published Thursday said. </P>
<P> Despite the collapse of Communism and the end of the Cold War there are more civil wars, guerrilla insurgencies and territorial disputes going on now than at any time this century. </P>
<P> And they are costing Western nations more than governments may think, says the book, entitled ``The Cost of Conflict.'' </P>
<P> Published by Saferworld, a foreign affairs think-tank based in Bristol, England, the book examines seven major trouble spots and analyses the costs not only to the groups and governments involved, but to Western countries. </P>
<P> Governments must not only act sooner to prevent wars, but they must curtail the international arms trade and show more resolution in standing up for human rights, the book concluded. </P>
<P> ``One priority is to change the order in which we approach international diplomacy so that preventing conflict becomes the first priority...and the second is to come to grips with the arms trade,'' Lord Judd, a former British defense minister and overseas development minister, told a news conference. </P>
<P> For instance, the West almost certainly helped cause the Gulf War by arming Iraq for years, the book says. </P>
<P> ``The West's attitude of selling weapons to a regime they believed they could control backfired dangerously in 1990,'' the book says. ``This should provide a lesson in reality for these arms suppliers.'' </P>
