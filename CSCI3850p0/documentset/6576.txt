<P>  Mary Decker Slaney, America's star-crossed premier middle distance runner, still hopes next year's Olympics will end 20 years of personal disappointments. </P>
<P> ``It's not impossible,'' said the 36-year-old Slaney of her chances to win the Olympic 5,000-meters in Atlanta. </P>
<P> Slaney, who says she has not run a track race since the summer of 1992, spoke at a news conference Monday that marked the 10th anniversary of her triumph as the overall winner of the first IAAF Mobil Grand Prix outdoor track series. </P>
<P> Only losing at the 1984 and 1988 Olympics as well as missing the 1976 and 1992 Games due to injuries and being a member of the U.S. team which boycotted the 1980 Games tarnish Slaney's glittering career. </P>
<P> ``I still feel it is not complete,'' said Slaney, the holder of two world indoor records and nine American indoor and outdoor distances. </P>
<P> ``What drives me to want to still be the best is that I haven't succeeded at certain things, like the Olympics. </P>
<P> ``Most of the people in the sport who know me and who know the sport would like to see success at the end of the rainbow for me.'' </P>
<P> Slaney knows, though, that her gold medal hopes could be stopped at any moment by her fragile fitness. </P>
<P> In recent years she has had trouble just getting to the starting line due to 20 surgeries for a variety of leg, foot, and ankle problems. </P>
<P> ``I think if I was a betting person I would bet against myself. It would be a long shot, but to me it doesn't seem that way,'' said Slaney, who had surgery on her right foot just 10 days ago which she expects will prevent her from serious competition until August. </P>
<P> ``It's like I can do this, like I want to do this. </P>
<P> ``The desire is there. I think the ability is there, I just have to get everything together at the right time. </P>
<P> ``It would be special.'' </P>
