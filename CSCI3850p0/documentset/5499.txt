<DATELINE>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Michael Jordan scored 30 of his 37 points in the second half as the Chicago Bulls won their season-high fifth straight game Wednesday, 108-101 over the reeling New Jersey Nets. </P>
<P> Jordan made just 2-of-13 shots in the first half but scored Chicago's first seven points of the fourth quarter as the Bulls grabbed a 92-86 lead. </P>
<P> The Nets closed within 102-100 with 2:25 to play but got no closer. Jordan's driving layup with 27 seconds left sealed the victory. </P>
<P> ``It was our game to win,'' Jordan said. ``It's really not how you begin a game but how you end it. I haven't really played a good 48-minute game since the New York game (when he scored 55 points). </P>
<P> ``I just have to keep pushing myself to get back to the standards that I'm used to. I had to keep shooting until I could get something going.'' </P>
<P> B.J. Armstrong scored 16 points and Scottie Pippen added 15 as Chicago moved into sole possession of fifth place in the Eastern Conference. </P>
<P> Armon Gilliam scored 27 points with 16 rebounds and Kenny Anderson added 21 points and 15 assists for the Nets, who were playing without injured starters Derrick Coleman and Chris Morris. New Jersey has lost five straight games and nine of the last 10 to fall out of realistic playoff contention. </P>
<P> Coleman has missed the last two games with a strained left wrist, while Morris was placed on the injured list with a strained left hamstring earlier in the day. </P>
<P> ``We gave the effort tonight, we just lost our composure down the stretch,'' said Nets coach Butch Beard. ``The team, the organization and the coaching staff is frustrated with this whole season. We just seem to be finding really strange ways to lose. It's tough on everybody.'' </P>
<P> In Orlando, Dennis Scott scored 17 of his 30 points in the fourth quarter as the Magic rallied from an 18-point deficit for a 128-125 triumph over the Detroit Pistons. </P>
<P> Shaquille O'Neal had 40 points and 19 rebounds for the Magic, who have won six of their last eight games. </P>
<P> Joe Dumars scored 41 points and Allan Houston 28 for the Pistons, who have lost three of their last four games. </P>
<P> In Milwaukee, Patrick Ewing scored 34 points and grabbed 18 rebounds as the New York Knicks rolled to a 114-94 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks. </P>
<P> Glenn Robinson scored 22 points and Vin Baker added 18 points and 12 rebounds for the Bucks, who have lost four of their last five games to continue to fade from the Eastern Conference playoff picture. </P>
<P> At Indiana, Rik Smits scored 29 points and grabbed 10 rebounds as the Pacers sent the Washington Bullets to their eighth straight defeat 102-90. </P>
<P> The Pacers remained a half-game back of New York for second place in the Eastern Conference and three games ahead of Charlotte for first place in the Central Division. </P>
<P> Calbert Cheaney scored 19 points and Chris Webber added 18 points and 14 rebounds for the Bullets. </P>
<P> In Dallas, Jason Kidd recorded his first career triple-double with 19 points, 12 assists, and 10 rebounds to help the Mavericks snap an eight-game losing streak against the Los Angeles Lakers with a 130-111 victory. </P>
<P> Jamal Mashburn scored 32 points and Lorenzo Williams chipped in with a career-high 19 points and 15 rebounds for the Mavericks, who have won 10 of their last 13 games. </P>
<P> Nick Van Exel had 24 points and Eddie Jones scored 22 for the Lakers, who had their three-game winning streak snapped. </P>
<P> In Atlanta, Andrew Lang had 18 points and 13 rebounds while Steve Smith and Grant Long each added 18 points to power the Hawks to a 96-87 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers. </P>
<P> The Hawks ended a two-game losing streak and won for only the third time in their last nine games. </P>
<P> John Williams had 14 points to lead for the Cavaliers, who have dropped three straight games and five of their last six. </P>
<P> In Charlotte, Alonzo Mourning scored 16 points and grabbed 11 rebounds as the Hornets beat the Philadelphia 76ers 84-66. </P>
<P> Shawn Bradley had 21 points and 13 rebounds for the Sixers, who have lost three straight. Dana Barros extended his streak with one 3-pointer made to 49 games. </P>
<P> The teams combined for the second lowest amount of points in a quarter in NBA history when the Hornets outscored the Sixers 11-8 in the second quarter. </P>
<P> The 19 points were one better than the record of 18 set by the Fort Wayne Pistons and Syracuse Nationals in the first quarter of a game in 1956. </P>
<P> The 76ers' 66 points marked the team's lowest output since it moved to Philadlephia. </P>
