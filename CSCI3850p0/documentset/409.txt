<P>  Following is the text of King Hussein of Jordan's speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday. He spoke in the House of Representatives' chamber at 11:10 a.m. EDT. </P>
<P> Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, honored guests, members of Congress, ladies and gentlemen, it is an honor for me to stand before you, the representatives of the great American nation, on this historic occasion. </P>
<P> We have now become partners in shaping the future of all our peoples. We seek for them a future of peace, stability and security, the prospects for which are growing before our eyes. It is a heartwarming sight for those of us who have continuously pursued this goal throughout our lives. </P>
<P> We in Jordan have always sought a bold peace. We have been conscious of our responsibilities towards the coming generations to ensure that they will have the certainty of leading a dignified and fulfilled life. We have sought a peace that can harness the creative energies to allow them to realize their true potential and build their future with confidence, devoid of fear and uncertainty. None of this can be achieved without establishing a direct dialogue at the highest level of leadership. </P>
<P> This meeting in Washington, at the invitation of President Clinton, represents the beginning of a new phase in our common journey towards peace between Jordan and Israel. </P>
<P> It is a milestone on the road toward comprehensive peace in our region. This meeting was preceded by a trilateral Jordanian-American-Israeli meeting at which my brother, Crown Prince Hassan, represented myself and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres represented Israel. </P>
<P> The trilateral working group was established under an agreement completed at the meeting hosted by President Clinton at the White House in October 1993. </P>
<P> Following my recent visit to the United States, in light of the status of negotiations, I decided to share with my people the realities affecting our search for peace. In a meeting with members of our parliament, I addressed the entire Jordanian nation. I have been rewarded by their approval and support. Their expression of confidence has always been the foremost consideration in my life. All of Jordan is here with me today. </P>
<P> We also remember today the three generations of gallant Jordanians and so many others who sacrificed themselves for the cause of Palestine. Every household in Jordan has sent a son to answer the Arab call. Many have not returned. Their sacrifice has made it possible for me to be here today. </P>
<P> My family has also paid a heavy price. My great grandfather, the leader of the great Arab revolt for freedom, independence and unity, lies buried next to the blessed al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. I was by the side of my grandfather, King Abdullah, at the doors of al-Aqsa Mosque when he was martyred. He was a man of peace who gave his life for this ideal. I have pledged my life to fulfilling his dream. He, too, is here today. </P>
<P> Mr. Speaker, at our meeting today I hope you will find a clear message to the American nation and to the world. </P>
<P> We are, together, committed to work tirelessly, to banish forever the abnormal conditions which have dominated our people's lives. We want normality and humanity to become the prevailing order. </P>
<P> Although we have labored for so long under conditions of hostility, I am certain that we can see these conditions for what they are: emblems of an unnatural and sinister state. We have all known the portents of the state -- the fear of death, the silence of isolation -- and we have all felt the fear that has mesmerized us, preventing us from moving forward to create together a bright future for the coming generations. What we are witnessing today, God willing, is a progression from a state of war to a state of peace. </P>
<P> These unique circumstances allow us to take bold steps. Our meeting now represents a revolt against all that is unnatural. It is unnatural not to have direct and open meetings between our respective officials and their leaders in order to grapple with all aspects of the conflict and, God willing, to resolve them. </P>
<P> It is unnatural not to wish to bridge this gulf across which we have all paid a shattering toll in blood and tears, the waste of our youth, and the grief of our forefathers. We have suffered this loss together, and it will leave its impact on all of us far into the future. </P>
<P> The two Semitic people, the Arabs and the Jews, have endured bitter trials and tribulations during the journey of history. Let us resolve to end this suffering forever and to fulfill our responsibilities as leaders of our peoples and our duty as human beings towards mankind. </P>
<P> I come before you today fully conscious of the need to secure a peace for all the children of Abraham. Our land is the birthplace of the divine faiths and the cradle of the heavenly messages to all humanity. </P>
<P> I also come before you today as a soldier who seeks to bear arms solely in the defense of his homeland, a man who understands the fears of his neighbors and who wishes only to live in peace with them -- a man who wishes to secure democracy, political pluralism and human rights for his nation. </P>
<P> I come before you today encouraged in the knowledge that the prime minister of Israel and his government have responded to the call for peace. They have recognized the Palestinian people and their rights and are negotiating with their chosen leadership in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. </P>
