<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The United States on Monday spearheaded an $18 billion international rescue package for Mexico to help the Latin American nation weather a crisis of confidence in its currency and its economic policies. </P>
<P> In a statement timed to coincide with the announcement of tough new economic measures by the Mexican government, Washington said it was increasing its ``swap'' or credit line with Mexico to $9 billion from $6 billion. </P>
<P> The balance of the $18 billion will be provided by Canada, Spain and other major nations and by a small coterie of international commercial banks, many from the United States. </P>
<P> ``The decision to increase our swap line with Mexico is based on the importance of the U.S.-Mexican economic relationship, the substantial economic reforms that Mexico has undertaken in recent years, and the strong program announced tonight by (Mexico),'' Acting U.S. Treasury Secretary Frank Newman said in a statement. </P>
<P> Faced with a currency crisis that has seen the value of the peso drop by more than 40 percent in the last two weeks, Mexico unveiled a wide-ranging economic plan to contain inflation and regain the confidence of global investors. </P>
<P> The International Monetary Fund, which helps police the global economy, was expected to give its approval to the plan. </P>
<P> The $18 billion support package is designed to give Mexico breathing room as it struggles to put its economic house back in order. </P>
<P> As part of the package, Canada agreed to increase its swap or credit line with Mexico to C$1.5 billion ($1.07 billion U.S.), from C$1 billion ($715 million). The United States, Canada and Mexico forged the North American Free Trade Agreement a year ago to strengthen economic ties. </P>
<P> Spain and other major nations are kicking in an additional $5 billion to the package, funneling the money through the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland, which acts as a central bank for the world's central bankers. </P>
<P> The balance of the $3 billion will come from international commercial banks, led by Citibank and Morgan Guaranty of the United States. </P>
<P> The economic crisis in Mexico has sent shivers throughout Latin America but its impact on the United States should be small. The steep plunge of the peso means that goods imported from Mexico should be that much cheaper for Americans to buy. But U.S. exports to Mexico will suffer. </P>
<P> Illegal immigration into the United States from Mexico could also increase as the Latin American nation's tough economic measures begin to bite. </P>
<P> The $9 billion U.S. credit line is being jointly financed by the Treasury Department and by the Federal Reserve. </P>
<P> The Treasury money will come from its Exchange Stabilization Fund and thus does not require congressional approval. The fund was established to allow the United States to react quickly to emergencies in currency markets. </P>
<P> The Treasury said all drawings on the credit lines will have assured means of repayment. That means they will be backed up by collateral. </P>
<P> If Mexico draws on the credit line, it basically must repay the money within six months. The interest charge on the short-term loan is equivalent to the three-month U.S. Treasury bill rate. </P>
