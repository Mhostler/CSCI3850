<P> Standing before weeping relatives of those killed nearly half a century ago, Lee added that the incident could have been avoided. </P>
<P> ``As the head of state, bearing the burden of mistakes made by the government and expressing the most sincere apology, I believe that with your forgiving hearts, we are able to transform the sadness into harmony and peace,'' Lee said. </P>
<P> ``(I) have felt extremely sad and sorry for the incident that could have been avoided but still happened and could have been prevented from spreading but still spread,'' he added, standing in a park next to the presidential palace in Taipei. </P>
<P> All over this island of 21 million people, hundreds gathered to mourn and remember. At Soochow University in Taipei over 100 people, many weeping, attended a commemorative concert. </P>
<P> The incident, in which Nationalist soldiers from China crushed rioting by native Taiwanese, strikes at the heart of one of Taiwan's greatest disharmonies -- ill-feeling between the native Taiwanese majority and an elite which came from China. </P>
<P> The Nationalists took control of the island after Japanese occupation ended in 1945 and the late Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek moved his entire government here in 1949 after losing a civil war on China's mainland. </P>
<P> Lee, who is Taiwan's first native-born president but also chairman of the ruling Nationalist Party, echoed appeals he made in local elections last year for harmony between all types of people. </P>
<P> Two more electoral tests are imminent. The Legislative Yuan, parliament, will be chosen late this year and the island's first presidential elections are slated for March 1996. </P>
<P> Talking after Lee's speech, one victim's relative, Lin Chung-yi, said: ``President Lee's speech is the most precious present to all relatives of the victims.'' </P>
<P> In 1993, the Cabinet approved compensation of up to Taiwan 190,111 each to relatives of victims in the incident which the government estimated in 1992 killed at least 18,000 people. </P>
<P> The compensation, awaiting new parliamentary legislation, has yet to be paid. </P>
<P> A legislator for the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which derives its following mainly from native Taiwanese, said Lee's apology did not go far enough. </P>
<P> ``It is a positive step but it does not go far enough. We want a clear explanation of what happened and why it happened. This has not yet been given,'' said DPP legislator Yao Chia-wen by telephone. </P>
