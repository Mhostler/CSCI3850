<P>  The Philippines said on Tuesday it may allow a second media tour of the disputed Spratly islands despite warnings by China the first was a provocation that should not be repeated. </P>
<P> ``We are willing to bring another batch or more of our Manila-based reporters and foreign journalists to the Spratlys depending on the demand and the level of interest,'' Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon told reporters. </P>
<P> A May 11-17 tour organised by the Philippine Defence Ministry for 38 journalists sparked a row between Manila and Beijing. </P>
<P> China denounced the trip as a violation of Chinese sovereignty, but President Fidel Ramos brushed aside the protest. </P>
<P> Two Chinese ships harassed the Philippine navy ship carrying the journalists near Mischief Reef, which was occupied by China last February but is also claimed by Manila. </P>
<P> Ramos sent a special envoy to Beijing in a bid to defuse the tension caused by the confrontation in the area. </P>
<P> Siazon said another trip by journalists to the Spratlys would help promote understanding of the dispute over the potentially oil-rich cluster of reefs in the South China Sea. </P>
<P> The Spratlys are claimed in whole or in part by China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan, Brunei and the Philippines. </P>
