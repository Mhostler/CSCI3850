<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Tennis star Vitas Gerulaitis' weekend death was an accident caused by carbon monoxide gas leaking into a ritzy beach cottage where he slept, police said Tuesday. </P>
<P> The statement by police in the posh Southampton Village resort on Long Island ended a two-day mystery about what had caused the athlete's death. </P>
<P> Gerulaitis was found dead in a friend's home after living a fast life that included admitted past bouts with drugs. </P>
<P> Preliminary results from an autopsy conducted by the Suffolk County medical examiner's office Monday turned up no apparent cause of death, but the examiner found his blood was saturated with carbon monoxide. </P>
<P> ``The levels of carbon monoxide were in the mid-70 percent range,'' said Dr Stuart Dawson, acting chief medical examiner in Suffolk County. ``The general rule of thumb is over 50 percent in the bloodstream is deadly.'' </P>
<P> Police said a faulty heating and air-conditioning system was to blame, pumping the deadly gas into the cottage where he stayed over the weekend. </P>
<P> Although the gas was not apparent when the police were called to the house Sunday, when the tennis star was found, they returned to the cottage late Monday after the autopsy was conducted. </P>
<P> ``A level of carbon monoxide found inside the cottage was so high that investigators were forced out of the structure,'' the police statment said. </P>
<P> Southampton Police Detective David Betts said that it was still unknown what caused the apparent gas leak in the heating and cooling system in the basement or how it seaped into a first-floor room where Gerulaitis slept. </P>
<P> ``I have not been able to determine what piece of equipment caused the gas,'' he said. ``It's hard to determine because it is an odorless and colorless gas.'' </P>
<P> Gerulaitis was found shortly after 3 p.m. EDT Sunday in a summer retreat belonging to his friend, real estate developer Martin Raynes. The house was in Southampton, a summer resort frequented by the rich and well known. </P>
<P> The tennis great had played a celebrity tournament Saturday and then returned to the cottage. He was last seen at 5 p.m. EDT Saturday and missed an evening dinner engagement. </P>
<P> Reacting to his death, officials of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said carbon monoxide fatalities are all too common and avoidable tragedies in the United States where 250 people die each year and another 5,000 people are treated in hospital emergency rooms. </P>
<P> Dawson, the medical examiner, said he sees about one death a year in Suffolk County from carbon monoxide poisoning. </P>
<P> Carbon monoxide is produced when fuel is burned with incomplete combustion. The commission is urging that carbon monoxide detectors, costing about $30 and up, be installed. The detectors sound an alarm, much like a smoke detector detects smoke. </P>
<P> Gerulaitis emerged from the public courts of the New York boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens to become the third-ranked tennis player in the world. He was never out of the top 10 from 1977 to 1983 before retiring in 1985. </P>
<P> Gerulaitis won his only Grand Slam title when he defeated Briton John Lloyd in the final of the 1977 Australian Open. </P>
<P> Off court, the shaggy-haired, quick-witted Gerulaitis was a fixture in Studio 54, then the center of the frenetic New York disco nightlife of the 1970s. </P>
<P> In 1983, a federal grand jury voted against indicting him on a charge of conspiring to take part in a cocaine deal. Gerulaitis later confessed to taking cocaine in the 1970s and admitted drugs and late-night partying had affected his game. </P>
<P> After retirement, Gerulaitis worked as a television analyst and last year took up tennis again, playing several tournaments on the senior circuit along with Connors and McEnroe. </P>
