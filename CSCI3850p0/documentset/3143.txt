<DATELINE>DUBLIN (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Renewed controversy about a child abuse case that brought down the Irish government threatened to undermine attempts Monday to forge a new three-party coalition. </P>
<P> Irish Labor leader Dick Spring, who walked out on his Fianna Fail coalition partners over the case, denied charges that he had misled the public over how much he knew. </P>
<P> He accused Fianna Fail figures of spreading ``black propaganda'' and said there appeared to be an attempt to wreck talks between Labor, Fine Gael and the Democratic Left on forming a new government this week. </P>
<P> ``I think this is another attempt to stop the government being formed,'' Spring told Irish radio, but added: ``I think there is a good prospect of putting together what will be a viable government for this country this week.'' </P>
<P> The political vacuum in Dublin is expected to slow the pace of an Anglo-Irish attempt to launch new all-party talks to solve the 25-year Northern Ireland conflict. </P>
<P> Spring walked out of talks with Fianna Fail on forming a new government one week ago after prime minister Albert Reynolds admitted allegations that he had asked former Attorney-General Harry Whelehan to resign over the handling of the abuse case. </P>
<P> But Fianna Fail says Spring was told by Reynolds two weeks earlier that he was trying to get Whelehan to resign. </P>
<P> Acting Justice Minister Maire Geoghehan-Quinn, a leading Fianna Fail figure, said she could not understand Spring's statement. ``I can't understand that for the life of me.'' </P>
<P> Political sources said the dispute seemed likely to rumble on and that the likelihood of the three parties forming a new right-left ``rainbow coalition'' this week seemed to be fading. </P>
<P> Ireland has been without a majority government for almost one month and Fianna Fail is running affairs in a caretaker capacity with Reynolds the acting prime minister and Bertie Ahern, the new party chief, its finance and foreign minister. </P>
<P> Spring broke off talks with Ahern on forming a new coalition with Fianna Fail when the Irish Times reported that secret attempts to get Whelehan to resign had been made. </P>
