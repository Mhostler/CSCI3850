<P>  The United Nations refugee agency resettled 120 Iraqi civilians from Kuwait to third countries in the first four months of 1995, a U.N. official said on Monday. </P>
<P> Another 23 Iraqis will leave shortly under the resettlement programme, Mustapha Omar, chief of mission in Kuwait for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), said by telephone, confirming a report in the English-language Arab Times. </P>
<P> Some of the resettled Iraqis crossed the Iraq-Kuwait border after the 1991 Gulf War to seek asylum, while others had been residents of the emirate, Omar said. </P>
<P> Hundreds of Iraqis have crossed the border after the 1991 conflict to flee worsening conditions in Iraq, which is under a strict U.N. economic sanctions imposed to punish Baghdad for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. </P>
<P> Omar declined to disclose the total number of Iraqis his office has helped resettle to third countries since the war. </P>
<P> The newspaper said the UNHCR resettled 40 Iraqis in Britain, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands and Denmark between January and March. In April, another 30 were resettled in New Zealand, 48 in the Netherlands and two in Denmark. </P>
<P> Twenty-three Iraqis would leave soon to Australia, Switzerland, Canada and the Netherlands. </P>
<P> Kuwaiti authorities held asylum seekers in detention while their cases were studied but gave the UNHCR full access to them at all times, Omar said. Kuwait does not accept Iraqi asylum seekers for resettlement in Kuwait. </P>
<P> Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 after months of disputes about the border, Iraqi debt to Kuwait and oil production policy. A U.S.-led multinational alliance ousted Iraqi troops in 1991. </P>
