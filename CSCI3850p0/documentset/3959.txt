<P>  Haiti is to ask the international community for swift and concrete action in delivering a promised $660 million assistance package, Prime Minister Smarck Michel said Wednesday. </P>
<P> Just hours before setting off for Paris to address a meeting of foreign bankers, Michel said the quick approval of pledged aid was vital if impoverished Haiti was to develop and put its long history of poverty and misery behind it. </P>
<P> The meeting has been called to allow representatives of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Inter-American Development Bank and overseas governments to ratify a $660 million reconstruction program agreed with Haiti late last year. </P>
<P> ``They promised it,'' he said. ``Now they are going to decide it and that's why Paris is important.'' </P>
<P> The money, the bulk of a huge five-year reconstruction plan for the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation, has been set aside for hundreds of projects covering all aspects of life, such as education, health, infastructure and government. </P>
<P> International donors, including the United States, promised Haiti an enormous aid package upon the return of democratically elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who lived in exile for three years after being deposed in a military coup. He was returned to power last October with the help of an American military intervention. </P>
<P> Some of the initial programs outlined in the reconstruction plan have began already, even though the arrival of the promised cash has been slow. </P>
<P> ``They promised ... that if we started implementing this program they would help,'' Michel said. ``I have done everything they asked for. Now they have to deliver so I can follow on.'' </P>
<P> Michel is to be accompanied on his trip by Planning Minister Jean-Marie Cherestal, Finance Minister Marie-Michele Rey and Central Bank Governor Leslie Delatour. </P>
<P> Cherestal is also to visit Brussels to meet with European union leaders and Michel is to stop in Washington on his way back for consultations with American officials. </P>
<P> Michel also said Justice Minister Ernest Malebranche would stay on in his post until a replacement could be found. Malebranche, 79, resigned Tuesday. </P>
