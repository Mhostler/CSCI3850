<P>  The United States and South Korea could defeat a North Korean attack, but the cost would be high, U.S. military officials told Congress Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``Today, as in the past, a Republic of Korea-U.S. combined defense team stands ready to successfully counter any offensive military or terrorist action by North Korea,'' Gen. Gary Luck, the commander of U.S. forces in South Korea, said at a hearing of the House National Security Committee. </P>
<P> But Luck added: ``The loss of life and infrastructure would be horrific.'' </P>
<P> Luck and Adm. Richard Macke, commander-in-chief of the U.S. Pacific Command, said North Korea remained a dangerous and unpredictable nation. </P>
<P> ``Even though their nuclear program is currently capped, the North remains a dangerous conventional threat, with over a million individuals under arms and 65-70 percent of those forces within 100 km (60 mi) of the Demilitarized Zone. They have deployed a tremendous artillery capability along the DMZ and within range of Seoul,'' Macke said. </P>
<P> ``We must be careful not to give them the perception that their survival is threatened -- if that happens they might lash out,'' Macke added. </P>
<P> ``The security situation in Korea remains quietly tense and dangerous,'' Luck said. </P>
<P> In Seoul Tuesday, a U.S. military source said Polish officers policing the Korean truce have left the border after North Korea threatend to oust them. </P>
<P> It was the latest effort by North Korea to dismantle the intricate armistice process that has kept an uneasy truce in Korea for more than 40 years. In 1993, it refused to let a delegation from the Czech Republic take over border duties from Czechoslovakia. </P>
<P> The Pentagon said Monday it would maintain its force of 100,000 troops in east Asia for the foreseeable future. The United States currently has 37,000 troops in South Korea, about 45,000 in Japan and over 15,000 sailors and Marines aboard warships in the western Pacific. </P>
<P> Luck said South Korea continues to be a superb military ally with a well-trained and well-equipped 650,000-member force. But he said more U.S. funding was needed to improve American readiness and facilities in South Korea. </P>
<P> ``This is especially true given the fact that approximately 50 percent of American forces in Korea have inadequate living, dining and work facilities,'' he said. </P>
<P> He said U.S. troop readiness would start to deteriorate in three months if more money was not approved for training. </P>
