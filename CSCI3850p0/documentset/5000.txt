<P>  Alaska Gov. Tony Knowles Friday unveiled a $135 million capital budget for fiscal year 1996 that he characterized as modest. </P>
<P> ``This is a back-to-the-basics capital budget,'' Knowles said at a news conference held at a state Department of Transportation complex in the capital city. </P>
<P> The governor said he is seeking to avoid ``the roller-coaster capital budgets that we have seen in recent years.'' Wide spending swings ranging from $100 million to over $600 million have helped fuel a ``boom-bust economy,'' he said. </P>
<P> The budget is premised on accompanying federal spending in Alaska of more than $388 million, mostly for roads, docks, airports and water and sewer projects, said Knowles, a Democrat elected last November. </P>
<P> An additional $135 million for state capital projects would come from other sources, including airport revenues, private-sector matching funds and the Alaska Housing Finance Corp., a state bonding and lending agency that funds housing projects, he said. </P>
<P> Major capital items include transportation projects, which account for $40.8 million; school renovations, which account for $13.6 million; and University of Alaska maintenance and upgrades, which account for $11.4 million. </P>
