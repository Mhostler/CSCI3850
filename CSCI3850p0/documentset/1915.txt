<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Greg Norman pronounced himself fit Monday and eager to take on the year's major championship winners at next month's Grand Slam of Golf. </P>
<P> Norman, sidelined more than a month by an intestinal ailment, said he had lost 13 pounds in five days during his bout with the illness but had gained it back and now felt 100 percent healthy. </P>
<P> The Australian, who won the special four-man event last year at Palm Springs, was added to the $1 million event as first alternate since the double Grand Slam wins by Nick Price at the British Open and PGA Championship left one spot open. </P>
<P> ``The pure and simplest way of putting it, is to thank Nick Price for winning two majors and putting me in the Grand Slam,'' Norman said in a teleconference call from Florida. </P>
<P> ``His fantastic year opened the door for me.'' </P>
<P> Rounding out the select foursome for the two-day event starting Nov. 8 in Hawaii will be Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal of Spain and U.S. Open winner Ernie Els of South Africa. </P>
<P> Norman said he began feeling very ill during the World Series of Golf and considered withdrawing. He had a series of tests and after losing 13 pounds over a span of just five days flew to Houston for another battery of blood tests. </P>
<P> The charismatic Australian said he was told the illness was ``some kind of chemical poisoning of the stomach...from eating fruit with skin on it or lettuce unwashed properly.'' </P>
<P> Norman said he felt he earned his invitation to play in the Grand Slam with his consistent results this season, which have placed him No. 2 on the U.S. Tour money list behind his good friend Price. </P>
<P> ``To be able to play in the PGA Grand Slam is a great honor and a great treat. Only four get to play,'' he said. </P>
<P> Norman said he is adding the Las Vegas Invitational to his schedule ahead of the Tour Championship as preparation and to be sure he plays enough official rounds to qualify for the Vardon Trophy for best scoring average. </P>
<P> ``That's my top goal now,'' said Norman, who leads the Vardon Trophy competition with an average of 68.42. Tom Lehman is next at 69.10, followed by Price at 69.17. </P>
<P> Despite being disappointed in not coming through in the year's major championships, Norman said he would rate his year ''like a 7.2 out of 10. It was a consistent year. I take pride in my performances week in week out.'' </P>
<P> The 39-year-old Australian, in fact, still has a chance to go over the $2 million mark in winnings in just 16 U.S. tournaments if he can win his last two tour events. </P>
<P> Norman said his greatest regret caused by the illness was missing last month's inaugural Presidents Cup match play event between an International Team and the United States. </P>
<P> ``I was the instigator from day one. I was steering the ship,'' he said about his influence in bringing about a Ryder Cup style competition for players outside of Europe. </P>
<P> ``Unfortunately for me I couldn't play it, but I think the PGA Tour gave birth to a wonderful baby. It's going to grow up to be a very strong tournament.'' </P>
