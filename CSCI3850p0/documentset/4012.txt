<P>  Bob Chandler, a friend of O.J. Simpson who played with the football legend at the University of Southern California and the Buffalo Bills, died in Los Angeles Friday of lung cancer. </P>
<P> The death was announced by the Los Angeles Raiders, with whom Chandler, a wide receiver, ended his playing career in 1982 after being transferred from the Bills. </P>
<P> Like Simpson, Chandler moved from the football field to the broadcasting booth, becoming a Raiders' game commentator and the co-host of ``2 on the Town,'' a weekly football program shown in Los Angeles on KCBS television, the West Coast flagship of the CBS network. </P>
<P> Chandler, who visited Simpson in jail several times after the former star running back had been arrested on charges of murdering his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman, was described in a tribute issued Friday by the Raiders as ``a great competitor and a great athlete. But most of all ... a great human being. </P>
<P> Simpson, who became a sportscaster, actor and TV pitchman, has pleaded not guilty to the charges and his so-called ``trial of the century'' is under way in Los Angeles. </P>
