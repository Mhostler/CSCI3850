<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Spurs are getting along without Dennis just fine, the Knicks won without Patrick, but the Magic missed Anfernee Sunday. </P>
<P> In San Antonio, Sean Elliott scored 30 points and David Robinson had 23 points and 14 rebounds as the streaking Spurs won their 11th straight game, overcoming a season-high 45 points from Charles Barkley to beat the Phoenix Suns 109-106. </P>
<P> The Spurs, who haven't lost since March 12, improved to 8-0 since rebounder par excellence Dennis Rodman went down with a separated shoulder. </P>
<P> ``I think they thought they could beat us without Dennis Rodman but everyone picked it up and played on emotion,'' said Elliott. ``But emotion is what you need in the playoffs so we'll let emotion carry us if we have to.'' </P>
<P> San Antonio, which has the best record in the NBA at 52-18, has won seven straight home games and is 25-2 at the Alamodome since December 12. </P>
<P> Phoenix lost for the fourth time in six games. </P>
<P> ``We've got to figure out a way to stop Sean Elliott,'' said Barkley. ``He made all the plays the last time (a 105-100 San Antonio win) and he made them all today.'' </P>
<P> At New Jersey, John Starks scored 26 points and teamed with backcourt mate Hubert Davis to lead the New York Knicks to a 94-85 comeback victory over the Nets despite playing the second half without Patrick Ewing. </P>
<P> Ewing was ejected along with New Jersey's Rick Mahorn for a scuffle with 1:06 left in the first half. </P>
<P> New York outscored the Nets 25-11 in the fourth quarter. Davis finished with 17 points, 15 of them in the second half. </P>
<P> At Los Angeles, Eddie Jones scored 11 of his 17 points in the fourth quarter as the Lakers handed the Orlando Magic -- playing without star point guard Anfernee Hardaway -- a 119-112 defeat, and clinched a playoff birth. </P>
<P> Cedric Ceballos had 33 points and Sedale Threatt contributed 19 for Los Angeles. </P>
<P> Shaquille O'Neal scored 27 points, pulled down 12 rebounds, and dished out six assists for Orlando (53-19) and Brooks Thompson had a career-best 20 points filling in for Hardaway. </P>
<P> Hardaway missed the game after feeling lightheaded during the shootaround and was taken to a hospital. Hardaway has been bothered by a sore throat and strep throat for the past two weeks and has lost 10 pounds over the last 10 days. </P>
<P> In Seattle, Shawn Kemp scored 13 of his 21 points in the first quarter and the SuperSonics cruised to their seventh straight win, 105-83 over the Atlanta Hawks. </P>
<P> Gary Payton added 21 points for the Sonics (51-20), who moved into first place in the Pacific Division, a half-game ahead of Phoenix. </P>
<P> The Hawks have dropped five of their last seven games. </P>
<P> In Miami, Alonzo Mourning and Hersey Hawkins scored 22 points apiece to lead the Charlotte Hornets to a 105-92 victory over the Heat. </P>
<P> The loss was the fourth in five games for the Heat, who slipped 1 3/8 games behind Boston in the battle for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. </P>
<P> Glen Rice led Miami with 30 points. </P>
<P> Jamal Mashburn led Dallas with 30 points. </P>
<P> In Cleveland, Dikembe Mutombo had a triple-double with 18 points, 18 rebounds and 10 blocks, and Jalen Rose's foul-line jumper with 50.8 seconds left lifted the Denver Nuggets to their third straight win, 104-101 over the Cavaliers. </P>
<P> Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf scored 32 points and Reggie Williams added 27 and 10 rebounds for Denver. </P>
<P> Mark Price, who missed two 3-point attempts in the last seconds, scored 21 for Cleveland, which is now tied with Chicago in the fifth playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. </P>
<P> Denver moved a half-game ahead of Sacramento into the eighth spot in the Western Conference. </P>
<P> At Detroit, Grant Hill tied a season high with 33 points and Joe Dumars scored 15 of his 23 points in the fourth quarter to lead the Pistons to a 110-105 victory over the Washington Bullets. </P>
<P> Allan Houston added 30 points for the Pistons. </P>
<P> The win was only the third in 12 games for the Pistons. The Bullets lost their seventh straight. </P>
<P> Chris Webber led Washington with 30 points. </P>
<P> At Indiana, Rik Smits scored 20 points and Reggie Miller added 19 to lead the Pacers to a 104-93 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers. </P>
<P> The win was the sixth in seven games for the Pacers while the Trail Blazers lost their sixth in seven games. </P>
<P> Rod Strickland led Portland with 20 points. </P>
