<P>  Four gay men and women dismissed from the armed forces went to the High Court Monday to challenge Britain's ban on homosexuals serving in the military. </P>
<P> The three men and one woman say the Ministry of Defense has violated their rights under European equality laws by contending that homosexuality is ``incompatible with military service.'' </P>
<P> Gay rights activists contend that several other countries in the NATO alliance permit homosexuals to serve in the military without problems. </P>
<P> Representing the four, lawyer David Pannick told the court that Britain's military authorities were ``pandering to irrational prejudice and intolerance.'' </P>
<P> ``It is incompatible with any concept of human rights and human dignity,'' Pannick said. </P>
<P> The Ministry of Defense says that allowing homosexuals to remain in the services would ``damage morale and unit effectiveness.'' </P>
<P> Former Lt. Commander Duncan Lustig-Prean, 36, was dismissed from the navy last year just months after being commended by his commanding officer. </P>
<P> ``The time has come to put an end to this injustice,'' he told reporters before the court case. ``The issue is fundamental to the rights and freedoms of every lesbian and gay person. I love the Royal Navy and want to continue in my vocation.'' </P>
<P> Former Royal Air Force nurse Jeanette Smith, 28, was dismissed after taking a holiday with her lover. ``Hopefully the judicial review will reveal the stupidity and unfairness of the ban,'' she said. </P>
<P> The gay campaign group Stonewall said that 250 people had been dismissed from the British armed forces between 1990 and 1994 on the grounds of their sexuality. </P>
