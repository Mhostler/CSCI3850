<P>  One of Nicole Brown Simpson's sisters expressed doubts Wednesday about the innocence of her former brother-in-law O.J. Simpson in the slaying of her younger sister. </P>
<P> ``If O.J. is so innocent, why are they trying to suppress all the evidence?'' Denise Brown, 37, asked several reporters covering the murder trial of the football star turned sportscaster, actor and advertising pitch man. </P>
<P> Her comments mark the first time any member of the Brown family has made a public comment doubting Simpson's innocence. </P>
<P> Brown, one of the three sisters of the late Nicole Brown Simpson, made her comments during a break in a court hearing in which Simpson's attorneys were trying to have key evidence gathered in the case suppressed. </P>
<P> Simpson, 47, has pleaded ``absolutely, 100 percent not guilty'' to stabbing and slashing his ex-wife, 35, and her friend Ronald Goldman, 25, on the night of June 12 outside Nicole's Brentwood townhouse. </P>
<P> ``He's 100 percent innocent? Keep the evidence, then,'' said Brown, a former model. </P>
<P> In a televised interview last month with ABC, Brown's mother, Juditha, said she asked Simpson at Nicole's funeral if he had killed her. He denied it, she said, telling her ``I loved your daughter.'' </P>
<P> Outside the courthouse, Simpson's lead defense attorney Robert Shapiro downplayed Denise Brown's statement. </P>
<P> ``Denise Brown is a relative of a victim,'' he said. ``She is not a lawyer. Lawyers have a particular responsibility to raise both legal and factual issues ... and obviously the judge is troubled by some of them so we're on the right track.'' </P>
