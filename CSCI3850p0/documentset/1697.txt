<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The first phase of jury selection in the highly publicized O.J. Simpson case ended Thursday with the addition of 48 more potential jurors, bringing the final pool to 304 from which 12 will be chosen to try the football great on double murder charges. </P>
<P> The racially diverse potential jurors, divided between men and women, have been directed to fill out voluminous 75-page questionnaires which will be an important factor in helping the judge, prosecutors and defense attorneys choose the final 12 panelists and eight alternates. </P>
<P> Simpson, 47, who turned a phenomenal football career into one as a sportscaster, actor and TV pitchman, has denied murdering his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, 35, and her friend, Ronald Goldman, 25, who were stabbed and slashed to death outside her Brentwood townhouse on June 12. </P>
<P> The sensational case has received gavel-to-gavel coverage on network television as well as worldwide coverage on television, newspapers and magazines. </P>
<P> Superior Court Judge Lance Ito, who will preside over the world's most closely followed trial, earlier expressed pleasure and surprise that the process of picking a pool of jurors willing to serve during a grueling trial expected to last about six months had gone so smoothly. </P>
<P> The second part of the process will start October 12 when jurors will return for face-to-face questioning by the prosecution and defense in a bid to weed out those who might be prejudiced one way or the other. </P>
<P> That process, experts say, could take anywhere from two to four weeks. </P>
<P> ``It's not about anything you read in the newspaper,'' Ito told Thursday's batch of jurors when describing the task before them. </P>
<P> Simpson, who earlier in the week sang the song ``Memory'' from the musical ``Cats'' and bantered with reporters covering the jury selection process, said nothing Thursday, although he did smile and make an acknowledging motion with his hands as he left the jury assembly room. </P>
<P> Ito is scheduled to meet defense and prosecuting attorneys Friday morning to set ground rules for jury questioning in a session closed to media and the public. </P>
<P> Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman Fidel Gonzalez said he could neither confirm nor deny a report in Thursday's New York Post which said Simpson was scolded by a bailiff after engaging in a mirthful discussion with friend and attorney Robert Kardashian during a break in jury selection Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``He's been a model prisoner all along,'' Gonzalez said. ``I have not heard anything other than that.'' </P>
<P> On Thursday, the defense response to the prosecution's motion for full sequestration of the jury was released. It was filed September 14, 12 days after the prosecution filed its motion. </P>
<P> Full sequestration would involve the jury staying in a hotel for the duration of the trial with limited visits by family and friends and no access to newspaper, television or magazine accounts of the case. </P>
<P> The defense based its opposition on ``the strong negative impact sequestration will have upon the availability of a representative cross-section of the community.'' </P>
<P> It also noted the hardship and burden which sequestration would have upon the ``deliberative process,'' and the availability of reasonable and less burdensome alternatives. </P>
<P> Defense attorneys Robert Shapiro, Johnnie Cochran and Gerald Uelmen also used the motion to repeat their attacks on the prosecution over leaks to the media. </P>
<P> ``To accede to prosecutorial requests for sequestration in the wake of serious misconduct such as the leak of 911 tapes makes police and prosecutors the beneficiaries of their own misconduct, and creates an incentive which will encourage prosecutorial leaks as a strategic ploy,'' the motion said in reference to police tapes of Nicole Simpson's call to police in 1993 during a domestic dispute. </P>
<P> The defense motion also claimed that sequestration favored the prosecution because they would get to present their case first. </P>
<P> ``When sequestration is utilized in a lengthy trial ... the defense may be facing a jury who are like the proverbial ''scorpions in a bottle'' after suffering through months of prosecutorial meandering,'' it said. </P>
