<P>  The chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff visited Haiti Tuesday in preparation for handing over Haitian peacekeeping to a U.N.-led force, officials said. </P>
<P> Gen. John Shalikashvili discussed the transition with Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and U.S. Maj. Gen. George A. Fisher, commanding officer of the multinational force in Haiti, U.S. embassy spokesman Stanley Schrager said. </P>
<P> The meetings were private and Shalikashvili made no public statements during the seven-hour visit to the capital, Port-au-Prince. </P>
<P> President Clinton and U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali will travel to Haiti March 31 to participate in a formal handover ceremony. </P>
<P> Aristide has said the day will be a ``big, big party'' in which the Haitian people will show their gratitude to Clinton for his role in restoring democracy to the island-nation. </P>
<P> U.N. spokesman Eric Falt told a press briefing Monday that about 80 percent of the troops that will participate in the U.N. peacekeeping operation were already in Haiti. </P>
<P> ``We will maintain the peace as actively as the MNF,'' Falt said. ``The transition will take place in stable conditions. We are ready to assume the task.'' </P>
<P> A force of 320 Pakistani soldiers and 120 civilian police arrived in Port-au-Prince Tuesday. A total of 37 nations have pledged 6,000 military and 900 police to the mission. </P>
<P> The United States will have 2,400 soldiers in Haiti -- down from 20,000 six months ago -- and the operation will be headed by U.S. Maj. Gen. Joseph Kinzer. </P>
<P> U.S.-led multinational troops arrived in Haiti in September in conjunction with U.N. Resolution 940, which authorized the use of ``all means necessary'' to restore the democratically elected Aristide to office and oust the military leaders who removed him in September 1991. </P>
<P> In a sign of growing discontent Monday, the first public anti-Aristide protest since he was restored to office took place in the northern city of Cap Haitien. </P>
<P> A palace spokesman confirmed local press reports that more than 200 people protested the high cost of living and the government's privatization plan. </P>
<P> An Argentine Police Monitor was reportedly injured by the protesters as he tried to make an arrest. </P>
<P> The crowd evoked the threat of popular justice by burning tires outside a government office. Protesters threatened to resort to ``necklacing'' -- placing tires laced with gasoline around an opponent's neck and lighting them -- if the high cost of living does not go down, witnesses said. </P>
