<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS, Minn.(Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  It may be much too soon to start thinking Cy Young Awards, but Kevin Appier has established himself as the early front runner in the American League. </P>
<P> Appier pitched seven shutout innings to pick up his third win of the young season and Greg Gagne and Phil Hiatt each belted two-run homers to power the Kansas City Royals to a 6-0 victory over the Minnesota Twins Thursday. </P>
<P> Appier (3-0), making the 150th start of his career, allowed five hits while walking one and striking out 12, one shy of his career high. </P>
<P> He has 27 strikeouts, while allowing just one earned run and eight hits in 19-2/3 innings for a remarkable 0.46 ERA. </P>
<P> ``I wasn't aware of the 12 strikeouts,'' Appier said. ``I was surprised. All the pitches were working well...splitters, slider, fastball.'' </P>
<P> Said Minnesota manager Tom Kelly: ``He (Appier) can throw any pitch he wants to. He just dominated the game.'' </P>
<P> Dilson Torres held the Twins to just two hits over the final two innings. Minnesota rookie LaTroy Hawkins, making his second career start, allowed four runs on six hits in 5 2/3 innings for the loss. </P>
<P> In Detroit, Kirk Gibson and Bobby Higginson homered to send Cleveland's Orel Hershiser to his first American League defeat as the Tigers edged the Indians 4-3. </P>
<P> David Wells (1-1) pitched seven scoreless innings before allowing three runs in the eighth. Mike Henneman pitched out of a bases-loaded jam and got the final four outs for his first save. </P>
<P> Gibson homered with one out in the second off Hershiser (0-1), the former Dodgers star who was making his second start for the Tribe. Hershiser allowed four runs and six hits in seven innings. </P>
<P> Higginson hit a two-run shot in the third to score John Flaherty, who singled to open the inning. </P>
<P> In Baltimore, Harold Baines drove in two runs with a single and a sacrifice fly and the Orioles capitalized on nine walks to beat the Milwaukee Brewers 5-2. </P>
<P> Milwaukee reliever Jose Mercedes (0-1) walked three consecutive batters to open the seventh inning. Baines then hit a sacrifice fly to left to score pinch runner Manny Alexander and tie the game at 2-2. </P>
<P> Chris Hoiles hit a grounder to shortstop, but Cal Ripken took out second baseman Pat Listach to prevent a double play and Rafael Palmeiro scored the go-ahead run for Baltimore. </P>
<P> Alan Mills (1-0) earned the win, allowing one run and two hits over 2 1/3 innings in relief of starter Sid Fernandez. </P>
<P> In New York, Don Mattingly's solo homer in the eighth inning snapped a tie and helped the Yankees to a 5-3 victory over the Boston Red Sox. </P>
<P> Mattingly homered to right off Boston's Joel Johnston (0-1) with one out in the eighth inning as the Yankees took three of four games from the Red Sox. </P>
<P> New York trailed 3-2 on a two-run homer by Mo Vaughn in the first inning and a solo shot by Tim Naehring in the fourth off Yankees starter Melido Perez. </P>
<P> But Paul O'Neill led off the eighth inning with a solo homer off Derek Lilliquist that tied the game at 3-3. Mattingly followed with his first of the season, putting New York ahead to stay. </P>
<P> At California, Scott Brosius highlighted a five-run sixth inning with a two-run double to lead the Oakland Athletics to a 9-6 victory over the Angels. </P>
<P> California held a 5-3 lead before the Athletics exploded for five runs on four hits in the sixth inning. </P>
<P> Brent Gates began the inning with a double off loser Mitch Williams (0-1) and scored on Mark McGwire's double. Geronimo Berroa walked and McGwire scored on J.T. Snow's throwing error. Brosius greeted reliever Mike James with his game-winning double, drving in Berroa and Ricky Henderson. </P>
<P> Todd Stottlemyre got the win and Dennis Eckersley picked up his second save. </P>
