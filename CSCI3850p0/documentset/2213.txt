<P>  Iraq warned Arab nations Tuesday against President Clinton's visit to their region, saying they will gain nothing from it. </P>
<P> In a scathing attack on the United States and Clinton, Iraq said the Middle East will only gain ``further conspiracy and aggression ... against the Arab nation.'' </P>
<P> ``Return home. You bird of bad omen,'' declared the official al-Qadissiya newspaper. ``There is no one among honorable Arabs and Moslems to welcome your awful visit.'' </P>
<P> The paper branded Clinton as ``a symbol of despotism, arrogance and evil in the world.'' </P>
<P> Clinton is due in Egypt late Tuesday night at the start of a tour which will take him to Jordan, Syria, Israel, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. </P>
<P> Iraq's official press has been heaping scorn on Clinton in response to his tough stand on sanctions imposed on Iraq by the United Nations for its 1990 invasion of Iraq. </P>
<P> The anti-Clinton campaign in the Iraqi press is reminiscent of its past attacks on former U.S. President George Bush, who was in office when a multinational, U.S.-led force evicted Iraqi troops from Kuwait in 1991. </P>
<P> Iraq hoped for a sympathetic hearing in Washington on the question of sanctions when Clinton took office in 1992. The sanctions are crippling Iraq's economy and causing widespread suffering among its population. </P>
<P> Clinton insists Iraq fully complies with all U.N. resolutions related to the 1990-91 Gulf crisis before the sanctions can be lifted. </P>
<P> Baghdad views U.S. insistence on full compliance as part of Washington's efforts to force a political change in Baghdad. </P>
<P> A troop buildup by Iraq near the Kuwaiti border earlier this month triggered a swift and massive military deployment in the area by the United States and other Western allies fearing a repeat of the 1990 invasion. </P>
<P> Iraq appears to be particularly angry at Clinton's planned visit to U.S. troops deployed in Kuwait. </P>
<P> ``You (Clinton) the master of the American Black House,'' said Qadissiya. ``Your visit to the (U.S.) troops of aggression and the provocative show of force close to our international borders ... will not scare any one of us.'' </P>
