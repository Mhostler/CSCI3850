<P>  Former boxing champion Mike Tyson seeks to leave prison quietly Saturday, prison officials say, but fellow heavyweight and recent visitor Riddick Bowe wants him to return to the ring with a bang. </P>
<P> The Indiana Department of Corrections said Tuesday that reporters will be kept 50 yards away from the entrance to the Indiana Youth Center when Tyson is scheduled to depart his jailers at 6 a.m. EST. </P>
<P> ``It is expected that his actual departure will occur within a span of a few minutes at most,'' Department of Corrections spokesman Pam Pattison said. </P>
<P> Tyson, 28, has served nearly three years of a six-year sentence at the Indiana Youth Center for raping a 19-year-old beauty pageant contestant in July, 1992. Prison officials said he will remain on probation for four years, reporting to authorities in suburban Cleveland where he has a home. </P>
<P> Bowe said he is hoping Tyson will resume his career against him in a blockbuster $120 million bout that the two discussed Monday in prison. </P>
<P> Bowe, fresh from Saturday's sixth-round knockout win over Herbie Hide in Las Vegas, met for 45 minutes with Tyson and pronounced him relatively fit. </P>
<P> ``Mike is the best heavyweight out there, as far as I'm concerned,'' Bowe told the Indianapolis Star. ``It will be a dream for myself to face Mike. Not to mention there will be a whole lot of money involved.'' </P>
<P> Among Tyson's visitors have been several boxing figures who may be feeling Tyson out -- particularly about his loyalty to his former manager, promoter and father-figure Don King. </P>
<P> King, who is under indictment and is alleged to have squandered parts of Tyson's purses, has insisted that he remains Tyson's manager should the boxer decide to resume fighting after his forced three-year hiatus. </P>
