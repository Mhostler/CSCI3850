<P>  Khmer Rouge guerrillas in northwestern Cambodia are abducting local men and forcing them to fight in the rebel army, in some cases holding their families as hostages to force their cooperation, aid workers said. </P>
<P> Six people who refused to be taken captive had been ``shot on the spot,'' Keo Koeun, head of operations for the Cambodian Red Cross in Siem Reap province, said Monday. </P>
<P> The rebels, facing waning popular support in the countryside, also have set fire to the homes of some men who have resisted being recruited, another aid official said. </P>
<P> ``They want to get more men for fighting, now they're forcing them to join,'' Koeun said. </P>
<P> ``They've brought their families up to Anlong Veng, where they keep the women and children, and they've sent the men to Pailin and other districts for fighting.'' </P>
<P> He estimated about 60 families from Siem Reap province had been forcibly abducted by the guerrillas, mostly in Svay Leu and adjacent districts about 35 miles north of the provincial capital. </P>
<P> ``They are very strict about discipline. They make the rules enforced by the weapon and if they don't follow their orders they shoot them,'' he told Reuters. </P>
<P> Koeun said it was hard for the recruits to escape because they were often deployed in unfamiliar areas and had no guarantees for the safety of their families. </P>
<P> Since the beginning of October more than 7,000 Cambodians have fled fighting in the north, the Red Cross chief said. </P>
<P> The Khmer Rouge, who refused to participate in last year's national elections, have continued to wage a low-level guerrilla campaign against the current coalition government. </P>
<P> The Maoist rebels were responsible during the ``Killing Fields'' years of 1975-79 for the deaths of more than a million Cambodians from slaughter, starvation and disease. </P>
<P> They were accused last month of murdering three Western tourists taken as hostages after a train ambush in southern Kampot province. The remains of the three were found in shallow jungle graves. </P>
