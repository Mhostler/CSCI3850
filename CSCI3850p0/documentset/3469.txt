<P>  California doctors have found inserting a stainless steel tube into a blood vessel in the leg may eliminate the need for major surgery for some people whose chest artery has ballooned into a life-threatening aneurysm. </P>
<P> The technique is similar to one already being developed by other researchers to expand blood vessels narrowed by heart disease using an expandable mesh tube. </P>
<P> But the latest round of research, conducted at Stanford University's School of Medicine, involves using custom-designed tubes to help close the ballooning portion of a blood vessel. </P>
<P> If all goes well, blood clots forming in the mesh seal the opening of the aneurysm, reducing the risk that the ballooned portion of the wall will rupture, according to a report by the team, led by Dr. Michael Dake. </P>
<P> The report in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine said the tubes, known as endovascular stent-grafts, have been placed in 33 patients. </P>
<P> The technique was successful in all but three patients, two of whom died from multi-organ failure. The third needed further surgery. </P>
<P> But the researchers stressed that more tests and continued monitoring of the patients is needed to determine if the technique provides a truly viable, long-term method for treating aneurysms. </P>
<P> Chest aneurysms are extremely dangerous. When one pops, it is usually fatal because that blood vessel carries most of the blood to the rest of the body. As a result, only about one in 10 people with the condition live for more than five years unless they undergo surgery. </P>
<P> But surgery also carries a risk -- 12 percent of patients die as a result of the operation. Thus, doctors are looking for better options for treating such patients. </P>
<P> The Dake team initially tried the technique on 13 volunteers between July 1992 and January 1994. </P>
<P> Each self-expanding tube had to be specifically designed for the patient. </P>
<P> With surgeons standing ready to open the chest in case the attempt failed, doctors cut a hole at the top of the leg, inserted the collapsed mesh tube that was threaded toward the chest. Using X-rays to guide them to the aneurysm's site, doctors allowed the tube to expand and fill the artery. </P>
<P> None of the initial 13 volunteers died or suffered stroke, paralysis or an infection as a result of the treatment. </P>
<P> However, one of the initial 13 patients needed surgery four months later because the blood vessel continued to balloon, even with the mesh tube in place. </P>
<P> The Dake group stressed that the technique is not advisable for every patient. In their study, volunteers were excluded if their aneurysm didn't have the proper shape, for example. </P>
<P> For carefully selected patients, use of the tubes ``appears to be a feasible alternative to standard surgical procedures,'' the Dake group concluded. </P>
