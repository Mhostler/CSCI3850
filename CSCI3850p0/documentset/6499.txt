<P>  China's government seemed to be hurtling toward a clash with international women's groups Friday after non-governmental organizations rejected plans to move their 1995 global forum to a rural resort and out of Beijing. </P>
<P> United Nations sources confirmed reports circulating on the Internet that the 19-member facilitating committee representing worldwide non-governmental organizations, or NGOs, voted May 10 to reject the proposed move. </P>
<P> Fifteen members of the NGO Forum Facilitating Committee opposed Beijing's plan to hold the women's forum in rural Huairou county, while four supported it, sources said. </P>
<P> The body agreed to give China until May 24 to offer ``an alternative that meets the needs of the 40,000 participants and journalists expected to take part,'' a report circulated on the Internet by WomeNet and other women's groups said. </P>
<P> The decision -- and mounting calls in the West to boycott the Beijing forum -- appeared to put organizers on a collision course with China's communist government, which has mobilized workers to spruce up the site near the Great Wall. </P>
<P> The official Xinhua news agency described the site Friday as a hive of construction activity. </P>
<P> About 1,300 NGOs are accredited for the August 30-September 8 NGO Forum, which coincides with the intergovernmental Fourth World Conference on Women, a decennial gathering to be held in central Beijing. </P>
<P> The NGO forum was to have been held in the huge 1950s-era Worker's Stadium, a venue prized for its downtown Beijing location and its proximity to the official conference. </P>
<P> The communist-controlled All-China Women's Federation announced the move to Huairou April 4, saying the Worker's Stadium had been deemed unfit due to structural problems. </P>
<P> Official sources say that is an excuse. The sources say city and Communist Party officials had grown nervous that advocates of lesbians' and prostitutes' rights might stage embarrassing protests in Tiananmen Square or other prominent sites. </P>
<P> China has no gay rights movement, while prostitution is illegal but widespread. </P>
<P> Women's and human rights activists have denounced the move as a bid to muzzle them -- or at least keep their freewheeling debates and liberal ideas away from the Chinese public. </P>
<P> Women's groups in the West have been flooding Chinese officials and U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali with letters and petitions denouncing the move. </P>
<P> Efforts to resolve the dispute have borne little fruit. </P>
<P> Forum convener Supatra Masdit visited Huairou and several other sites in April and pressed women's federation president Chen Muhua and state family planning commission minister Peng Peiyun to rethink the move. </P>
<P> Masdit's report on her inspection made no recommendation but raised serious questions, saying Huairou was inconvenient, about an hour's drive from Beijing, and lacked essential facilities -- chiefly a central meeting venue. </P>
<P> Some European groups are pressing for Masdit to organize an inspection team to corroborate Chinese engineers' purported finding that the Workers' Stadium is unsafe. </P>
<P> The September 4-11 Fourth World Conference on Women is China's first major international meeting and a symbol of its emergence as a global force. </P>
<P> Masdit has said she hoped the forum could be held at one of two alternative Beijing sites -- the indoor Capital Gymnasium and the National Olympic Village. </P>
