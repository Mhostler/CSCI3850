<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A wealthy adviser to Brazilian president Fernando Henrique Cardoso arranged a loan that helped U.S. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown buy a $360,000 townhouse, U.S. News & World Report reported in its edition that will go on sale Monday. </P>
<P> Joser Amaro Pinto Ramos -- who is Cardoso's adviser, puts together financing for energy and transportation projects. He told the magazine that he had arranged ``a substantial loan'' for a downpayment on the townhouse at the request of Lillian Madsen, a mutual friend of his and Brown who occupies the house. </P>
<P> On Saturday, the Washington Post reported that a former business partner of Brown's paid off $190,000 of his personal debts last year and later hired a private detective to find out who was talking to congressional investigators about her dealings with Brown. </P>
<P> The Post said Brown's debts, including legal bills, personal credit lines at three banks and mortgages on two West Virginia properties, were paid with funds provided by Nolanda Hill, his former partner in First International Communications Corp. The newspaper said spokesmen for Brown and Hill had confirmed its report. </P>
<P> Questions about the financing of the townhouse first arose in 1993. The Justice Department investigated but found no wrongdoing by Brown. Ramos' role in the financing had not been disclosed before. </P>
<P> No mention is made in Brown's financial disclosure reports of the loan, which Ramos said he had arranged to be made not to Brown but to Madsen through contacts at an unspecified bank in Paris. </P>
<P> During a trade mission to Brazil last June, headed by Brown, Ramos hosted a dinner party for him at his Sao Paolo home attended by about 15 business and political leaders, U.S. News reported. </P>
<P> Ramos told the magazine he had never spoken to Brown about the loan and was unaware the secretary owned the property, in a fashionable part of Washington D.C. He said Brown had done nothing to help his business, which has consulting companies in Sao Paolo, Paris and New York. </P>
<P> Brown, a lawyer-lobbyist before joining President Clinton's cabinet, has represented some of Ramos's clients, the magazine said. </P>
<P> Brown was traveling in India and could not immediately be reached for comment. His personal lawyer, Reid Weingarten, did not immediately return calls seeking comment. </P>
<P> Madsen was questioned last year during an FBI investigation into unsubstantiated allegations that Brown had agreed to take money in exchange for working to lift the U.S. trade embargo against Vietnam. </P>
<P> Madsen could not be reached Sunay. </P>
<P> The Justice Department closed that investigation last February without bringing charges against Brown. </P>
<P> Ramos would not disclose the amount of the loan to Madsen, who has described herself as a ``close personal friend'' of Brown. The deed and mortgage of the townhouse she occupies are in the names of Brown and his son Michael. </P>
