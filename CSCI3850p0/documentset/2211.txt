<P>  Kashmir's top separatist leader Shabir Shah, just freed from prison, has rejected India's plans for elections soon in the Himalayan region and called on the United States and Britain to back his secessionist drive. </P>
<P> ``I appeal to the U.S. President Bill Clinton, the U.K. and the U.N. to bring pressure on India to give up its obstinacy and arrogance,'' Shah said in an interview late Monday. </P>
<P> Shah, called the ``Nelson Mandela of Kashmir'' by backers, spoke to Reuters in a brick house rented by his supporters on the outskirts of Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir state. </P>
<P> He said he would not give up his lifelong struggle for Kashmir's freedom despite spending 20 of the past 26 years in prison for advocating secession from India. </P>
<P> Shah, 41, was first jailed at age 15 for leading a demonstration against Indian rule in Kashmir. In 1988, his father died after being beaten in police custody. </P>
<P> Shah said he had been beaten, chained, stripped, deprived of sleep and placed in solitary confinement. He said his ears and kidneys had been damaged, and he can only stand for short periods because of pain in his feet. </P>
<P> He was arrested in 1989, the year the militants launched an armed separatist rebellion, and was released Oct. 14 in Jammu, the winter capital of Jammu and Kashmir, to throngs of well-wishers. </P>
<P> In his first days of freedom, Shah has toured the Himalayan region drawing hundreds of thousands of supporters chanting ``Free Kashmir.'' A rally in Srinagar last week drew an estimated 200,000 people -- the biggest gathering in the Himalayan city for nearly two decades, residents said. </P>
<P> Shah was the fourth secessionist leader freed in recent months in hopes of rallying regional support for elections that New Delhi wants to hold in March in Jammu and Kashmir, largely Hindu India's only Muslim-majority state. </P>
<P> But Shah said elections would not solve the Kashmir problem. ``We are fighting for freedom. They are talking of elections which are irrelevant to us,'' he said. ``Elections will not solve the problem. Talk of elections is a fraud.'' </P>
