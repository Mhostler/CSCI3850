<P>  Visiting First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton Thursday toured the Taj Mahal, India's fabled monument to a husband's love for his wife, and cheered on a much-acclaimed project to help poor women. </P>
<P> ``I don't think I want to leave. I think I'll just stay right here. I think this place is just haunting,'' Clinton said after spending an hour with her daughter Chelsea, 15, marvelling at the splendid white marble mausoleum at Agra. </P>
<P> Built by the Mughal Emperor Shahjehan in the 17th century in honor of his wife, who died giving birth to their fourteenth child, the monument was once hailed by an Indian poet as ``a teardrop on the cheek of time.'' </P>
<P> After posing for pictures like millions of previous tourists in front of the great domed edifice that looks as though it is floating on air, Clinton and Chelsea went inside and were shown around by tourguide Kuldeep Narain. </P>
<P> When Narain showed President Clinton's wife and daughter the delicate inlaid stonework that surrounds the tombs of Shahjehan and his empress, Clinton exclaimed: ``That's incredible. I've never seen anything like it.'' </P>
<P> Chelsea was equally awed. </P>
<P> ``When I was little, this was sort of the embodiment of the fairy tale palace for me. I would see pictures of it, and I would dream I was a princess or whatever, and now that I'm here, it's spectacular,'' she said. </P>
<P> Afterward, Clinton flew to this western Indian business capital where she placed flowers at a retreat on the bank of the Sabarmati River once used by nationalist leader Mahatma Gandhi, who was assassinated in 1948. </P>
<P> But the main reason for her visit was to get a first-hand look at the work of the Self-Employed Women's Association (SEWA), which tries to help poor women gain independence. </P>
<P> Founded 24 years ago by Indian social activist Ela Bhatt, SEWA has organized women involved in such menial labor as fish-vending into 74 trade associations. </P>
<P> It also operates a bank to provide credit for poor women that has 61,000 customers and assets of $4 million. </P>
<P> ``I have long been interested in what SEWA was doing. The word of your work has travelled many thousands of miles,'' Clinton told several hundred sari-clad members of the movement who gathered to greet her. </P>
<P> Clinton, who was winding up a three-day visit to the world's second most populous country, told the women that ``we are working to catch up with SEWA in the United States.'' </P>
<P> India, with 950 million people, has over 40 percent of the world's poor and a 50 percent illiteracy rate. </P>
<P> After visiting the SEWA bank in a drab, bustling storefront where she was given her own passbook, Clinton talked with SEWA women for more than an hour in a dusty, sunbaked tent outside. </P>
<P> When she asked the women to tell her what the organization had done for them, one shabbily-clad SEWA member who described herself only as a villager said that before she joined she was ``afraid of everything.'' </P>
<P> ``I was afraid of my husband and my mother-in-law and the police and everybody. But since joining SEWA, I'm no longer afraid of anybody,'' she said through a translator. </P>
<P> Clinton, in the midst of a 12-day goodwill mission to South Asia, Friday was scheduled to fly to isolated Nepal where a leftist group threatened to demonstrate against her. </P>
<P> She began her trip in Pakistan, and was to visit Bangladesh and Sri Lanka before returning to the United States April 6. </P>
