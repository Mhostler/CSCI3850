<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Japan's Sony Corp has started overhauling its money-losing movie studio operations after writing off $3.2 billion of its investment in November, the New York Times reported Wednesday. </P>
<P> Much of the oversight of the studios will be moved to New York from Southern California and will be placed under Jeff Sagansky, who was hired from CBS Inc four months ago, the paper said. </P>
<P> Sony is also planning to make lower-cost films to avoid high-priced, unprofitable flops at the box office and is seeking to bring in financial partners on some films, the paper said. </P>
<P> The company wrote off $3.2 billion to reflect the diminished value and accumulated losses of Columbia Pictures and Tristar Pictures, the paper said. </P>
<P> Sagansky's move diminishes the role of Alan Levine, president of Sony Pictures Entertainment, and Mark Canton, chairman of Columbia/Tristar Motion Picture Companies. </P>
<P> Recent flops at the box office have forced Sony to cap spending on new movies, the paper said. </P>
<P> Sony is looking for financial partnerships on at least 10 films of the 30 planned for release this year, the paper said. </P>
<P> Executives close to the company told the paper that Sony is looking for a return on assets of eight percent or nine percent, compared with earlier expectations of 11 percent. </P>
<P> Sony paid $3.4 billion and assumed $1.2 billion in debt in 1989 to buy Tristar and Columbia, which were both controlled by Coca-Cola Co, the paper said. </P>
