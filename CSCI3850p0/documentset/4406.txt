<P>  Doctors in training opposed to abortion on moral grounds do not to have to undergo training in the procedure, the medical accreditation council said Friday in clarifying its controversial recommendation earlier this week. </P>
<P> The recommendation by the council, whose accreditation is needed by teaching hospitals to qualify for federal funding, that resident gynecologists and obstetricians receive training in abortion procedures triggered an angry response from pro-life advocates. </P>
<P> ``The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education's recent recommendation in no way forces or coerces any individual or institution to perform abortion. Any resident who holds any moral or religious objection to abortion is allowed to be excused from the training requirement,'' the council's executive director said in a statement. </P>
<P> But executive director John Gienapp said the uproar led him to clarify the council's position and assure teaching hospitals who do not perform abortions that residents wishing the training can be sent elsewhere to get it. </P>
<P> The recommendation was designed ``to address the need for enhanced education in the provision of primary and preventive health care for women by obstetricians and gynecologists,'' the council's statement said. </P>
