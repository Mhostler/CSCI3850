<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The United States Wednesday defended its new policy toward Cuba against critics and pledged it will carefully monitor the fate of ``boat people'' who will now be forcibly returned to Cuba. </P>
<P> The policy announced Tuesday resulted from the highest-level talks between Washington and Havana in nearly two decades, but State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns denied speculation they signaled a move toward normal ties. </P>
<P> Months after vowing never to reward Cubans who try to sail illegally to the United States, the administration reversed course, opened its borders to about 15,000 ``boat people'' held in refugee camps and said future migrants would be forcibly returned to Cuba. </P>
<P> Some Cuban American leaders protested against the forced repatriation and human rights observers said the policy ran counter to human rights standards. </P>
<P> Burns, defending what he insisted was not a policy change, said the situation in the refugee camps at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where about 15,000 mostly young and frustrated males were being held indefinitely, was prone to violence, expensive at $1 million a day and ``untenable.'' </P>
<P> Some officials may have feared riots were likely, he said. </P>
<P> ``We believe that the steps that were announced yesterday will discourage further dangerous, uncontrolled outflows of migrants from Cuba, and thus save many lives that otherwise might be lost at sea,'' he told a daily news briefing. </P>
<P> The announcement meant that nearly all of the 21,000 Cubans now living under dire conditions in the camps will migrate to the United States. About 6,000 women, children and elderly were already being prepared for transfer, but the 15,000 men were looking at an indefinite stay in the camps. </P>
<P> U.S. officials have predicted it would take until September 1996 to finish the shift and said most people would be absorbed into Florida's Cuban-American community. </P>
<P> Responding to concerns for future boat people who try to flee the communist regime, Burns said ``the Cuban government has committed itself to take no action against those migrants returned to Cuba in the future.'' </P>
<P> He also stressed that diplomats in the U.S. interests section in Havana ``will closely monitor the treatment of any returned migrants, beginning from the moment of their return.'' </P>
<P> Vessels with migrants will be met at the dock by U.S. officials, migrants will be counseled on options for legal migration and ``they will be afforded every opportunity to apply through the proper legal channels which exist,'' he said. </P>
<P> Burns refused to reveal details of the secret talks between Undersecretary of State Peter Tarnoff and Cuban representative Ricardo Alarcn that led to the policy change and said he did not know if there would be more talks at that level. </P>
<P> The Washington Post reported Wednesday that Tarnoff and another senior official have recommended easing sanctions against Cuba as part of a policy of engagement. </P>
<P> Burns repeated the U.S. position that ``we are prepared to respond with carefully calibrated steps to meaningful and irreversible political and economic change in Cuba.'' </P>
<P> But he said ``we need to see changes in the nature of how the totalitarian regime in Cuba goes about its business in the treatment of its own people, because human rights concerns are very strong here, on the economy and on politics ... And I have nothing to give you today that would indicate that we are prepared to do that.'' </P>
