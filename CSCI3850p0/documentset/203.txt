<P>  Former Philippine first lady Imelda Marcos was charged with corruption Wednesday for allegedly accepting a necklace worth more than $80,000 as a gift in 1985 while she was head of a government ministry. </P>
<P> Prosecutors, in a suit filed in a Manila court, accused the widow of the late president Ferdinand Marcos of violating an anti-graft law prohibiting civil servants from receiving gifts from persons having dealings with the government. </P>
<P> Marcos was sentenced by a court to 18 years in jail in September after being convicted in another corruption case. She is on bail while the case is on appeal. </P>
<P> Virginia Zamora, a representative of Metro Infrastructure Development Corp, allegedly gave the gift to Marcos in a bid to prompt the Ministry of Human Settlements to pay money it owed Metro, the prosecutors said. Marcos was head of the ministry at the time and the firm had a contract with the ministry to develop a residential site in a Manila suburb. </P>
<P> The necklace was handed to Marcos by a congressman's wife on behalf of Zamora during a social function, they said. Even if Marcos did not demand the gift, it was still ``immoral and indecent'' for a public official to receive it for no justifiable reason, the prosecutors said. </P>
<P> Marcos did not file any answer to the charges during a preliminary investigation of the case. She is facing more than 100 criminal and civil suits for allegedly helping her husband steal up to $5 billion from the economy during their 20 years in power. They were ousted in a 1986 popular revolt that forced them to flee to Hawaii, where Ferdinand Marcos died three years later. </P>
