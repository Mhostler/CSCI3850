<P>  Here is the complete text of a previously unknown letter written by Anne Frank's father to a second cousin in Britain in March 1945 just after he was freed from the Auschwitz Nazi death camp. </P>
<P> The letter, provided by Dutch daily Algemeen Dagblad, shows Otto Frank had no idea his family had perished and that he was the only survivor. </P>
<P> I hope that this letter may reach you giving you the news that I am living. It really is a wonder. I wrote to Robert and Paul, but it is not certain that my letters will arrive so I ask you to communicate with them. </P>
<P> We were liberated by the Russians on Jan 27 and it was lucky that at that time I was staying in the hospital, as this was left by the Germans intact. They tried to make me leave with them, but I managed to escape and stayed; that was my chance. I do not know how many of my comrades, who had to retreat with them, are still living. I don't believe they are many. </P>
<P> Here we are waiting to be repatriated, but there is still war and we are far from home, Holland still being partly occupied. Of Frau Edith and the children I know nothing. We were separated on our arrival at Birkenau-Auschwitz on September 5. We were in hiding for more than two years in Amsterdam and our friends cared for us, looking after our food and all our needs in spite of all dangers. Luckily I earned enough money in those years to pay our way, but now I am a beggar, having lost everything (word ``everything'' underlined) except life. Nothing of my household is left, not a photo, not a letter from my children, nothing, nothing; but I don't want to think what will happen later and if I shall be able to work again. There are as many in the same situation. </P>
<P> I hope you are well, especially your dear mother and yourself, when shall we meet again? I long for you all and I am so much better now, weighing 60 kg (130 lb) again. How shall I find you all and all my old friends? I always was optimistic and I am still trying my best. So I trust that we shall meet again, all of us and that we shall feel the old friendship and the confidence we always had for each other. As ever affectionately, yours Otto. </P>
<P> Many regards to you, your mother, Paul's, Robert's and the different friends.'' </P>
