<P>  North Korea's shadowy leader Kim Jong-il is unlikely to appear at a national ceremony to celebrate his 53rd birthday next Thursday, Kyodo news agency said Friday. </P>
<P> The Japanese agency, in a report from Pyongyang, quoted a North Korean government official as saying: ``(Party) Secretary Kim is a very modest person and will not attend the ceremony.'' </P>
<P> Other government officials said the celebration would not be unusually ostentatious. </P>
<P> There has been widespread speculation that the 53rd birthday of the son and heir apparent of late President Kim Il-sung would be a big affair after the government issued an ordinance Tuesday making it the nation's greatest holiday. </P>
<P> The government ordinance, which made both Feb. 16 and 17 national holidays, merely reflects Kim's desire to allow people to take a rest, the official was quoted as saying. </P>
<P> In recent days, the strictly controlled North Korean media has started to prepare the country for Kim's birthday, with the official news agency KCNA describing it as ``the greatest holiday of the nation.'' </P>
<P> Kim officially assumed control of the army in 1991, was made a marshal the following year and became chairman of the National Defense Committee in 1993. </P>
<P> There is little doubt he will assume the titles of state president and chairman of the Communist Party, although North Korea watchers have been confounded by the long delay in his elevation to the posts. </P>
<P> Kim Il-sung, North Korea's ``Great Leader,'' died of heart failure on July 8. </P>
