<P>  Bosnian Serb forces have released more United Nations personnel who were detained as ``human shields'' against possible NATO air strikes, a U.N. military spokesman said Friday. </P>
<P> Col. Jan-Dirk Merveldt told reporters Bosnian Serbs had released 27 U.N. military observers and 40 French soldiers around Serb-held parts of Sarajevo. </P>
<P> It was the latest sign the Serbs were beginning to ease their hard-line stance toward the United Nations peacekeeping force. </P>
<P> On Thursday they released 55 Canadian peacekeepers held at Ilijas, near Sarajevo, leaving some 200 U.N. troops still detained of the 500 who were seized by the Serbs following NATO air raids on Serb targets last month. </P>
<P> The French peacekeepers had been held under a kind of house arrest at a weapons collection site in Lukavica and prevented from leaving. </P>
<P> Merveldt, spokesman for the U.N. Protection Force, said the French were ``unblocked'' now and free to come and go at the collection site. </P>
