<P>  The Bosnian government army's activities are destabilizing the military situation around Sarajevo and placing the capital's population at great risk, U.N. officials said Sunday. </P>
<P> The officials cited Bosnian army violations of a demilitarized zone in the mountains west of the city, sporadic firing of heavy weapons and trench-digging activities -- all of which violate existing agreements. </P>
<P> ``Any increase in the level of conflict or any unraveling of an already existing agreement is bound to destabilize the security situation in Sarajevo,'' said a senior U.N. officer. </P>
<P> ``If the Bosnian army doesn't move out of the DMZ and stop these other violations then all these arrangements for the security of Sarajevo could collapse.'' </P>
<P> Bosnian Serb forces encircled Sarajevo in April 1992 in the opening days of the Bosnian war. </P>
<P> They hit the capital repeatedly with heavy artillery and sniper fire, killing 10,000 residents and wounding 50,000, until last February when they pulled their big guns out of range after NATO threatened air strikes following a market blast that killed 68 people. </P>
<P> Conditions around the city gradually improved as utilities were restored, streetcar service resumed and routes for commercial goods were opened. </P>
<P> But the situation began to deteriorate again in August after Bosnian Serbs rejected an international peace plan to end the war and neighboring Yugoslavia -- once their staunch ally -- sealed the border to fuel and military supplies. </P>
<P> Bosnian Serb forces began firing on the main government supply route into the city, effectively closing it. </P>
<P> Muslim-led government troops retaliated by occupying a demilitarized zone on Mount Igman, from which they can fire onto a Serb supply route into the town of Trnovo. </P>
<P> Government forces also advanced -- sometimes by blasting trenches through solid rock -- to positions from which they could fire on two other Serb supply routes, one from Pale to Vogosca and the other from Pale to Lukavica. </P>
<P> U.N. officials told reporters Sunday that Bosnian Serb army restraint in response to these provocations could soon evaporate, plunging Sarajevo back into a cycle of war that peacekeepers would be powerless to prevent. </P>
<P> The Bosnian government told U.N. special envoy Yasushi Akashi over the weekend that it will begin removing troops from the Igman DMZ on Monday at noon. </P>
<P> But the government is demanding U.N. peacekeepers provide greater security for the Igman logistics road as a condition of complete withdrawal, and the United Nations is resisting. </P>
<P> ``How you would defend that route I don't know,'' said a senior U.N. military officer who asked not to be named. </P>
<P> ``I'm afraid we can't satisfy their demand. The road is too vulnerable and we haven't the resources to secure it and protect those passing along it.'' </P>
<P> Asked why the United Nations is emphasizing Bosnian government violations of agreements around Sarajevo and not mentioning any Bosnian Serb violations, a U.N. officer said: ``This is a factual briefing. We don't have any bias. We're just telling it like it is.'' </P>
