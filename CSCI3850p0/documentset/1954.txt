<P>  President Boris Yeltsin has dismissed acting finance minister Sergei Dubinin over the collapse of the ruble, top presidential aide Sergei Filatov told reporters Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``I don't know if you are aware of it, but today a presidential decree has been signed to relieve acting finance minister Sergei Dubinin of his post,'' Filatov, Yeltsin's chief of staff, said. </P>
<P> Russia's two pro-reform deputy finance ministers, Sergei Aleksashenko and Andrei Kazmin, told Reuters they would resign if President Boris Yeltsin did not reinstate acting Finance Minister Sergei Dubinin. </P>
<P> ``If the decision on the sacking of Dubinin is not reversed, I am going to resign,'' Aleksashenko told Reuters on Wednesday at the State Duma (lower chamber of parliament). </P>
<P> Kazmin said: ``I will do the same.'' </P>
<P> The two also expected the first deputy finance minister, Andrei Vavilov, to replace Dubinin. </P>
<P> Earlier Yeltsin also asked parliament to fire central bank chairman Viktor Gerashchenko over the ruble crisis. </P>
<P> Yeltsin also made it clear Wednesday he regarded the ruble's collapse this week as a deliberate act of sabotage. He named a security chief from the former KGB secret service to investigate its causes. </P>
<P> Interfax quoted Yeltsin as saying the currency's nosedive was the result ``of sabotage or the manifestation of a policy of extreme irresponsibility and slovenliness by the special groups of people who organised the rouble's disastrous fall.'' </P>
<P> The ruble lost 21.5 percent of its value Tuesday, falling to 3,926 from 3,081 against the dollar in a single session on the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange (MICEX). It recovered 5.1 percent at Wednesday's session to 3,736. </P>
<P> Yeltsin told the influential security council he was setting up an investigative committee. </P>
<P> It would be run by Security Council secretary Oleg Lobov and Sergei Stepashin, head of the Federal Counterintelligence Service (FSK) which is a successor to the KGB. </P>
<P> Lobov was to present the security council, a non-elected ``inner circle'' of close Yeltsin allies that decide strategic matters, with a report detailing who was to blame. He had three days to complete the task, Yeltsin said. </P>
<P> Yeltsin was not alone in his conviction that the ruble crisis was caused by shadowy political enemies. Russians brought up under the Soviet command economic system often assume political maneuvering lies behind economic turmoil. </P>
<P> Panicking dealers and observers at the MICEX currency exchange said repeatedly they believed the ruble, overvalued at recent rates around 2,000 to the dollar, was deliberately being brought lower as part of economic maneuvering by officials. </P>
