<P>  A contempt of court case against an American professor and others over a newspaper article was postponed Thursday until next January 9. </P>
<P> At an adjournment request proceeding, the lawyer representing four of the five defendants argued he needed more time to prepare his case, originally scheduled for a High Court hearing Friday. </P>
<P> The dispute stems from an October 7 newspaper opinion piece by Christopher Lingle, a former professor at the National University of Singapore, in which he referred to unnamed ``intolerant regimes'' and their judiciaries. </P>
<P> Singapore officials have said they viewed those specific remarks as directed at Singapore. </P>
<P> The Singapore government said on November 18 it would take legal action for contempt of court against Lingle as well as the International Herald Tribune newspaper, its publisher Richard McClean, its Asian editor Michael Richardson, and its local printer, Singapore Press Holdings Ltd. </P>
<P> The counsel from the Singapore attorney general's office argued Thursday that the defense had been given ample time to prepare its case, and that allegations this serious should not be left hanging. </P>
<P> ``We feel that the matter should be dealt with as expeditiously as possible,'' Quek Mong Hua, deputy senior state counsel, told Reuters after the proceeding. </P>
<P> Lingle, 46, was not present at Thursday's proceeding and was not represented by legal counsel. He resigned from his university post and returned to the United States October 20. </P>
<P> Lingle told Reuters by telephone from Atlanta that after giving the matter careful consideration and discussing it with others: ``I've decided not to return to answer the charges.'' </P>
