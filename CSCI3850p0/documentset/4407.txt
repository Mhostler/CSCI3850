<P>  Libya has protested to the United Nations over a recent Voice of America (VOA) broadcast criticizing its human rights record and called for an impartial investigation of the rights situation in both countries. </P>
<P> In a letter to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali published Friday, Libyan U.N. representative Mohamed Azwai said his country ``refutes the sophistries and fabrications'' contained in the Feb. 9 broadcast which he said were aimed at ``misrepresenting the human rights record in Libya.'' </P>
<P> ``At the same time, they are to be seen in the framework of the vicious campaign being waged by the United States of America against Libya in order to obstruct its endeavors to achieve economic and social development and ensure the welfare of its people,'' he added. </P>
<P> Azwai said Libya, as on many previous occasions, was prepared for ``an impartial inquiry into human rights violations, in any form whatever, and into the grounds for these false allegations.'' </P>
<P> At the same time, he added, ``we insist on an inquiry in the very country that accuses other countries of violating human rights, namely the United States of America.'' </P>
<P> The General Assembly, the Security Council and other relevant bodies should ``make appropriate arrangements for the conduct of the necessary inquiries,'' he said, while affirming Libya's national sovereignty its total rejection of interference in its internal affairs. </P>
<P> ``The United States of America, which claims to be the world's greatest defender of human rights, must look to itself and must examine its own record of numerous human rights violations, of oppression and of racial discrimination, particularly against blacks and American Indians.  ``The events that took place in Los Angeles provide the best indication of that,'' he added, apparently referring to rioting which followed acquittal of four policemen in 1992 on charges of beating up a black motorist. </P>
<P> Azwai said the United States had been ``alarmed and disconcerted by the political stability enjoyed by the Libyan people...and by its steadfast character despite the iniquitous economic embargo imposed as a result of the hegemony of certain major powers in the Security Council, chiefly the United States of America itself.'' </P>
<P> He was alluding to sanctions first imposed on Libya in 1992 for failing to surrender for trial two men indicted in the United States and Britain for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 270 people. </P>
