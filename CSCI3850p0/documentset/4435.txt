<P>  Talks between China and the United States on protecting intellectual property rights have made progress and will resume next week at a higher level, China's Ministry of Foreign Trade said Sunday. </P>
<P> The talks, which began Feb. 14, have been constructive and progress has been made, the Xinhua news agency quoted a spokesman from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation as saying. </P>
<P> The negotiations will resume at a higher level in Beijing next week and Foreign Trade Vice Minister Sun Zhenyu has invited deputy U.S. trade representative Charlene Barshefsky to preside jointly at the talks, the spokesman said. </P>
<P> The U.S. Embassy confirmed Barshefsky had been invited and said the U.S. side might make a statement on the talks later Sunday. The embassy spokesman had no further comment. </P>
<P> Washington says piracy of U.S. patents, copyrights and trademarks in China costs U.S. industry nearly $1 billion a year and has ordered $1.08 billion in punitive tariffs on Chinese exports effective Feb. 26 if no deal is struck. China has ordered tit-for-tat countermeasures. </P>
<P> ``The negotiations have been frank and have covered in detail improved protection of copyright and trademark goods,'' a U.S. statement said Saturday. </P>
<P> The two sides were focusing on how to put teeth in China's enforcement of a string of new intellectual property protection laws, which U.S. officials say are widely admired in legal terms -- but widely ignored by pirates. </P>
<P> Discussions touched on what the embassy called ``initiation of a special enforcement period,'' language that indicated the U.S. side was attentive to Beijing's consistent plea for more time to build up its anti-piracy infrastructure. </P>
<P> The People's Daily Sunday reported raids on factories found to have churned out counterfeit laser discs. </P>
<P> The State Copyright Administration revoked the license of Dali Laser Audio-Video Products Co in central Nanjing and shut down Yisheng Laser Disc Manufacturing in Zhongshan in southern Guangdong province, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> The Nanjing plant was found to have produced nearly 900,000 unauthorised laser discs and the Zhongshan factory was alleged to have ``committed a similar offense,'' it said. </P>
<P> The raids were the latest in a series aimed at cracking down on intellectual property thieves who until recently had faced little or no enforcement despite China's promulgation of a raft of anti-piracy laws. </P>
<P> In 1994, in 28 provinces and cities, authorities seized 4.673 million pirated audio and video cassettes and discs, the People's Daily said. </P>
<P> Authorities have proposed a nationwide clean-up of the recording industry and have closed or fined four plants found to be serious offenders, it added. </P>
<P> The United States has been pressing China to raid 29 south China plants alleged to flood Asia with pirated U.S. laser and compact discs as a downpayment toward building a better environment for intellectual property protection. </P>
<P> It was not immediately clear if the four plants that were closed or fined were on the U.S. list of 29. </P>
