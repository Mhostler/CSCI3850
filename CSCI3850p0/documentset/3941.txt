<P>  Binyamin Kahane, the international head of the Kahane Chai movement and son of slain militant Rabbi Meir Kahane, denied Tuesday his organization was a terrorist group and said they do not have more than $2 million in U.S. assets. </P>
<P> Saying that President Clinton's freeze order was ``an insane analogy tantamount to comparing Bill Clinton to Adolf Hitler,'' Kahane admitted his group ``has no more than $2 million in the United States.'' </P>
<P> Kahane made his remarks at a late-evening news conference at a midtown hotel that was attended by several Kahane Chai supporters, including Mike Guzofsky, who runs the U.S. operation. </P>
<P> Neither man would define what form those assets were in. ``I personally know of millions of dollars that were sent to Israel,'' Guzofsky said. </P>
<P> On Tuesday, the president froze the assets of 12 Middle East ``terrorist'' groups including Kahane Chai, the Kach movement founded by the elder Kahane, who was murdered in 1990, and 10 Arab groups that Clinton said threatened the peace process. </P>
<P> Guzofsky said his group has known since last March that a freeze on the assets was being considered by the administration and had taken ``appropriate steps'' to make sure the money went to Israel. </P>
<P> He also said his group would not be intimidated by Clinton's order and that it ``would not affect fund raising or the flow of dollars to Israel.'' </P>
<P> Kahane Chai was outlawed last year in Israel, after a follower of the group killed at least 29 Muslims at a Hebron mosque. </P>
<P> Both men accused Clinton of caving in to Israeli pressure in issuing the freeze after Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for a weekend bombing that killed 19 people. </P>
<P> ``We are not going to close up shop ... because Clinton is giving in to a mad man in Israel -- Rabin,'' Guzofasky said. ''We are going to step up our activities,'' he added, saying that would also include ``sabotaging'' the peace process. </P>
