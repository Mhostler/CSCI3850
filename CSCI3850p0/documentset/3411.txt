<P>  The Clinton administration is considering allowing Cuba to open news bureaus in the United States and clearing the way for U.S. news media to establish offices on the island, according to two Florida lawmakers. </P>
<P> Republican Reps. Lincoln Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen have written to President Clinton warning him that ``any friendly gesture'' towards Cuba's communist government would be ``throwing the moribund totalitarian regime a lifeline.'' </P>
<P> They listed among other steps under consideration, plans to authorize U.S. businesses to engage in the unrestricted sale and financing of medicine and medical supplies, lifting the ban on charter flights, and allowing travel for academic, cultural or scientific exchanges. </P>
<P> The White House had no immediate comment on reports that some of the moves could be announced within 10 days. </P>
<P> After Havana expelled the last U.S. correspondent based in Cuba 25 years ago, the United States shut down Cuba's U.S. bureaus except at the United Nations. Reporters have since had to apply for visas on a temporary case-by-case basis. </P>
<P> Reuters maintains a bureau in the Cuban capital. </P>
<P> Diaz-Balart and Ros-Lehtinen urged Clinton ``to remain firm in enforcement of sanctions against the Cuban dictatorship. </P>
<P> ``Any ...friendly gesture toward Castro at this time of almost unprecedented repression would constitute a form of complicity with the ferocious oppression of the Cuban communist dictatorship against its people,'' their letter said. </P>
