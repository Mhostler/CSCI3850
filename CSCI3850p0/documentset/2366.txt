<P>  A Canadian television station has axed a U.S.-made children's futuristic action show about teenage warriors after complaints it was excessively violent. </P>
<P> YTV, a specialist children's channel, took Mighty Morphin Power Rangers off the air Tuesday after a censure from the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council, an industry review board. </P>
<P> ``Among other things it contains too much violence; it doesn't show children the effects of violence and that's a big problem from our point of view,'' council spokesman Ronald Cohen said Wednesday. </P>
<P> The Power Rangers -- a popular series about teen-age super hero vigilantes who become robotic warriors to guard the planet against evil space aliens -- is made for Rupert Murdoch's Fox-TV network in the United States. </P>
<P> The council also censured another Canadian network, Global Television, but the network said Wednesday it has yet to decide whether to drop the show, which is based on a popular Japanese series from the 1970s. </P>
<P> The action followed complaints from two mothers who said their children displayed aggressive behavior after watching the program. One of the mothers, Kathryn Flannery, submitted a petition to broadcast regulators after she saw a viewer discretion warning before the opening of one episode. </P>
<P> ``If there's a warning in front of a children's program, (the program) simply shouldn't be on,'' she said. ``They're making the violence in society entertainment.'' </P>
