<DATELINE>ESSEN, Germany (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  European Union leaders condemned the Bosnian Serbs Saturday for violating the Bihac security zone and said U.N. peacekeepers must stay on there to save lives and deliver humanitarian aid. </P>
<P> They issued a statement at an EU summit in the German city of Essen that stressed continued support for the flagging efforts to end Europe's worst conflict for half a century. </P>
<P> Participants saw the declaration as partly making up for the failure of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe to even mention the war only a few hundred miles from its meeting Monday and Tuesday in lling its mandate, the implications for Bosnia and its civilian population would be severe,'' it added. </P>
<P> The leaders insisted on an immediate cease-fire in and around the U.N.-designated ``safe area'' of Bihac, freedom of movement fo and its agreement will be needed to prolong a temporary easing of international sanctions against Belgrade, British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said. </P>
<P> There were no dissenting voices or no suggestions of tougher military action at the summit, diplomats said. </P>
<P> Just as the leaders were stressing there could be no military solution to the Bosnia conflict, Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Germany might deploy its Tornado fighter jets there if they were needed to help defend an UNPROFOR pullout. </P>
<P> Kohl, who shied away this week from a NATO inquiry about its readiness to help defend a pull-out, told ZDF television he would consider approving Germany's first military mission abroad in 50 years if his allies needed help. </P>
<P> Contact group officials are due in Sarajevo again next week to try to sell the peace plan, which divides Bosnia between Serbs and Muslims and holds out the possibility of Croat-Muslim and Serb-Bosnian Serb link-ups. </P>
<P> As a third winter of war closes in, the second summit of European leaders within a week found itself overshadowed by the Bosnian conflict and their inability to do anything about it. </P>
<P> Tuesday, the CSCE summit in Budapest attended by more than 50 countries was unable to agree to a statement after Russia blocked tough language against the Serbs. </P>
<P> More than half of the 23,000 U.N. troops in Bosnia are from EU countries. The force has been hampered, humiliated and attacked by the Serbs while the peace process has faltered. </P>
