<P>  U.N. officials said Thursday that rival Somali warlords have apparently agreed to reconcile and cooperate in forming a police force and running Somalia's main airport and port facilities. </P>
<P> U.N. spokesman George Bennett told a news conference in the capital Mogadishu that a nine-point deal had been struck between the Somalia National Alliance of Mohamed Farrah Aidid and Ali Mahdi Mohamed's Somali Salvation Alliance. </P>
<P> They have been the main groups battling for control of the lawless east African country, which has been without a government since 1991 when several clans ousted Mohammed Siad Barre, a dictator who had ruled Somalia since 1969. </P>
<P> Bennett said he had not actually seen the deal and cautioned that previous peace agreements had failed. But U.S. military intelligence officers said they had also received reports of an agreement between the two rival warlords. </P>
<P> Bennett said the imminent departure of the U.N. peacekeeping operation may have encouraged the warlords to seek a fresh agreement. </P>
<P> Within days, a rearguard of 1,400 Pakistani and Bangladeshi troops will be left at the airfield and port -- all that remains of a force that once numbered 30,000 from 28 nations that tried but failed to restore order in the anarchic Horn of Africa country. </P>
<P> Up to 2,500 U.S. Marines and 500 Italians will pluck the last U.N. troops and their tanks and armoured vehicles from the beaches around the end of the month. </P>
<P> Earlier in the week, intelligence reports had indicated the two militias might fight for control of the airfield and sea port when U.N. forces abandon them. </P>
<P> Rival clans belonging to the rival warlord's groups battled into the early hours Thursday in Mogadishu. Hospital sources said one Somali was reported killed and two injured in the fighting. </P>
