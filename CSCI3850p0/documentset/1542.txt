<P>  Singapore has rejected a last-ditch legal appeal by a 59-year-old Dutchman condemned to hang for drug trafficking, Dutch authorities said Thursday. </P>
<P> Johannes van Damme was scheduled to go to the gallows at dawn Friday (around 6 p.m. EDT Thursday) in Changi jail for heroin trafficking. </P>
<P> ``The latest appeal by a lawyer has been turned down,'' a Dutch foreign ministry spokesman in The Hague told Reuters, referring to an 11th-hour bid by Singapore lawyer Edmond Pereira to save van Damme from the gallows. </P>
<P> If simultaneous Dutch diplomatic efforts also fail to secure clemency, Van Damme will be the first Westerner to be executed in Singapore for drug offenses. </P>
<P> The Dutch engineer was arrested at Singapore airport in September 1991, with 9.4 pounds of heroin in his suitcase. He said during his trial he was carrying the bag for someone else and had not known what it contained. </P>
<P> Van Damme's lawyers had sought to reopen the case, citing a Dutch police report showing their client had been a police informant and might have subsequently been framed by a Nigerian gang he exposed. </P>
<P> A Dutch foreign ministry spokesman said diplomatic efforts to save Van Damme were continuing: ``We are working to the last minute.'' </P>
<P> The human rights organization Amnesty International, which launched a worldwide campaign against the hanging on Wednesday, said it had not given up hope. </P>
<P> ``It happens very often that ... a death sentence is postponed at the last minute,'' a spokeswoman told Dutch news agency ANP. </P>
<P> Foreign Minister Hans van Mierlo pledged on Tuesday to ``leave no stone unturned'' in his efforts to prevent the hanging, despite the failure of a string of high-level mercy appeals earlier this year. </P>
<P> A legal plea for clemency in July and a letter from Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands to Singapore President Ong Teong Cheong were both rejected. </P>
<P> The World Council of Churches joined appeals for the sentence to be commuted and members of the European Parliament urged German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel to use his influence to prevent the execution, ANP reported. </P>
<P> A Dutch Reformed Church minister who visited Van Damme on Thursday morning said the condemned man was calm, spiritually strong and hoping for a miracle. </P>
