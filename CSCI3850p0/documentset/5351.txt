<DATELINE>TAIPEI, March 31 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui prepared on Friday to fly to the Middle East for a tour seen at home as an important effort to break out of the island's enforced diplomatic isolation. </P>
<P> Lee was due to leave Taiwan at 3 a.m. (1900 GMT Friday) on Saturday for his first trip to Jordan and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and only his third overseas tour since he became president in 1988. </P>
<P> Taiwan has diplomatic relations with only 29 countries, mainly because pressure from its arch-rival China has caused most to switch recognition to Beijing. </P>
<P> Lee was taking with him a powerful phalanx of Taiwan businessmen expected to agree in principle to deals to reward Jordan and the UAE for receiving Lee despite opposition from Beijing. </P>
<P> But analysts said the two small nations have more to offer Taiwan than a little dignity on the international stage. </P>
<P> ``To ensure exports and energy sources is very important,'' Economics Minister Chiang Ping-kun told journalists. </P>
<P> Kwang Hwa Investment Holding Co, a company under Taiwan's ruling Nationalist Party, plans to cooperate with Jordan in developing mineral resources in the Dead Sea. </P>
<P> ``After the visit I believe...follow-up actions such as signing investment guarantee pacts, tax agreements and furthering many investment cases will gradually emerge,'' Kwang Hwa president Chang Chung-pu told Reuters. </P>
<P> Taiwan's state-run Chinese Petroleum Corp said it may begin importing liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and possibly oil from the UAE. </P>
<P> ``Chairman Chang (Tzu-yuan) might discuss with UAE officials purchasing more crude oil, starting to buy liquefied petroleum gas from UAE and possible ventures in oil-related projects during the visit,'' a company spokeswoman said. </P>
<P> Last year, Taiwan imported 990,000 tonnes of LPG, mostly from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, but none from UAE, a government Energy Commission official said. </P>
