<P> It said a fourth Cuban made the swim with the others Sunday afternoon but was caught and returned to the camps. </P>
<P> The Guantanamo Bay Naval Base and other U.S. military installations surround this bay on the southeast end of Cuba, and the entire military complex is surrounded by a strip of minefields. </P>
<P> Several Cubans from the camps tried at least once before to swim across the bay, believing communist Cuba was on the other side, but were picked up by U.S. Navy boats. </P>
