<P>  An unemployed cleaner burned a lottery ticket that would have won her nearly $60,000 because a preacher told her she would go to Hell if she accepted the money, a Brazilian newspaper reported Friday. </P>
<P> Maria Benoiza Nascimento, a 39-year old mother of seven in the northeastern city of Fotaleza, said members of her evangelical Assembly of God congregation chanted ``burn, burn, burn,'' after the preacher said she would die in a plane crash and go to Hell if she went to claim her prize in Sao Paulo. </P>
<P> Nascimento's husband beat her and left home when he discovered what she had done, the Jornal do Brasil newspaper said. </P>
<P> The woman's only hope is that the organizers of the television lottery will manage to trace the number of the winning ticket to her, the newspaper said. </P>
