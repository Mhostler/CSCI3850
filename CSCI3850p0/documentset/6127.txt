<DATELINE>PARIS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  France slapped a rare ban on a book by a Muslim author Friday, accusing it of an anti-western tone that could threaten public order. </P>
<P> The Paris publishers of ``The Licit and Illicit in Islam'' by Youssef Qaradhawi, denied the work was inflammatory and said they would contact lawyers to try to overturn the ban. </P>
<P> ``It was first published in 1990 in France. Why are they acting now?'' asked an official at publishers Al Qalam. </P>
<P> An Interior Ministry decree in the Official Journal outlawed the work, saying it could ``cause dangers for public order because of its clearly anti-western tone and ideas contrary to the laws and fundamental values of the republic.'' </P>
<P> The ban covered all sales and distribution in France.  ``The book explains the Koran. If this work is inflammatory for the West, then so is the Koran,'' the official at Al Qalam said, asking not to be named. </P>
<P> He estimated about 9,000 copies of the work, written in Arabic and translated into French, were in circulation mainly in France and Belgium. He said it was aimed at Muslims living in western nations. </P>
<P> ``We won't give up, we will contact our lawyers,'' he said. </P>
<P> France, where Islam is the second religion behind Roman Catholicism, has often tried to clamp down on fundamentalism. </P>
<P> Last year, for instance, it barred girls from wearing Muslim headscarves in schools calling them a symbol of the repression of women and of religious extremism. </P>
