<DATELINE>PARIS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The foreign ministers of Israel and Egypt failed Thursday to settle a row over Israel's refusal to sign a treaty banning the spread of nuclear weapons but they did agree to continue their dialogue shortly. </P>
<P> ``No, the situation remains the same,'' Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said when asked if the dispute, which has jeopardized the extension of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), had been settled at the talks in Paris. </P>
<P> Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told a joint briefing for reporters that a new meeting was planned shortly after the two minister had reported back to their governments. </P>
<P> ``There's still a long way to go ... but we do look forward to progress in the near future,'' Moussa said. </P>
<P> Asked if talks would resume before the April 17 opening in New York of a four-week international conference to discuss extending the 25-year-old NPT, Peres replied: ``I can't tell you before we report back to our governments. They would be very angry if we told you before we told them.'' </P>
<P> Israel, which has never publicly acknowledged it has nuclear weapons, has said it cannot renounce them as long as states such as Iran and Libya openly threaten to destroy the Jewish state. </P>
<P> Western experts say Israel has about 200 warheads and missiles capable of delivering them accurately to any point in the Middle East. </P>
<P> Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak Wednesday appeared to soften Cairo's earlier insistence that Israel must sign the pact before Egypt would agree to its renewal. </P>
<P> But Moussa denied any shift in Cairo's stance but said it was commited to the NPT. ``But we do believe in the universality of the system, including in the Middle East,'' he said. </P>
<P> Mubarak has said after talks with President Clinton in Washington: ``We are not asking them (Israel) to join the NPT now or tomorrow. I hope with the help of the United States we could narrow the gap, complete something concerning this issue.'' </P>
<P> Mubarak said that, with the Middle East peace process moving forward, Israel would not need nuclear weapons in future. ``But we are negotiating this issue to find any kind of formula to be agreed on,'' he said. </P>
<P> Peres, who dined with Moussa after their talks, said Israel was ``not a major player in the NPT story'' and wanted all non-conventional weapons eliminated from the Middle East. </P>
<P> ``Our differences are about how to reach that goal, not about the goal itself,'' he said. </P>
<P> Moussa and Peres met at the Hotel Bristol in central Paris, venue of secret talks that finalised the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord of 1993. </P>
<P> U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Wednesday it would be a ``grave mistake'' to make support for extending the NPT conditional on actions by countries outside the treaty -- a clear reference to Israel. </P>
