<P>  A trespasser was struck and seriously injured Tuesday night by a New Jersey Transit train in an accident that delayed thousands of homebound commuters, a railroad spokeswoman said. </P>
<P> The accident occurred near the Glen Ridge station in northern New Jersey at 7:25 p.m. EDT, said New Jersey Transit spokeswoman Linda Maurice. </P>
<P> The injured person was taken by helicopter to University Hospital in Newark, Maurice said. </P>
<P> Passengers on the train were delayed for 50 minutes before they could be transferred to another train. Other trains were delayed 20 to 30 , she said. </P>
<P> ``We try to impress on people the importance of safety, Trains belong on the rails, not people ... If someone is on our railroad, they are trespassing,'' Maurice said. </P>
