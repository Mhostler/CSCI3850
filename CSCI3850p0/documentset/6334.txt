<P>  A Japanese proposal on firearms control has angered gun-owning groups in the United States, a U.N. conference on crime prevention heard this week. </P>
<P> ``I want the U.N. and the Japanese to know that we're playing with fire here,'' Thomas Mason of the National Rifle Association told Reuters Saturday. </P>
<P> ``The U.N. is not popular with conservative elements of the American public and the last thing it needs to do is get involved in anything that hints of gun confiscation or gun bans,'' he added. </P>
<P> Mason had told a workshop at the conference on the prevention of violent crime Friday the U.S. pro-gun lobby rejected national bans. </P>
<P> The original Japanese draft resolution called for national and international control of guns but the word ``control'' has been replaced with ``regulation'' after objections from the U.S. delegation, Jiro Ono of the Japanese delegation said. </P>
<P> ``The NRA were extremely concerned about this as was the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee (Sen Jesse Helms) who sent a letter to the Attorney General (Janet Reno) opposing this resolution,'' Thomas told Reuters Saturday. </P>
<P> ``This had the potential of being a very, very significant political issue...that's one of the reasons the American delegation here was so active in toning that down,'' said Thomas, a criminoligist in Portland, Wash. </P>
<P> Jeremy Travis, director of the National Institute of Justice and head of the U.S. team at the conference, said his delegation opposed the word ``control'' in all proposals but had also to consider the rights of gun owners. </P>
<P> ``This issue is obviously one of concern to Americans due to the extent of gun violence and gun-related violence...we're attempting to balance that concern against the legitimate rights of gun owners,'' said Travis. </P>
<P> Different attitudes towards the state's role in protecting citizens lie at the heart of the debate. Unlike the United States, gun ownership in Japan is illegal and people look to the state to protect them, said Ono, head of Japanese police's Second International Affairs Division. </P>
<P> He said Japan had presented the proposal after the number of gun-related violent crimes had increased. The number of handguns confiscated by police had risen by 70 percent in the past three years. In March, the national police chief was shot and wounded outside his home. </P>
<P> ``Many Japanese people live in fear of the threat of illegal handguns or firearms. </P>
<P> The proposal is one of about 15 main resolutions at the conference. Once approved by a committees it will go to the plenary Monday for formal adoption. None of the operative articles are mandatory. </P>
