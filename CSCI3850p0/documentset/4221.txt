<P>  For the second time in a week Japan has run into charges of being anti-Semitic, but the country's top Jewish leader Wednesday defended the nation's attitudes as naive rather than anti-Jewish. </P>
<P> In the latest dispute, which flared earlier in the week in Paris, a Japanese fashion designer took a series of men's striped pyjamas off the market after outraged Jews said they resembled Nazi concentration camp uniforms. </P>
<P> The European Jewish Congress accused Comme des Garcons designer Rei Kawakubo of trivialising the Holocaust after she included the striped pyjamas in her men's wear show on the same day Jews marked the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp. </P>
<P> A week ago, the Japanese publishing house Bungei Shunju Co. closed one of its monthly magazines due to protests from Jewish groups about an article denying the existence of the Nazi gas chambers. </P>
<P> Commenting on the two incidents, U.S.-born Ernie Salomon, president of the Japan Jewish Center, said even Japan's small band of anti-Semitics were so out of touch with reality that their views were ``laughably cockeyed.'' </P>
<P> ``This country is not anti-Semitic. This country is naive. Most people don't even know who or what a Jew is,'' said Salomon, who has lived in Japan for 45 years. </P>
<P> His center is the umbrella organization representing Japan's 2,000-strong Jewish community, who worship at just two synagogues. </P>
<P> In withdrawing the clothes, Comme des Garcons said in a statement: ``Rei Kawakubo has decided, as a measure of respect to those people who have been shocked, to withdraw from the collection the striped pyjamas in question as well as all other clothes made with the same fabric.'' </P>
<P> The show on Jan. 27, the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Russian troops at Auschwitz, featured several striped dressing gowns and pyjamas, including one evocative pair modelled by an emaciated model with closely cropped hair and protruding ears which the Congress had called ``particularly shocking.'' </P>
<P> Kawakubo, 52, said in a statement that the theme of her collection was sleep and relaxation and that she never meant to make a reference to the camps. </P>
<P> Kawakubo's husband and managing director Adrian Joffe, who is Jewish, also said he had not made the connection with Auschwitz when they were preparing the collection. </P>
<P> The ``Marco Polo'' magazine that was withdrawn featured a 10-page story titled ``There were no Nazi gas chambers'' which argued there was scant evidence that Jews were systematically killed in gas chambers. </P>
<P> Salomon said, unlike virulent anti-Semitism in some other countries, Japanese were often unaware they were making derogatory comments about Jews. </P>
<P> ``I know one rightist who goes around denouncing Jews and then makes donations to Israel,'' he said. </P>
