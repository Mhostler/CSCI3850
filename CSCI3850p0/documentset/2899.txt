<P>  Paula Jones, who is suing President Clinton on charges of sexual harassment, instituted another lawsuit Tuesday -- this time suing Penthouse Magazine to stop it from printing provocative topless photographs of her. </P>
<P> The suit, filed in Manhattan Federal Court, seeks $30 million each from the magazine, its publisher, General Media International Inc., and Jones' former lover who took the photographs in 1987 and later sold them. </P>
<P> Jones also is seeking a court order barring publication of the photographs. The suit asks that all the pictures and negatives be returned to her. </P>
<P> Last May, Jones, a former Arkansas state employee, filed suit against Clinton accusing him of making sexual advances toward her when the two were alone together in a hotel room. The suit asks for both an apology and $700,000 in damages. Clinton has denied the charges and is seeking to have the case thrown out of court. </P>
<P> In her latest lawsuit, Jones said she never authorized the sale or use of a dozen photographs showing her topless, wearing a G-string and modeling in a variety of provocative poses. </P>
<P> She also alleges she had an a verbal agreement with ex-boyfriend Mike Turner that he would not show the photographs to anyone. Jones said she was 19 when she met Turner while working in a shoe store. He was 32 at the time. </P>
<P> The dozen pictures and accompanying story are scheduled for Penthouse's January issue, which goes on sale Dec. 6. </P>
<P> The suit alleges the defendants violated New York State's civil rights law. It is filed in federal court because the parties are located in different states. Jones lives in California, Turner in Arkansas and Penthouse is based in New York. </P>
<P> A Penthouse statement attached to the suit said Jones ``cut a sexual swath'' through Little Rock and friends and family portray her in the story as ``flirtatious and promiscuous.'' </P>
<P> ``In examining Paula Jones's leap from small-town vamp to big-time thorn in the side of a president, Penthouse concludes that without the help of an array of right-wing and born-again Christian groups and personalities, she might never have shown up on the national media's radar screens,'' the statement said. </P>
