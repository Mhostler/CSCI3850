<P>  The armed forces will be recalled onto Rio's streets in an attempt to reduce violent crime, but there will no repeat of recent massive military raids on shanty-towns, Rio Gov. Marcello Alencar said Monday. </P>
<P> ``We're not going to send the armed forces in to occupy the shantytowns. We're going to use a much more integrated approach,'' Alencar told reporters after meeting with army generals and other military officials. </P>
<P> Troops will patrol the city's streets, ports and airports, and help train police in the use of firearms used by the military but will only act as backup to police in any raids on the shantytown strongholds of drug gangs, the governor said. </P>
<P> ``Crime is not suddenly going to end and violence will always exist, but we cannot allow this trivialization of violence,'' Alencar said. </P>
<P> Between November and February, thousands of troops, backed by helicopters and tanks, carried out high-profile raids on the strongholds of Rio's heavily armed drug gangs. </P>
<P> However, only a few minor gangleaders were arrested and modest amounts of drugs and weapons seized. In addition, there has been no apparent let-up in the pace of murders, kidnappings and gunbattles as a result of ``Operation Rio.'' </P>
<P> ``Operation Rio was a disaster,'' said Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, a Sao Paulo sociology professor. ``It was basically an attempt for the military to show off without any attempt to get to grips with organized crime.'' </P>
<P> Alencar said he was due to present his new security plan to President Fernando Henrique Cardoso Tuesday and patrols could begin after that meeting. </P>
<P> Asked whether he might impose emergency measures, such as allowing police to detain suspects without warrants, Alencar said he would consider such measures if necessary to reduce the violence. </P>
