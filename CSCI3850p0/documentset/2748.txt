<P>  An Iraqi opposition news group reported Monday that the Iraqi government had arrested more than 1,000 political suspects, including many army and air force officers and religious officials. </P>
<P> The Iraqi Broadcasting Corporation, which is linked to the opposition alliance Iraqi National Congress, said in a report sent from Kurdish-controlled Salahuddin in northern Iraq that those arrested had been accused of opposing the government and working to overthrow it. </P>
<P> The report only named one of an estimated 1,000 people arrested -- Lt.-Col. Muhammad Mazloum al-Dalimi, who was said to be commander of al-Bakr air base near Samarrah, about 60 miles north of the capital Baghdad. </P>
<P> ``A large number of imams from mosques and prayer halls in Baghdad, al-Ramadi, Mosul and al-Faluja have been arrested,'' the report said, citing mounting anger at the government among clerics. </P>
<P> The opposition group accused the government of arresting families of suspected political defectors to pressure them into surrendering. </P>
<P> It was not possible to verify the report which quoted ``well-placed sources.'' </P>
