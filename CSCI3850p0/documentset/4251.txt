<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Indian President Shankar Dayal Sharma swore in five new ministers Thursday as part of a reshuffle of Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's cabinet. </P>
<P> In a ceremony in an ornate room in the Rashtrapati Bhavan presidential palace, Sharma also swore in three new junior ministers in Rao's first reshuffle in a year. </P>
<P> But in line with custom, there was no immediate announcement of what jobs ministers held in the new cabinet. Under Indian tradition, the president swears in only new ministers or ministers who are elevated in rank. </P>
<P> Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherjee was expected to replace the ailing Dinesh Singh as foreign minister, while Finance Minister Manmohan Singh was expected to keep his post. </P>
<P> Madhavrao Scindia, Ajit Singh and Buta Singh were sworn in as cabinet ministers. </P>
<P> Ajit Singh was expected to become food and civil supplies minister. A farm lobby leader, Singh broke away from the left of center Janata Dal party and merged his faction with the Congress party in 1994, helping Rao's then minority government acquire a majority in parliament. </P>
<P> Ajit Singh is an influential leader of the predominant Jat farming caste in the western part of India's most populous and electorally critical Uttar Pradesh state. </P>
<P> Scindia, who resigned as civil aviation minister in January 1993, was expected to be defense minister, taking the portfolio from Rao. </P>
<P> Buta Singh, home minister under former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, was expected to head the Health Ministry which has been leaderless since B. Shankaranand resigned in December after being linked to a $1.3 billion stock market scandal. </P>
<P> Buta Singh is a minority Sikh leader from the lowest castes which the Congress Party is wooing to improve its electoral fortunes. </P>
<P> G. Venkataswamy and P.A. Sangma were elevated to cabinet minister status from their current junior minister positions. Venkataswamy had been junior Textiles Minister while Sangma was junior Labor Minister. </P>
<P> P. Chidambaram was sworn in as a junior minister with independent charge. He was expected to become junior commerce minister. </P>
<P> Urmila Ben Patel and Matang Singh were sworn in as junior ministers in ministries headed by full cabinet ministers. </P>
