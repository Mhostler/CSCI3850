<DATELINE>NEW DELHI (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Voting continued in the eastern Indian state of Orissa Thursday with an opinion poll predicting the leftist Janata Dal party would lose ground but remain in power in the state. </P>
<P> It was the second day of voting in Orissa, one of six states holding assembly elections in February and March, in what has been viewed as a test for the federal government of Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao. </P>
<P> The voting follows a series of electoral reverses for his ruling Congress party in state polls last year. </P>
<P> Press reports spoke of a 65 percent turnout on the first day of voting last Tuesday, when polling was held in about half of Orissa. </P>
<P> Police said that in the only violent incident in the Orissa voting, six people were injured when a bomb exploded Tuesday in a truck hired by the Congress party for electioneering. </P>
<P> Janata Dal officials accused Congress workers of planning to assassinate one of their candidates, and said three people were killed in the blast, but police could not confirm this. </P>
<P> A poll conducted by the independent Center for Media Studies predicted the Janata Dal would take 43 percent of the vote in Orissa, a mainly agricultural state on the shores of the Bay of Bengal, down from 53 percent in the last election in 1990. </P>
<P> It said this would translate into 75 to 85 seats in the 147 seat state assembly, enough to continue in power. </P>
<P> The poll predicted that only three percent of the swing would move to Congress, raising its vote to around 33 percent and 30 to 40 seats, with the rest accruing to a variety of smaller parties and independents. </P>
<P> In neighboring Bihar, where voting begins Saturday in the last of the current round of state elections, the poll suggested Congress was also gaining on the ruling Janata Dal. </P>
<P> Federal Election Commissioner T.N. Seshan last month postponed the assembly polls in Bihar, where nearly 50 people including a candidate have been killed in the campaign, to allow time to deploy thousands of federal forces to protect polling stations. </P>
<P> Bihar Chief Minister Laloo Prasad Yadav of the Janata Dal Thursday warned Seshan that any further postponement of the polls would trigger off a ``revolt by the people.'' </P>
<P> ``The rescheduling of the poll smacks of a conspiracy hatched by the Congress-I and the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) and any further change in the poll would establish the... charge that Mr Seshan is dancing to the tunes of the two parties,'' Yadav told the Press Trust of India (PTI). </P>
<P> The Bihar government replaced a senior bureaucrat and the state police chief Monday after the election commission complained that lack of coordination between the two had jeopardized security. </P>
<P> PTI quoted official sources as saying Bihar's borders with Nepal and the neighboring state of West Bengal were to be sealed from Thursday to prevent firearms and agitators from entering during the election, which is on March 11, 15 and 19. </P>
<P> Vote counting in Orissa and the western states of Gujarat and Maharashtra will begin Saturday. In northeastern Arunachal Pradesh, where the vote takes place Saturday, counting will start on March 15, while in Bihar it will begin on March 21. </P>
<P> Last month Congress emerged as the largest party and formed the government in the small northeastern state of Manipur, the only state in the current round of polls where votes have already been counted. </P>
