<P>  House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Monday he will not run for president in 1996, despite offers of assistance from supporters who want to see the outspoken conservative in the White House. </P>
<P> Speaking to reporters after a breakfast meeting with local business leaders, Gingrich said he would remain in Congress to oversee passage of the Republican Party's ``Contract with America'' and a planned shift of government authority from the federal to the state level. </P>
<P> ``You've got a bunch of very fine candidates out there,'' said the 51-year-old Georgia native, who just a month ago became the Republican Party's first Speaker of the House of Representatives in 40 years. </P>
<P> ``People who want to get involved in the presidential race ought to get involved. People who want to help us in Congress pass the Contract with America and work on renewing American civilisation and replacing the welfare state will have to focus on that,'' he said. ``We'll work on that for the next year and a half and we'll let the other folks go and run for president.'' </P>
<P> Gingrich said his announcement followed a series of weekend discussions with would-be campaign supporters, including friends from Iowa and New Hampshire, states where the first presidential tests will be held. </P>
<P> ``Hopefully, in '97, I'll be Speaker of the House. I've got to get re-elected by the district and I've got to get re-elected by my colleagues and we have to keep a majority,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``If we can do those three things, that's a pretty big job at this stage of my career.'' </P>
<P> Gingrich, who helped mastermind the stunning Republican victory in last November's midterm elections, said he began seriously to consider a possible White House bid last week after former Vice President Dan Quayle announced he would not run for office. </P>
<P> Gingrich said he agreed with supporters who urged him to remain in Congress and continue work on ``restoring American civilization'' by radically altering the system of government. </P>
<P> ``I hardly need to run for president to get my message out,'' he said, adding that the job of speaker has proved to be ''three times tougher'' than he first imagined it would be. </P>
<P> Later, after a speech to a joint session of the Georgia General Assembly, Gingrich told reporters that he was not at all worried about the GOP's ability to come up with a formidable candidate. </P>
<P> ``We've had Republican presidents in the last four years. We haven't had a Repuublican speaker,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``And, so, I think being speaker with a Republican president could be a very important part of building the kind of team that could really complete the revolution and that's why I decided I'd stay, period.'' </P>
<P> There are three Republicans so far who have said they intend to run for president -- Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, and Lamar Alexander, former governor of Tennessee. </P>
<P> Gingrich said he viewed their early announcements as an indication of President Clinton's political weakness. </P>
<P> At the weekend, the Christian Coalition said it would not support a Republican ticket in the 1996 elections unless both the presidential and vice presidential candidates oppose abortion rights, according to the New York Times. </P>
<P> The call by the Christian right, a key voting block for the Republicans, could hamper the ambitions of moderate party hopefuls like Massachusetts governor William Weld, California governor Pete Wilson and New Jersey governor Christine Todd Whitman, who have all said that abortion language does not belong in the party's 1996 platform. </P>
<P> When asked to comment on the Christian Coalition's position, Gingrich told reporters Saturday that the Republican Party would be the only choice for anti-abortion voters in 1996. </P>
<P> ``I think that virtually everybody that is pro-life, when faced with a choice between the current Clinton administration and its proposed surgeon general and its policies and the Republican ticket, will vote for the Republican ticket,'' he said. </P>
