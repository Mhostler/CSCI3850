<P>  Algerian Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah Dembri said Thursday he hoped peace would return to his country within months, since Islamic insurgents were losing their struggle and deserting the cause in growing numbers. </P>
<P> Up to 40,000 people have died in a bitter struggle between Algeria's army-backed government and Islamists since January 1992 when the government scrapped elections which the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) had been poised to win. </P>
<P> Dembri, giving a speech in London after talks with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, said the security situation had ``visibly improved'' -- an apparent reference to recent army sweeps against Muslim fundamentalists. </P>
<P> ``Military operations are more effective ... more and more people are deserting the armed groups, realizing that they are on the wrong path,'' he told the Royal Institute for International Affairs (RIIA). </P>
<P> ``We are trying to give hope back to the people. Algeria has been through a difficult transition and will continue to be afflicted by tensions ... But there is hope for a return to domestic peace in the coming months.'' </P>
<P> Dembri repeated that presidential elections would be held before the end of the year in an attempt to unite the North African state's 26 million people. </P>
<P> But he sidestepped all questions about exactly when these might be held, whether the government was prepared to hold talks with the banned FIS, recent military operations or what the prospects were for economic growth and stability. </P>
<P> There have been several calls from Algerian opposition parties for the government to include the FIS in peace talks which would try to establish a cease-fire. </P>
<P> While Islam was the country's religion, Dembri said Algeria was determined that it should not be used by political groups to cause disharmony -- and nor would it dominate the state. </P>
<P> ``Whatever the price, we will continue to be a democratic, modern society ... a country with a secular tradition of openness,'' he said. </P>
