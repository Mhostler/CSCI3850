<P>  Gulf Air has cancelled an order for six Boeing 777 jets, saying the purchase would give the carrier too much capacity, a Boeing spokesman confirmed. </P>
<P> ``The agreement with Gulf Air was dependent on analysis of the airline's capacity requirements,'' said Boeing spokesman Jerry Johnson. ``They finished their analysis, and we accept their decision that the 777 would add capacity beyond their current needs.'' </P>
<P> An industry analyst said the planes were valued at about $130 million each. </P>
<P> Gulf Air, based in Bahrain, had been expected to take delivery of the six aircraft between 1998 and 2000. Gulf Air also has cancelled options it held for six additional 777s, Johnson said. </P>
<P> The long-haul, twin-engine 777, which can seat up to 328 in a three-class configuration, is scheduled for initial delivery to UAL Corp's United Airlines May 15. </P>
<P> Johnson noted that GulfAir operates other Boeing jets, including 767s, and said the manufacturer looks forward to a continued business relationship with the carrier, jointly owned by Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and Abu Dhabi. </P>
