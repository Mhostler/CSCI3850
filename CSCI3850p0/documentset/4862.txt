<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Secretary of State Warren Christopher, in a brief interlude from his mediation in the Arab-Israeli dispute, travels to Saudi Arabia Sunday to discuss the maintenance of U.N. sanctions against Iraq. </P>
<P> Christopher will meet foreign ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), grouping six Gulf Arab countries, in the Red Sea port of Jeddah before flying to Damascus to try once again to narrow Israeli-Syrian differences on the Golan Heights. </P>
<P> In advance of Christopher's talks Monday with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, his special Middle East coordinator, Dennis Ross, met Israel's chief of staff, Gen. Amnon Shahak, Saturday evening. </P>
<P> Israeli sources said Ross and Shahak discussed security arrangements that would guarantee a future Israeli withdrawal on the Golan, captured by the Jewish state in 1967. </P>
<P> U.S. officials say this is for the moment a more promising area for negotiation than the sensitive issues of when and how far Israel will withdraw. </P>
<P> Despite the lack of any confirmation from Syria, Israeli leaders have confidently predicted that Assad will agree to resume the direct talks between Syrian and Israeli officials in Washington that were broken off last December. </P>
<P> Israel's chief negotiator with Syria, Washington envoy Itamar Rabinovich, told Israel television that talks between ambassadors, senior officers and possibly chiefs of staff ``can certainly be expected in the upcoming months.'' </P>
<P> In Saudi Arabia, Christopher, who spent Saturday resting in Israel despite saying he feels fit after suffering a stomach ulcer last month, will argue that sanctions against Iraq must be maintained. </P>
<P> The United States is campaigning to defeat attempts by Russia, France and some other countries to move toward easing the sanctions imposed on Iraq by the United Nations after Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. </P>
<P> After a tour of U.N. Security Council members by U.N. envoy Madeleine Albright, Washington says it has the nine votes needed in the 15-member council to keep the sanctions regime unchanged. </P>
<P> In discussing this with the GCC, which groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, Christopher is likely to be preaching to the converted as Saudi Arabia and its allies want no leniency for Iraq. </P>
<P> But he will tread on more controversial ground when he broaches the issue of aid to the Palestinians. </P>
<P> U.S. officials say some Gulf Arab countries are among those who have been slow to deliver on pledges to help to finance Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho. </P>
<P> Christopher promised the Palestine Liberation Organization Friday that he would coax the reluctant donors. But Gulf Arab countries are short of cash due to low oil prices and the costs of the 1991 Gulf War that drove Iraq from Kuwait. </P>
<P> Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal met Assad in Damascus Saturday during a surprise visit which officials said focused on the stalled peace talks between Syria and Israel. </P>
<P> From Damascus, Christopher will go to Jordan Monday, return to Israel and probably pay one more visit to Syria before flying back to Washington Tuesday, U.S. officials said. </P>
