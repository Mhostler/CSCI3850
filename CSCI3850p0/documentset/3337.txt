<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Unbowed and unrepentant, former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders, fired Dec. 9 for her outspoken comments on drugs and sexuality, has said she will continue to speak out about the risks of sexually transmitted diseases. </P>
<P> Elders, who favored studying the legalization of drugs and the distribution of contraceptives on demand in public schools, was forced out of office after she publicly condoned the idea of teaching schoolchildren to masturbate as a way of avoiding the spread of AIDS. </P>
<P> In an article published in Tuesday's issue of the New York Times, Elders said she regretted that some of her statements on the dangers of sexually transmitted diseases and ways to prevent them have caused discomfort. </P>
<P> ``But I regret even more the realities they describe. </P>
<P> ``Sexual practices are, of course, best left to consenting adults, behind closed doors. But sex becomes a proper subject for government when sexual behavior endangers public health, as is clearly the case with AIDS and other diseases, or when it leads to increased poverty, ignorance and enslavement, as is the case with unplanned, unwanted children.'' </P>
<P> She said when young people do not have the support system that families can provide, they need to be given information about to protect themselves. </P>
<P> ``As parents, teachers and leaders, we cannot stand by and let our children slip away because of ignorance or a failure of courage. </P>
<P> ``This means telling the truth to our young people about the risks of their behavior and giving them ways to reduce these risks,'' she said. </P>
<P> Elders said while it was easier to stay on the sidelines and let others make things happen, she could not keep quiet when more and more teenagers engaged in sexual intercourse and fewer than half of them used condoms and when the rates of sexually transmitted diseases continued growing. </P>
<P> ``Change demands active involvement; sometimes one person with courage can make a majority,'' she said.  Elders is returning to the University of Arkansas School of Medicine, where she was professor of pediatrics for 26 years. </P>
<P> ``As I leave public life, I will continue to be a voice for the poor and the powerless ... to make the world a better place for all God's children,'' she added. </P>
