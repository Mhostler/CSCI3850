<P>  Foreign observers, allowed to watch Mexico's electoral process for the first time, said Tuesday the Sunday vote was marred by irregularities, but that it was a step forward for the country's democracy. </P>
<P> A high-level, U.S.-funded delegation told reporters that it noted problems ranging from voters turned away because they were not on registration lists to isolated cases of intimidation by party officials. </P>
<P> But the group, which included former Canadian Prime Minister Joe Clark, former President Vinicio Cerezo of Guatemala and former U.S. House Speaker Jim Wright, said the problems were not sufficient to offset the big margin of victory for ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) candidate Ernesto Zedillo. </P>
<P> ``The election represents a significant step forward for the Mexican democratic process,'' the delegation's report said. </P>
<P> With nearly 80 percent of the vote counted, Zedillo was leading by 22 percent over nearest rival Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the conservative National Action Party. </P>
<P> Separately, a group of 10 U.S. academic observers, including top specialists on Mexico, also noted irregularities which they said were most pronounced in isolated rural areas. </P>
<P> They cited the late opening of many polling places due to logistical problems and party representatives from all parties ''overstepping their authority'' by, for example, examining voter registration cards while people stood in lines to vote. </P>
<P> But they said that ``the conclusion ... is that the overall electoral process ... was proper, open and the voter turnout large.'' </P>
<P> A Canadian group of church and human rights officials said it saw no ``massive fraud,'' but that ``serious irregularities occurred at polling stations throughout the country.'' </P>
<P> These included reports in the state of Morelos of the ''carousel'' system, under which one person voted in several polling stations by using false identification and removing indelible ink on thumbs, a practice aimed at preventing such fraud. </P>
<P> The U.S.-funded group also complained that the election was marked by inequities during the campaign that gave the long-ruling PRI advantages over its opposition. </P>
<P> These included broadcast media bias in favor of Zedillo, use of state money for campaign purposes and the PRI's overwhelming financial resources. The delegation recommended a number of reforms to make future elections fair. </P>
<P> Nearly 1,000 foreign observers monitored the vote. It was the first time that Mexico had allowed outsiders in to witness an election. </P>
