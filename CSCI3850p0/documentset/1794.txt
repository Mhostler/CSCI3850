<P>  Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz and Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati expressed hopes for closer relations between their two countries during a meeting Monday at the United Nations, an Iranian source said. </P>
<P> Iran and Iraq, which fought a bloody war from 1980 to 1988, have diplomatic relations at the charge d'affaires level. But many issues stemming from the war remain unresolved. </P>
<P> These include the fate of thousands of prisoners or soldiers missing in action, Iranian claims for reparations, and the dredging and reopening of the Shatt al-Arab waterway. </P>
<P> Aziz was said to have repeated a two-year-old invitation for Velayati to visit Baghdad, but no date was set, the source said. </P>
<P> Velayati was reported to have spoken positively of the work of lower-level delegations which the two countries have exchanged from time to time. </P>
<P> The Iranian source said Velayati told a closed-door meeting earlier of the Organization of the Islamic Conference that Iran was concerned at the suffering of the Iraqi people as a result of U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Velayati was said to have called on all parties to take steps to bring this situation to an early end. </P>
