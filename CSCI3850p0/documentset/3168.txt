<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The director of the Oslo stock exchange has been found dead a day after he was fired from his job because of alleged financial irregularities, the bourse said Tuesday. </P>
<P> It gave no cause for the death of Erik Jarve, 50, whom it had fired for allegedly mixing his ``private economy and the economy of the bourse.'' </P>
<P> Jarve was appointed to head the exchange in 1977 and was the public face of the bourse for two decades. </P>
<P> The Norwegian news agency NTB quoted police as saying Jarve was found drowned in a lake near his summer house in the southern province of Telemark at 1:25 a.m. (local time). It offered no further details. </P>
<P> ``The Oslo Bourse has with deep sorrow received the message that bourse director Erik Jarve died during the night,'' a terse bourse statement said. </P>
<P> It said trading would not be discontinued but a 15-minute ceremony of remembrance would be held at 1 p.m. Brokers were asked to reduce business during that time. </P>
<P> Deputy bourse director Kjell Froensdal told Norwegian radio that the bourse was shocked by the news. </P>
<P> ``I am sure Jarve would have wanted us to continue trading as usual,'' Froensdal said. ``The bourse was his life. We will do it but at the same time have a ceremony of remembrance.'' </P>
<P> The bourse statement praised Jarve's ``outstanding work for the Oslo Bourse and the Norwegian equities market in the past 25 years.'' </P>
