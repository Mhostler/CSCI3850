<P>  Forget the formal royal handshake. The royal hug became the order of the day as Britain's Prince Charles continued his tour of riot-torn areas of Los Angeles Wednesday. </P>
<P> The prince, who was taken by surprise when choirmaster Iris Stevenson gave him a big hug during a visit to a high school Tuesday, was only too happy to oblige Wednesday when supermarket worker Ronnie Morgan asked him, ``Can I have a hug?'' </P>
<P> After Charles had thrown his arms around her, Morgan planted a kiss firmly on his cheek. </P>
<P> Asked why she did it, the petite black woman replied, ``I want to be the next princess.'' </P>
<P> Charles and his wife, Princess Diana, are estranged and their broken marriage has created scandals involving alleged affairs that the British tabloid press have pounced on. </P>
<P> In an authorized biography Charles says he never loved his wife and was pushed into the marriage by his father, the Duke of Edinburgh. </P>
<P> But the prince appeared to have left his marital woes at home as His Royal Highness became His Royal Hugness. </P>
<P> During his visit to the supermarket, in the predominantly black district of Inglewood, the prince did the very British thing of sitting down to tea and scones. </P>
<P> Charles chatted easily with supermarket workers who had been trained through the store's urban renewal program. He asked them about their work, their problems, and what it was like living in Los Angeles. </P>
<P> His easygoing style has earned him the name of Prince Charming in the local media. </P>
<P> ``He has got beautiful eyes. He is very charming,'' said store clerk Catherine Dunning. </P>
<P> The supermarket is also promoting British food as part of the UK/LA Festival, a two-month-long cultural, arts and trade event. </P>
<P> In preparation for Charles' visit, traditional British dishes were being showcased at the front of the store. Most prominent were the prince's favorite sweet biscuits, known as Duchy's Originals. </P>
<P> Following his visit to the store, the prince went on to the mainly Hispanic Boyle Heights section in East Los Angeles to visit the PUENTE Adult Job Training and Literacy Center. </P>
<P> PUENTE, which means bridge in Spanish, is an acronym for People United to Enrich the Neighborhood Through Education and the center teaches English to adult Hispanics and attempts to place them in jobs. </P>
<P> ``The only phrase I know in Spanish is totally unmentionable,'' Charles joked as he addressed the workers and students. </P>
<P> Wednesday was one of the quietest days of the prince's five-day tour. </P>
