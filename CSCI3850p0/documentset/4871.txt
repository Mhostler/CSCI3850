<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Iraq, claiming to have ``revived the glories of the Tower of Babel,'' inaugurated Sunday the 70-story Saddam Tower, which it said was the tallest building in the Middle East. </P>
<P> Ahmed Ismael, director of the Fao, company which built the tower, said the new structure was a symbol of Iraq's perseverance under crippling U.N. trade sanctions. </P>
<P> The skyscraper, which stands 666 feet high, rose from the rubble of an earlier project levelled by allied bombing in the early days of the Gulf War. </P>
<P> ``With the reconstruction of Saddam Tower, the Iraqis have revived today their glories of reconstructing the Tower of Babel,'' Ismael said. In the Bible, the Babylonian builders of the Tower of Babel intended it to reach the heavens. </P>
<P> Ismael said his engineers originally intended to build a 1,148-foot-high structure, ``but current conditions of the embargo stood as a hindrance.'' </P>
<P> The building's main function will be as a communications center for radio and television transmission across the country. </P>
<P> No estimates on cost are available. </P>
