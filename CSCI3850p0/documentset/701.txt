<P>  President Clinton is planning to announce Thursday his choice of Abner Mikva, chief judge of the federal appeals court here, as his next White House counsel, White House officials said Wednesday night. </P>
<P> Mikva, 68, would take over in September from Lloyd Cutler, the prominent Washington lawyer and Democratic party stalwart who had agreed to serve only 130 days, the limit for a special government employee. </P>
<P> Cutler, a senior partner at the law firm of Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering, took over from Clinton's first White House counsel, Bernard Nussbaum. </P>
<P> Nussbaum resigned last spring under criticism for his role in White House-Treasury contacts about a federal investigation of an Arkansas savings and loan that touched on Clinton. </P>
<P> Mikva served in the House of Representatives and in the Illinois legislature before being named to the federal bench by President Jimmy Carter in 1979. </P>
<P> A senior White House official said Clinton knew Mikva well, although it was not immediately clear how so. </P>
<P> ``He's an extraordinary lawyer and judge and is very well respected,'' the official said. ``Having served in Congres he has political savvy as well as legal experience.'' </P>
<P> Mikva's appointment will be the first major White House personnel change since Leon Panetta took over as chief of staff last month from Thomas ``Mack'' McLarty. </P>
<P> Panetta is expected to recommend a White House staff shakeup to Clinton soon. </P>
