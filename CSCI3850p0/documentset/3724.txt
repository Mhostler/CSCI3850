<P>  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin meets Jordan's King Hussein in Amman Thursday to discuss implementing more of their two-month-old peace treaty, an Israeli spokeswoman said. </P>
<P> ``It's this evening with the king,'' she said. ``It's in Amman.'' </P>
<P> An Israeli spokesman earlier said only that they would meet soon. </P>
<P> Before the peace treaty ending a 46-year-old formal state of war, such meetings were always shrouded in secrecy. </P>
<P> The treaty was only Israel's second with an Arab state after Egypt in 1979. The spokeswoman said Rabin and the king would be talking about implementing further stages of the agreement. </P>
