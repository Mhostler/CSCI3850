<P>  The Walt Disney Co Tuesday said it named Sidney Poitier to its board of directors, filling the unexpired term held by late Disney president Frank Wells. </P>
<P> The term runs until the annual stockholders meeting in February. Wells died last April in a helicopter accident in eastern Nevada. </P>
<P> Poitier, 67, an actor, director and writer, became the first black to win an Academy Award for Best Actor. He won the prize in 1963 for his role in ``Lillies of the Field.'' </P>
<P> ``The world knows Sidney Poitier as a superb actor and a true artist,'' said Disney chairman Michael Eisner. ``But Sidney's talent is more than screen deep. His election to our board brings us not only his exhaustive knowledge of the entertainment industry but the judgment and wisdom of an exceptional man.'' </P>
<P> Poitier, who has starred in 40 films, is chief executive officer of Verdon-Cedric Productions, co-president of First Artists Productions Ltd and a director of SpectraVision Inc . </P>
<P> He has also directed nine shows and written four. </P>
<P> Poitier was born in Miami and grew up on Cat Island in the Bahamas, where his parents owned a tomato farm. After Army service during World War II, he worked as a janitor at the American Negro Theater in return for acting lessons. </P>
<P> He holds honorary doctorate degrees from Sarah Lawrence College, the University of Miami and Morehouse College. </P>
