<P>  U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross said Saturday after meeting the leaders of Syria and Israel that further preparations were needed before talks could be held between military chiefs of the two countries. </P>
<P> ``I think we ought to continue to prepare the ground before we have the experts meet so any meeting would be productive. We still have a ways to go,'' Ross told Israel's army radio after his latest effort to advance the Middle East peace process. </P>
<P> Ross met Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin Saturday night after six hours of talks in Syria with President Hafez al-Assad. He began his Middle East shuttle Thursday in Israel and was expected to go to Egypt Sunday. </P>
<P> Israel's chief negotiator with Syria, Itamar Rabinovich, attended the Rabin-Ross meeting and described Syria's position as ``disappointing.'' He said Damascus was blocking a resumption of military talks. </P>
<P> ``What is delaying it is the lack of willingness on the Syrian part to enter into such a discussion,'' said Rabinovitch, Israel's ambassador to the United States. </P>
<P> ``If the Syrians decide they want to keep this slow pace and tough style of negotiations, that is obviously their right but what pays the price are the negotiations.'' </P>
<P> In Syria, diplomats said Assad and Ross reviewed the latest talks between the Israeli and Syrian ambassadors in Washington and the possibility of expanding negotiations to include military officials. </P>
<P> Syrian officials said there was no breakthrough. The Israeli and Syrian chiefs of staff met in Washington in December but no progress was reported. </P>
<P> After more than three years of sparring, peace efforts are stalled over the Golan Heights, captured by Israel from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war. </P>
<P> Damascus demands a full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan. Israel says it will not discuss the scope of a pullout before Syria agrees to establish full normal diplomatic relations. </P>
<P> Syrian officials said Israel had not shown any change regarding the Golan Heights and security arrangements there. </P>
