<P>  Russia's prosecutors office held an emergency meeting Saturday to weigh legal action against top military officials who refused to obey their commanders during the Chechnya campaign, Interfax news agency said. </P>
<P> Interfax said its information came from Sergei Nosovets, head of the information department in President Boris Yeltsin's administration. The agency did not say who attended the meeting or which officials were under scrutiny. </P>
<P> Officials were not immediately available for comment. </P>
<P> Gen. Ivan Babichev, who led one of Russia's military columns to Chechnya, said at an early stage of the campaign he would not shoot at civilians who tried to block the troops' movement after the operation had started. </P>
<P> Newspapers later said Babichev was among the Russian commanders heading the offensive on the Chechen capital, Grozny. </P>
<P> In all other cases Moscow officials have denied media reports about discontent among the military sent to quell Chechnya's three-year independence bid and rejected reports that senior commanders had disobeyed orders. </P>
