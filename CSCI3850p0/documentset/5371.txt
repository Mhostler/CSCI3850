<P>  President Clinton arrived Friday night in his home state after a 10-hour trip to Haiti during which he took part in ceremonies marking the official end of the six-month U.S. mission to restore democracy to the Caribbean nation. </P>
<P> A 6,000-member force assembled by the United Nations has taken over peacekeeping duties from U.S. troops who swept ashore last September to help restore to power President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the democratically elected Haitian leader ousted in a 1991 military coup. </P>
<P> Clinton told reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Little Rock that he had been overwhelmed by the reception he received from U.S. servicemen in Haiti. He said he had been very impressed by ``those amazing kids in uniform.'' </P>
<P> Shortly after he left, witnesses reported hearing gunfire they blamed on a disturbance at the national penitentiary. It was not immediately clear how serious the incident was. </P>
<P> The president, who changed from his business suit into jeans and a polo shirt for the trip home, said he planned to watch the NCAA basketball tournament on television and cheer for the Arkansas Razorbacks. </P>
<P> ``I have to have something else to think about, otherwise I'll go nuts,'' he said. </P>
<P> Clinton will stay in Arkansas for the weekend. He plans to play golf and relax. </P>
