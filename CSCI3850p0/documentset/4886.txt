<P>  Sardinian kidnappers desperate to dupe a family into believing their dead hostage was still alive killed another man and sent them a piece of his ear, Italian newspapers reported Monday. </P>
<P> They said genetic DNA tests on the piece of flesh, mailed one year ago to the family of kidnapped Sardinian pharmacist Antonio Ruiu, had shown it was from another man. </P>
<P> The reports, which appeared in all leading newspapers, said investigators suspected the severed ear belonged to Giuseppe Sechi, a 20-year-old Sardinian who disappeared without trace on March 21 last year after visiting his girlfriend. </P>
<P> Police declined to comment on the reports, which said Sechi had probably been seized and murdered by Ruiu's kidnappers simply so they could slice off his ear. </P>
<P> Ruiu, 42, was seized by masked kidnappers on Oct. 22, 1993, on the edge of Orune, his home village north of the town of Nuoro in the rugged center of the Mediterranean island. </P>
<P> A piece of his ear was posted to his family two months later. But it was badly decomposed and relatives demanded further proof that Ruiu was still alive. </P>
<P> Police believe Ruiu was probably killed during the kidnapping, possibly after recognizing one of his abductors. </P>
<P> Sardinian and Calabrian kidnap gangs frequently send a piece of a victim's ear to hostages' families to raise pressure for payment. </P>
<P> At least seven cases have occurred in the past 22 years. In 1992 the macabre ritual was carried out on a seven-year-old boy and photographed by the kidnappers. Police freed the boy, Farouk Kassam, in July 1992. </P>
