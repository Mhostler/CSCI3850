<P>  Staid old-guard communists in cheap gray suits and punks with wild spiky hair celebrated together Sunday when reform communists boosted their parliamentary power in Germany's general election. </P>
<P> An ear-splitting cheer erupted at the campaign headquarters of the Party of Democratic Socialism when German television predicted the PDS would win at least three and perhaps four constituencies. </P>
<P> Under complex election rules, this means they would return to the Bonn parliament with about a dozen more seats. </P>
<P> As a Dixieland Jazz band blared out tunes including ``Happy Days Are Here Again,'' a convention center packed with more than 2,000 PDS backers danced into the evening, toasting their resurrection with beer, bratwurst and backslapping. </P>
<P> ``It's the biggest party in Berlin,'' said German television of the improbable gathering where aging communists with neatly combed hair shouted for joy alongside punks with their crazy coiffures dyed in green, pink, orange and blue hues. </P>
<P> ``It's a great day for Germany,'' said Arnold Hagen, a 50-year-old unemployed east Berlin diplomat. ``There is now a genuine alternative party. The people will not accept unemployment and crime as something that's unavoidable.'' </P>
<P> Christine Hoffman, a 21-year-old punk with green hair, said she disliked political parties, but found the PDS acceptable. </P>
<P> ``They're not like the others,'' she said. </P>
<P> Germany's two main ARD and ZDF television stations predicted the PDS would win three and perhaps even four direct seats in the east and so return to parliament even if it did not clear the normal five percent minimum. </P>
<P> Television projections had the PDS winning 4.3 percent nationwide, meaning it would have 29 seats in the next 656-seat legislature. That is up from 17 seats in 1990. </P>
<P> ``It's a historic achievement that we've been returned to parliament,'' said the PDS's charismatic leader Gregor Gysi. ``We now have a good chance of becoming a leftist party nationwide and not just for eastern Germany.'' </P>
<P> Dismissed as a party for the incorrigible old guard when it won just 2.4 percent of the nationwide vote in 1990, the PDS has since been rejuvenated under Gysi and new leaders. </P>
