<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The self-appointed leader of an Austrian neo-Nazi group was sentenced Thursday to two years in jail after being convicted of being a member of a banned neo-Nazi organization. </P>
<P> The state prosecutor lodged an immediate appeal against what he said was a mild sentence on Gerhard Endres, 34. </P>
<P> The court found Endres guilty on four charges, including taking over the leadership of the People's Extra-Parliamentary Opposition (VAPO), a banned neo-Nazi organization, following the arrest in 1992 of its leader Gottfried Kuessel. </P>
<P> The other charges were long-term membership in VAPO, helping to finance the organization and participation in procuring 15 Soviet-made shotguns. </P>
<P> Austria outlaws neo-Nazi organizations and bans any justification of Nazi deeds or crimes. </P>
<P> Endres faced up to 20 years imprisonment, but the judge said he was handing down a relatively mild sentence because Endres had no previous convictions. </P>
<P> Kuessel, 36, regarded as the German-speaking world's top neo-Nazi, was sentenced last September to 10 years in jail. </P>
