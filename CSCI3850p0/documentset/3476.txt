<DATELINE>TUNIS, Tunisia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Algeria's radical Armed Islamic Group (GIA) said Wednesday it killed four Catholic priests in Algeria after four of its members were killed when French commandos stormed a jetliner to end a hijacking in Marseille.  The priests, three Frenchmen and a Belgian, were killed in Algeria Tuesday, the day after the commandos ended the hijacking, which began Saturday in Algiers. </P>
<P> In a statement faxed to news organizations, the GIA said the priests died as part of a campaign of ``annihilation and physical liquidation of Christian crusaders.'' </P>
<P> The group, which has emerged as one of Algeria's most hard-line Muslim fundamentalist factions, said the priests were killed after four of its own ``soldiers'' died in the hijacking. </P>
<P> The four were members of the same unit that killed the priests at the Algerian town of Tizi-Ouzou Tuesday, it added. </P>
<P> ``The Armed Islamic Group will, God willing, continue its Jihad (fight) against all who stand in the way of achieving the supremacy on earth of God's sharia (Islamic law) and the establishment of a wise caliphate (Islamic state).'' </P>
<P> The statement was signed by Abou Abderrahmane Amine, named as the group's prince and identified by Algerian newspapers as the new leader of the group. </P>
<P> France meanwhile, was investigating whether the hijackers had accomplices in France. The Paris public prosecutor's office started legal action against ``persons unknown'' for complicity in the hijacking, justice sources said. </P>
<P> The Algerian government acknowledged there had been lapses in security at the Algiers airport which may have played a role in the hijacking and said it would correct them. </P>
<P> It also denied it had submitted to pressure from Paris when it allowed the airliner to leave Algiers for Marseille, saying it had based its decision to let the plane take off solely on a desire to ``save lives.'' </P>
<P> Algerian authorities said Wednesday the priests were gunned down after they resisted a kidnap attempt involving three Muslim fundamentalist gunmen. </P>
<P> An official security statement carried by Algeria's news agency APS said three militants posing as security forces members asked the priests to accompany them from their church in the town of Tizi-Ouzou. </P>
<P> When the priests refused, the gunmen forced them to the church courtyard and shot them, the statement said. </P>
<P> The statement said security forces launched a hunt for the killers, who had abandoned their getaway car. </P>
<P> Eight priests and monks have been killed in Algeria in the past seven months. </P>
