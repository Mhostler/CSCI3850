<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Mexico's ruling party candidate Ernesto Zedillo said he won Sunday's presidential elections cleanly and invited his opponents Monday to join him in drafting a government platform to take the nation into the 21st century. </P>
<P> Zedillo, beaming as he addressed several thousand wildly cheering supporters at the Revolutionary Institutional Party (PRI) headquarters, said he no longer considered his rivals adversaries but partners in building the nation. </P>
<P> ``The next government must be a government of all,'' he said. ``I call on each and every presidential candidate, all parties and all political forces to take part in a dialogue which, while respecting our rivalry, will lead to a common platform for everyone.'' </P>
<P> He stressed that the PRI, in power for 65 years, had won fairly. </P>
<P> Zedillo, a 42-year-old Yale-educated economist, said the balloting Sunday had been ``peaceful, clean, legal, well-attended and transparent.'' </P>
<P> Apparently alluding to past allegations of fraudulent tactics by the party, he said: ``The PRI has shown that neither now nor never will there be a place for practices that in the past could have darkened our triumphs.'' </P>
<P> With nearly 39 percent of the ballots counted, Zedillo led the presidential race Monday with 48.06 per cent of the vote, according to the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE). </P>
<P> In second place was conservative lawyer Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the National Action Party (PAN), with 30.12 percent.  Center-left candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, running third with 16.07 percent, said there had been huge fraud and urged his Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) to peacefully protest the government in rallies across the country Saturday. </P>
<P> The leading Mexican observer group, Alianza Civica, also expressed doubts about the fairness of the election, in which nine presidential candidates competed. </P>
<P> Foreign observers' initial reaction was to generally give the election a clean bill. </P>
<P> Sunday's elections were widely viewed as a watershed with many predicting unrest if Mexicans perceived widespread fraud to keep the PRI, the world's longest-ruling party still in power, in office. </P>
<P> In a meeting with foreign correspondents Sunday, Zedillo attributed the PRI's strong showing to the party's political base and organizational abilities. </P>
<P> He also said it followed advice of ``political marketers'' to run a positive campaign highlighting his proposals for his six-year administration. </P>
