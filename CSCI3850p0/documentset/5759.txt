<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS, Indiana, April 15 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Derek Harper hit a 3-pointer with 7.5 seconds left to lift the New York Knicks to their fifth straight win, an 88-84 victory over the Indiana Pacers Friday in a possible preview of an Eastern Conference playoff matchup. </P>
<P> After Rik Smits tied the game with 31 seconds to play, John Starks let the shot clock wind down before finding Harper deep in the left corner for the game winner. </P>
<P> ``We played with pride,'' said Knicks coach Pat Riley. ''This game comes down to one shot. They had a lot at stake, we had a lot at stake.'' </P>
<P> Patrick Ewing scored 30 points and grabbed 12 rebounds as New York extended its lead to 3 3/8 games over the Pacers for second place in the Eastern Conference standings. </P>
<P> ``We definitely wanted to beat them and definitely want the homecourt advantage (in the playoffs),'' Ewing said. </P>
<P> Derrick McKey scored 23 points for the Pacers, who saw their lead over second-place Charlotte dwindle to a half game in the Central Division. </P>
<P> The Pacers held a 68-60 advantage heading into the fourth quarter, but Hubert Davis hit a jumper and Greg Anthony drilled two straight 3-pointers to tie it. </P>
<P> ``The key was the start of the fourth quarter,'' Riley said. ''We hit three consecutive jumpers and got right back into it.'' </P>
<P> At Detroit, Greg Sutton scored five of his 14 points in a 14-3 fourth-quarter run as the Charlotte Hornets rallied for a 94-86 victory over the Pistons. </P>
<P> Sutton, taking over for an injured Muggsy Bogues at point guard, scored 12 points in the final 13 minutes as the Hornets beat Detroit for the 10th straight time. </P>
<P> Alonzo Mourning scored 23 points and grabbed 13 rebounds for the Hornets, who have won three straight games to keep the pressure on the Pacers in the Central Division race. </P>
<P> Allan Houston scored 21 points for the Pistons, who were mathematically eliminated from the playoff hunt. </P>
<P> In San Antonio, David Robinson scored 32 points and pulled down 16 rebounds to lead the Spurs to a 98-88 victory over the Sacramento Kings. </P>
<P> Dennis Rodman added 15 rebounds in his return from a 14-game absence with a separated shoulder. </P>
<P> Sean Elliott scored 17 points for San Antonio, which had lost its last two games after a 15-game winning streak as the Spurs extended their lead to two games over second-place Utah in the Midwest Division. </P>
<P> Mitch Richmond scored 22 points for Sacramento, which fell a game behind Denver in the race for the final Western Conference playoff berth. </P>
<P> In Denver, Bryant Stith scored a season-high 27 points as the Nuggets moved into a Western Conference playoff spot with a 102-87 victory over the Phoenix Suns. </P>
<P> Reggie Williams scored 17 points and Dale Ellis added 16 for Denver, which won its third straight game despite the absence of leading scorer Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf who sat out with a leg injury. </P>
<P> Kevin Johnson scored 24 points and Charles Barkley netted 16 for Phoenix, which fell into a first-place tie with idle Seattle in the Pacific Division. </P>
<P> In Cleveland, Tony Campbell came off the bench to score 11 of his 15 points in the second quarter as the Cavaliers beat the Atlanta Hawks 83-70 to solidify their hold on sixth place in the Eastern Conference. </P>
<P> Tyrone Hill had 16 points and 18 rebounds and John Williams added 16 points to help the Cavs move two games ahead of the Hawks. Both teams have four games remaining. </P>
<P> Andrew Lang scored 15 points and Steve Smith added 13 for the Hawks, who were held to their lowest point total of the season. </P>
<P> At Minnesota, Isaiah Rider's 3-pointer with 1:37 left in overtime snapped a tie as the Timberwolves beat the Milwaukee Bucks 104-100. </P>
<P> Christian Laettner had 25 points and 11 rebounds and Tom Gugliotta and Rider each scored 23 points for Minnesota, which snapped a four-game losing streak and won for only the second time in its last 11 games. </P>
<P> Glenn Robinson scored 28 points and Marty Conlon netted 19 for the Bucks, who fell two games behind Boston in the battle for the final playoff spot in the East. </P>
