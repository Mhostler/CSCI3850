<P>  British playwright John Osborne, the ``Angry Young Man'' known for his contempt of homosexuals, had a secret gay lover, a newspaper claimed Tuesday. </P>
<P> Osborne, whose 1956 play ``Look Back in Anger'' revolutionized the theater, died last month at the age of 65. </P>
<P> Evening Standard arts correspondent Nicholas de Jongh said the irascible five-times married Osborne took one secret to the grave with him -- a love affair with fellow actor Anthony Creighton in the 1950s that lasted almost 10 years and continued through two marriages. </P>
<P> ``It was a love affair. A good, happy, supportive and enduring relationship,'' De Jongh quoted Creighton, now 72, as saying. </P>
<P> The revelation comes as a surprise given Osborne's public contempt for homosexuals. He once declared; ``I have been blessed with God's two greatest gifts -- to be born English and heterosexual.'' </P>
<P> ``I think John was a hypocrite. In his autobiography he 'outs' me with contempt - and without my permission. Yet it was he who had a homosexual affair with me,'' Creighton said. </P>
<P> ``In his plays and journalism John subjected homosexuals to derision, contempt and malice. And I think people should be able to appreciate that (Osborne's play) 'Patriot for Me', which stigmatizes homosexuality, is a projection of his own self-hatred,'' he added. </P>
<P> Creighton said he believed neither of Osborne's first two wives realized the playwright was also sleeping with his close male friend. </P>
<P> He said the affair ended shortly before Osborne's marriage to his third wife Penelope Gilliatt. Creighton's own theatrical career petered out and he severed ties with the stage world. </P>
