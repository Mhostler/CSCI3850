<P>  Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle said Friday he was hopeful Dr. Henry Foster would be confirmed as U.S. Surgeon General despite opposition from powerful Republicans Bob Dole and Phil Gramm. </P>
<P> Daschle said Foster was being held hostage by Republican presidential politics. He warned Democrats might retaliate if a Senate vote was not allowed on President Clinton's nominee. </P>
<P> ``If they want to play right-wing political games with somebody with this qualified background, then I really hold out little hope that we'll get a lot more done this year on things that ought to be addressed in a meaningful way,'' he said. Democrats have enough votes to stop Senate action. </P>
<P> Many conservative and anti-abortion groups oppose the 61-year-old black Tennessee doctor because he performed 39 abortions. He was nominated in February to replace Joycelyn Elders, who stepped down after making controversial comments about sexuality. </P>
<P> ``Dr. Foster's nomination ought not to be held hostage to Pat Buchanan and Bob Dornan,'' Daschle said, referring to two conservative Republican presidential candidates. Dole, of Kansas, and Gramm, a Texan, are also seeking the nomination. </P>
<P> Foster won bipartisan praise this week at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, but Majority Leader Dole told Daschle Thursday he has not decided if he will allow a vote in the full Senate, and Gramm has said he will filibuster if Foster's name is brought up. </P>
<P> ``I'm encouraged by his (Dole's) letter. He didn't say he wouldn't bring Dr. Foster's nomination to the floor,'' Daschle told reporters. </P>
<P> ``Bob Dole is one of the fairest persons I've had an opportunity to work with,'' he added. </P>
<P> Daschle, of South Dakota, said a growing number of Republican senators believed Foster deserved a vote. </P>
<P> ``If Phil Gramm or others choose to filibuster his nomination, I'm increasingly optimistic we can invoke cloture and get a vote on Dr. Foster,'' Daschle said. </P>
<P> A cloture motion to shut off debate requires 60 votes. Republicans have a 54-46 Senate majority. </P>
