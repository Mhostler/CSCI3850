<P>  Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam will pay an official visit to North Korea in the next three months after going to South Korea and Japan with Communist Party boss Do Muoi, a government spokeswoman said on Thursday. </P>
<P> ``Vietnam attaches importance to consolidating and developing the traditional relations with the People's Democratic Republic of Korea (North Korea),'' Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Ho The Lan told reporters. </P>
<P> Cam would go to Pyongyang in the second quarter of this year, she said. He will be the most senior Vietnamese official to visit since Defence Minister Doan Khue last June. </P>
<P> Vietnam and North Korea are two of the world's five remaining communist-ruled countries. Lan said they had maintained friendly relations for a long time and it was normal for them to exchange views. </P>
<P> But she spoke more fulsomely at a regular press briefing about prospects for developing Vietnam's economic ties with South Korea and Japan when Muoi, the Communist Party General Secretary, visits Seoul and Tokyo from next Tuesday. </P>
<P> Lan said agreements, which she did not specify, were expected to be signed during the visits. </P>
<P> Vietnam, South Korea and Japan ``share the desire to broaden cooperation for development in each country in the interests of peace and stability in the region,'' she said. </P>
<P> ``It is certain that the visits...will help to bring relations between Vietnam and these countries to a new stage with greater scale, larger extent and higher efficiency.'' </P>
<P> South Korea is the fourth biggest investor in Vietnam since 1988 and Japan the fifth. Japan is Vietnam's biggest aid donor and trading partner. </P>
<P> Muoi, 78, will be the first Vietnamese party boss to visit either country. </P>
<P> He will be accompanied by Cam, a member of the party's politburo, Hong Ha, secretary of its executive Central Committee, Deputy Prime Minister Tran Duc Luong, Trade Minister Le Van Triet and Do Quoc Sam, head of the State Planning Committee. </P>
