<P>  The Clinton administration said Friday it was looking at all available means to carry out its policy of pressuring Iran politically and economically, and stressed that a deal between Conoco Inc. and Iran to develop oil and gas fields runs afoul of this policy. </P>
<P> State Department spokeswoman Christine Shelly at a news briefing said the administration stressed to Conoco officials in meetings this week that the company's plan to develop huge offshore oil and gas fields with Iran was ``inconsistent'' with U.S. policy. </P>
<P> ``We constantly look at all of the means which we have at our disposal to try to attain more effectively our policy objectives'' of containing Iran, Shelly said at a news briefing. But she would not say this meant the administration will try to block the deal. </P>
<P> Shelly said Conoco officials provided the administration with details of the agreement with National Iranian Oil Company to develop Iran's Sirri A and E offshore oil and gas fields. Officials said talks with Conoco continued Friday. </P>
<P> Shelly also said she ``had nothing specific'' to say about legislation pending in Congress to ban all economic and financial transactions with Iran. </P>
<P> ``However at this point I would not rule anything out,'' she said, declining to say whether the administration has a position on the legislation. </P>
<P> Conoco's agreement with Iran is ``something that we will be working on over the next several days and weeks,'' she said. </P>
<P> Currently, American companies are allowed to buy oil from Iran but may not resell it in the United States. </P>
<P> Shelly said the United States considers Iran to be ``an outlaw nation,'' and U.S. policy is to try to block Iran from gaining armaments and weapons of mass destruction. </P>
<P> White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Tuesday that ``this type of cooperation with Iran is inconsistent with the policy that we've maintained to bring pressure to bear on Iran both politically and economically to get them to change many things that we consider objectionable and contrary to the interests of the international community.'' </P>
<P> U.S. officials have said Conoco was not legally obligated to seek U.S. government approval before entering that type of agreement. </P>
