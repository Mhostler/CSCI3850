<P>  Irish Republican Gerry Adams urged Northern Ireland's angry Protestant politicians Wednesday not to boycott talks to end 25 years of conflict. </P>
<P> ``We want to try to bring about a peace settlement and if Unionists are saying ``no' to that, then I think they are misjudging both the opportunity and the mood of people both within this state and within this island,'' he said. </P>
<P> Adams was reacting to Unionist threats to boycott all-party talks on a lasting Northern Ireland settlement, which will consider a controversial ``framework document'' that the British and Irish governments could unveil next week. </P>
<P> Adams, leader of the Irish Republican Army's political wing, Sinn Fein, stands to be invited to the new talks following an IRA ceasefire last September which heralded a period of peace the British province has not known for a quarter century. </P>
<P> The Unionist threat cast fresh shadows over a joint drive by Britain and Ireland to draw up diplomatic and constitutional guidelines on which to base a lasting settlement. </P>
<P> British Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew and Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring said they were close to finalising the document after five-hour talks in Belfast on Tuesday capped two years of complex negotiation. </P>
<P> But Unionists, from the 60 percent Protestant majority, said they fear the plan will dilute their cherished British sovereignty and quickly denounced the still-secret draft. They said they would boycott talks when they are eventually held. </P>
<P> ``I think there is a very serious danger that the government has made a massive misjudgement of the situation despite the numerous warnings and advice they have been given over the months,'' David Trimble of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) said. </P>
<P> Trimble said the plan could set up cross-border bodies that would be tantamount to a reunification of Ireland or joint rule by Dublin and London under the guise of economic cooperation. </P>
<P> But Britain and Ireland insist that the document is only a discussion paper that would have to be approved in referendums before adoption. </P>
<P> Irish Prime Minister John Bruton told the Dublin parliament that neither Catholic nor Protestant had anything to fear. ``There is no ground for fear of any kind by any party..'' </P>
<P> Adams, whose party seeks the reunification of Ireland, said that it was a discussion paper and would probably contain suggestions that his party would also oppose. </P>
<P> Unlike mainstream Unionist parties, smaller fringe Protestant parties linked to pro-British guerrillas say they will wait to judge the document on its merits. </P>
<P> Billy Hutchinson, leader of the Progressive Unionist Party told journalists: ``I think that the people of Northern Ireland believe that they can have peace on this island, and that they can keep both the IRA and the Loyalist paramilitaries on a ceasefire. I am confident the ceasefire will hold.'' </P>
