<P>  Tourists visiting the White House Thursday got a pleasant surprise -- a piece of birthday cake to mark the 202nd anniversary of the Executive Mansion. </P>
<P> White House staff members served pieces of white, chocolate and yellow cake with red, white and blue icing to visitors as they completed their tours in a driveway in front of the president's house. </P>
<P> ``It's just a fun thing,'' said Marc Hoberman, assistant director of the White House Visitors' Office, which oversees the Tuesday-through-Saturday tours of the historic building. </P>
<P> Hoberman said Navy cooks who prepare food for the White House Mess -- the president's dining room -- baked 36 cakes for the occasion. Between 5,500 and 6,500 people were expected to get some before the day was out, he said. </P>
<P> Although cynics might see sinister political overtones in the tourist treat with congressional elections less than a month away, Hoberman said the cake giveaway began last year and he hopes to make it an annual tradition. </P>
<P> The cornerstone of the White House was laid on October 13, 1792. John Adams, America's second president, was the first U.S. leader to occupy the federalist-style building. </P>
