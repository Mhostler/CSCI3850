<P>  The head of a moderate Democratic organization advised President Clinton Wednesday to view the mid-term election as a wake-up call in preparation for the 1996 presidential election. </P>
<P> Al From, president of the Democratic Leadership Council, told reporters that Clinton can win re-election by a majority if he seizes the center of the political spectrum. </P>
<P> Clinton, former chairman of the DLC an organization designed to move the party from the left toward the middle, won the presidency with less than a majority of the vote, 43 percent, against Republican George Bush with 37 percent and Ross Perot with nearly 19 percent. </P>
<P> From saw the political system ``in turmoil'' with many swing voters willing to go for a third party candidate again. </P>
<P> But he said Clinton is ``surprisingly well positioned'' to win over those angry voters if he builds on a mainstream political agenda in Congress. </P>
<P> ``Democrats have to look at next Tuesday's election as a wake-up call,'' From said. </P>
<P> ``As a candidate, Bill Clinton spoke about a new synthesis in governing,'' From said. ``If President Clinton can find his voice from the 1992 campaign, Republican gains in 1994, hopwever, large, will be short-lived. </P>
<P> Republicans are counting on big victories next Tuesday and are aiming for control of the Senate by winning the seven necessary seats for a majority and are shooting for the more distant target of House control too. </P>
<P> From has hired Clinton's pollster, Stan Greenberg, to study independent voters immediately after the election to learn about their preferences in preparing for the 1996 election. </P>
<P> Separately, Greenberg is finding Democrats are making headway in the closing days of this campaign, White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said. </P>
