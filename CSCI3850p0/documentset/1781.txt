<P>  Two more women will run for president in Peru's elections next April as well as Susana Higuchi, who is trying to unseat her husband President Alberto Fujimori, party officials said Monday. </P>
<P> Lourdres Flores Nano, head of the largest opposition party in Peru's congress, was heading for certain victory in internal elections by the Popular Christian Party (PPC) to choose a presidential candidate. </P>
<P> The larger but widely discredited Aprista party of former president Alan Garcia chose Mercedes Cabanillas, who was education minister under Garcia, as its candidate in another internal election, party officials said. </P>
<P> The PPC, which had contemplated supporting former United Nations secretary-general Javier Perez de Cuellar in his bid for president, decided to present its own candidate in an effort to win representation in Peru's Congress. </P>
<P> Seven candidates, including Higuchi who is standing as an independent, have declared their candidacy. </P>
<P> Fujimori, who is eligible to stand for reelection, has yet to declare his candidacy but most analysts expect he will. </P>
