<P>  Elvis Stojko put aside his injury problems to produce a masterful short program as he began defense of his crown at the world figure skating championships Wednesday. </P>
<P> The 23-year-old Canadian skated cautiously but was flawless in a brilliant display of jumping that belied the trouble he has had with his right ankle for the past eight weeks. </P>
<P> The first of the top contenders to skate, he began with a splendid triple axel-triple toe loop jump combination which, because of the injury, he had not been able to land until last week. </P>
<P> He followed with a superb triple lutz and a closing double axel that was absolutely perfect along with an exciting footwork sequence down the middle of the ice. </P>
<P> Stojko earned marks of between 5.7 and 5.9 out of 6.0 for the elements and five 5.8s for presentation from the nine-judge panel. </P>
<P> ``It felt great. There was so much adrenalin pumping I didn't think about the ankle,'' he said. ``I was just concentrating on the skating. </P>
<P> ``The challenge to myself was to do it for myself and not back down.'' </P>
<P> His coach Doug Leigh said: ``This had nothing to do with gold medals or defending a title. All the medals on his wall were put aside today. </P>
<P> ``He lived up to the challenge. He was unbelievable.'' </P>
<P> Stojko injured his ankle landing a jump just prior to the Canadian championships in January and was forced to abandon his defense of that title. His training has been seriously hampered since then. </P>
<P> His marks might have been higher except that all the other contenders had to skate later in the day and the judges had to leave room in case they performed even better than the Canadian. </P>
