<P>  Argentina's government, trying to quell an emotional debate over victims of the military's ``dirty war'' on leftists in the late 1970s, admitted Monday it had bungled a list of 545 newly discovered victims. </P>
<P> The ruling Peronists, struggling to gain the upper hand in the pre-election debate over the ``desaparecidos'' (disappeared), were forced to acknowledge opposition allegations that one person on the list is in fact still alive. They refused to accept that two other people on the list were also alive, despite confirmation in one case from the Argentine consul in Paris. </P>
<P> According to official estimates, 10,000 people disappeared after being kidnapped and tortured by the military, presumably to suffer the same fate as the 4,000 confirmed dead. </P>
<P> Human Rights Undersecretary Alicia Pierini blamed errors in the list published Friday on transcription mistakes and President Carlos Menem accused Radical presidential candidate Horacio Massaccesi of using the issue for political ends. </P>
<P> ``Votes are won with proposals, plans and ideas, not by taking advantage of situations like this whose only result is bringing sadness to victims' families,'' Menem said. </P>
<P> Under pressure to furnish lists of victims of the 1976-83 military regime, the government insists no such data exist and has produced instead a list of formerly unidentified cases. But Radical politician Cesar Gass said the government had caused his family grief and was itself engaging in electioneering by rushing out inaccurate data. </P>
<P> Gass's 18-year-old son Leandro was mistakenly included in the list -- he was kidnapped with his mother but released -- but his brother Sergio did disappear. He said the information given by the government was not what bereaved families want. </P>
<P> ``Everyone knows who the 'desaparecidos' are, the only thing one wants to know is who killed them and where they are,'' he said.  The ``dirty war'' nightmare has been revived by confessions of an ex-navy officer about detainees being thrown alive from aircraft into the Atlantic. Menem himself added to the rash of chilling reminiscences by telling the CBS television program ''60 Minutes'' about his own imprisonment on a navy ship, when he saw hooded prisoners brought abroad and heard their screams as they were tortured in the hold. </P>
