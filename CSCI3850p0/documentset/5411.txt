<DATELINE>MOSCOW, April 3 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev said on Monday Moscow might stop complying with a crucial treaty on the reduction of conventional arms if NATO rapidly expanded its membership to East European countries. </P>
<P> Grachev told a news conference Russia could effectively be isolated from the rest of the continent if former Soviet bloc countries were admitted to the Alliance. </P>
<P> ``Counter measures could be taken,'' Grachev said in reply to reporters' questions after an hour-long meeting with U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry. </P>
<P> ``We would not abide by the Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty. And we might create necessary military groups in the most threatening directions and set up closer cooperation with other CIS countries.'' </P>
<P> Rejecting the CFE treaty could give Russia a free hand in the tinderbox Caucasus region, where it is battling to suppress an independence drive by the separatist Chechnya region. </P>
<P> The CFE treaty, signed in 1990 by members of NATO and the now-defunct Warsaw Pact, provides for the biggest conventional weapons cuts in arms control history and fixed the distribution of troops and armour. </P>
<P> The treaty, which includes 30 nations and covers an area from the Atlantic to the Urals, is widely viewed as a cornerstone of European security. </P>
<P> Russia says that after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the distribution of armed forces should be changed to allow Moscow to station more men and armour in its volatile southern regions. The West rejects the idea. </P>
<P> ``We need more heavy armour in the Caucasus,'' Grachev said. ``And the Chechen experience proves this once again.'' </P>
<P> Grachev's statement on Monday, linking the NATO expansion with Russia's adherance to the CFE treaty, appeared to have hardened Moscow's stance on the sensitive issue. </P>
<P> Most East European and former Soviet republics have joined NATO's Partnership for Peace, designed to integrate members into the alliance without granting these countries full membership. </P>
<P> But Russia's punitive action in Chechnya, Moscow's biggest military operation since the 10-year Afghan war, has aroused suspicions among the states of the former Soviet that the Kremlin's imperialist spirit is reviving. </P>
<P> They see NATO membership as their only safety guarantee and have recently stepped up calls to be allowed into the Alliance. But NATO has set no concrete schedule for expansion. </P>
<P> Russia plans to join the Partnership for Peace as long as it is given special status, an idea firmly opposed by other members of the programme. </P>
