<P>  The best routes out of poverty in China's new market economy include playing the stock markets, running a private business, becoming a singer or actor or driving a taxi, a state survey said. </P>
<P> The survey by the State Planning Commission, printed in the China Business Times Wednesday, identified the 14 best-paid occupations in a country where the average monthly urban wage last year was $23. </P>
<P> The richest are those who play the stock market successfully, with an annual income of more than $118,000. </P>
<P> Then come businessmen, with annual incomes up to $11,800. </P>
<P> Actors and singers earn up to $1,180 for a single performance, while models who have won awards in international competitions can pocket $118 for a single appearance. </P>
<P> Presidents of some companies can earn up to $5,900 a year, as well as managers in foreign-owned companies and specialists in fields where demand exceeds supply, such as lawyers or high-quality cooks. </P>
<P> Middlemen or brokers also do well, with annual earnings of $11,800. Cab drivers also figure among the 14, with annual incomes of up to $4,700, although they complain of having to work every day of the year to earn it. </P>
