<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A Guatemalan intelligence officer in the pay of the CIA ordered the killings of a U.S. citizen and a guerrilla leader married to an American lawyer, a House Intelligence Committee member alleged Thursday. </P>
<P> New Jersey Democrat Robert Torricelli said the Central Intelligence Agency knew about the killings in Guatemala in 1990 and 1992 but concealed its knowledge for years. </P>
<P> Responding to Torricelli's charges, the CIA said only that it had received ``credible information'' about the two deaths long after they occurred and shared it with U.S. authorities. </P>
<P> ``When there is an investigation about the death of an American citizen, withholding information about those responsible and circumstances about that murder ... is a crime,'' Torricelli said, adding that he was not making a charge of criminality but was calling for an investigation. </P>
<P> He said the United States could protect its interests in Guatemala ``without having contractual relationships with hired killers who are involved in a brutal civil war.'' </P>
<P> Torricelli spoke at a news conference with Jennifer Harbury, a Harvard Law School graduate and widow of guerrilla leader Efraim Bamaca Velasquez who Torricelli said was tortured and executed after being captured in 1992. </P>
<P> Harbury, who has gone on hunger strikes to publicize her demands to know her husband's fate, said: ``This is the first time I have been told the truth in two years.'' </P>
<P> Torricelli said he told Harbury Wednesday that there was reason to believe her husband had died by order of Col. Julio Roberto Alpirez, a Guatemalan intelligence officer. </P>
<P> He said the officer was also responsible for directing the 1990 murder of American citizen Micheal DeVine, following his abduction from the Guatemala farm where he lived. </P>
<P> In a letter to President Clinton, Torricelli said Roberto Alpirez was under contract with the CIA and remained on its payroll at the time of the killings. </P>
<P> He told reporters the officer was ``separated'' from the CIA but there was conflicting information on when. </P>
<P> A U.S. Army spokesman confirmed that Alpirez had studied at the army's School of the Americas -- often criticized for its ties to the Latin American military -- graduating from a 47-week command and general staff course at Fort Benning, Ga., in 1989. </P>
<P> At the White House, spokesman Mike McCurry was asked if he could deny that Bamaca's killer was on the U.S. government payroll. ``We don't know who killed Efraim Bamaca,'' he said. </P>
<P> He said the United States was pressing the Guatemalan government to re-interrogate several Guatemalan military officers, including Alpirez, who he said was believed in the vicinity of the firefight during which Bamaca was captured. </P>
<P> Torricelli said sources had indicated State Department and White House officials learned of the facts of the Guatemala killings between October and late January. </P>
<P> His letter to Clinton said: ``The direct involvement of the CIA in the murder of these individuals leads me to the extraordinary conclusion that the agency is simply out of control and that it contains what can only be called a criminal element.'' </P>
<P> McCurry called the charge exaggerated. </P>
<P> In a statement, Acting CIA Director William Studeman said the charge the agency had information about the two deaths at the time they occurred was ``false and utterly irresponsible.'' </P>
<P> ``Credible information'' about the deaths ``was acquired by the U.S. Intelligence Community well after they occurred,'' he said. ``The agency shared all of this information with the appropriate U.S. Government authorities.'' </P>
<P> He said the CIA had given the congressional intelligence committees detailed briefings on the case in February. </P>
<P> State Department spokesman David Johnson said Harbury was told last month that available information indicated her husband was killed following his capture and the department had gone to ``extraordinary lengths'' to keep her informed. </P>
