<P>  Israeli troops shot and killed four Palestinian policemen in the Gaza Strip in the worst such clash since Palestinians won limited self-rule there. </P>
<P> In two other clashes Monday, soldiers killed three armed Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. </P>
<P> Palestinian and Israeli officials are to meet in Cairo Tuesday to discuss obstacles to peace. The violence came on a day when the Israeli government ordered a halt to construction of a new Jewish settlement on the West Bank which Palestinians said threatened the peace moves. </P>
<P> A Palestinian police official said Israeli soldiers patrolling near Beit Hanoun in the Gaza Strip had shot and killed the four Palestinian police after they refused to hand over their weapons. He said the shooting was unprovoked. </P>
<P> ``Israeli soldiers came in as Palestinian police were preparing their food. They asked for their guns and then started shooting,'' said Sayeb al-Alajez, the commander of Palestinian police north of Gaza city. </P>
<P> The Israeli army said its soldiers, patrolling along the border with Gaza, had come under fire first. </P>
<P> ``The soldiers returned fire and chased the gunmen. During the pursuit shots were fired at the soldiers from one of the houses,'' an army spokeswoman said. </P>
<P> She said soldiers shot back, killing the four policemen. </P>
<P> Palestinian police took control of most of the strip last May when Palestinians set up their self-rule authority in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho. </P>
<P> Under the peace deal, Israeli and Palestinian forces coordinate security in the strip, home to nearly one million Arabs and a few thousand Jewish settlers. </P>
<P> Israeli and Palestinian troops exchanged fire during a checkpoint riot at Erez in July. Two Palestinians were killed in the clashes, neither of them policemen. </P>
<P> Earlier Monday, soldiers in the West Bank shot dead two Palestinian gunmen who the army said were members of the militant Muslim movement Hamas, on their way to Jerusalem to carry out an attack against Israelis. </P>
<P> An army spokesman said the Palestinians shot at soldiers from a moving car south of Bethlehem. The soldiers shot back, killing two and injuring a third who managed to escape. </P>
<P> The soldiers found automatic weapons, ammunition, Jewish skullcaps and Korans in the car, the spokesman said. </P>
<P> Israeli soldiers also shot dead a Palestinian gunmen near the West Bank city of Hebron. </P>
<P> Israeli military sources said soldiers and border policemen looking for guerrillas came under fire from a house in Beit Awwa village, near Hebron. They surrounded the house and fired on it, killing the gunman. </P>
<P> Palestinians identified the dead man as Bassam al-Masalmeh, 25, of Beit Awwa, and said he belonged to Hamas. A 50-year-old villager was also wounded in the shootout, but was said to be in fair condition. </P>
<P> The Israeli army imposed a curfew on the village when residents threw rocks at them to protest the killing. </P>
<P> Arab children slightly injured a Jewish settler with stones when he strayed into the northern West Bank refugee camp of Balatta, Israeli security sources and Palestinians said. </P>
<P> Palestinians said Israeli soldiers rescued the man after the children searched him for weapons. </P>
<P> The Israeli Cabinet, announcing its decision to forbid the building of a Jewish settlement near the West Bank Arab village of al-Khader, instead offered settlers permission to build 500 apartments at an alternative site close to an existing settlement. </P>
