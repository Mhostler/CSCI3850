<P>  Secretary of State Warren Christopher denied Saturday that the Clinton administration was moving methodically toward recognition of President Fidel Castro's government in Cuba. </P>
<P> ``That is false,'' Christopher declared on the Cable News Network program ``Evans and Novak.'' </P>
<P> U.S. officials are bracing for a struggle with Congress over Cuban policy, firmly resisting attempts by Republican lawmakers to tighten sanctions on the communist state. </P>
<P> Key Republicans are backing legislation meant to further isolate Cuba and damage its economy with the goal of bringing down Castro. </P>
<P> But President Clinton angered many conservative members of Congress this week when he ended a decades-long right for Cuban refugees to enter the United States, instead returning those picked up at sea back to Cuban authorities. </P>
<P> Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and co-sponsor of the new bill, has warned the administration might be softening the U.S. stand against the communist state. </P>
<P> But Christopher said the administration was ``living within the terms of the Cuban Democracy Act.'' </P>
<P> That measure, passed overwhelmingly by Congress, decreed that there should be an embargo of Cuba, but also provided for improved communications between the United States and Cuba, he said. </P>
<P> ``We're within the bounds of that ... What we want to do is see a democratic Cuba,'' said Christopher. ``That's the Cuba that we want to recognize.'' </P>
<P> The secretary described the Helms legislation as having ''some good features and some bad features.'' He did not elaborate, but said the administration would like to work with Helms and other Republicans on the bill. </P>
