<P>  Riot police clashed with supporters of a secretive German colony in southern Chile late Wednesday as authorities forcibly closed the settlement's hospital, witnesses said. </P>
<P> Two people were injured and four were arrested after members and supporters of Colonia Dignidad (Dignity Colony) stoned riot police as they moved into the group's site in the Andean foothills, they said. Government officials finally managed to padlock the doors of the hospital, which officials said had no permission to operate. </P>
<P> ``It does not have the proper authorizations, it does not comply with sanitary codes, it has no reason to be operating,'' interior under-secretary Belisario Velasco said in Santiago. </P>
<P> Witnesses said among those arrested was one German member of the colony, whose leaders are accused of child abuse, forced confinement and using the site as a torture center during Chile's former military regime. </P>
<P> No one appeared to be inside the hospital, which reopened Sunday in defiance of a court order last year that revoked its charitable status and ordered it closed. </P>
<P> Colonia Dignidad was set up near the town of Parral by Paul Schaefer, a former Nazi soldier who left Germany in 1961. Defectors from the group charge he separated children from their parents and kept residents living behind barbed wire. </P>
<P> The colony's 200 or so inhabitants are all but cut off from the outside world, do not speak Spanish and have refused to cooperate with investigators looking into abuse charges. Some local residents support the colony's hospital, however, because they say it offers the best health care in the area. </P>
