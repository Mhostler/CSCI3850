<P> What really happened in Pakrac after Croatian troops crushed the last pocket of rebel Serb resistance on Thursday was still unclear as the U.N. had quoted EU reports that Serbs were being expelled and their homes plundered. </P>
<P> An EU monitor in Pakrac, Guenter Baron from Germany, told Reuters that Croatian troops had rounded up 1,700 Serb men of all ages from the reconquered rebel half of town on Friday night and taken them away in buses. </P>
<P> They were deposited in schools in two towns to the north where they were given a good meal and allowed to take a bath. EU sources said earlier that Serb women and children were also bused away after being separated from menfolk. Baron suggested the Serb men were normal prisoners of war. </P>
<P> ``The Croatian operation was excellent, professional, competent and correct,'' he said. Foreign journalists permitted to walk about the Serb side of Pakrac on their own found no evidence of dynamited or looted houses and a resident said: ``No problems so far. The police are treating us well.'' </P>
