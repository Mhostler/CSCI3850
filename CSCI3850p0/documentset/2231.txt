<P>  A hijacker armed with a grenade has taken 16 people hostage on board a plane in Russia's north Caucasus republic of Dagestan, the ministry for emergency situations said Wednesday. </P>
<P> A ministry spokesman said the hijacker ordered the captain of the Yak-40 plane to land shortly after takeoff from Dagestan's capital, Makhachkala, on Tuesday night on a flight to the southern Russian city of Rostov. </P>
<P> The man demanded $2 million in cash and enough fuel to fly to Iran across the Caspian Sea, said the spokesman. </P>
<P> The plane, now parked on the runway at Makhachkala airport, initially had 17 passengers and five crew members aboard. </P>
<P> The hijacker later allowed three women, two children and one man to leave the aircraft. </P>
<P> Police and other security forces were at the scene and negotiations with the hijacker had started, said the spokesman. </P>
<P> There have been a series of hijackings in Russia's turbulent north Caucusus region in the last 10 months, mostly involving buses and helicopters. </P>
