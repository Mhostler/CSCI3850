<P>  Baseball's spring training, the sequel, got under way Wednesday and, at the New York Yankees camp, there was optimism to spare. </P>
<P> Half of the club's 40-man roster was in uniform for what was billed as a ``voluntary supervised workout.'' The first mandatory practice is slated for Friday. </P>
<P> ``So far, so good,'' said New York manager Buck Showalter. ''You can tell everybody's real excited to be back.'' </P>
<P> Showalter could be excused for seeming somewhat less than enthusiastic, however, having been through opening day of spring training before, just six weeks ago, when there was no end in sight to the players' strike. </P>
<P> That strike finally ended Friday, the replacement players were released, and the major leaguers began trickling into camp Monday. To accommodate them, the start of the regular season was pushed back to April 26. </P>
<P> Most of the big-name players had not reported as of Wednesday, but those who were here participated in the three-hour workout with added enthusiasm. </P>
<P> ``It feels good to be back,'' said catcher Jim Leyritz. ``We were hoping they'd get something done before this thing (the regular season) got started, and they finished it just in time.'' </P>
<P> Added Yankee star pitcher Jimmy Key: ``I'm pretty ecstatic. Getting on that plane today, I haven't felt that great in a long time.'' </P>
<P> The Yankees finished the strike-shortened 1994 season with the best record in the American League (70-43) and the men in pinstripes are considered World Series contenders. </P>
<P> ``I would think with the way the season ended last year that there would be great expectations coming into this year,'' Showalter said, adding: ``I've had enough of the mediocre expectations of three or four years ago and, so if there's added pressure, I welcome that.'' </P>
<P> He quipped: ``It sure beats the alternative.'' </P>
<P> The Yankees got some good news Wednesday when it was announced that ace relief pitcher John Wetteland had been acquired in a trade with the cash-strapped Montreal Expos, adding to an already potent pitching staff. </P>
<P> New York gave up young prospect Fernando Seguignol, a player to be named later and cash considerations. </P>
<P> ``Pitching is such a huge part of the game and anytime you can add a guy like that, it's a real bonus,'' said outfielder Paul O'Neill, one of the first players back in camp. </P>
<P> Optimism aside, though, the players know they have their work cut out for them, not only preparing for the regular season in just three weeks, but also trying to win back the fans, only a handful of which showed up Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``I don't think it (spring training) will be all that bad,'' said pitcher Stirling Hitchcock. ``Most of us have done a pretty good job of keeping ourselves in shape.'' </P>
<P> Key, who was well on his way to a possible Cy Young award when the season ended last year, said he has been throwing hard for the past month. He threw 100 pitches in game conditions Wednesday to prove he was ready. </P>
<P> ``The arm is great,'' he said. ``I can't complain, there.'' </P>
<P> As for the fans, the players will have to go the extra mile to win them back. O'Neill took a first step by signing autographs for 10 minutes after practice. </P>
<P> ``We see the damage that was done and it's kind of irreparable,'' Leyritz said, adding: ``We're hoping that maybe we can repair it by playing a full season this year, and doing some things to help the fans.'' </P>
<P> Still, although the strike is over, the players and owners have yet to sign a new collective bargaining agreement, leaving open the possibility of a lockout or renewed strike later on. </P>
<P> ``I think both parties want to get something done,'' Leyritz said. ``I think something will be done before the year's over.'' </P>
