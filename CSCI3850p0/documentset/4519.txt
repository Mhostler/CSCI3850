<P>  Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, set to announce his fourth campaign for the White House April 10, said he believed he could defeat President Clinton in 1996, although he admitted Clinton was a good campaigner. </P>
<P> The 71-year-old Kansas senator said his main strength was his many years of experience in Congress and scoffed at concern about his age, saying some supporters had told him, ``You have the experience. You've been tested. Maybe it's time for adult leadership.'' </P>
<P> Dole is currently the frontrunner among the Republicans vying for the GOP nomination, with a recent Boston Globe poll putting Dole far ahead of the next candidate in the key state of New Hampshire, which kicks off the 1996 primary season. </P>
<P> Dole said he was approaching this campaign differently than his previous unsuccessful attempts to take over the White House. ``I am more relaxed. I'm sort of the warm, fuzzy, reasonable Bob Dole,'' he told Cable News Network's ``Larry King Live.'' </P>
<P> He said he was enjoying his lead in the polls and hoped to maintain it throughout the campaign. </P>
<P> ``I think I can defeat President Clinton in 1996,'' he said, adding, ``(But) you never take any sitting president for granted. You don't take President Clinton for granted. He's a good campaigner.'' </P>
<P> Dole plans to formally announce his campaign April 10 in Topeka, Kansas, traveling to Des Moines, Iowa, Concord or Manchester, New Hampshire, New York City and his hometown of Russell, Kansas during a week-long tour. </P>
<P> Dole said he was in good health and rejected criticism about his age, saying his opponents should refrain from hitting the issue. ``If they can keep up with me, they can raise it. But they've got to keep up with me,'' he said. </P>
<P> He said he'd suffered a bout of prostate cancer three years ago but had been healthy since. </P>
<P> Dole said he did not plan to be a ``one-term president'' if elected and said his reported consideration of a one-term pledge was ``just an option'' as was the possibility of naming a vice presidential running mate -- possibly a pro-choice Republican -- early in the process. </P>
<P> He said a one-term pledge would make him a ``lame duck'' from the start, although it would allow him to ``get in there, get it done and get out.'' </P>
