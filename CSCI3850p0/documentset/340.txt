<P> Albright did not use the word ``invasion'' but ``all necessary means'' is a catch phrase for military intervention. It was used when the council authorized U.S. troops to expel Iraqi forces from Kuwait in 1991. </P>
<P> She told reporters the United States was drafting a resolution with a two-phase approach. The first would be a ''multinational force whose job it would be to secure a stable enviroment'' and would include language providing for ``all necessary means.'' </P>
<P> The second phase, she said, would be a smaller United Nations operation to preserve that secure environment and train the country's military and police, presumably after Haiti's military leaders are removed from office. </P>
<P> She said she was laying the ``diplomatic groundwork'' for whatever option the United States chooses. She hoped the resolution would be adopted by the end of next week. </P>
