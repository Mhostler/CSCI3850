<DATELINE>PARIS, May 8 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien welcomed on Monday conservative Jacques Chirac's election as president of France but avoided stirring fresh controversy over the new Gaullist leader's stand on Quebec. </P>
<P> ``I wish to congratulate him. He is a man of experience,'' Chretien told reporters shortly before joining Chirac and other world leaders for ceremonies commemorating the end of World War Two in Europe. </P>
<P> ``I have known him for a very long time and I am convinced that we will have good relations,'' Chretien said. </P>
<P> Conservative Chirac attracted wide Canadian publicity in January after saying France should recognise Quebec's independence if its people back it in a referendum this year. </P>
<P> ``When you read the words, you could give a lot of meanings to them,'' Chretien told Monday's news conference, predicting Paris would maintain its even-handed stance on French-speaking Quebec. </P>
<P> Chretien was speaking after talks with the president of the European Union's executive Commission, Jacques Santer, aimed at healing the recent feud over Atlantic fishing rights. </P>
<P> In his January remarks, Chirac said France should not interfere in the poll planned by Quebec's separatist premier, Jacques Parizeau, but should stand by its people if they back secession. </P>
<P> France has long pursued a delicately balanced policy towards its former possession, after General de Gaulle's cry of ``Vive le Quebec libre!'' (Long live free Quebec) in 1967 soured relations between Paris and Ottawa for several years. </P>
<P> Successive governments have endorsed a neutral stance of ``neither interference, nor indifference,'' which outgoing French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur reaffirmed in January. </P>
