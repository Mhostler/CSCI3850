<P>  United Nations helicopter gunships and tanks fired on Somali militiamen who attacked Bangladeshi peacekeepers as they withdrew from a base near Mogadishu Tuesday, a military spokesman said. </P>
<P> The Somalis suffered an unknown number of casualties. </P>
<P> The shooting broke out Tuesday morning after the Somalis demanded the United Nations pay rent on a riverside camp which U.N. forces occupied during two years of military intervention. </P>
<P> ``Our troops were forced to react when Somali militiamen using technicals (battle wagons) fired on the Bangladeshi U.N. military contingent in Afgoye, about 32 kilometers (20 miles) west of the capital,'' U.N. Major Zubair Chattha told reporters. </P>
<P> Chattha said the 900-member Bangladeshi battalion was trying to withdraw from the town along the Shebelle river before the U.N.'s pullout from Somalia when the militiamen struck. </P>
<P> He said a quick reaction force of nine M-60 tanks and three armored vehicles backed by two Cobra helicopter gunships was sent into the area from Mogadishu late Monday to cover the withdrawal. </P>
<P> U.N. troops apparently suffered no casualties and the Bangladeshis rumbled into Mogadishu later in the day, abandoning Afgoye completely. </P>
<P> Indian troops were also gradually leaving the southern port of Kismayu, an area heavily contested by several Somali clan militias, and the last battalion there has withdrawn to the airport complex. They will all be gone by the end of the week, official said. </P>
