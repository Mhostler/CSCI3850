<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  As President Clinton seeks to redefine his presidency, a behind-scenes battle is raging for his political soul and sources say one top aide has questioned the strength of Clinton's convictions. </P>
<P> Witnesses said it was David Gergen, the Republican-turned-Democratic political guru brought in to improve Clinton's image and communication with the public, who told a group of former and present White House speech writers a week ago that ``nobody knows what he stands for.'' </P>
<P> An angered Gergen, however, said his remarks had been misinterpreted. ``It's total hooey that I would ever put a knife into Bill Clinton. I deeply resent having my comments twisted for political purposes.'' </P>
<P> The occasion was a dinner of the Judson Welliver Society, an association of White House wordsmiths, and the topic was what Clinton must do in the next two years to rebound from devastating Democratic losses in the Nov. 8 elections. </P>
<P> Gergen, a former Richard Nixon speechwriter and adviser to Ronald Reagan, served in both the Clinton White House and State Department and has resigned effective at year's end. </P>
<P> Some dinner participants, from both sides of the political spectrum, expressed shock that Gergen would not take the opportunity to stand up for the president in front of a group that includes many editorial columnists and political pundits. </P>
<P> Instead, he reportedly said the American people do not know whether Clinton is a conservative or a liberal and that the president has not shown them ``his heart.'' </P>
<P> Said one of those present, ``It was like, 'Hey, I'm only the piano player in this bordello.''' </P>
<P> Said another, ``If the message hasn't gotten out what Clinton stands for, shouldn't he (Gergen) be taking some of the blame for that? Instead of standing up for Bill Clinton and what he stands for, he stabs him in the back in front of a bunch of opinion leaders.'' </P>
<P> Gergen said his point was that Clinton should ``speak from the heart'' more often like he did a year ago in Memphis when he passionately urged blacks to take more responsibility to improve their plight. </P>
<P> ``I believe this is a man of conviction. I believe they have strong views, and they haven't gotten through effectively in all the hubbub of recent months. I think he believes that. I think he agrees with that,'' Gergen said. </P>
<P> One participant, who asked to remain unidentified, agreed with Gergen's version of events. </P>
<P> ``My impression of what he was saying was that out in the country, it's hard to know what he (Clinton) stands for, which is different from saying that people around him don't know what he stands for ... I didn't hear him say that the president doesn't have a compass,'' this source said. </P>
<P> Hendrik Hertzberg, executive editor of The New Yorker magazine and former chief White House speech writer to Jimmy Carter, reportedly came to Clinton's defense, saying he showed his convictions by fighting hard for health care reform. </P>
<P> The episode is revealing because even now Clinton and his top advisers are struggling to rework his presidency to deal with Republicans who seized control of both houses of Congress in the elections. </P>
<P> Officials say the White House is split between those who want Clinton to take a middle-road approach and those who want him to tilt toward the liberal side to shore up the traditional Democratic base ahead of his expected 1996 re-election bid. </P>
<P> Memos are flying, meetings are constant and backbiting is in evidence as the battle rages. </P>
<P> One official involved in the planning said, ``The president is going to his roots as someone who operates from the middle of the spectrum and is going to fight for the middle-class and change the way Washington works.'' </P>
<P> Clinton himself has adopted a more conservative theme in recent remarks, saying in his national radio address last Saturday, ``Nobody wants government on our backs, but we do need a strong, if limited government by our side.'' </P>
<P> Going back to his roots would mean taking up some of the themes of the Democratic Leadership Council, a centrist political organization from which Clinton, its head in his days as Arkansas governor, vaulted to his 1992 election bid. </P>
<P> On Monday the Council is to unveil a 10-point plan replying to the Republican ``Contract With America,'' whose calls for tax cuts, a balanced-budget amendment and other conservative goals helped propel Republican candidates to victory. </P>
<P> Officials at the Council say they do not know how far Clinton will go toward embracing their plan. </P>
