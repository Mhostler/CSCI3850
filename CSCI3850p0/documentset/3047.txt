<P>  A jury has awarded more than $2 million to the heirs of two of the Three Stooges who claimed that the heirs of a third Stooge had denied them a fair share of the profits from the trio's work. </P>
<P> After more than three months of testimony and a week of deliberations, a Los Angeles Superior Court jury Tuesday found that Jeffrey Scott, the grandson of Stooges founder Moe Howard, and Howard's daughter, Joan Maurer, had breached their contract with the heirs of Joe ``Curly Joe'' DeRita and Larry Fine. </P>
<P> Jean DeRita, Curly Joe's widow, was awarded just under $1.6 million and the grandchildren of Fine got just over $500,000. </P>
<P> The plaintiffs claimed they had been shortchanged by the defendants when it came to distributing merchandising profits from Three Stooges products. </P>
<P> The punitive damages phase of the trial began Wednesday. </P>
<P> The trio, which underwent a number of personnel changes during its history, was founded in 1923 by Moe Howard. Larry Fine joined the troupe in 1928 but DeRita did not become a Stooge until 1959. </P>
<P> During the group's heyday, from 1934 to 1958, Columbia Pictures produced 200 Stooges comedy shorts, described by Ephraim Katz, author of ``The Film Encyclopaedia,'' as ``The longest running series of two-reel comedies in the history of sound films.'' </P>
<P> With DeRita, the Stooges made half a dozen feature films in the 1960s. </P>
<P> Larry Fine died in 1974 followed by Moe Howard a year later. DeRita died last year. </P>
