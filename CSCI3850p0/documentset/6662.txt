<P>  Top Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal said Thursday Alois Brunner, the most notorious Nazi war criminal still at large, had apparently left his longtime refuge in Syria for a secret hideout in South America. </P>
<P> Wiesenthal, head of the Vienna-based Jewish Documentation Center, said Brunner, one of Adolf Hitler's top Nazi henchmen, was probably living in Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay or Brazil. </P>
<P> Officials of the Simon Wiesenthal Center earlier told a news conference in Paris there had been unconfirmed sightings of Austrian-born Brunner, now 83, in a remote area of northern Argentina near the borders of Paraguay and Brazil. </P>
<P> They showed reporters what they said was an Interpol list of the 12 most wanted men in Latin America which now includes Brunner, apparently for the first time. </P>
<P> Brunner is wanted in connection with the deaths of 130,000 Jews whom he had deported to death camps during World War II. </P>
<P></P>
<P> ``We expect that the case should not be forgotten. He is the last of Eichmann's crew.'' </P>
<P> Brunner was World War II deputy to fellow Austrian Adolf Eichmann, the man to whom Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, also an Austrian, entrusted the extermination of six million Jews. </P>
<P> In Paris, Rabbi Marvin Hier, an official of the Wiesenthal Center, said he hoped Brunner could be tried in Austria. </P>
<P> ``It would be an invaluable lesson for Austrian society which has often presented itself also as victims of the Nazis,'' he said. </P>
<P> Hier said he met U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) head Louis Freeh last week in Washington to enlist his aid. </P>
<P> The centers' European director Shimon Samuels said in Paris he had just returned from several Latin American capitals where he had received pledges of help. He said he also visited Germany where justice authorities told him a $250,000 reward might be posted within days for Brunner's capture. </P>
<P> Germany, France and Austria all launched extradition proceedings against Brunner. Syria has always denied any knowledge of him. </P>
<P> In Vienna, the opposition Green Party Thursday demanded an investigation into allegations that the Austrian embassy in Cairo issued a new passport to a man who may have been Brunner. </P>
<P> Greens spokesman Karl Oellinger urged Austria's new foreign minister, Wolfgang Schuessel, to set up an immediate inquiry into whether the embassy inadvertently issued the document. </P>
<P> ``It is very hard to believe that the Austrian ambassador in Cairo, especially, should not suspect something when an 83-year-old man asks for a new passport,'' Oellinger said. </P>
<P> Several Middle East publications reported two years ago that Brunner had died in Syria. ``If we have no proof he is dead, we assume he is alive. Interpol seems to point to that,'' Hier said. </P>
