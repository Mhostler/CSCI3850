<P>  The Security Council, meeting in emergency session, Sunday condemned the escalation of fighting around Bihac and demanded that Serbs in Croatia stay out of the conflict in northwestern Bosnia. </P>
<P> In a statement read at a formal session, the council said it ``views with alarm the escalation in recent fighting in the Bihac area, and the flow of refugees and displaced persons resulting from it.'' </P>
<P> Of particular concern are reports that Croatian Serbs occupying the Krajina area of Croatia are helping Bosnian Serbs in their assault on the mountaous enclave. The Krajina Serbs have launched heavy shelling attacks on Muslim positions. </P>
<P> The policy statement, read by Council President Madeleine Albright of the United States, asks Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to report immediately to the council on measures the United Nations could take to stabilize the situation around Bihac, one of six so-called U.N. safe areas. </P>
<P> A U.S. official said Washington was concerned that the crisis in Bihac could get out of control, forcing the Croatian government to take its territory by military means to prevent Bosnian Serb armies from joining with Krajina Serbs. </P>
<P> He said the United States was consulting with its allies on the possibility of making Bihac a heavy weapons exclusion zone, such as Sarajevo and Goradze, which could invite NATO attacks. </P>
<P> Bosnia's U.N. ambassador Muhamed Sacirbey, who called the meeting, said the United Nations ``had failed to take measures to stop attacks on the safe areas and violations of a no-fly zone.'' </P>
<P> Sacireby called on the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) and NATO to take action and if they failed for Croatia to ``stop aggressive acts from their territory.'' So far UNPROFOR has been powerless to stop the fighting. </P>
<P> Russia has suggested that Bihac and other safe areas be demilitarized but Sacirbey indicated his government had doubts about such measures. Some diplomats, however, hoped Moscow would mount a diplomatic offensive among the Serbs, its traditional allies, to calm Bihac. </P>
<P> Croatia, in a letter to the Security Council, said NATO should take action in chasing Krajina Serb planes ``over the airspace of Croatia whenever the Security Council and General Assembly resolutions are being violated.'' </P>
<P> The United Nations has forces spread thinly through rebel Serb areas of Croatia to separate the warring armies. </P>
<P> A U.N. military spokesman said in Sarajevo Sunday the Bosnian Serb army had regained around 40 percent of the ground lost to a suprise offensive by the Bosnian Muslim-led government army two weeks ago. </P>
<P> Fighting had subsided in the northwest region but he said the Serbs may be pausing to resupply troops before pressing ahead with their counter-attack. </P>
