<P>  About 1,200 people were evacuated from their homes in the southwest German city of Ludwigshafen Wednesday after two World War II bombs were found. </P>
<P> Both bombs, discovered after officials studied Allied wartime aerial photographs, were defused. </P>
<P> The find was the third since city officials started studying the photographs in October. </P>
<P> In Munich, meanwhile, a 1,200 pound wartime bomb was found at the city's former Riem international airport. </P>
<P> The bomb, found buried by the control tower during building work, was defused safely, police said. </P>
<P> Riem was in service until May 1992, when it was replaced by a new airport, Germany's second largest after Frankfurt. </P>
<P> World War II bombs from Allied raids are still frequently found in Germany. </P>
