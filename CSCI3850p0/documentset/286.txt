<P>  Director Steven Spielberg urged governors across the United States to promote teaching programs in schools that foster tolerance among different races, ethnic groups and religions. </P>
<P> ``In schools today, young people are not being taught about practicing personal responsibilities. Those are the seeds that can lead to indifference and then intolerance,'' Spielberg said at the summer meeting of the National Governors Association in Boston. </P>
<P> ``Schindler's List,'' which swept the Academy Awards this year, winning both Best Picture and Best Director for Spielberg, tells the story of a German industrialist who saved the lives of over a thousand Jews. </P>
<P> Spielberg, who is a producer as well as being a director of such blockbusters as ``E.T.'' and ``Jurassic Park,'' said he made ``Schindler's List'' about the Holocaust partly to educate people about intolerance and hate. </P>
<P> He said he was surprised when it became a commercial hit seen by about 75 million people around the world. </P>
<P> ``We cannot forget the lessons of the past,'' Spielberg said. ``To deny and forget the hate crimes of the past would guarantee their recurrence. </P>
<P> ``If we make an effort, that can be a way for teaching your children and my children about what happened so that the next generation will not tolerate what the last generation ignored.'' </P>
<P> Spielberg thanked the governors for their help in promoting a program for high school students to see ``Schindler's List'' and said the film will soon be available on video, which he would donate to ``every high school across America''. </P>
<P> ``I wanted to make the film accessible to as many high school students as possible,'' he said. </P>
<P> The renowned director urged governors to promote educational programs within their states to teach tolerance. He said such courses were currently being taught only in a handful of the most liberal and socially conscious schools in the country. </P>
<P> ``Only four states now call for teaching on the Holocaust, the history of black slavery along with multicultural programs focusing on issues of prejudice and discrimination. </P>
<P> ``I would hope all 50 states would require it. On behalf of today's younger generation, and of future generations, I urge you to raise the expectations of teachers in our country so they will be motivated to teach courses in tolerance,'' Spielberg told the governors. </P>
