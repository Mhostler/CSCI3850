<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter</DATELINE>
<P>  President Bill Clinton joined forces with political opponents, three former presidents and powerful figures from past eras on Monday to urge Congress to pass the GATT world trade pact. </P>
<P> Congressional sources said that although passage appeared assured in the House of Representatives on Tuesday, there was still uncertainty about whether it would clear the Senate in a vote Thursday. </P>
<P> In a White House rally of both Democrats and Republicans, Clinton mustered prestigious support for the 123-nation pact, which took seven years to negotiate and would lower trade tariffs worldwide. </P>
<P> The president said U.S. leaders must fight a spreading undercurrent of anxiety about the deal under GATT, short for General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. </P>
<P> ``It is not a Republican agreement or a Democratic one. It is an American agreement designed to benefit all the American people in every region of our country and from every walk of life,'' Clinton told the meeting in the White House East Room. </P>
<P> U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor predicted the measure would pass ``overwhelmingly'' in the House and Senate and said its failure would be ``a tragedy for trade, a tragedy for jobs, a tragedy for our standard of living.'' </P>
<P> Kantor said it was critical to get the measure approved in 1994 to set an example for other countries. </P>
<P> ``When you're in essence the 800-pound gorilla, when you're the largest trading nation on earth, when you're the largest military power, when you ratify, then everyone else feels comfortable doing it,'' Kantor said. ``If you don't, they'll back away.'' </P>
<P> On Capitol Hill, Representative Sam Gibbons, a Florida Democrat and acting chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee, predicted the pact would garner about 270 votes in the 435-member House -- well over the majority needed. </P>
<P> But after a late afternoon meeting of Democratic lawmakers counting votes for the agreement, several legislators said they expected the GATT agreement to pass by a smaller margin than the 1993 234-200 victory of the North American Free Trade Agreement. </P>
<P> Congressional sources also said they were still short of the 60 votes needed in the 100-seat Senate to waive a special budget rule and bring the accord up for a vote. </P>
<P> ``You don't have 60 votes for it. We're still struggling,'' said one source. He said Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole's recent decision to support the accord would help, but Dole, in Europe until Thursday, was not on hand to lobby for it. </P>
<P> Colorado Republican Hank Brown announced his opposition to the agreement and two Democratic senators criticized the pact for not addressing the problem of child labor. </P>
<P> Clinton, bruised by earlier legislative near-misses, planned to telephone members of Congress to lobby for the pact. </P>
<P> Attending the White House rally were former top officials dating back to the 1950s. They included James Baker, secretary of State under former President George Bush and Treasury secretary under former President Ronald Reagan; Elliot Richardson, a stalwart in several Republican administrations; James Miller, budget director under Reagan; and Bert Lance, budget director under former President Jimmy Carter. </P>
<P> Also there were the entire Clinton cabinet, several Nobel laureates in economics and leaders of the outgoing Congress. </P>
<P> Vice President Al Gore read a letter to Clinton from former presidents Gerald Ford, Carter and Bush that called the pact ``a bridge from the post-war world of half a century ago to the post-Cold War world ... being forged today.'' </P>
<P> It said congressional passage would clinch economic benefits for the United States and the world and would demonstrate continued U.S. global leadership. </P>
<P> Over the weekend, opponents launched a last-minute blitz with radio and television commercials arguing the deal to open global markets would cost U.S. jobs and cede sovereignty to ''foreign bureaucrats'' overseeing trade. </P>
<P> GATT opponents are an unlikely alliance including conservative Republican commentator Patrick Buchanan, independent Texas billionaire Ross Perot and West Virginia Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd. </P>
