<P>  Picabo Street cried tears of joy Saturday after capturing her fifth downhill win of the season to become the first American woman ever to win the World Cup downhill title. </P>
<P> Street, took a near perfect line down the 3,080-meter course, the longest women's downhill stretch on the World Cup this season, to finish in one minute, 50.57 seconds. </P>
<P> ``This is such a great day and I was so nervous before to start,'' Street said afterwards. ``What a great season. I was just hoping for a single win when I started it, and now I'm at the top of the standings.'' </P>
<P> Street's sizzling run was just barely good enough. She was a mere 6/100 of a second ahead of Russian Varvara Zelenskaya, who also fearlessly attacked the course from the start. </P>
<P> Street watched anxiously in the bright sunshine as Austrian Renate Goetsch, who came down two places later, posted the best times at the first two intermediate stages. </P>
<P> But the Austrian strayed wide of a true line lower down to finish third in 1:50.71. </P>
<P> The last American to win a World Cup trophy was the great technical specialist Tamara McKinney who took the overall World Cup title in 1983. </P>
<P> Street's triumph raised her downhill tally to 609 points after eight races with one race remaining. </P>
<P> Fellow-American Hilary Lindh, winner of two early season downhills, finished fifth Saturday behind World Cup overall leader German Katja Seizinger. </P>
<P> Lindh earned 45 points for a tally of 398 points in the downhill standings. </P>
<P> Street wept at the finish, but later said there was still another challenge ahead. </P>
<P> ``Now I will be relaxed in next week's finals at Bormio,'' said Street, the Olympic silver medallist. ``I will still try to win another time....it tastes great.'' </P>
<P> Few racers have bettered five downhill wins in a season. </P>
<P> The most recent were Austria's Annemarie Moser-Proell in 1973 with eight wins, Switzerland's Marie Therese Nadig in 1980 with six wins and her teammate Michaela Figini in 1989 also with six. </P>
<P> Street's triumph left Zelenskaya still looking for her first World Cup win. </P>
<P> ``I have made some mistakes at the top... I was so close this time,'' she said. </P>
<P> Seizinger, bidding for her first World Cup overall title after seeing it slip away for the last three seasons, increased her total to 993 points, 19 ahead of Swiss Heidi Zeller-Baehler, who finished seventh. </P>
<P> Defending overall champion Swiss Vreni Schneider collected 15 useful points finishing 16th to maintain her hopes of a third overall title. She has 930 points in total. </P>
<P> Schneider is hoping to take the lead after Sunday's slalom where she could also win the only combined of the season. </P>
<P> ``I think that the World Cup will be decided in the last races at the finals at Bormio,'' Schneider said. ``We are all very close together. </P>
