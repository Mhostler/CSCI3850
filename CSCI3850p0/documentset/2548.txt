<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Asia-Pacific ministers Friday endorsed contentious investment principles for a region responsible for half the world's trade and industrial output. </P>
<P> The action highlighted the start of a two-day meeting which opened with Indonesia's President Suharto urging an accelerated drive for a free trade area embracing half the globe's people. </P>
<P> Squabbling over the investment code by senior officials had threatened to cast a shadow over the ambitious trade talks of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. </P>
<P> Most ministers had little to say after the first session of the meeting of 18 First and Third World nations. </P>
<P> Their talks will set the scene for a summit in nearby Bogor next Tuesday hosted by Suharto and including President Clinton, Chinese President Jiang Zemin and other leaders. </P>
<P> ``As part of the ministerial declaration, this morning the ministers endorsed the set of non-binding principles for investment,'' Joun Yung Sun, a senior South Korean foreign ministry official, told reporters. He gave no details. </P>
<P> APEC's 18 countries, including new member Chile, account for about 45 percent of trade in the world, raising the prospect of a formidable new free trade bloc by the year 2020. </P>
<P> The Bogor summit is likely to endorse plans edging APEC toward its ambitious goals, and Suharto provided the backdrop when he opened the ministerial meetings. </P>
<P> ``I do hope that our meeting in Bogor will produce a basic agreement on the cooperation... that will accelerate trade liberalization and investment among us,'' Suharto said. </P>
<P> ``The awareness of the diversity of the stages of development among our member economies inspires us to engage in dialog and cooperation in a friendly and constructive atmosphere.'' </P>
<P> The 73-year-old retired army general, also leader of the 111-member Non-Aligned Movement, said APEC was never designed as an exclusive trading bloc. </P>
<P> The ministers later met in a cavernous convention center in Jakarta, capital of one of the world's fastest-growing economies. </P>
<P> Japanese officials said the first day was spent covering economic trends, trade and investment. </P>
<P> APEC officials took three days to hammer out by Thursday the non-binding investment treaty after U.S. reluctance because it did not contain sufficient protection for investors. </P>
<P> APEC groups Australia, the United States, Canada, Mexico, Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Indonesia, Brunei, the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Papua New Guinea, New Zealand and Chile. </P>
<P> The investment code, endorsed Friday, is part of efforts to move toward free trade. If enforced, it would go beyond trends endorsed in the latest round of world trade talks. </P>
<P> Much of the interest over the next few days will be in bilateral contacts between ministers and leaders. </P>
<P> South Korean officials said President Kim Young-sam planned to seek participation by APEC members in a U.S.-led drive to end the dispute over secretive North Korean nuclear development. </P>
<P> U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher was to ask China to encourage North Korea to go along, U.S. officials said. </P>
<P> Chinese officials have indicated their goals include getting the United States to allow Beijing to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade this year and thus become a founder member of the World Trade Organization. </P>
<P> U.S. officials said Friday they were exploring a possible compromise on the timing of Chinese membership. </P>
<P> On a separate subject, China's foreign trade minister Wu Yi said Friday her country would accept a timetable for trade liberalization in the APEC region but would insist on different schedules for different types of economies. </P>
<P> A top-level advisory group has recommended trade and investment liberalization by 2020, with industrialized countries such as Japan and the United States taking the lead in 2010. </P>
