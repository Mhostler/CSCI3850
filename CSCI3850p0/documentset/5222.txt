<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  South African President Nelson Mandela said Monday he had fired his estranged wife Winnie as a deputy minister in his government. </P>
<P> ``I have released Winnie Mandela of her position as deputy minister of arts, culture, science and technology,'' Mandela told a news conference in Cape Town. </P>
<P> ``I have taken this decision after much reflection given that comrade Winnie Mandela has in the past played an important role in the struggle against apartheid,'' he said. </P>
<P> Mandela said he had appointed Bridget Mabandla to replace her with immediate effect. </P>
<P> ``I appointed the cabinet and it is my right and prerogative to reshuffle the government ... if I consider it necessary for the effective functioning of the government and I have exercised the right,'' Mandela said. </P>
<P> He was asked why he had fired her and he replied, ``You must accept my assurance that I have exercised my right very, very carefully.'' </P>
<P> Winnie has become an outspoken critic of his post-apartheid administration. </P>
<P> Mrs. Mandela's job, which does not include a seat in the cabinet, has been in doubt since she defied a presidential order and traveled to West Africa in mid-February. </P>
<P> Mandela had ordered her to stay home, instead, to manage the resignation from the Women's League of the ruling African National Congress of 11 leading members in protest against her leadership style. </P>
<P> While she was away, police raided Mrs. Mandela's home and offices in connection with allegations of fraud and misuse of public office. </P>
<P> The Supreme Court last week overturned the search warrant and forced police to return the documents, but police chief Gen. George Fivaz has said since that the investigation would continue. </P>
<P> Mandela, 76, and his wife, 61, separated in 1992 -- a year after his release after 27 years in jail for opposing white minority rule. The separation followed her conviction on charges of kidnapping and assault of children, one of them a well-known political activist, during the anti-apartheid struggle. </P>
