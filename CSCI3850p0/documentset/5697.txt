<P>  A Frenchman disfigured by an exploding insecticide won $400,000 compensation Wednesday and the head of the firm that made the spray was given a suspended jail term. </P>
<P> ``I am satisfied,'' said Denis Benoliel after a court handed down the judgements. </P>
<P> Benoliel almost died in the 1990 blast when he lit a cigarette after spraying the insecticide in his home. His disfigured face and hands have been partially rebuilt in a series of operations. </P>
<P> The court in Senlis north of Paris ordered manufacturers Reckitt and Colman France to pay $400,000 in compensation and sentenced the head of the company, Lukas Beyeler, to a one-year suspended jail term. </P>
<P> The court said the Paris-based company had not properly labeled the product to warn users it was flammable. </P>
<P> The company, which argued the prosecution had not proved that its aerosol was to blame for the blast, said it would appeal. </P>
