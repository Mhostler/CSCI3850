<P>  NATO Secretary-General Willy Claes said Friday that he would not accept any Russian attempts to impose its views on the way the military organization admitted new members. </P>
<P> ``Russia is important but we do not accept vetoes...on our decisions (on NATO enlargement),'' a NATO spokesman quoted Claes as saying after meeting Romanian President Ion Iliescu. </P>
<P> ``I want to underline our willingness to cooperate with Russia on the same level as other countries on the Partnership for Peace plan, taking into account that Russia is a military superpower,'' Claes added. </P>
<P> The six former Eastern bloc countries -- Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia -- want to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as soon as possible to distance themselves from their former Soviet master. </P>
<P> But Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev told NATO Deputy Secretary-General Gerhardt von Moltke Thursday that a decision to admit new members would be premature and would seriously endanger the process of stabilization in Europe. </P>
<P> Russia is a party to NATO's Partnership for Peace program, designed to integrate former Soviet bloc countries into the alliance without granting them the full membership. </P>
<P> Claes said the debate on NATO's expansion was expected to become clearer after a meeting of NATO foreign ministers on Dec. 1 but it would remain general rather than concentrate on who should become a member and when. </P>
<P> ``Enlargement cannot be excluded, but it is an evolutionary process,'' he said. </P>
