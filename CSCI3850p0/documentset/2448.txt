<DATELINE>LONDON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  British newspapers Monday pored over the latest portrayal of Princess Diana as a sad, lonely but determined woman, besotted with her sons and eager for love and power. </P>
<P> Reporting on excerpts from a new biography published Sunday, some highlighted Diana's fears that her estranged husband Prince Charles had hired a woman aide, Alexandra Legge-Bourke, to act as a ``surrogate mother'' for William, 12, and Harry, 10. </P>
<P> Others focused on the claim in ``Diana - Her New Life'' by royal author Andrew Morton that the princess, a long-time sufferer from the eating disorder bulimia nervosa, was using the mood-altering ``designer drug'' Prozac to try to cure it. </P>
<P> Morton's book, to be published Tuesday, also says, according to the serialization in The Sunday Times, that Diana wants to remarry and have more children -- preferably girls -- but is waiting for Charles, heir to the British throne, to make the first move to divorce. </P>
<P> The Daily Mirror said Monday it had found the safe house where Charles and his long-time friend Camilla Parker Bowles, whose role in Charles' life made Diana wildly jealous, were still meeting. It said the couple spent up to an hour a day on the phone if they could not meet in person. </P>
<P> Unlike a biography published last week of Charles by journalist Jonathan Dimbleby, which told of the heir's adultery with Bowles while branding Diana a hysterical and conniving woman, Morton's book has no official backing. </P>
<P> Buckingham Palace described Morton's book as ``a mishmash of tedious and secondhand gossip'' and said its claims that Charles and Diana had already discussed divorce were untrue. </P>
<P> Some tabloids said Diana, 33, had denied any involvement in the book, which quotes lawyers as telling her she can expect the equivalent of up to $25 million in any divorce. </P>
<P> Charles, who will be 46 on Nov. 14, was quoted in the Dimbleby biography as saying that his 1992 separation from the princess was hastened by the revelation that Diana encouraged an earlier Morton book which laid bare the misery of their union. </P>
<P> But it was unclear if Morton has had the same access to Diana's inner circle of friends for his sequel, which also says the princess relies heavily on astrologers and mystics for advice and believes she was a nun in a former life. </P>
<P> The palace confirmed that Diana would head a new campaign by the British Red Cross, a sign that she is returning to public life after a self-imposed, year-long exile. </P>
<P> The princess's new role, in the face of hostile courtiers who wanted to see her crushed or even sent into exile alone, testifies to her strength despite the troubles which have caused her so much misery, Morton claims. </P>
<P> The Sun, Britain's best-selling newspaper, led its report of his new book with the story that Diana slashed her arms with scissors in a halfhearted suicide attempt aboard a royal jet shortly before her separation from Charles two years ago. </P>
<P> ``She hacked at her arms ... after a blazing row with Prince Charles. As blood pumped from the cuts, Di smeared it over the walls,'' it said. </P>
<P> Morton also says that Diana has become increasingly lonely. She even ate her Christmas dinner alone last year at her London home, a state apartment in Kensington Palace, while the rest of the royal family were gathered at Queen Elizabeth II's Norfolk County estate, Sandringham. </P>
<P> The Sun also dwelled on the report that Diana's ideal man would be clean-cut, smart, well-spoken, courteous and with a wry sense of humor -- in other words, a lot like Prince Charles. </P>
<P> Among her idols are English actor Tom Conti and film star Tom Cruise, liked for his ``cheeky sex appeal.'' </P>
<P> But the five pages the tabloid devoted to the new book are nothing compared to the 17 pages it needed for last month's royal bombshell book ``Princess in Love'' by British journalist Anna Pasternak, which alleged Diana had a five-year affair with former cavalry officer James Hewitt. </P>
<P> An aide for Charles, who is attending an environmental conference in Hong Kong, said the new book ``is not something he's bothered by.'' </P>
<P> Dutch, French, German and Japanese versions are due out later this week. </P>
