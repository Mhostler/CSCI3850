<P>  United States Swimming (USS) wants all of China's potential Olympic swimmers to be routinely tested for drugs until the Olympic Games in Atlanta, the federation's board of governors said Sunday. </P>
<P> The board called on China to submit a list of names of all potential Olympians by September of 1995 to FINA, the international governing body for swimming, for testing. </P>
<P> It said in a statement that complying with the request would give China a chance to prove to the world that its swimmers are clean of any performance-enhancing substances. </P>
<P> ``The proposal is being made in light of of the FINA Bureau report from its Bangkok meeting in March,'' USS president Carol Zaleski said in the statement. </P>
<P> Zaleski said in that report the Chinese federation announced that eight additional Chinese swimmers tested positive between April 1990 and June 1994, bringing the number of Chinese swimmers testing positive up to 19 since 1990. </P>
<P> ``China's record of widespread drug use is more than alarming,'' said Zaleski, who added that the aim was for ``a drug-free Olympic swimming competition in Atlanta.'' </P>
<P> The USS Board of Directors is organizing an international meeting in Atlanta in conjunction with the Pan Pacific Championships (Aug. 9-13) to discuss legislation for FINA's extraordinary Congress in Rio de Janeiro Dec. 1-3, during the short course world championships. </P>
<P> The Pan Pacific Swimming Association voted in February to ban China from the Pan Pacifics based on their widespread drug use. </P>
