<P>  Rare prints discovered in a mice-infested trunk, including two by 16th century German artist Albrecht Duerer, were sold by a London auction house for twice their estimated value Thursday. </P>
<P> Auctioneers Sotheby's said one of the Duerer prints, ``Samson Rending the Lion,'' fetched $311,700, the most ever paid for a Duerer woodcut. </P>
<P> ``It's terribly unusual to find a woodcut in this state, completely unpressed, unmarked and undisturbed for such a long time,'' said Frederick Mulder, the London dealer who bought the print. </P>
<P> The other Duerer print, ``The Rhinoceros,'' depicting the first such animal seen in Europe, was sold for $174,200 to an American collector bidding by phone. </P>
<P> The prints had been expected to sell for about $93,750 each. </P>
<P> Sotheby's said the seller, who wished to remain anonymous, found the prints in an old wooden trunk infested with mice while clearing out an outhouse. </P>
<P> ``Books had been chucked about on top and mice had chewed an album of airs from Mozart operas into beautiful cup-shaped nests,'' Sotheby's quoted the man as saying. </P>
<P> Sotheby's, which said the contents of the trunk appeared to have lain undisturbed for more than 100 years, said the two Duerer woodcuts were comparable in quality to the finest examples in the British Museum. </P>
