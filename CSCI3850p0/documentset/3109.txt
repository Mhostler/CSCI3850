<P>  Picabo Street drew a sketch in the snow, then used her skis to turn it into a masterpiece by winning a World Cup downhill race Friday. </P>
<P> ``I drew a podium in the snow at the top of the hill and I put Hilary on top, me as second and Katja third,'' the 23-year-old American said. </P>
<P> She had the right three racers on the podium -- she was just a little modest in her own expectations. </P>
<P> Street won the gold medal, fellow American Hilary Lindh was second and Kajta Seizinger of Germany was third. </P>
<P> It was the first U.S. 1-2 finish since 1982 when Holly Flanders and Cindy Nelson did it. </P>
<P> It was also Street's first World Cup win, and she did it with relative ease. </P>
<P> She was clocked in one minute 40.40 seconds. Lindh was second in 1:41.16 and Seizinger, the reigning downhill champion, was timed in 1:41.33. </P>
<P> Street, who joined the U.S. team seven years ago, was elated at finally breaking through with a win. ``I can't believe it. I've been waiting a long time for this.'' </P>
<P> Describing the slope Friday, she said: ``The snow was consistent all the way. It was as smooth as a baby's bum.'' </P>
<P> She did, however, have one slip: ``I made a terrible turn, but it teed me off and drove me to do better the rest of the way down.'' </P>
<P> She added, ``I said to myself, come on, you dirtbag, get going.'' </P>
<P> Ernst Hager, head coach of the U.S. women's downhillers, said he wasn't surprised by Street's win. </P>
<P> However, he wouldn't predict a win in Saturday's downhill, not because he feels Street isn't capable ``but because I know how difficult it is to do that.'' </P>
<P> He also said Lindh has come a long way and is capable of winning again after her victory in Colorado last week. </P>
<P> ``You're seeing a new Hilary. She's far more relaxed than she was.'' </P>
<P> Lindh, who is quieter by nature than the outgoing Street, said reports of a ``feud'' between them were exaggerated. </P>
<P> ``There simply are differences in our personality and in the way we do things,'' said Lindh. ``It's a bit hard to deal with at times, but that's the way things are.'' </P>
<P> Seizinger was disappointed with her run and said she had to correct her line a couple of times on the way down because she had gone into the new snow that was deep. </P>
<P> She suggested that the course should be groomed better for Saturday or it could become dangerous. </P>
<P> The weather was almost perfect with the sun shining and the temperature hovering right around freezing. </P>
<P> Heidi Zeller-Baehler of Switzerland finished a disappointing 15th after taking a gamble that didn't pay off. She decided to start 30th, figuring the track would have been made faster by the earlier skiers, but it didn't work out. </P>
<P> Lindh retained first place in the World Cup downhill standings with 180 points, 60 ahead of Seizinger, who has 120. Street has 100. </P>
<P> In the overall standings, Zeller-Baehler is first with 305 points, Vreni Schneider of Switzerland is second with 257 and Seizinger is third with 203. </P>
<P> Schneider decided to skip this event after she inspected the course and decided it was too narrow for her. </P>
