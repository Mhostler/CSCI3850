<P>  President Clinton can rely on the support of only 42 percent of the electorate and will face a tough re-election battle in 1996, according to a bipartisan poll issued Wednesday. </P>
<P> The survey, by Republican polling firm the Tarrance Group and Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, came up with the 42 percent figure after analyzing views on Clinton according to several criteria. </P>
<P> It found that over 40 percent of the electorate, including 92 percent of Republicans, said they would vote against Clinton no matter who his Republican opponent was next year. </P>
<P> Clinton would lose to Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, the leading Republican presidential candidate, by 42-45 percent, the poll said -- although that falls within the poll's statistical margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points. </P>
<P> ``This analysis shows deep problems for Bill Clinton,'' said pollster Ed Goeas of the Tarrance Group. He said the president's job approval rating had changed little over the past year, with 45 percent of voters consistently expressing negative feelings about him. </P>
<P> ``His negatives have been so institutionalized, it doesn't matter what style he adopts,'' said Goeas. ``Alternatively, people have stopped listening to him.'' </P>
<P> Clinton won election in 1992 with 43 percent of the popular vote in a three-way race against former president George Bush and Texas billionaire Ross Perot. </P>
<P> However the poll showed that Dole would narrowly beat Clinton in 1996 even if Perot ran again. </P>
<P> Even Lake, who tried to put a more positive spin on the numbers, said Clinton faced a formidable problem. She noted that Republicans were much more enthusiastic about their candidates than Democrats were about theirs'. </P>
<P> ``Democrats are much less sure about re-electing Clinton than Republicans are about getting rid of Clinton,'' she said. </P>
<P> Overall, voters liked Republicans more than Democrats and approved of the job the Republican majority was doing in Congress. If Congressional elections were held now, the Republicans would probably improve their majorities. </P>
