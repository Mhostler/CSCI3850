<P>  Republican House Speaker- designate Newt Gingrich said Tuesday he expected to have a vote on a balanced budget amendment on the floor of the House of Representatives Jan. 19. </P>
<P> Gingrich told a conference of the conservative, non-profit think-tank, Heritage Foundation, ``We're probably going to vote on the balanced budget amendment on January 19, and have that as our first smashing victory.'' </P>
<P> To pass, such a resolution would need a two-thirds majority. In the old House, dominated by Democrats, the balanced budget amendment came up for a vote last March, falling 12 votes short of the necessary two thirds. </P>
<P> A balanced budget amendment is one of the 10 points in Gingrich's ``Contract with America,'' endorsed by House Republicans but not by their colleagues in the Senate. </P>
<P> However, Senate Republican leaders have also favored pushing for a balanced budget amendment as one of their first major items of business. </P>
<P> To amend the constitution, each of the 50 states would also need to approve the proposed change. </P>
<P> Gingrich also vowed to introduce an amendment to allow voluntary school prayer, saying it was central to healing the country. </P>
<P> ``Re-establishing the legitimate right of praying is at the core of being American. It will have surprising impact within a year on the quality of life in the schools,'' he said. </P>
<P> But he said Republicans should take a broad view of religion, recognizing that every American had the right to see God in his own way. </P>
