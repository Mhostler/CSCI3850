<P>  Federal programs that aid U.S. farm exports and help feed the poor are earmarked for hefty increases in the fiscal 1996 budget proposed Monday by the Clinton administration. </P>
<P> The Agriculture Department's $62.3 billion share of the overall budget spares farmers from any change in crop subsidy programs. However, the administration said it will propose later cuts totaling $1.5 billion in farm subsidies over five years -- a negligible sum considering predictions of huge cuts looming for the department. </P>
<P> Crop supports were estimated to drop to $8.9 billion in fiscal 1996 with a return to normal-sized crops. Record 1994 crops will drive up farm subsidies this year. </P>
<P> Overall, Department of Agriculture spending in fiscal 1996 would be virtually the same as this year. Some analysts who expected a stand-pat budget for the department said it would shift the blame to the Republican-run Congress for making the cuts necessary to trim the federal deficit and preserve White House leverage as Congress writes a farm-policy law this year. </P>
<P> Under the fiscal 1996 budget, farm export promotion would get an additional $600 million over five years in ``green box'' spending, an initiative that takes its name from the moniker given promotional programs that comply with fair-trade rules. </P>
<P> Green-box items include $100 million in a new type of short-term export credit guarantees aimed at consumer-ready and high-value products, larger funding for the cost-sharing Market Promotion Program to build demand for U.S. goods, more donations through the Food for Progress Program and a larger network of U.S. agricultural attache offices. </P>
<P> For example, Hanoi is slated as a site for an agricultural attache. </P>
<P> About $1.1 billion would be spent in fiscal 1996 under U.S. export subsidy programs, $5.7 billion in export credits would be offered and the Food for Peace Program would get $1.02 billion. </P>
<P> President Clinton followed up his laudatory words in the State of the Union speech by proposing a $350 million increase in the Women, Infants and Children feeding program. It would give WIC $3.83 billion and allow the program to reach an additional 400,000 low-income pregnant women, new mothers and their offspring. </P>
<P> Upon taking office, the administration set a goal of full funding -- enough money to aid all eligible people -- of WIC by the end of 1996. At present, WIC serves 72 percent of those eligible. </P>
<P> Food stamp funding spending would climb to $26 billion, a $900 million increase due chiefly to a slight increase in benefits stemming from rising food costs. </P>
<P> Child nutrition programs, dominated by the school lunch program, would get $8.55 billion, a slight increase. </P>
<P> House Republicans have proposed converting public-feeding programs into a block grant for states to run as they wish, but with lower federal funding. </P>
<P></P>
<P> Tonnage shipped under the Food for Peace program was forecast to total 3.4 million metric tons in fiscal 1996, a drop of 400,000 tons from the current fiscal year. Funding for concessional sales would drop to $178 million, enough to aid 900,000 tons of sales. About 1.2 million tons will be shipped this year. </P>
