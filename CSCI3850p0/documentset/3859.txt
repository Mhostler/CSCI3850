<DATELINE>HOUSTON, Texas (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  John Starks returned to the scene of the crime Thursday and helped the New York Knicks exact some revenge against the Rockets with a 93-77 victory over Houston in the first meeting between the clubs since the NBA Finals. </P>
<P> The last time Starks played in the Summit he shot a miserable 2-for-18 and was painted the villain of the Knicks defeat in the seventh and deciding game of the championship series. </P>
<P> On Thursday, Starks shot 9-for-17, scoring nine of his 22 points in the fourth quarter, to lead the Knicks to victory.  ``I wanted everyone here to know I could hit a three,'' said Starks, who was 0-for-11 from that distance in Game Seven. </P>
<P> ``It's not redemption for last year. We just wanted to close the gap between us and Orlando,'' added Starks, whose Knicks are 7 3/8 games back of the first-place Magic in the Atlantic Division. </P>
<P> Derek Harper added 16 points and Patrick Ewing had 15 points and 18 rebounds for the Knicks, who have won 10 of their last 11 games and dealt the defending NBA champions their third straight loss. </P>
<P> Hakeem Olajuwon had 28 points and 17 rebounds to pace the Rockets, who shot 5-of-14 from the field in the final period and went nearly the last five minutes without a field goal. </P>
<P> Majerle, who hit five three-pointers in the fourth quarter, also scored five points in an 11-0 third-quarter run that put the Suns in front for good. </P>
<P> James Robinson scored a career-high 32 points for the Blazers, who were without starting guards Rod Strickland and Clyde Drexler and reserve forward Mark Bryant. All three were suspended for brawling in Portland's previous game against the Sacramento Kings. </P>
<P> At Minnesota, Detlef Schrempf scored 16 of his 22 points in the third quarter, including 10 during a 13-2 run that lifted the Seattle SuperSonics to their eighth straight victory, a 102-87 triumph over the Timberwolves. </P>
<P> Schrempf keyed the spurt which erased a five-point deficit and gave Seattle a 70-64 lead with 5:57 left in the period. Shawn Kemp added 20 points and 13 rebounds for Seattle. Isaiah Rider scored 22 points to lead the T-Wolves, who shot only 35 percent from the field. </P>
<P> In Milwaukee, rookie Glenn Robinson scored 30 points and Todd Day added 29 to lead the Bucks to a 120-115 victory over the struggling Washington Bullets. </P>
<P> Milwaukee has won three games in a row for the first time in nearly two years. The Bullets have lost 10 of their last 11 and 19 of 21 games. </P>
<P> Vin Baker made a pair of free throws with 6:07 left to give the Bucks a 104-102 lead and they held on for the win. </P>
<P> Rex Chapman scored 30 points, Scott Skiles added 22 and Calbert Cheaney had 21 for Washington. </P>
<P> In Sacramento, Mitch Richmond scored 11 of his 26 points in the fourth quarter to help the Kings overcame an 18-point first-half deficit and rally for a 112-103 victory over the Golden State Warriors. </P>
<P> Walt Williams added 21 points and Spud Webb chipped in 18 for Sacramento, winner of eight of its last 11 contests. </P>
<P> Tim Hardaway scored 29 points for the Warriors, who have dropped 14 in a row on the road. </P>
<P> Victor Alexander and David Wood each added a season-high 20 points for the struggling Warriors. </P>
