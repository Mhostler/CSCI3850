<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Clinton's national security adviser said Sunday that the United States will stick to plans for bringing former Soviet client states into NATO despite Moscow's objections. </P>
<P> ``We're at a very important strategic moment in Central and Eastern Europe,'' the adviser, Anthony Lake, said in an interview on the NBC-TV program ``Meet the Press'' on Sunday. </P>
<P> ``We have to show the Poles and the Czechs and the Hungarians and others that they can look to the West in confidence, that NATO will be expanding,'' he added. </P>
<P> He said the administration had not yet established a precise timetable, pending further consultations with U.S. allies. </P>
<P> Lake spelled out U.S. policy on Russian President Boris Yeltsin's military drive to crush rebels in southern Russia's mainly Muslim breakaway province of Chechnya. </P>
<P> ``I think the issue is more how they use force than whether they use it,'' he said in the comments taped Friday at the White House. </P>
<P> ``First of all, let me make it clear that we support the territorial integrity of Russia, just as we support the territorial integrity of its neighbors, so the issue is not whether Chechnya should be a part of Russia or not.'' </P>
<P> ``The issue for us is what their military tactics are, and we're very concerned that the kinds of tactics they've been using have led to many more deaths than we think should have occurred.'' </P>
<P> Lake said the United States was not excluding Russia itself from membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization at some unspecified date. </P>
<P> Pressed on whether Poland and Hungary would be brought in by 1996, Lake replied: ``I can't give you a date. This is a process that's got to evolve.'' </P>
<P> He said NATO expansion was one of the ``important reasons'' for a scheduled Geneva meeting in mid-January between Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev. </P>
<P> Kozyrev, in an interview from Moscow on the same program, taped Friday, said the Russian government was intent on maintaining good relations with the United States regardless of any disagreements. </P>
<P> He played down a warning by Yeltsin that defying Russia over NATO expansion could result in a ``cold peace.'' </P>
<P> ``Let me take a few seconds to assure American people and Russian people that we will not allow a Cold War be substituted by the cold peace,'' Kozyrev said. </P>
<P> ``We are on track of partnership and, in the end, alliance with the United States as with other democratic countries in the world, but it takes a little longer and a little more painful process to translate this ...'' </P>
