<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  An Iraqi Kurdish group said its guerrillas clashed Thursday with Iraqi government troops in north Iraq after Baghdad pushed its forces towards rebel-held territory on two fronts. </P>
<P> The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) said Iraqi troops opened artillery and machinegun fire on several of its positions in the Chem Chamal district, east of Kirkuk city. </P>
<P> There was no independent confirmation of the report. </P>
<P> Shazad Saib, the PUK's Ankara representative, said Iraqi infantry units and 30 tanks had also moved up to less than a mile (one km) from the PUK-held town of Kifri, 60 miles (100 km) southwest of Chem Chamal. </P>
<P> There were no reports of casualties. </P>
<P> ``Our forces have fired back. We don't know yet if it is an all out attack but it's a sensitive situation,'' Saib told Reuters. </P>
<P> The reported Iraqi push took place south of a Kurdish safe haven protected by Western air power from Iraqi attacks. </P>
<P> The London office of the Iraqi National Congress opposition group also reported fighting in the Chem Chamal area. </P>
<P> The PUK has blamed the government of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein for a bomb explosion which killed 76 people in the Kurdish city of Zakho Monday. </P>
<P> Saib said Iraqi artillery had stepped up its previously sporadic shelling of Kurdish areas near Kifri since Tuesday. </P>
<P> Iraq's other main Kurdish militia, the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), has charged the PUK with the Zakho bombing. </P>
<P> The PUK and KDP ostensibly share power in the Kurdish administration which governs northern Iraq but the two groups have frequently clashed in the last 10 weeks. </P>
<P> Iraq's Kurds have been under the protection of a U.S., British and French joint air force based in southern Turkey since after the Gulf War in 1991. </P>
