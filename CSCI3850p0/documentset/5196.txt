<P>  An Atlanta Braves replacement baseball player, signed to stand in for striking major leaguers, was shot to death near the hotel where the team is staying for spring training, police said Saturday. </P>
<P> The player, Dave Shotkoski, went for a walk early Friday evening and was gunned down near the hotel, a police spokeswoman said. </P>
<P> Witnesses told investigators the gunman fired several shots and escaped on a bicycle. Police said late Saturday they did not have a suspect in custody. </P>

<P> Shotkoski, 30, was from Hoffman Estate, Ill., police said. </P>
<P> The Braves, who offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the killer, canceled their exhibition game against Montreal Saturday. </P>
