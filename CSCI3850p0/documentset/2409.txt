<DATELINE>OTTAWA (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Bodies are piling up in southern Quebec towns where grave-diggers went on strike 74 days ago. </P>
<P> ``They're just stashing them away like beef carcasses,'' recent widow Antoinette O'Dwyer told the Ottawa Sun. Grieving families said they would fetch the bodies and bury them themselves if undertakers do not pick up their shovels soon. </P>
<P> Funeral homes with full cold-storage space are keeping the cadavers in outside ``winter vaults'' but an autumn heatwave could make the use of these unrefrigerated stone buildings unpleasant. </P>
<P> Negotiations over cemetery workers' job security continue. </P>
