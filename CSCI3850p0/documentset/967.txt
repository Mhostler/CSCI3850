<P>  Rwanda's Prime Minister warned Wednesday there could be a regional war if refugees do not return from Zaire, where he said Rwandan extremists were continuing their intimidation. </P>
<P> ``The return of recent refugees is an absolute priority, otherwise the conflict will begin again,'' Faustin Twagiramungu told the Belgian newspaper Le Soir, adding that the Rwandan Patriotic Front would react if extremists made attacks. </P>
<P> ``If the ``activities' resumed, this could degenerate into a regional conflict because our troops, who have just emerged from a war, would not stand back and not react and would risk bringing war into Zaire,'' he said. </P>
<P> Rwandan refugees have flooded into neighboring countries since April following the massacre of an estimated 500,000 people, mainly from the Tutsi minority, after the assassination of Rwanda's president. </P>
<P> There was a major exodus in July to eastern Zaire, which was described by aid workers as the biggest flow of refugees in contemporary history. </P>
<P> Twagiramungu said that some 200,000 refugees had returned from neighboring Burundi and Uganda out of an estimated two million in total. </P>
<P> He said his government was receiving no outside help and the state's coffers were bare. Civil servants were not being paid and were being fed by the World Food Programme. </P>
<P> Humanitarian emergency aid was being given. But ``the essential condition for the country to start up again is for the government to function,'' Twagiramungu added. </P>
<P> French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said in a radio interview Wednesday that it was up to the new government, headed by the Tutsi-dominated Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF), to provide the conditions under which refugees could return home. </P>
<P> He said the departure of French troops from Rwanda had not triggered a new refugee exodus. </P>
<P> ``A few days ago people were predicting a massive exodus from the humanitarian safe zone,'' Juppe said. ``This exodus has not taken place.'' </P>
<P> France pulled out the last of its 2,500 troops from Rwanda Sunday despite opposition from relief agencies and the United Nations, ending a two-month mission during which it created a safe zone in the southwest of the central African nation. </P>
<P> The French presence helped stop massacres by soldiers and militiamen loyal to the former Hutu regime in which an estimated 500,000 people died, most of them from the Tutsi minority. Many Hutus have sought refuge in the safe zone. </P>
<P> Relief agencies feared that the pullout might bring a repeat of the exodus from Rwanda which hit the Zairean border town of Goma where about 800,000 people are stranded in filthy, disease-ridden camps. </P>
