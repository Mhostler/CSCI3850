<P>  A majority of the nation's lawyers believe that O.J. Simpson will escape conviction of the double murder of his ex-wife and a friend, according to a poll to be published Monday. </P>
<P> The survey, which appears in the current issue of the National Law Journal, shows that 61 percent of lawyers think the trial will end in not guilty verdicts or a hung jury. Of those, 22 percent believe he will be acquitted and 39 percent believe the jury will not be able to reach a verdict. </P>
<P> When the National Law Journal told Robert Shapiro, one of Simpson's lawyers, about the results, he said, ``I hope those lawyers get to serve on the jury.'' </P>
<P> The poll of 311 lawyers across the country was conducted by Penn + Schoen Associates between September 23-26. It has a sampling error of plus or minus 5.6 percent at a 95 percent confidence level. </P>
<P> Jury selection in the case began Sept. 26 before Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Lance Ito. Simpson is charged in the June 12 slayings of Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman. </P>
<P> The survey respondents believed that conviction in the case which is built on circumstantial evidence will depend on the admissibility of DNA evidence. Six out of 10 lawyers said that if the DNA evidence is ruled inadmissible, Simpson is unlikely to be convicted. </P>
<P> A large majority, 78 percent, felt that the massive amount of pretrial publicity has made it less likely Simpson will get a fair trial. The same percentage favored a judicial gag order. </P>
<P> Despite these feelings, 40 percent thought the quality of coverage favored neither defense nor prosecution. </P>
<P> Another large majority, 64 percent, said that Simpson's fame as a football star, sportscaster and actor will hurt his chances for a fair trial. </P>
<P> Forty-two percent felt Simpson's race -- he is black -- will help him win an acquittal while 12 percent said it would make a guilty verdict more likely. </P>
