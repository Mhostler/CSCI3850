<P>  House Speaker Newt Gingrich charged Tuesday ``a small group of elitists'' from public television are lobbying Congress with tax money to prevent a cutoff of federal funds for their programming. </P>
<P> At a news conference, the Republican leader was asked about a published poll commissioned by the Public Broadcasting Service that said 49 percent of Americans think public television funding should be increased. </P>
<P> The poll came at a time the Republicans controlling Congress want to cut or eliminate federal funds for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which in turn partially funds National Public Radio and PBS, the public TV service. </P>
<P> ``My question is what is a tax-supported institution doing publishing a poll?'' Gingrich replied. ``What is PBS doing using tax money to lobby the American people to send it more tax money?'' </P>
<P> He said cable television networks are not in Congress lobbying for funds. ``The only group lobbying are a small group of elitists who want to tax all of the American people so they can spend all the money,'' Gingrich said. </P>
<P> Public broadcasting receives roughly 14 percent of its money from funds funneled through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. PBS's annual budget is about $160 million. Most public broadcasting funds come from donations and grants. </P>
<P> A spokeswoman for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, Karen Doyne, said ``The poll cost very little, and the money came from public television stations.'' </P>
<P> She said the poll of 1,005 adults conducted Jan. 5-8 by Opinion Researchg Corp of Princeton, N.J., cost about $5,000. </P>
<P> Its principal findings were that 49 percent of adults, including Republicans and Democrats, favor increased funding for public television, 35 percent want the same amount and 13 percent want a reduction or elimination. The rest did not know. The poll had a three percentage point margin of error. </P>
<P> Gingrich told reporters he assumed some of the costs of the poll came from federal appropriations that went to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which receives about $286 million from Congress. </P>
<P> Doyne said, however, that ``none of the direct funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting went into the poll. All of the money came from the stations.'' </P>
<P> While Gingrich said individual cable networks are not lobbying Congress, there is a cable television association whose activities do include lobbying. </P>
