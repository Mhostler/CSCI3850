<P>  Ghana has unveiled an ambitious plan to plug itself into the international information revolution by privatising its state telecommunications company. </P>
<P> Under the plan, announced by Transport and Communications Minister Edward Salia on Wednesday, Ghana Telecom will be privatised by finding a strategic investor to help strengthen its technological base and train its staff. </P>
<P> The government will break Ghana Telecom's monopoly by allowing a second national network to compete. </P>
<P> And the market for cellular telephones, paging and payphones will be liberalised to attract more companies and a national authority will regulate the industry. </P>
<P> ``The international community is working towards establishing a global information infrastructure,'' Salia said in remarks carried by state-run Ghana News Agency. </P>
<P> ``It is therefore imperative for Ghana to become part of the network because the alternative would be that we would be marginalised.'' </P>
<P> Ghana is liberalising its economy as part of International Monetary Fund and World Bank-sponsored reforms to encourage foreign investment and bolster its economy. </P>
<P> Salia said his aim was to boost the number of telephone lines in Ghana to 200,000 from 50,000 -- the International Telecommunications Union target -- but still below current demand of 300,000. </P>
<P> He said international or bilateral credit, which tended in the past to result in high-cost procurement and higher prices, was not the answer. </P>
<P> ``The solution to the problem of meeting the demand within a reasonable timeframe must lie with the private sector,'' he said. ``That is to attract private sector finance here.'' </P>
<P> Salia said a strategic investor would be invited to buy into Ghana Telecom. One market analyst predicted U.S. companies Southwest Bell and AT&T could be likely investors. </P>
<P> ``The French are also extremely keen about hedging their investment in West Africa,'' the analyst added. </P>
<P> Salia said investment opportunities would be given to Ghanaians through the sale of some shares of the privatised company to expand its ownership beyond the strategic investor. </P>
<P> The second national network operator and Ghana Telecom would have similar rights and obligations, he added. </P>
