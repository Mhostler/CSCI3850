<P>  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin Wednesday rejected PLO and Syrian criticism of his country's draft peace accord with Jordan and said Israel would press ahead with attempts to negotiate peace with Syria. </P>
<P> Rabin said Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization had signed a bilateral agreement with Israel, and real peace in the Middle East could only be achieved through similar bilateral deals with Israel's Arab neighbors. </P>
<P> ``I believe every Arab country has got its own leadership, its own interests and therefore real negotiations that will lead to a real peace have to be done on the basis of bilateral (deals),'' Rabin told British Broadcasting Corporation radio. </P>
<P> ``We will continue also the (U.S.-mediated) negotiations with Syria. We are committed to continue the peace negotiations with every Arab partner,'' said the Israeli prime minister, who is on a two-day private visit to Britain. </P>
<P> In Cairo Tuesday, Syrian President Hafez al-Assad said that Arab states which have broken ranks and reached separate agreements with Israel had made a big mistake. </P>
<P> The PLO assailed Israel's treaty with Jordan Tuesday, saying it violated the PLO's own deal with the Jewish state. </P>
<P> A draft treaty initialled in Amman on Monday recognises a special role for Jordan as guardian of the Muslim shrines in Jerusalem -- a role the PLO also claims for itself. </P>
<P> Rabin, who held talks with British Prime Minister John Major Tuesday and was to speak at Oxford University later on Wednesday, said he believed Jerusalem must remain united under Israeli sovereignty and be ``our capital forever.'' </P>
<P> But he said there would be a guarantee of free access to the holy places and that they would be fully self-administered. </P>
<P> Rabin was asked about an explosion on a bus in Tel Aviv Wednesday. He said he had no details of the attack but blamed Muslim groups opposed to Arab-Israeli peace moves. </P>
<P> He said he would return to Israel immediately. </P>
