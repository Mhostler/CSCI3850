<P>  The manuscript of four Haydn string quartets which an Australian woman kept under her bed for safekeeping was sold at a London auction Thursday for $1.04 million. </P>
<P> The manuscript, cherished by the woman's family for more than a century, was bought by German antiquarian book dealer Hans Schneider, Sotheby's auctioneers said. </P>
<P> The woman, who prefers to remain anonymous, wants to use the money to set up an international trust for young musicians. </P>
<P> Her ancestor, a retired English colonel, bought the manuscript at a London auction house in 1851 before emigrating to Australia. </P>
<P> ``Joseph Haydn was known as the father of the string quartet and these quartets represent the perfection of his style,'' said a spokesman for Sotheby's. </P>
