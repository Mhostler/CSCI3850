<DATELINE>KIEV, Ukraine (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Leonid Kuchma took the oath of office as Ukraine's second post-Soviet head of state Tuesday and said the time for romanticism and experiments was over in the former Soviet republic. </P>
<P> Kuchma, visibly moved by the ceremony in parliament, swore to defend Ukrainian independence and uphold its laws, one hand on the country's Soviet-era constitution, the other on a 15th-century Ukrainian translation of the Bible. </P>
<P> He then walked 100 yards to the Marinsky palace, the presidential residence that once housed visiting Russian czars, to take the reins of power from the man he defeated in this month's election -- Leonid Kravchuk. </P>
<P> In a fiery speech, broadcast live on television, Kuchma pledged to forge ahead with economic reforms and quickly relieve the mass misery and poverty caused by two and a half years of economic decline. </P>
<P> ``Strict and unpopular measures will have to be taken. We must not yield to the temptation of cosmetic measures, of closing our eyes, of deceiving the nation,'' he said, speaking pointedly in stilted Ukrainian rather than his native Russian. </P>
<P> ``The state has no time for experiments. The people have neither the time nor the patience for them ... Political romanticism and euphoria associated with a new state need to be replaced with realism, concrete action and pragmatism.'' </P>
<P> He also proposed making Russian, spoken as a mother tongue by large numbers of Ukraine's 52 million people, an official language. Ukrainian, discouraged for centuries under czarist and Kremlin rule, would remain the sole ``state language.'' </P>
<P> That provoked cries of ``shame'' from nationalists which were overwhelmed by applause from the large contingents of communists and allies elected to parliament earlier this year.  Since his resounding election win over Kravchuk, the former communist who led Ukraine to independence, Kuchma has pledged to proceed with ``evolutionary, not revolutionary reforms.'' </P>
<P> He has also been at pains to stress that campaign promises to enter an economic union with Russia did not mean restoring Ukraine's Soviet-era links with Moscow, nor would it harm relations with Germany, the United States and other countries. </P>
<P> Kuchma has said his first moves will be to liberalize controlled foreign exchange markets and ease tax burdens. </P>
<P> Official figures released on the eve of the inauguration underscored the extent of the catastrophe after Kravchuk's failure to put together a comprehensive reform program. </P>
<P> The figures showed industrial production had plunged nearly 40 percent in the first six months of the year, with production of some consumer goods falling by up to 80 percent. </P>
