<P>  The commander of U.N. troops in Bosnia has warned against escalating the use of force to press for a peaceful solution in former Yugoslavia. </P>
<P> ``We cannot bomb our way to peace. Increased use of force, to my mind, is not a solution at the moment,'' Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose said in an ABC television interview Wednesday. </P>
<P> His comments appeared to differ considerably from the U.S. perspective. </P>
<P> President Clinton had been preparing to ask the United Nations to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia, but agreed on Monday to wait six months at the request of the Bosnian government. </P>
<P> And Defense Secretary William Perry threatened Bosnian Serbs Wednesday with ``more vigorous application'' of NATO air strikes in retaliation for any Serb attacks against Muslim safe havens and NATO peacekeeping troops. </P>
<P> ``Of course, there is debate going on all the time, but I believe we have used force to the limit possible,'' Rose said on ''Nightline.'' </P>
<P> The U.N. commander allowed that there would always be ''slightly different'' points of view among those on the ground and ``people elsewhere.'' </P>
<P> ``But my assertion is that we have been extremely robust in the level of force we have used already ... we cannot use more levels of force than we are curently using,'' he said. </P>
<P> Rose explained that he was required to stay within the principles of peacekeeping. He said his forces had remained on the right side of what he called ``the Mogadishu line,'' a reference to what began as a humanitarian mission in Somalia but turned into a disaster when U.S. troops were drawn into factional fighting. </P>
<P> ``I cannot allow my troops to be led or pushed across the Mogadishu line, where a very good peacekeeping organization went into war,'' Rose said. ``We cannot fight a war from white-painted vehicles.'' </P>
<P> Rose also denied reports that he might leave his post in Bosnia early or be replaced. </P>
<P> ``I am here for one year and I promised the people of Sarajevo I would be with them as a Sarajevan living in their city, walking around the streets as they do, without a flak vest, not necessarily driving armored cars, and returning this city to peace,'' he said. </P>
