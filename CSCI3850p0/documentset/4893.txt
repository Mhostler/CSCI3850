<P> Taking the witness stand for the third day, Detective Mark Fuhrman said he found the glove on a narrow walkway behind Simpson's guesthouse the morning after the murders outside Nicole Brown Simpson's Brentwood townhouse two miles away. </P>
<P> Fuhrman said he was led to the area after Kato Kaelin, Simpson's house guest, told of having heard a loud thump on his outside wall the night before. </P>
<P> ``It appeared to be a dark leather glove,'' Fuhrman said. ''It appeared to be somewhat moist or sticky.'' </P>
<P> He said it ``looked similar'' to a bloody glove found near the bodies. Tests would later show the glove found on Simpson's grounds was also stained with blood. </P>
<P> Simpson's attorneys have accused Fuhrman of being a racist who may have planted the glove at Simpson's estate to frame him. Fuhrman has denied racism or evidence tampering. </P>
