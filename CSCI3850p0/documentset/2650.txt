<P>  European allies believe U.S. military advisers are helping Bosnia's Muslim-led government and that intelligence on Serb positions and deployment is being handed to the Muslims, diplomats and military sources say. </P>
<P> The sources, contacted among a wide range of U.S. allies recently, told Reuters there was serious concern in European capitals about U.S. military support in Bosnia, although there was no conclusive proof of direct Washington involvement. </P>
<P> ``We know there are American military advisers on the ground, offering the Muslims training and so on. There is also some evidence that valuable U.S. intelligence has somehow got through to them,'' said one source, who declined to be identified. </P>
<P> ``We are not sure to what degree this represents the involvement of private individuals, mercenaries if you like, or whether the government is involved in some way,'' said another senior source. ``But it is extremely worrying.'' </P>
<P> The United States has denied suggestions that it has supplied arms to the Bosnian government, although Washington favors lifting an international embargo to help the Muslims fight back against the better-equipped Serbs. </P>
<P> The United States, which has taken a tougher line against the Serbs than many of its partners, caused consternation among its NATO allies by deciding unilaterally last week to stop enforcing the arms embargo for the Muslims. </P>
<P> Any perception that the United States is now turning a blind eye to infringements of the arms embargo or that it is actively helping the Muslims would seriously damage the chances of a peace deal in Bosnia and cause more transatlantic trouble. </P>
<P> Diplomats said several governments had sought clarification from Washington on the degree of U.S. military involvement but had received only vague or limited responses. </P>
<P> Many European governments have troops in Bosnia as part of the U.N. peacekeeping force and they are worried that a tougher U.S. line could bring reprisals from the Serbs. </P>
<P> ``No one has talked about it publicly but there have been contacts on this and many of us are unhappy,'' said one envoy. </P>
<P> Some said there was some evidence a small amount of U.S. weaponry had been smuggled through to Bosnian government forces, although with no apparent involvement from Washington. </P>
<P> ``There are all sorts of ways private individuals with certain sympathies could have got stuff through,'' said one military source. ``There is some evidence of that but certainly without any official fingerprints.'' </P>
<P> Diplomats said it was unclear to what degree U.S. military advisers, thought to number several dozen, were present in Bosnia with official government blessing. </P>
<P> There was evidence that Bosnian government forces -- who made major gains against the Serbs recently before losing some of the ground they had taken -- had received U.S. intelligence, including aerial photographs. </P>
<P> ``That is much harder to explain,'' said another European envoy. ``Private individuals do not have access to such secret government material which can be passed to third parties.'' </P>
<P> The United States is, however, now refusing to pass intelligence onto its NATO allies about possible shipments of weapons to the Bosnian Muslims in violation of the arms embargo. </P>
