<P>  Cuba, traditionally wary of U.S. intervention in the Caribbean, Wednesday condemned the U.S. military operation in neighboring Haiti as another ``black chapter of interference'' by the United States. </P>
<P> ``We firmly oppose this type of flagrant intervention in the internal affairs of a sovereign state and alert world public opinion to the dangers that actions of this nature represent for international peace and security,'' the foreign ministry said in a lengthy statement. </P>
<P> ``With this new action, the United States reopens a black chapter of interference in the region. Anyone applauding it today may be its victim tomorrow,'' said the statement, published in the ruling Communist Party newspaper Granma. </P>
<P> The statement said from the outset Cuba had favored a negotiated settlement to achieve the restoration of democracy in Haiti. </P>
<P> It viewed the U.S. military intervention as an effort by the Clinton administration to ``reaffirm U.S. hegemony'' and silence critics seeking a strong leadership, said the statement. </P>
<P> The deal reached Sunday with Haiti's military leaders showed Washington could have used persuasion alone to get them leave, it said. </P>
<P> The intervention might be bloodless, but was still dangerous and illegal, the statement said. </P>
<P> And it showed ``how far the United States can go in manipulating international mechanisms, imposing solutions that walk all over the sacred principles of inviolability and sovereignty of nations,'' it added. </P>
