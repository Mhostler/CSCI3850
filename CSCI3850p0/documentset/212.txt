<P>  Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala told a Senate panel opening hearings on the Clinton welfare reform plan Wednesday the government must tell teen-age mothers they have ``made a mistake.'' </P>
<P> The Clinton plan would permit welfare payments to recipients born after 1971 for only two years. The recipients would then have to find work. </P>
<P> Shalala said government should send the message it will make a short-term investment in a young mother and child, but the mother must make an investment in herself as well. </P>
<P> ``This should not be an easy decision on your part to engage in sexual activity that may result in a child, but if you do, you're about to go through a very, very difficult time because you have made what we consider a mistake,'' Shalala said. </P>
<P> Senate Finance Committee Chairman Daniel Moynihan, the moving force on Capitol Hill for welfare reform, said he would soon convene more hearings on reform. </P>
<P> Under the Clinton plan, teen-age recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children would have until age 20 to find work, or be forced to take a government job. </P>
<P> Only mothers with a child under age 1 year-old or a disabled child would be exempt. </P>
<P> Iowa Republican Charles Grassley asked what would happen ''if the private sector jobs are not available and if there isn't enough money appropriated ... then those individuals will not be off welfare after two years, right?'' </P>
<P> Shalala said the Clinton administration is planning carefully to match money with recipients. </P>
<P> Without the Clinton plan by 2000 there will be 2.3 million heads of household getting AFDC, she said. Under the Clinton plan about 330,000 of those people would be in private jobs, nearly 400,000 on government jobs and 222,000 would be working part-time. </P>
<P> Moynihan said he hoped welfare reform would pass this year. But Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell -- who said he shares that hope -- has called it highly unlikely. </P>
