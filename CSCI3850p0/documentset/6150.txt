<P>  Vietnam plans to reform its cabinet structure in a move one minister says is a ``necessity'' to make the executive branch more effective and adaptable, a newspaper reported on Sunday. </P>
<P> The semi-official Vietnam Investment Review weekly quoted Minister of Government Le Xuan Trinh as saying the cabinet would discuss reorganising the executive and other state offices at a meeting in Ho Chi Minh City in the coming week. </P>
<P> Trinh, who said the plan had been approved by the ruling Communist Party Politburo and would be implemented later this year, said the move was in line with a masterplan to reform the whole national administration. </P>
<P> He said some ministry departments would either be combined, split or required to change their names to match new roles. </P>
<P> It was unclear if any ministers would lose their positions in the streamlining, which has been expected by political analysts and diplomats. </P>
<P> Foreign business executives complain that complex licensing proceedures in communist Vietnam sometimes require approval from several ministries. They have also said coordination among ministries and government departments is poor. </P>
<P> Trinh said the government had succeeded in abolishing some red tape and cumbersome bureaucratic formalities on foreign investment, trade and urban planning. </P>
<P> ``We have reduced a lot of paperwork and fees and we will keep following the same track in the near future,'' he added. </P>
<P> During this week's cabinet meeting, the government would take tougher measures to deal with transport problems in the large cities of Ho Chi Minh City in southern Vietnam and the capital, Hanoi, Trinh said. </P>
