<P>  Rookie Kevin Jarvis pitched the first complete game in the major leagues this season, a two-hit shutout, as the Cincinnati Reds blanked the Florida Marlins 3-0 Wednesday for their fourth straight victory. </P>
<P> Jarvis (1-0), a 25-year-old righthander, walked two and struck out three and helped his cause by going 2-for-4 from the plate and scoring Cincincinnati's first run. </P>
<P> After allowing a double to Greg Colbrunn with one out in the second inning, Jarvis retired 22 of the next 23 batters until Gary Sheffield doubled with two out in the ninth. </P>
<P> ``It feels great,'' Jarvis said. ``All four of my pitches were working and I was throwing strikes. It was a lot of fun out there.'' </P>
<P> Jarvis singled to right off loser John Burkett to open Cincinnati's three-run sixth inning. He later scored on a triple by Deion Sanders. </P>
<P> As for his hitting, Jarvis said: ``My theory of hitting is that a blind squirrel finds a nut once in awhile.'' </P>
<P> Burkett (2-2) allowed three runs and six hits in 5 1/3 innings as the Marlins suffered their fourth straight loss and fell to 0-6 at home. </P>
<P> In San Diego, Eric Karros homered and drove in two runs and Ramon Martinez pitched six strong innings to lead the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 3-1 victory over the Padres. </P>
<P> Karros, who had three of the Dodgers' five hits, singled in Raul Mondesi in a two-run first inning and homered to deep center in the ninth as Los Angeles avoided a three-game sweep. </P>
<P> Martinez (3-1) allowed one run and seven hits in six innings, walking two and striking out five. Todd Worrell finished for his second save. </P>
<P> Former Dodger Fernando Valenzuela (0-2) gave up two runs and four hits in five innings for the loss. </P>
<P> In Philadelphia, Tyler Green pitched six scoreless innings and Darren Daulton homered and drove in four runs as the streaking Phillies routed the Montreal Expos 10-1 for their seventh straight victory. </P>
<P> Dave Hollins hit a two-run homer and Jim Eisenreich drove in a pair of runs for the Phillies, who have won seven in a row for the first time time since 1991. </P>
<P> Green (2-1), a rookie right-hander, won his second consecutive start. He allowed three hits, walked four and struck out six before giving way to Toby Borland, who allowed one run in two innings. </P>
<P> In New York, Jose Vizcaino's two-run bloop single keyed a a four-run eighth inning as the Mets rallied for a 5-2 victory over the Atlanta Braves. </P>
<P> The Mets snapped a three-game losing streak and won for only the third time in their last nine games. The Braves lost for the fifth time in six games. </P>
<P> Doug Henry (1-1) pitched a scoreless eighth to earn the win and John Franco pitched a perfect ninth for his third save. Mark Wohlers (0-1) took the loss. </P>
<P> In St Louis, Bernard Gilkey had four RBI, Todd Zeile homered twice and drove in three runs and Ken Hill pitched eight strong innings as the Cardinals hammered the Chicago Cubs 11-1. </P>
<P> Ray Lankford also homered and drove on a pair of runs and Jose Oquendo scored three times for St Louis. </P>
<P> Hill (2-0) allowed only one run on a solo homer by Sammy Sosa and four hits in eight innings. Hill also had a RBI on a sacrifice fly in the fourth inning. </P>
<P> Kevin Foster (2-1) was roughed up for six runs and six hits in 3 2/3 innings for the loss. </P>
<P> At Colorado, Joe Girardi went 4-for-4 and drove in two runs, including the go-ahead run in the seventh inning, as the Rockies rallied for an 8-5 win over the San Francisco Giants. </P>
<P> Dante Bichette started a two-out rally for Colorado with a double off loser Jose Bautista (0-1). Girardi followed with a single to center, scoring Bichette for a 5-4 lead and Vinny Castilla doubled home Girardi. </P>
<P> Rookie Jason Bates hit a two-run homer in the eighth off Steve Frey to give Colorado an 8-4 lead. </P>
