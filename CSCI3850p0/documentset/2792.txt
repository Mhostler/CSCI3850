<P>  French magistrates and newspapers howled Wednesday about an amendment that would muzzle coverage of the country's widening corruptions scandals. </P>
<P> The proposed ban on reporting investigations until a suspect is brought to trial slipped through the National Assembly after midnight Tuesday with barely a dozen members present. It will become law if approved next month by the Senate. </P>
<P> Drafted by right-wing Gaullist member of parliament Alain Marsaud, a former investigating magistrate in terrorism cases, it would bar ``publication of any information about a person under police or judicial investigation before they had been brought to trial.'' </P>
<P> Marsaud said his amendment was designed to protect the presumption of innocence and had nothing to do with the probes that have forced three Cabinet ministers to resign. </P>
<P> Claude Pernollet, president of the the largest magistrates' union (USM), said it would stifle reporting of exactly those scandals involving politicians and businessmen. </P>
<P> ``The current government is clearly very embarrassed by the number of scandals involving ministers and senior executives. This is a way of putting a lid on the scandals,'' he said. </P>
<P> To outwit efforts by successive governments to stifle probes, magistrates, public prosecutors and counsel for civil plaintiffs have often leaked documents or briefed reporters on the state of investigations. </P>
<P> In some cases, such as the prosecution of Socialist Party leader Henri Emmanuelli over illicit party funding, suspects have learned through the media of their impending indictment. </P>
<P> In others, such as a soccer bribery scandal involving Bernard Tapie's Marseille club, public prosecutors have issued statements to counter what they viewed as manipulation of the media or attempted intimidation by defendants or their lawyers. </P>
<P> The newspaper Le Monde called the Marsaud amendment an attack on liberty, saying it violated freedom of speech guaranteed by the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man, which is part of the French constitution. </P>
<P> ``If senators follow Mr. Marsaud, it will no longer be possible to speak freely about 'scandals.' In that sense, this is really an attack on liberty...,'' it said in an editorial. </P>
