<P>  Farm programs have been a fact of life in rural America for decades, but the Republican victory in Congress last month has planted the seeds of a complete re-examination of the concept of farm spending. </P>
<P> Richard Lugar, the Indiana Republican who will head the Senate Agriculture Committee, has promised what he calls a ''bottom up'' spending review -- starting from zero and re-introducing programs case-by-case on merit. </P>
<P> ``We would approach the subject by assuming first of all that there were no agriculture programs and seek justification for any at all,'' Lugar told Reuters late Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``No-one in a responsible position right now is ruling out that we're going to have to abandon some programs or cut others,'' Lugar said from Indianapolis in a telephone interview. </P>
<P> Through programs that date back to the New Deal and beyond, the U.S. government subsidizes exports, makes deficiency payments for certain crops and pays farmers to take acreage out of production. </P>
<P> The programs are enshrined every five years in a Farm Bill, with the next one set to be drawn up by Congress next year. </P>
<P> ``In some cases, there may be full justification for doing what we are doing now,'' Lugar said. </P>
<P> ``But in many cases we will clearly do less and in some cases ... we ought to abolish the programs completely,'' he added. </P>
<P> New technology, efficient farming, international trade deals and general economic conditions meant farmers may no longer needed all of the programs, he said. </P>
<P> Under the current system, there was no way of telling when devastating floods like last year's, or perfect growing conditions like this year's, would explode spending beyond budgeted limits, he said. </P>
<P> In the 1990 Farm Bill, extensive cutting at the committee stage slashed spending projections to $41 billion from $51 billion for the five years, but Lugar estimates that the final figure will now be nearer $57 billion. </P>
<P> Food manufacturers and other sectors of agro-industry welcome Lugar's proposal, seeing abundant, low-cost supplies if farmers are allowed to plant fence-row to fence-row. </P>
<P> ``It's refreshing that programs that have been extended for decades get a fresh look...rather than once again fine tuned,'' said Bernard Steinweg, vice president of Continental Grain Co, one of the world's biggest grain exporters. </P>
<P> But Lugar will meet plenty of opposition from groups representing producers and from some members of both parties in Congress. </P>
<P> Supporters of farm programs say the subsidies have guaranteed the cheapest food in the world for U.S. consumers, and have kept family-run farms in business. </P>
<P> ``I don't see any drastic changes in the 1995 Farm Bill,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, a Democrat from Iowa, one of the major agricultural states. </P>
<P> ``We're simply not going to wipe out the whole loan program. It's not going to happen,'' Harkin said. </P>
<P> And Pat Roberts, who will head the Agriculture Committee in the House of Representatives, is a known supporter of programs that benefit wheat growers in his home state of Kansas. </P>
<P> ``It would be devastating to production agriculture to see major cuts, especially without anything to replace it,'' said Bruce Knight of the National Association of Wheat Growers. </P>
<P> Knight, who says his members produce 75 to 80 percent of wheat grown in the United States, promised full-scale lobbying against any move to ax farm programs wholesale. </P>
