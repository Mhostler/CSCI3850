<P>  William Usery, who was appointed by President Clinton to mediate the Major League Baseball labor dispute, met with representatives of the Players' Association Wednesday in a fact-finding session. </P>
<P> Usery is expected to meet with union representatives again Thursday before scheduling similar sessions with owners ahead of face-to-face negotiations. </P>
<P> Usery, a former labor secretary under President Ford, met briefly with union boss Donald Fehr and owners' chief negotiator Richard Ravitch last week in Washington. It was the first meeting between the two sides since the 1994 season was canceled more than a month ago. </P>
<P> The two sides are not expected to meet again until the end of next week to resume efforts to reach a new collective bargaining agreement. </P>
<P> The players began their strike on Aug. 12 and the owners canceled the rest of the seaon and playoffs and World Series Sept. 14. </P>
<P> Usery, considered one of the nation's top labor mediators, was appointed by Clinton with the hope that he can end the impasse before it threatens the 1995 season. </P>
<P> Usery helped negotiate an end to a 1974 National Football League strike. He mediated the coal miners' strike last year. </P>
