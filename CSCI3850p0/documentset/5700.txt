<P>  A sculpture of Britain's Queen Elizabeth naked except for a tiara was blasted by Australian monarchists on Thursday as an outrageous act designed to promote Prime Minister Paul Keating's republican cause. </P>
<P> ``It's an absolutely outrageous and disrespectful act,'' the Australians for Constitutional Monarchy (ACM) group national spokeswoman Kerry Jones told Reuters. </P>
<P> The rusting ferro-concrete sculpture of a flabbily naked queen and her paunchy, nude husband sitting together on a park bench by Canberra's Lake Burely Griffin is part of an officially sanctioned exhibition. </P>
<P> The work is titled ``Down by the lake with Liz and Phil.'' </P>
<P> The queen sits with her legs clamped tightly together and her arms resting on her lap while her husband Prince Philip sits back casually with his legs wide open. </P>
<P> Queen Elizabeth is Australia's head of state. </P>
<P> The sculpture was made for a month-long outdoor sculpture exhibition and approved by the National Capital Planning Authority (NCPA). The NCPA is a federal government body chaired by an avowed republican. </P>
<P> Monarchists, who want the sculpture removed, accused the NCPA and the sculptor of pursuing Keating's republican agenda to change the constitution and dump the Queen as head-of-state by the year 2001. </P>
<P> ``This is a question of politics,'' said Alan Fitzgerald, the ACM's Canberra president. </P>
<P> ``It's just a continuation of the Brit-bashing which seems to be part of the republicans' agenda,'' he added. </P>
<P> Sculptor Greg Taylor acknowledged the work was deliberately pro-republican. </P>
<P> ``It's about the irrelevance of the monarchy and the final decay of the British influence in Australia,'' he told Reuters. </P>
<P> The sculpture is due to be removed at the end of April. </P>
