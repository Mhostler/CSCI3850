<DATELINE>PARIS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  New French President Jacques Chirac named a young, pro-European government Thursday packed with a record 12 women and with several new ministries highlighting his priorities of employment, urban renewal and welfare reform. </P>
<P> Gaullist Prime Minister Alain Juppe, 49, will make a maiden policy statement to parliament next Tuesday after the center-right cabinet meets for the first time Saturday, his office announced. </P>
<P> Ultra-liberal free-marketeer Alain Madelin, 49, was given a powerful ministry in charge of economics and finance with control over the budget. </P>
<P> Herve de Charette, 56, a liberal who favors European Unity and a close ally of ex-president Valery Giscard d'Estaing, was named as foreign minister. </P>
<P> Another pro-European liberal, Charles Millon, 49, was given the defense ministry, Chirac loyalist Jacques Toubon, 53, was made justice minister and ranked number two in the government, and Gaullist Jean-Louis Debre, 50, son of former prime minister Michel Debre, was appointed interior minister. </P>
<P> In his inaugural address Wednesday and throughout his campaign, Chirac said the fight against France's near-record 12.2 percent unemployment would be his top priority. Centrist Jacques Barrot will spearhead his promised battle for jobs as minister of labor, social dialogue and participation. </P>
<P> The 42-member government included such novelties as a Ministry for Solidarity among the Generations, apparently in charge of family affairs and pensions, a Ministry of Social Integration and the Fight against Poverty, and a Ministry for Administrative Reform, Decentralization and Citizenship. </P>
<P> Many members were first-time ministers, including all 12 of the women, many of whom were virtual political unknowns. </P>
<P> Government spokesman Francois Baroin, 29, a former radio reporter who was Chirac's campaign spokesman, is the youngest. </P>
<P> The most senior women minister will be Elisabeth Hubert, 38, who was put in charge of public health and health insurance. </P>
<P> She called her job as ``a difficult combat,'' citing a forecast $11 billion health insurance deficit this year, and promised a rapid health service reform. </P>
<P> In a surprise move, outgoing environment minister Michel Barnier, 44, was appointed minister of European affairs under de Charette, replacing the respected Alain Lamassoure, who had been widely expected to stay on despite having backed ex-premier Edouard Balladur's unsuccessful presidential bid. </P>
<P> Chirac chairs his first European Union summit in the French Riviera resort of Cannes in just six weeks' time. </P>
<P> The new president was expected to spell out his commitment to the vital Franco-German partnership at the heart of European integration at a meeting with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Strasbourg Thursday night. </P>
<P> Despite pledges that there would be no vindictive purge, only five Balladur supporters survived the change, all but one in more junior cabinet jobs. </P>
<P> The exception was Education Minister Francois Bayrou, 43, president of the centrist CDS party, who was rewarded for his late switch to Chirac by having universities, research and vocational training added to his education portfolio. </P>
<P> Among discarded Balladur heavyweights were interior minister Charles Pasqua, defense minister Francois Leotard and social affairs minister Simone Veil. </P>
<P> The Socialist opposition said the other big loser was National Assembly speaker Philippe Seguin, whose social Gaullism had been ignored, it said. </P>
<P> Sources close to Chirac said the decision to fragment some of the previous super-ministries and spell out ministers' responsibilities in lengthy titles was intended to maximize efficiency by giving each member clear responsibilities. </P>
