<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Romania's post-communist leaders sent former King Michael back into exile Friday just an hour after he defied them and landed in Bucharest aboard a commercial airline flight from Paris. </P>
<P> Michael, 72, was put on the same Air France jet that had brought him economy class from Paris. He left having seen only Otopeni airport. </P>
<P> President Ion Iliescu and his government had repeatedly said it would not let Michael into the country without a visa, saying they considered him a foreign commoner. </P>
<P> True to their word they dispatched him back into exile. He declined their offer of a flight back to his home in Switzerland on a Soviet-era Tupolev of the Romanian airline Tarom, preferring instead to return to Paris. </P>
<P> Emotions flared among a crowd of 2,500 monarchists waiting for Michael at the airport. ``Assassins, Assassins,'' some in the crowd shouted at anti-terrorist police when it became clear that he would not be allowed to stay in the country. </P>
<P> But protests at the airport and at the Bucharest hotel where the ex-royal family was booked dissolved with wintry rain. </P>
<P> A government statement, referring to the expulsion only as ``an unpleasant situation,'' said the visit was ``inconvenient'' and posed a threat to public order and the laws of the republic. </P>
<P> ``The government regrets that the ex-sovereign and his entourage got involved in such an attempt at forcing entry into the country,'' the government of Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu said in a statement broadcast on state radio. </P>
<P> Opposition politician Dinu Patriciu said the banning shamed Romania almost five years since it overthrew the Stalinist dictatorship of Nicolae Ceausescu in December 1989. </P>
<P> ``This is an abuse, proof that democracy in this country is only a facade,'' he said. ``We live in a dictatorship of a single man. The only man taking decisions in this country is the president and a country ruled in this way is a dictatorship.'' </P>
<P> Michael is a beacon for opposition forces ranged against members of the old-guard who have retained power, winning two democratic elections since the revolution. Iliescu has risked letting Michael into the country only once -- an Easter 1992 visit drew huge crowds of monarchist supporters. </P>
<P> In 1990, Michael tried a similar tack and spent several hours in the country. This time he was never allowed off the tarmac of the airport. </P>
