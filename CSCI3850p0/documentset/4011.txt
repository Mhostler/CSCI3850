<P>  Nicaraguan boxer Alexis Arguello said Friday he may still return to the ring after he recovers from two broken bones in his left hand, suffered during the latest fight in his comeback attempt. </P>
<P> Arguello, 42, was injured when he lost a decision to American Scott Walker in Las Vegas. It was the second fight in eight years for the former three-time world champion, who launched his comeback last year. </P>
<P> ``I have time to decide whether I continue in boxing or not,'' Arguello told a news conference. ``I love my people and I want the boxing world to respect this Nicaraguan Indian.'' </P>
<P> Arguello, who will wear a cast on his left hand for at least two weeks, said his recovery will last five months. </P>
<P> He said friends are encouraging him to give up boxing in favor of an offer to provide Spanish-language commentary for the Home Box Office. </P>
<P> Arguello broke another bone in his left hand last year in his first comeback fight, a victory over Mexican Jose Palomares. That fight had been delayed when Arguello broke a rib during training. </P>
<P> Arguello, who began his pro career in 1968, has held the World Boxing Association featherweight, World Boxing Council super featherweight and WBC lightweight championships. </P>
