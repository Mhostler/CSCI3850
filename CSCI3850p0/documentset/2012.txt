<P>  The mother of kidnapped Israeli soldier Corporal Nachshon Waxman appealed to his Islamic captors Friday, saying she hoped ``God will guide their actions.'' </P>
<P> Waxman, 19, was abducted last weekend by Hamas guerrillas, who have threatened to kill him unless Israel releases Hamas founder Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and 200 other prisoners by 1900 GMT on Friday. </P>
<P> Appearing on several television networks Friday morning, Esther Waxman read a statement from her home in Jerusalem in which she appealed for her son's release. </P>
<P> On NBC-TV's ``Today'' program, Mrs. Waxman said she had received a message from Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat and was convinced that her son's release was Arafat's top priority. </P>
<P> ``Yasser Arafat, as well as our government, as well as the United States government, as well as everyone who feels life is precious is doing all they can,'' Mrs. Waxman said. </P>
<P> She said there had been no response to her husband Yehuda's offer to pay a ransom for Nachshon's return. </P>
<P> Israel believes the Hamas guerrillas are holding Waxman, who has dual Israeli and U.S. citizenship, in the Palestinian-run Gaza Strip. Arafat denies this, although he ordered a fresh sweep overnight for suspected Hamas activists. </P>
<P> As the deadline neared, Hamas Friday warned Arafat to stop arresting its members in the hunt for Waxman. Meanwhile, Israel ruled out negotiations with the kidnappers. </P>
<P> In her prepared statement, Mrs. Waxman said, ``In particular, I hope the petition for Nachshon's release -- signed unanimously by the Hamas and PLO men whose very release is being demanded by Nachshon's captors -- will have an effect on them and that God will guide their actions.'' </P>
<P> ``There will be no peace of mind for me and I won't stop worrying until Nachshon is home with us and I can hold him in my arms and hug him and kiss him,'' Mrs. Waxman said. </P>
<P> Waxman, a Holocaust survivor who was raised in New York City, urged U.S. citizens and their leaders to use all possible channels to secure her son's release. </P>
<P> Then she addressed her remarks to her son, saying, ``And to you Nachshon, I send this message via the media who have been so helpful in reaching you. Nachshon, the Sabbath is a day of serenity and peace and joy. We will say our normal Sabbath prayers with extra devotion. You are in our hearts every second. ... Be strong and courageous and may God be with you. Amen.'' </P>
<P> Waxman also urged women around the world to join her in lighting a candle for her son at sundown Friday, 4:30 p.m. Israeli time (12:30 p.m. EDT), the beginning of the Jewish Sabbath. </P>
<P> In an interview on CBS-TV's ``This Morning'' program, Waxman said, ``My son is just a boy, and I hope all his hopes and dreams are yet to be and that we'll see him home soon,'' she said. </P>
