<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Typhoon Doug pounded Taiwan Monday, battering the island with high winds and heavy rain, killing 10 people and leaving three missing and 41 hurt, police said. </P>
<P> The storm was the strongest of three typhoons to hit Taiwan since early July. Winds up to 85 mph blew down hundreds of trees and signboards and cut power lines to more than 870,000 homes. </P>
<P> Four people were killed when a landslide crushed their dormitory in southern Taiwan, three died in car crashes as the high winds caused havoc on the island's roads, two were killed by falling trees and one died in a fall, police said. </P>
<P> Police said three people were missing, two after they went hiking and one who disappeared after going to visit his orchard. </P>
<P> At least 41 people were injured by falling items or in car accidents and 457 people in eastern Taiwan were forced to flee their homes to nearby shelters, police said. </P>
<P> Several trucks of a freight train loaded with coal plunged into a river in northern Taiwan after the rain-swollen torrent swept away part of the rail bridge, police said. No one was injured. </P>
<P> The storm dumped more than 19 inches of rain on mountains in the center of the island. </P>
<P> Fifteen of the island's 21 local governments, including Taipei and Kaohsiung cities, ordered offices and schools to close. The Taiwan stock exchange and most businesses also shut. </P>
<P> State-run Chinese Petroleum Corp temporarily closed four small plants in its refinery complex in northern Taoyuan, fearing emergency power shutdowns caused by the typhoon, a spokesman said. </P>
<P> All domestic airports were forced to close, although international flights remained unaffected. </P>
<P> The typhoon cut communications with several districts and major roads and rail routes connecting the east and west coasts were blocked by flooding and landslides. </P>
<P> Estimates of damage were not immediately available. </P>
<P> Typhoon Doug, the strongest typhoon to hit Taiwan this year, was expected to move off Taiwan later Monday, heading toward the coast of China, the Central Weather Bureau said. </P>
<P> Last week, Typhoon Caitlin killed eight people. </P>
