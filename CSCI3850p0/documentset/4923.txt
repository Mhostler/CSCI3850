<P>  Harvard University has received a $70.5 million gift, one of the 10 largest bequests ever to a U.S. academic institution, to fund faculty positions and financial aid, officials said Wednesday. </P>
<P> John Loeb, formerly a senior partner of investment banker Loeb, Rhoades & Co, and his wife Francis set aside for the prestigious institution a substantial part of their estate worth $70.5 million when it comes to term. </P>
<P> Loeb, Rhoades & Co., one of the first investment firms in New York City, was one of many brokerages acquired by Shearson Lehman Brothers in the 1970s and 1980s. </P>
<P> ``I wanted to make an intelligent long-term investment that would make a difference not only to a great university but to our country, so I chose to make a real commitment to Harvard,'' Loeb, 92, said in a press statement. </P>
<P> The gift, the largest by a living benefactor in the history of the university, brings the amount received under Harvard's ambitious campaign to raise $2.1 billion by the end of the decade to $861.5 million. </P>
<P> ``It is indicative of John Loeb's lifetime of service and loyalty to Harvard that he and Frances lay the cornerstone to the campaign with their extraordinary giift,'' Harvard President Neil Rudenstine said in a press statement. </P>
<P> ``His concern for Harvard's academic reputation and quality has been unwavering, and the Loebs' gift will ensure a strong and secure Harvard now and beyond the year 2000,'' said Rudenstine, who returned in February from a three-month absence due to exhaustion. </P>
<P> Harvard officials said they estimate the Loebs have donated nearly $100 million to the university over their lifetimes. </P>
<P> John Loeb graduated from Harvard with a bachelor of science degree in 1924. He is well known in New York for his philanthropy, including serving as a longtime chairman of New York University Institute of Fine Arts and as a life governor of New York Hospital. </P>
<P> Harvard will rename the offices at 17 Quincy Street of the fellows of Harvard College and the Board of Overseers -- the site of many important functions and formally the official residence of Harvard presidents -- the John Langleloth and Frances Lehman Loeb House in recognition of the bequest. </P>
<P> More than half of the funds, or $39.2 million, is designated for Harvard College, which includes the university's undergraduate school and faculty of arts and sciences, to pay for professorships, faculty positions and scholarships. </P>
<P> Another $17.2 million will go the school of design, $11.8 million to the school of public health, $1.5 million to the Loeb Drama Center, better known as the American Repertory Theatre, and $800,000 to the Memorial Church for the Humanist chaplaincy. </P>
