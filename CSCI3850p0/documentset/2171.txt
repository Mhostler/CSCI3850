<P>  George Gay Jr., who became a national hero as the only aviator of his squadron to survive a famous World War II attack on Japanese warships during the Battle of Midway, has died at age 77. </P>
<P> Family members said he died Friday of a heart attack in an Atlanta hospital. </P>
<P> Gay, of Marietta, Ga., earned his place in history by bobbing up and down in the ocean for 30 hours as the battle that became the turning point of the war in the Pacific raged around him. </P>
<P> At the time, Gay was a 25-year-old Naval pilot with Torpedo Squadron 8, which joined other planes in attacking a Japanese aircraft carrier task force near Midway Island June 4, 1942. </P>
<P> Of the squadron's 30 men, Gay was the only one to survive the assault. </P>
<P> Wounded, and in a lifejacket, he watched American dive bombers descend from the skies to attack the Japanese. </P>
<P> The Atlanta Journal-Constitution quoted him as saying he found himself ``cheering and hollering with every hit'' as he floated in the ocean. </P>
<P> Despite the fate of Gay's squadron, Japan's Imperial Navy lost three carriers in the battle and never fully recovered. </P>
<P> His daughter, Sandra Heimbach, told Reuters that Gay will be cremated and that, at his own request, his ashes will be spread over the Midway battle site so he can rest in peace with ``his buddies.'' </P>
<P> ``My father always maintained that he was not a hero, but that the men who died at Midway were the heroes,'' Ms. Heimbach said. </P>
<P> Following the battle, Fleet Adm. Chester Nimitz made Gay his spokesman in spreading his firsthand account of the Midway victory back in the United States. </P>
<P> He appeared on the cover of Life magazine's Aug. 13, 1942, issue and on radio shows including Nelson Eddy and Don McNeil's ``Breakfast Club''. </P>
<P> After World War II, Gay was discharged as a lieutenant and worked as a TWA pilot for 30 years, flying worldwide routes from 1947 until he retired at the age of 60 in 1977. </P>
<P> He also made about one speech a month to civic groups around the country, retelling his Midway experiences and calling for greater U.S. military preparedness. He accepted his expenses as payment only. </P>
<P> A native of Texas, Gay lived on Long Island, N.Y., later in Naples, Fla., and finally moved to Atlanta because of the convenient air routes for speaking engagements. </P>
<P> In 1975, actor Kevin Dobson played him in the Universal Studios film ``Midway'' in promotion of which Gay toured with Henry Fonda and Charlton Heston. </P>
<P> He self-published in 1980 the book ``Sole Survivor,'' which covered his romantic exploits as well as his Midway experiences, and sold copies at air shows. </P>
<P> Family members said he is survived by a wife, a son and daughter, a granddaughter and a great-grandson. </P>
