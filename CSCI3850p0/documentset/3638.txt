<P>  President Clinton's wife Hillary called Sunday for an end to the ``war of words'' over a Republican suggestion that poor and disadvantaged children be put in orphanages. </P>
<P> Mrs. Clinton, who last month dismissed the idea as ''absurd,'' gave a detailed response in a Newsweek magazine essay to Newt Gingrich's proposal and even used the House speaker's own family history to illustrate her view. </P>
<P> ``Those who believe poverty is a disqualification from good parenting probably have never been in the company of poor but hardworking parents,'' she wrote in the magazine's latest edition. </P>
<P> ``Both the President and the Speaker lost their fathers, one through death, one through divorce,'' she wrote. </P>
<P> ``Each of their young mothers eventually remarried and each boy was then adopted by a new father. But one can only imagine what might have happened if bad luck had left these young women alone and in poverty. </P>
<P> ``I doubt either mom would have given up Bill or Newt to any orphanage without one heck of a fight,'' Mrs Clinton wrote. </P>
<P> Noting that as a lawyer she had spent 25 years working ``to strengthen families and help children,'' Mrs Clinton wrote: ``I am heartened that the well-being of children and families increasingly is a focus of national attention.'' </P>
<P> ``I agree with the recent comments of Speaker Gingrich who said last week that the debate over orphanages had become distorted and cheap. Let's move on to a discussion that is open, honest and fair.'' </P>
<P> ``It is my hope that we can now put the war of words about orphanages and the slogans about welfare families behind us and join together ... to fulfill our responsibilities to America's children.'' </P>
<P> She wrote that like most Americans, she was ``deeply disturbed by the outrageous rates of out-of-wedlock births and the welfare dependency they bring. </P>
<P> ``My heart breaks every time I hear another story about a mother or father who abuses, neglects or kills a child.'' </P>
<P> But orphanages were not the answer, she argued. </P>
<P> ``Children are almost always best off with their families. Our legal system presumes that a child should be with his or her parents unless there is convincing evidence that abuse or neglect threatens a child's well-being.'' </P>
<P> ``That standard should not be changed. But we should look for better ways to identify children at risk, move quickly to help their families and, as a last resort, move children to the best possible out-of-home placement,'' she wrote. </P>
<P> ``We should never permit children to be taken from their families simply because the parents are poor, unmarried or lacking education.'' </P>
<P> ``Instances of abuse and neglect occur in rich as well as in poor families,'' she wrote, aiming a jab at the Republicans. </P>
<P> ``I grew up in a Republican family and although I'm now a Democrat, I always thought the Republican Party believed in the value of family -- not in government intrusions into family life.'' </P>
