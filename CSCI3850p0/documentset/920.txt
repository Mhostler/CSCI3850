<DATELINE>WASHINGTON, (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Vice President Al Gore underwent surgery Saturday night to repair an achilles tendon he tore while playing basketball with former colleagues in the House of Representatives, a Gore spokeswoman said. </P>
<P> Gore, 46, tore the tendon that runs along the back of his lower left leg during a basketball game in the House gymnasium between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. EDT with House members who are friends. </P>
<P> After being examined by a doctor at his home at the U.S. Naval Observatory, he was transported to Bethesda Naval Hospital, where it was determined his injury would require surgery, said spokeswoman Heidi Kukis. </P>
<P> Surgery began at 8 p.m. EDT and was expected to last about an hour and a half, she said. Gore was to remain in the hospital overnight for observation. </P>
<P> It was unclear whether Gore would require a cast on the leg, but casts are often required for these sorts of injuries and they take weeks to months to heal. </P>
<P> In an extreme case, the lower leg is immobilized in a cast and the foot positioned with the toes down and the heel up in order to put no pressure at all on the healing tendon. Crutches are required. </P>
<P> Kukis said that at this point Gore was still planning to go on a trip to the Middle East on September 3. </P>
<P> Gore, a former member of the House and former senator from Tennessee, is active in sports. </P>
<P> ``He plays basketball a lot with his friends,'' Kukis said. She said that after the injury, Gore's military aide ``said he was doing fine but that it is painful.'' </P>
<P> She said Gore had planned to be away by now with his wife, Tipper, and their children for their summer vacation but decided to remain in town to help press for passage of President Clinton's initiatives on crime and health care reform. </P>
