<P>  Princess Diana's younger brother Earl Spencer, familiar to U.S. TV viewers as a reporter of Britain's racy royal gossip, is accusing British tabloids of harassing his wife over her reported treatment for the eating disorder bulimia. </P>
<P> But the News of the World Sunday rejected his charge, saying Spencer had ``always seized opportunity after opportunity to put himself in the public eye, grabbing fees from newspapers, magazines and TV companies along the diamond-studded way.'' </P>
<P> Spencer, 30, filed an official complaint last week with the Press Complaints Commission, Britain's media watchdog, over coverage of his wife Victoria's treatment at an exclusive clinic. </P>
<P> Spencer, who inherited his father's Althorpe stately home in 1992, lists his occupation as a television journalist. His priviliged position often gave authority to his reports for the NBC Today show on the goings-on of the Royal Family. </P>
<P> He told BBC Radio Sunday his wife, 29, had been tormented for a decade by various mental conditions and he eventually managed to convince her to have treatment. </P>
<P> ``As soon as she was admitted, the tabloids fell on the story, desperate to be the first to rip the heart out of it...and to hell with it if the resulting carnage set back the patient, perhaps irreversibly,'' he said. </P>
<P> In a radio piece he wrote himself, he said press standards now varied between ``the plain spiteful and the truly evil.'' </P>
