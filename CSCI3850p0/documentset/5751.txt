<P>  The United States said Friday that U.S. and South Korean forces would conduct a joint military exercise in South Korea later this month. </P>
<P> A senior Defense Department official said he expected North Korea would object to the exercises. He said the troops taking part in the ``command post'' exercise would total about 13,000 Americans and Koreans; of the Americans involved, about 10 percent will come from outside Korea. </P>
<P> The official said he thought North Korea would object to the exercise -- scheduled for late April until mid May -- as being provocative, as it had complained about past joint military operations. ``We are anticipating there will be a negative reaction,'' he told reporters. </P>
<P> Asked about the North's past objections that such exercises were for invasion planning, the official said the effort was in keeping with U.S. strategy of being able to fight two wars in different regions of the world. </P>
<P> The announcement came as the United States and North Korea recessed discussions over the type of nuclear reactor the North would receive in return for its pledge to end a nuclear weapons program Washington says it has. The talks in Berlin are to resume Tuesday. </P>
<P> But the official said the timing of the exercise was not tied to the nuclear talks and planning for it was done late last year. He added there was a similar exercise last year. </P>
<P> Describing the military operation as a command exercise, the official said U.S. and South Korean commanders would train on receiving troops into Korea from outside, staging them and then moving them on to battle points. He said most of the exercise would be in command headquarters and consist of paperwork, not field operations. ``There will be no large movement of forces per se.'' </P>
