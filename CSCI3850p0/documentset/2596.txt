<P> (Eds: Updates with  NASA said it was diverting the space shuttle to California Monday because a tropical storm made it unsafe for six astronauts to land Atlantis in Florida. </P>
<P> Touchdown was scheduled to occur at 10:34 a.m. EST or 12:07 p.m. EST at Edwards Air Force Base in California's Mojave Desert. </P>
<P> Mission managers put off a decision on which opportunity to use while they observed weather conditions at the shuttle's backup landing site. </P>
<P> The shuttle and its crew were coming home from an 11-day orbital mission in which they studied the atmosphere and gauged the health of Earth's protective ozone layer with a suite of cargo bay instruments and a retrievable satellite. </P>
<P> Touchdown at the Kennedy Space Center had been previously set for 7:31 a.m. EST. Mission managers added an extra orbit to the flight early Monday, moving the landing to 9:04 a.m. EST to give themselves more time to observe the weather, according to National Aeronautics and Space Administration spokesman Kyle Herring. </P>
<P> Tropical Storm Gordon was crossing the southern tip of Florida, bringing forecasts of rain and gale-force winds to the state's central east coast where the shuttle runway is located. </P>
<P> Herring earlier said forecasts for the Mojave Desert called for clear skies and gusty but acceptable winds. </P>
<P> If unexpected problems forced the astronauts to pass up all four landing opportunities Monday, they could spend another day in space and try again Tuesday, NASA said. </P>
<P> The members of the five-man, one-woman crew are Donald McMonagle, commander; Curtis Brown, copilot; Ellen Ochoa, payload commander; Joseph Tanner, flight engineer; and Scott Parazynski and Jean-Francois Clervoy, mission specialists. </P>
<P> Clervoy, representing the European Space Agency, is the fifth astronaut from France. </P>
