<DATELINE>TOKYO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The dollar plunged to a new post-war global low Wednesday as pandemonium in Asian currency markets overwhelmed repeated bursts of dollar buying by Japan's central bank to push the U.S. currency below 89 yen. </P>
<P> The U.S. currency hit 88.95 yen and fell through 1.35 marks in afternoon trade, breaking the previous global lows of 89.00 yen and 1.3595 set in New York Tuesday. </P>
<P> The renewed slide came after Japanese economic ministers held an emergency meeting and vowed to consider all possible measures to deal with the currency crisis. But the ministers failed to spell out any specific steps. </P>
<P> Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama told reporters that the yen's rise was a result of speculation. ``This does not reflect economic fundamentals and it is speculative,'' he said. </P>
<P> Murayama said Japan would cooperate with other major nations on currencies, but he did not say what form this cooperation would take. </P>
<P> In Washington, House Speaker Newt Gingrich said the dollar's persistent weakness against the German mark and the yen was ``a direct result'' of last week's defeat in the U.S. Senate of the balanced budget amendment, and added that he viewed the situation as ``very, very dangerous.'' </P>
<P> ``The world market now believes that the United States doesn't have the will to balance its budget and that we're going to keep borrowing money and that, frankly, the dollar is going to keep sliding,'' Gingrich said on his weekly live television program. </P>
<P> As the dollar plunged, the soaring yen set off alarm bells in Japanese ministries, which are concerned that it could slice into the revenues of the country's exporters. </P>
<P> With intervention by monetary authorities so far powerless to halt the dollar's fall, speculation is mounting that the Bank of Japan may have to lower market interest rates and perhaps cut its key official lending rate to cap the yen's rise and ensure liquidity for debt-ridden financial institutions. </P>
