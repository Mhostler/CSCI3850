<P>  Republican challenger Rick Santorum is pulling ahead of incumbent Harris Wofford in the race for a Pennsylvania Senate seat, a poll said Thursday. </P>
<P> The Philadelphia Daily News/KYW News 3 poll shows the suburban Pittsburgh congressman had 42 percent support among likely voters against Wofford's 32 percent. </P>
<P> Nearly a quarter of voters were undecided with the rest favoring two minor-party candidates. </P>
<P> A Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and WTAE TV poll released earlier this week showed Santorum with an 11-point lead among voters. </P>
<P> The results represent a major shift from early October, when Santorum and Wofford were in a virtual dead heat. </P>
<P> Wofford was elected in 1991 to fill the term left vacant after Sen. John Heinz died in a plane accident. His victory over former Bush administration attorney general Dick Thornburgh was seen as a major win for Democrats, and helped pave the way for President Clinton's election. </P>
<P> It was James Carville, later Clinton's 1992 campaign strategist, who orchestrated Wofford's campaign. </P>
