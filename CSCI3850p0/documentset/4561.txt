<P>  Vice President Al Gore said Saturday there was no crisis in U.S.-French relations despite France's accusation of American spying in Paris. </P>
<P> Gore was asked about France's request to Washington to recall five Americans, including four diplomats, it accused of industrial and political espionage, at a news conference after meeting European Commission President Jacques Santer. </P>
<P> ``This is a matter that is best dealt with privately. There is no crisis in U.S.-French relations,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``The U.S.-French relationship is a very strong relationship which is very important to the American people.'' </P>
<P> Gore is in Brussels to attend a Group of Seven industrial nations conference on the information society. </P>
<P> The leak of France's request has embarrassed French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and put Interior Minister Charles Pasqua, a Balladur ally, at loggerheads with Foreign Minister Alain Juppe. </P>
<P> Juppe's ministry accuses Pasqua of leaking the French request to divert attention from a phone-tapping scandal linked to his Rally for the Republic party. </P>
<P> Pasqua in turn blamed American officials for the publicity but the U.S. embassy in Paris accused him of lying. </P>
<P> The affair has been more reminiscent of Franco-Soviet Cold War battles than of relations between two allies -- even though the two have a history of divisions on issues ranging from NATO to Hollywood movies. </P>
