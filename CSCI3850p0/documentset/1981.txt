<P>  When your tabby cat makes a telephone call in Australia there's no charge.  This was the ruling after a Siamese cat ran up a large bill by knocking a telephone receiver off its cradle and then hitting the redial button, an Australian newspaper reported Thursday. </P>
<P> But the cat's owner did not have to pay the bill because Australia's telephone ombudsman found communications laws did not provide for animals making calls, Brisbane's Courier-Mail said. </P>
