<P>  President Clinton went jogging Thursday with two of the greatest American long-distance runners in athletic history and proved that he could hold his own against them. </P>
<P> Clinton ran step-for-step with Bill Rodgers and Frank Shorter, who between them have won Olympic medals and scores of marathons in addition to holding various running records. </P>
<P> The trio took just under 26 minutes to run the approximately three-mile, oval-shaped course at Hains Point in Washington near the Potomac River. </P>
<P> When asked if he could keep up with his companions, both in their late 40s, the 48-year-old Clinton laughed and just shook his head as if in awe. </P>
<P> Rodgers was king of the roads in the 1970s and won the Boston and New York marathons four times each. He was 29 when he first won the New York Marathon in 1976. </P>
<P> He holds 16 U.S. running records in distances from three miles to the marathon in addition to some 18 records in his age group. </P>
<P> Shorter won Olympic gold and silver marathon medals during the 1970s. </P>
<P> The president has been known to hold his own against high-caliber athletes. He once proved too much for Al Joyner, the 1984 Olympic triple jump champion, when they ran together. </P>
<P> Joyner, two miles into a three-mile run, pooped out and rode in a car back to the White House while the president kept chugging along. </P>
