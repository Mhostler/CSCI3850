<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A total of 40 countries, including the five big nuclear weapons states, have signed a nuclear safety document designed to step up security at atomic reactors worldwide, U.N. officials said Wednesday. </P>
<P> Members of the International Atomic Energy Agency began signing the safety agreement Tuesday, led by the United States, Russia, China, France and Britain. </P>
<P> Officials at the Vienna-based IAEA, the nuclear arm of the United Nations, said enough countries had now signed the International Convention on Nuclear Safety to bring it officially into force. </P>
<P> National parliaments also have to ratify the document. </P>
<P> The convention applies to land-based civil nuclear power plants and seeks to avert accidents such as the 1986 explosion at Chernobyl, the world's worst civil nuclear disaster. </P>
<P> Ukraine, which now owns Chernobyl following the collapse of the Soviet Union, signed the convention Tuesday. </P>
<P> Work on the convention began in 1991 after communism crumbled in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, revealing potential safety risks posed by the region's aging reactors. </P>
<P> Bulgaria, which has also signed the convention, shut down two of six reactors at its Soviet-designed Kozloduy plant on the Danube in 1991 due to international safety concerns. </P>
<P> Signatories are required to submit an immediate report on atomic installations and, if necessary, urgently carry out improvements to upgrade the safety of sites. </P>
<P> A key demand in the document urges countries to shut down reactors if they have tried all other means to improve safety. </P>
<P> ``If such upgrading cannot be achieved, plans should be implemented to shut down the nuclear installation as soon as practically possible,'' the convention says. </P>
<P> The document sets out a framework for a review of a nation's atomic sites by other countries. </P>
<P> Neighboring states, in particular, may call for an urgent study if they are concerned about a reactor's safety and a possible radioactive fallout accident affecting their own populations and crops. </P>
<P> A total 485 nuclear power plants were operating or being built around the world in 1993, according to IAEA statistics. </P>
<P> The document will remain open for signature for other states throughout the IAEA's annual conference in Vienna which ends Friday. </P>
