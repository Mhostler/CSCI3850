<P>  Many who crowded China's first national ``healthy sex'' exposition Wednesday raced past posters on eugenics and contraception to view a once unthinkable display of sex aids. </P>
<P> China wages regular campaigns against pornography and prostitution, often executing pimps and smut-dealers, but the puritanical communist lid is gradually being lifted from human sexuality, unleashing huge demand for sexual knowledge. </P>
<P> Less-than-bashful Chinese streamed into a Beijing hall at the opening of the ``First National Healthy Sexual Behavior and Sexual Education Exhibition.'' </P>
<P> ``I came because this is the biggest sex show in China and it has the government's support,'' said editor Wang Ying, who admitted once feeling shamed ``even by the mention of sex.'' </P>
<P> Perusing a case filled with latex penises and vaginas, colorful condoms and birth-control pills, she said the displays could help Chinese -- her husband, for example -- to get over their own sexual inhibitions. </P>
<P> Wang's reproductive career is considered over since she has reached the strict state limit of one child per couple. </P>
<P> Small groups of people gazed at posters outlining the latest in contraceptive techniques and the science of eugenics -- how to bear healthy, smart children. Many displays featured graphic photographs of people ravaged by sexually transmitted diseases and their deformed offspring. </P>
<P> The crowds were biggest and the jostling most intense in the commercial section of the show, where executives aggressively hawked a wide range of sexual wares. </P>
<P> Visitors also were shelling out cash to buy a range of books about sex, including a Chinese translation of the famous ``Kinsey Report'' on human sexuality and others titled ``The Magic of Sex'' and ``Complete Sexual Love.'' </P>
