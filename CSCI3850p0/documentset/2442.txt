<P>  Iran attacked opposition guerrillas based inside Iraq after they tried to cross the border into Iran to hit its oil installations, the official Iranian news agency IRNA reported Sunday. </P>
<P> In Baghdad, Iraq said Iran had fired Scud missiles early Sunday into a camp used by exile Mujahideen Khalq guerrillas, causing damage but no casualties. </P>
<P> The Iranian agency said: ``Early reports from inside Iraq indicated that MKO (Mujahideen Khalq) operational base sustained heavy damage and a number of MKO terrorists were killed in the attack.'' </P>
<P> IRNA said the base of the Mujahideen Khalq was 30 miles from the Iraqi capital Baghdad in Abu Ghoraib area. </P>
<P> It said the attack was part of a ``chase operation'' by border guards who killed two Mujahideen guerrillas and arrested three trying to cross to Iran to bomb oil installations in the Mousian region. </P>
<P> ``Simultaneously with the chase operation of the Iranian border guards, at least four strong explosions were heard from inside the MKO (Mujahideen) terrorist base called Ashraf,'' IRNA said. It did not elaborate on the explosions. </P>
<P> In a later report, the agency said one captured guerrilla, whom it named as Mojtaba Oveisi, said he was expecting to be joined in Iran by others and ``that they intended to blast economic installations, oil pipelines and oil wells'' in the western border province. </P>
<P> A Mujahideen spokesman, in a statement faxed from the group's Paris office to Reuters in London Sunday morning, rejected the initial IRNA report ``as a sheer lie and absolutely false.'' He added that it was ``a transparent ploy to justify the missile attack on the Ashraf camp.'' </P>
