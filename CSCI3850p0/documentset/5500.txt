<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Mexico will begin repaying rescue loans from the United States this year, Mexican Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz told The Washington Post Thursday. </P>
<P> Ortiz, in Jerusalem for the annual meeting of the Inter-American Development Bank, also said Mexico would not need to borrow the entire $20 billion credit line pledged by the Clinton administration, the newspaper reported. </P>
<P> ``The worst is over ... we are very close to turning the corner. We don't want to draw the whole amount (of loans) and we intend to make early repayment, even if it is more expensive for us,'' it quoted him as saying. </P>
<P> Ortiz said Mexico would be ``pretty much home free'' if its economy can sustain recent momentum through June and July, when it must repay about $6 billion in short-term, dollar-denominated bonds, called tesobonos. </P>
<P> He expressed optimism that his economic reforms were working, but cautioned that plans in Congress to bar the U.S. administration from extending its next installment of credit to Mexico without congressional approval could jeopardize the success of the reforms. </P>
<P> He warned the congressional proposal could cause Mexico to default on its loans and send the economy into a downward spiral, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> ``All the good momentum we have seen in the markets would be lost. The situation would reverse itself with damaging consequences not only for Mexico, but also the entire international system,'' it quoted him as saying. </P>
<P> Mexican officials quoted by the paper also predicted a 5 percent rise in Mexican oil exports, adding some 60,000 barrels a day to current export levels of 1.3 million a day. </P>
