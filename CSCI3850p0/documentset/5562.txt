<P>  U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright Friday gave credence to documents unearthed by a London newspaper that alleged Iraq was pursuing a clandestine nuclear program. </P>
<P> Speaking to the American Society for International Law, Albright said the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency would report on the documents obtained by the Sunday Times of London, perhaps as early as Monday. </P>
<P> ``The London Sunday Times is in possession of documents that appear to be genuine and indicate Iraq is pursuing a nuclear weapons program,'' Albright said, according to a copy of her prepared speech. She gave no further details. </P>
<P> The newspaper said a defecting Iraqi nuclear scientist had vanished in Greece while trying to reveal details of a secret nuclear weapons program Iraq was hiding from IAEA inspectors. The paper said he had faxed them two sample pages of documents and a summary of their contents, which suggested Iraq was back at work on nuclear weapons, forbidden under U.N. Security Council resolutions. </P>
<P> The IAEA previously reported that it had destroyed Iraq's nuclear materials after the end of the 1991 Gulf War. But the agency, which did not discover the program for years, is often in a weak position to defend its findings. </P>
<P> Iraq has been under sanctions since August 1990 when it invaded Kuwait. A condition for lifting a ban on oil exports is that it scrap its weapons of mass destruction and get an all-clear from the IAEA on nuclear arms and the U.N. Special Commission for biological, chemical and ballistic weapons. </P>
<P> As both groups said Iraq was close to complying with disarmament demands -- except for the key area of potential biological weapons -- the United States publicly voiced suspicions Iraq was reconstructing its weapons programs in all fields. Its comments have drawn rebukes from the Special Commission as well as from many diplomats. </P>
<P> The United States has said it would vote against any lifting of the oil embargo. Instead it wants Iraq to sell a limited quantity of oil under strict U.N. supervision to pay for needed humanitarian supplies. </P>
