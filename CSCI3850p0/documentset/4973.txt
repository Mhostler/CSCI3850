<DATELINE>MY LAI, Vietnam (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Vietnam remembered the anniversary of the My Lai massacre Thursday in a surprisingly low-key ceremony for a year that marks the 20th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War. </P>
<P> In what appeared to be a new sign of Vietnam's policy of allowing the past to rest and looking instead ahead to future warm relations with the United States, the mood of the ceremony was forgiveness, not anger. </P>
<P> Three of the five survivors of the March 16, 1968 massacre, which became a symbol of American atrocities in Vietnam, attended the event. They put the blame for the massacre squarely on the shoulders of U.S. soldiers and not the American people and government. </P>
<P> ``A group of crazy U.S. soldiers did this, not the American people,'' said Pham Phi Thuan, 57, who lost a grandfather, two sisters and three nephews in the killings. </P>
<P> ``This was just done by soldiers who lost their humanity for a few hours,'' said Pham Dat, 67, who lost 10 relatives in the attack. ``But when Americans come here now I feel very friendly towards them. I welcome them.'' </P>
<P> The two survivors' comments contrasted sharply with attitudes 10 years ago. Then, they both said, they wouldn't forgive Americans for what Vietnam claims was the murder of 504 men, women and children in six hamlets including My Lai, where most of the killings took place. </P>
<P> The death toll is disputed. A U.S. military investigation team estimated about 200 dead. Lt. William Calley -- who commanded Charlie company of the first battalion, 20th infantry regiment, 11th brigade, Americal -- was charged with the murder of 102 civilians. </P>
<P> Calley was sentenced to life imprisonment, but eventually served only three years under house arrest at Fort Benning, Georgia. </P>
<P> Calley was recently reported by People magazine to be living quietly in Columbus, Ga., where he runs his father-in-law's jewelry store and is said to be a pillar of the community. Now in his early 50s, he assiduously shuns publicity and his telephone number is unlisted. </P>
<P> For Thursday's early morning ceremony, there was no high-level national Communist Party official present. A crowd of barely 200 people, mainly schoolchildren, turned out. </P>
<P> Unlike previous years, banners strung around the memorial site made no mention of the words ``United States'' or ``American,'' simply describing the tragedy as a massacre during the war years. </P>
<P> The keynote speech was given by Le Phuong Tuan, vice president of the local People's Committee, who set the tone for the ceremony by calling on the attendees to look to the future while honoring and remembering the grief of the past. </P>
<P> ``We gather in commemoration of the dead, not to sharpen the pain or to recall hatred of the United States,'' he said. ``This is a ceremony for all of mankind.'' </P>
<P> Apart from journalists, there were only two foreigners at the gathering, a British couple, Paul and Karen Hinton, who were on a backpacking holiday in Vietnam. </P>
<P> ``It's an emotional place,'' said Paul Hinton, a postman from Tring in Hertfordshire. ``But it's difficult to feel as guilty any more. Vietnam has such a bright future ahead of it now the war is over.'' </P>
<P> Hinton, like most of the growing number of foreigners visiting Vietnam as tourists and on business, said he was amazed at the lack of hostility shown towards Americans and other westerners. </P>
<P> ``It's as though a war never happened here,'' he said. </P>
<P> For the three survivors who each broke down weeping during interviews, the day brought back painful memories of lost loved ones and how they managed to escape. </P>
<P> Pham Phi Thuan and Pham Dat each said they escaped by hiding under the corpses of other victims. </P>
<P> ``I was wounded and covered in blood and I hid under the bodies of my friends when we fell after being lined up and shot by an irrigation ditch,'' Thuan said. </P>
<P> ``When it happened the sun was over there,'' she said, pointing to the east. </P>
<P> ``When I recovered conciousness and climbed out of the ditch, the sun was overhead,'' the elderly woman said, indicating that she spent nearly six hours until midday in the ditch. </P>
<P> The war came to an end in April 1975 when U.S. civilians were evacuated from Saigon -- now called Ho Chi Minh City -- as communist forces completed the takeover of South Vietnam. </P>
