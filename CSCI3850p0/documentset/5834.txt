<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A man suspected of being a serial killer dubbed South Africa's ``Station Strangler'' said voices from his deceased brother told him to ``murder and murder again,'' a court heard Tuesday. </P>
<P> Police said in affidavits presented at the Cape Town Supreme Court that Norman Afzal Simons told them voices from his brother who was murdered in 1991 lived in him. The voices ordered him to kill. </P>
<P> ``It happened after I was sodomized by my brother, who is now dead. He was murdered in 1991. From the day that he sodomized me his spirit began to live in me. After he died the voices told me to kill,'' police quoted Simons as saying. </P>
<P> Simons is pleading not guilty to murdering 10-year-old Elroy van Rooyen. But in the police affidavits he admitted he sodomized and killed the boy. </P>
<P> Earlier this month Simons, a 27-year-old school teacher, disputed the admissability of the statements, saying police had put ``undue influence'' on him. But the judge ruled the statements were admissable. </P>
<P> ``I met him at a games shop in the Strand and we traveled here by train. It was the 11th of March 1994, just after five in the afternoon when we arrived at the station,'' Simons said in the affidavits. </P>
<P> ``I'm not sure, but I think the child's surname was Van Rooyen. I molested him at the station. I also murdered him. I just want to say that it was very gruesome and it affects me a lot. </P>
<P> The boy was last seen alive on March 11, 1994 when he left his cousin and accompanied an unknown man, alleged to be Simons, to Cape Town's Strand railroad station. His badly decomposed body was found 10 days later in Kleinvlei with his hands tied behind his back. </P>
<P> Simons was first believed to have killed 21 boys and a young man, all of them of mixed race, during an eight-year killing spree. Most were found buried in shallow graves in the Cape Town area after being sodomized and strangled. </P>
<P> But he had so far been charged with only van Rooyen's murder. </P>
<P> The Station Strangler is believed to have lured many of his victims away from train stations. </P>
<P> Simons had been freed on $550 bail, but is being held in custody at the request of his lawyer to protect him from would-be vigilantes. </P>
