<P>  DNA ``fingerprinting'' techniques are accurate and should be accepted as evidence in court, American geneticists reported Wednesday. </P>
<P> They pointed in particular to the murder trial of football and screen star O.J. Simpson, in which court debates about the admissibility of DNA evidence have made daily headlines. </P>
<P> The latest procedures and standards are reliable and if anything, give an advantage to defendants, Eric Lander of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge, Ma., and Bruce Budowle of the Federal Bureau of Investigation wrote in the science journal Nature. </P>
<P> ``The Los Angeles trial ... to be broadcast live by several major television networks, will probably feature the most detailed course in molecular genetics ever taught to the U.S. people,'' they wrote. </P>
<P> The two, who were once prominently on opposite sides in the debate over whether DNA evidence was reliable, said, ``We ... could identify no remaining problem that should prevent the full use of DNA evidence in any court.'' </P>
<P> DNA, the basic genetic building block of life, carries a virtually unique code for each living creature. Techniques allowing scientists to read the code quickly became controversial when introduced to criminal courts. </P>
<P> Lander and Budowle said the methods had been improved and should be accepted by courts. The U.S. National Research Council (NRC) had set out laboratory protocols and procedures, they wrote. </P>
<P> In early days many experts miscalculated the probability that a certain DNA sample would match that of a defendant. </P>
<P> ``The NRC committee easily rectified these problems by requiring consistency between the measurement precision used for forensic analysis and for population genetic estimates,'' they wrote. </P>
<P> ``The public needs to understand that the DNA fingerprinting controversy has been resolved. There is no scientific reason to doubt the accuracy of forensic DNA typing results, provided that the testing laboratory and the specific tests are on par with currently practiced standards in the field.'' </P>
