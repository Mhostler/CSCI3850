<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Pope John Paul II, dogged by health problems for the past two years, postponed Thursday a visit to the United States next month until late 1995 to fully recover from surgery for a broken leg. </P>
<P> The 13-month postponement, which the Vatican announced in a brief statement, again fueled fears for the health of the 74-year-old leader of the world's 960 million Roman Catholics. </P>
<P> It was the second time this year that history's most traveled pope, who has made 62 overseas trips and 115 in Italy since his election in 1978, had to cancel a foreign journey because of the operation for the fractured limb. </P>
<P> It was also another major disappointment for the pope, who had to cancel a trip to Sarajevo this month on security grounds. </P>
<P> Chief Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said the postponement was ``exclusively'' related to problems with the pope's right leg and that his health was otherwise sound. </P>
<P> ``There is no other reason apart from the leg. This is the exclusive reason,'' he told reporters. ``There are no other problems of any medical type other than what is written in the statement.'' </P>
<P> President Clinton expressed regret over the postponement and wished the pope a quick recovery. </P>
<P> ``President Clinton regrets that the Pope is not able to come since he was looking forward to greeting him on his arrival in New York,'' U.S. Ambassador Raymond L. Flynn said in a statement. </P>
<P> ``I know I speak for all Americans when I wish the Holy Father a speedy recovery and look forward to welcoming him when he travels to the U.S. next year,'' the statement said. </P>
<P> The pontiff broke his right femur, or thigh bone, last April when he slipped in his bath at the Vatican, his second fall in six months. </P>
<P> He spent a month in hospital after bone replacement surgery and still walks with a cane. He appeared to be rested at his last public appearance Wednesday. </P>
<P> Still, the postponement again underscored that history's most dynamic papacy is on the wane after 16 years of grueling travels continued even after the pope was almost killed in an assassination attempt in 1981. </P>
<P> In the past few months, as the pope appeared more frail and tired in public, the Vatican formally denied rumors or published reports he had bone cancer, Parkinson's disease or suffered from fainting spells. </P>
<P> In July 1992 doctors removed an intestinal tumor the size of an orange. A biopsy later revealed the tumor was becoming malignant. The Vatican has repeatedly stated the tumor was caught before it could spread. </P>
<P> ``The only reason, the exclusive reason for this postponement is what is written in the statement,'' Navarro-Valls told reporters after announcing the surprise delay. </P>
<P> ``The doctors are insisting that they want a functional recovery of the leg and of their patient,'' he said. </P>
<P> The official statement said the trip, which had been scheduled for Oct. 20-23, was postponed ``in order to allow for a more complete and more speedy recovery of mobility...'' </P>
<P> The trip was to have included a major address to the U.N. General Assembly in New York and visits to New York City, Newark, N.J., and Baltimore. </P>
<P> It was rescheduled by mutual agreement with U.N. Secretary General Boutros-Boutros Ghali for November 1995 to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. </P>
<P> The Vatican said the pope still hoped to visit Asia in January, would preside at a month-long synod of bishops at the Vatican in October and hold a beatification ceremony in St. Peter's Square on Oct. 16, the 16th anniversary of his election. </P>
