<P>  Black Americans who have fled the inner cities for the suburbs are on average paying higher property taxes than whites in comparable houses and neighborhoods, according to a study released Wednesday. </P>
<P> The examination of 1990 U.S. Census responses in 30 cities and 31 suburban areas was conducted by a professor at Queens College for The New York Times. </P>
<P> The study said that blacks paid 47 percent more on average in the Philadelphia suburban area and 27 percent more in Cleveland-area suburbs. </P>
<P> It found that blacks also pay more in some cities, led by Newark with a 34 percent discrepancy. </P>
<P> But it found that the cities had more of an even mix, with whites paying more in seven of the cities surveyed. </P>
<P> The paper quoted sociologists and tax experts as saying that the higher figures did not stem from deliberate racism by taxing authorities. </P>
<P> Instead it was linked mainly to tax initiatives that often lower taxes for existing residents while forcing newcomers to pay more and to reassessments when houses change hands. </P>
<P> The author of the study, Andrew Beveridge, said the data shows the difficulties blacks face in joining the middle class. </P>
<P> ``It means that if one of the routes in the U.S.A. to middle-class status has been to move to the suburbs and live a comfortable suburban lifestyle, trying to achieve that is going to cost more for blacks,'' the Times quoted him as saying. </P>
<P> The study found one area where whites appear to pay more on average, Miami. It said this could be due to the recent influx of Cubans into the area. It said in the city, whites pay 26.5 percent more and pay 3.5 percent more in the outlying suburbs. </P>
