<DATELINE></DATELINE>
<P> Determined to mend its crime-stained image abroad, Miami has spent millions of dollars to spruce up for the Summit of the Americas and has used the swaying palm tree as a stage prop par excellence. </P>
<P> Earlier this week, local political leader Art Teele vowed that ``the tropical background of palm trees and oceanfront view ... will more than dispel the notion that Miami is unsafe.'' </P>
<P> Leaving no stone unturned, organizers placed the huge international media center at the Port of Miami, a site carefully calculated to ensure the best television images of the city are sent around the world with the sparkling waters of Biscayne Bay and Miami's sparkling lights as a backdrop. </P>
<P> Ready to oblige, many television reporters here have performed their ``stand-ups'' from the edge of a pier overlooking the bay and the city. </P>
<P> And, in keeping with Teele's pledge, at times you see a reporter in front of a stand of palms waving in the breeze. They're real palms, of course -- but growing in pots and strategically placed at the edge of the concrete wharf. </P>
<P> You just can't see the pots in the television shots. </P>
<P> City officials thought it was a bad break when, the week before the summit, the FBI released national statistics confirming greater Miami as the most crime-troubled metropolis in America. </P>
<P> But this week, as the world assembled for the summit, a Miamian from Colombia did her part to dispel the image and sent at least one tourist home happy. </P>
<P> Patricia, a 31-year-old who does not give her full name because she is in the United States illegally, was in line at an automatic teller machine near the airport Wednesday when she saw a man standing nearby grab money from an older woman after she made a withdrawal. </P>
<P> Patricia, a devout Christian, responded in a flash, kicking off her shoes and chasing down the thief. </P>
<P> Though only 5 feet tall, Patricia jumped on the assailant and shouted ``In the name of Jesus Christ, I demand you give this money back.'' </P>
<P> The man, taken aback, apologized profusely, saying, ``I'm sorry, I'm sorry,'' gave back the money and ran away, said Joe Gould, a friend of Patricia's who related her story. </P>
<P> Patricia took the money, $250, back to the victim, who turned out to be a startled tourist from France. </P>
<P> Fidel Castro's Communist-ruled nation was the only Western Hemisphere country not invited to the summit, but the Cuba angle is crucial to the hundreds of thousands of Cuban exiles in Miami -- so important that at least one local television station sent a reporter to cover the summit from the Caribbean island. </P>
<P> ``They're the only country in the hemisphere not invited to the summit,'' said WPLG Channel 10 news director Tom Doerr. ``We were curious about their perspective on it.'' </P>
<P> Will that include Castro's perspective? </P>
<P> ``We asked, and we were told he will not be available,'' said Doerr. </P>
<P> For summit junkies, Florida International University has put everything you ever wanted to know about the meeting on the Internet, the globe-spanning network of computer networks. It's called SummitNet. </P>
<P> With help from Tandem Computers and Sprint, the university is supplying minute-by-minute updates, agendas, transcripts of speeches and other crucial summit facts to any of the estimated 26 million Internet users who care to dial in. </P>
<P> Over 50,000 users accessed SummitNet in the weeks leading up to the hemispheric gathering and more than 100,000 were expected by the end of the weekend, said organizer Rene Ramos. </P>
<P> ``We're getting inquiries from all over the world,'' he said. ``Governments, institutions, business people, everyone.'' </P>
<P> The university hopes to maintain SummitNet when the gathering is over as a repository for political, commercial and sociological data on the hemisphere. </P>
<P> ``We see it as a way to give people a handle on these really complex events,'' Ramos said. </P>
