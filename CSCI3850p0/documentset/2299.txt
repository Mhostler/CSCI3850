<P>  Iran's President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said Saturday he hoped for greater unity between the Bosnian and Croatian parties in the former Yugoslavia's civil war. </P>
<P> Rafsanjani held talks Saturday with Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, who was in Tehran to attend trilateral talks Sunday with his Croatian counterpart Nikica Valentic. </P>
<P> Rafsanjani, in remarks broadcast on Iranian television and monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation, was quoted as saying it was Iran's policy to provide humanitarian aid to Bosnia and Croatia and that he hoped the talks would ``strengthen coordination and unity between Croatian and Bosnian sides.'' </P>
<P> Rafsanjani also met Valentic Saturday and said he hoped for greater cooperation between Iran, Bosnia and Croatia, the Iranian news agency IRNA said. </P>

<P> Silajdzic was quoted by the BBC as telling Iran's First Vice President Hassan Habibi earlier that the war would continue as long as the arms embargo against the Bosnian Muslims continued. </P>
