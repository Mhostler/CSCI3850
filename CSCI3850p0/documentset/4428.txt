<P>  Pakistani police said Saturday they had smashed two foreign-aided ``terrorist gangs'' that had been responsible for many deaths in sectarian violence. </P>
<P> Deputy inspector general Shoaib Suddle said preliminary investigations showed the gangs had received foreign help at official and unofficial levels but he declined to name any country. </P>
<P> ``We are in the process of gathering that information,'' he told a news conference. </P>
<P> Police have arrested eight members of the gangs and recovered several assault rifles and other weapons. </P>
<P> Suddle said some gang members had told police they were aided by ``intelligence agencies of some foreign countries.'' </P>
<P> He said the gangs comprised members of Sipah-i-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP), a militant organization of the majority Sunni Muslim sect. The minority Shiite Muslims have accused the SSP of mounting violence against them. </P>
<P> The SSP accuses neighboring Iran of helping Shiites, whose militants in turn accuse Saudi Arabia of helping the SSP. </P>
<P> Gunmen killed four Shiite Muslim brothers in Karachi Saturday, pushing this month's toll from violence in the volatile Pakistani port city to 90, police said. </P>
<P> Earlier in the day, police and paramilitary troops arrested 19 people for possessing illegal weapons in a house-to-house search in central Karachi, an official spokesman said. </P>
