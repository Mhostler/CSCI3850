<P>  Ontario's hard-hitting Tobacco Control Act went into effect Wednesday, banning the use of coin-operated cigarette vending machines and prohibiting the sale of cigarettes in drug stores. </P>
<P> The new law in Canada's most populous province also makes it illegal to sell tobacco products to anyone under the age of 19. Previously sales to those under 16 years of age were banned. </P>
<P> Ontario's Minister of Health, Ruth Grier, said the law is aimed at preventing young people from starting the habit that is blamed for 13,000 deaths in the province annually. </P>
<P> ``Today is a very important day for public health,'' Grier said in a statement. </P>
<P> The health minister estimates currently, one out of every four people aged 15 to 19 smokes. Since 1991, smoking among seventh grade students has increased by 50 percent. But research shows if young people reach the age of 20 without smoking, it is likely they never will. </P>
<P> The law also requires tobacco retailers to post health warnings, bans the sale of so-called kiddie-packs of packages containing fewer than 20 cigarettes. Most of the changes go into effect by the end of the year.  It bans smoking in facilities used by children and teen-agers such as schools, children's hospitals, day nurseries and requires packaging to show health warnings and a list of toxins. </P>
<P> Smoking will also be banned in a range of public places, such as stores, financial institutions, video and amusement arcades, laundromats, hair salons, barber shops and transit shelters and stations. </P>
<P> Tobacco retailers who sell to minors may be fined up to $1,454 for individuals and $3,635 or corporations. Second offenses will carry fines of up to $54,546 and retailers will be prohibited from selling tobacco products. </P>
