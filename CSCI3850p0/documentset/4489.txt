<P>  The Bangkok criminal court Thursday postponed ruling on a request for the extradition of a former Thai politician indicted in the United States on drug trafficking charges, a court official said. </P>
<P> Thanong Siripreechapong, a former member of parliament for the opposition Chart Thai party, was ordered held until March 7 when the hearing will continue, the official said. </P>
<P> The court postponed the case after Thanong's lawyer sought more time to prepare documents, the official said. </P>
<P> Thanong resigned as a member of parliament last May after the United States disclosed details of the previously secret 1991 indictment. He has denied the charges. </P>
<P> Documents from a California court allege Thanong was involved in smuggling more than 45 metric tons of marijuana to the United States between 1977 and 1987, earning him more than $10 million. </P>
<P> A warrant was issued for his arrest earlier this month and he surrendered to authorities on Feb. 10. He has been denied bail. </P>
<P> If Thanong is extradited, it will be the first time a Thai has been sent to face charges abroad. </P>
