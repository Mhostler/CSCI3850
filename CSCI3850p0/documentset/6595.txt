<DATELINE>MOGADISHU, Somalia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A quarrel between militia warlord Mohamed Farah Aideed and his former right-hand man has heightened tension in Somalia's war-shattered capital Mogadishu. </P>
<P> Pro-Aideed radio late Monday quoted a statement by the supreme council of elders from his Habre Gedir clan disowning Osman Hassan Ali Atto, Aideed's one-time financier. </P>
<P> Osman Atto split publicly with Aideed weeks before the last U.N. peacekeepers abandoned Somalia in March after failing to get militia leaders to make peace. </P>
<P> Osman Atto, a Habre Gedir imprisoned by U.S.-led foreign forces in 1993 as a supporter of Aideed, has since appealed for peace with the world and other clans and hit out at the warlord. </P>
<P> Pro-Aideed radio accused Osman Atto of ``serving foreign interests.'' It said anyone, foreigner or Somali, who had contact with him would be regarded as an enemy. </P>
<P> This appeared to be a reference to the fact that Osman Atto had separate discussions with senior U.S. and U.N. officials in the last stages of the U.N. evacuation from Somalia. </P>
<P> Aideed blocked U.N. special envoy Aldo Ajello from visiting Mogadishu last week and told the United Nations to stop interfering in Somalia. </P>
<P> Two other former aides of Aideed, Abdi Hassan Qeybdid and Mohamed Hassan Awale, who were also detained by foreign forces during the hunt for the warlord, have split from him in recent weeks. </P>
<P> Sporadic fighting has broken out between Aideed's and Osman Atto's supporters, and Monday Aideed radio called on Habre Gedirs to confiscate Osman Atto's property. </P>
<P> In June 1993, U.S. gunships attacked Habre Gedir militia compounds in Mogadishu and as their main targets hit Osman Atto's ``garages'' where gun-mounted ``technical'' battlewagons were built. </P>
<P> The militias have far fewer weapons as a result of disarmament by U.S. and U.N. troops, but Mogadishu residents believe Osman Atto has more firepower than Aideed. </P>
<P> U.N. officials had forecast fighting for control of Mogadishu's port and seaport after the U.N. troop pullout. </P>
<P> In north Mogadishu, Ali Mahdi Mohamed, leader of the Abgal clan militia, has said that unless Somalia forms a government within the next three months the country will plunge back into famine and fighting. </P>
<P> Ali Mahdi, Aideed's arch-rival for four years, was speaking Monday, the 52nd anniversary of the formation of the Somali Youth League -- the main nationalist party to bring the country to independence in 1960. </P>
<P> Somalia has had no national institutions since clan war broke out in January 1991. </P>
<P> The death toll from a stray artillery shell that exploded near Mogadishu port Saturday rose Tuesday to nine schoolchildren and one woman. Eight children and the woman died instantly and 23 were wounded. </P>
<P> Attackers fired at the sea port during a clan argument. </P>
