<P>  Britain Tuesday imposed a three-month delay on exporting a 19th century sculpture to give its galleries a chance to beat the $12 million the Getty Museum paid for it five years ago. </P>
<P> Arts minister Stephen Dorrell held up export of ``The Three Graces'' by Italian sculptor Antonio Canova for the second time since California-based Getty bought the piece in 1989. </P>
<P> Depicting three naked women the sculpture is regarded as one of the finest neo-classical works of its kind and was commissioned in 1814 by the sixth Duke of Bedford. It stayed in his stately family home until 1984, when it was sold to a Cayman Islands-based company which later sold it to the Getty Museum. </P>
<P> It has spent much of the time since in a warehouse in south London as the Getty waited for clearance to ship the work. </P>
<P> Under legislation on the export of major art works ministers can hold up shipment if British galleries believe the work is of naitonal importance and that they can raise a matching sum. </P>
<P> London's Victoria and Albert Museum has joined forces with the National Galleries of Scotland to keep ``The Three Graces'' in the country, raising $8.94 million so far. </P>
<P> Dorrell said he was satisfied the two galleries would be able to raise the rest of the money in three months. </P>
<P> The Getty, however, was less than happy. A spokesman told BBC television the decision was a little like allowing a home soccer side to play on and on in injury time until it won. </P>
