<P>  A son of Beijing's disgraced Communist Party chief Chen Xitong has been detained for alleged economic crimes, the second party ``princeling'' to be held recently, Chinese sources said Monday. </P>
<P> Chen Xiaotong, president of Beijing's New Century Hotel, was detained last month for investigation into economic irregularities, the sources said. They gave no details of the allegations. </P>
<P> The younger Chen has been absent from work for about 10 days, said the duty manager at the Sino-Japanese joint venture hotel. </P>
<P> ``He's on leave. He has not reported for work for 10 days,'' the manager said by telephone. He declined to comment on whether Chen Xiaotong had been detained for investigation. </P>
<P> The younger Chen is the second princeling -- a nickname applied to sons and daughters of China's ruling Communist Party elite -- to be detained in a spreading anti-corruption campaign. </P>
<P> Zhou Beifang, head of two Hong Kong-listed subsidiaries of Beijing's largest steelworks, Capital Iron and Steel (Shougang), was detained Feb. 13 for unspecified economic crimes. </P>
<P> His father, Zhou Guanwu, stepped down as head of Shougang the following day. </P>
<P> The elder Chen, 65, resigned from Beijing's most powerful job as party secretary last week to take responsibility after Senior Vice-Mayor Wang Baosen shot and killed himself April 4 after coming under investigation for economic crimes. </P>
<P> His departure has plunged Chinese politics into new volatility, lifting the lid on a simmering struggle for power that had not been expected to erupt until after the death of 90-year-old paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. </P>
<P> The elder Chen, a former Beijing mayor promoted to the powerful Politburo in 1992 for his hardline stand against students in the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests, had been at loggerheads with national Communist Party chief and state President Jiang Zemin for months. </P>
<P> Chen's successor, Wei Jianxing, 64, head of the party's watchdog of party probity, has vowed to track down all those involved in a string of serious corruption cases in Beijing. </P>
<P> Wei was expected to remain in the Beijing hierarchy only long enough to clean up the capital, which has for years been rumored to be among the most corrupt administrations in China, analysts said. </P>
<P> Analysts said the appointment of Wei, a party mandarin with little experience of local administration, underlined Jiang's determination to root out graft. </P>
<P> Jiang has said corruption could even topple the party, which has ruled China unchallenged since 1949. </P>
