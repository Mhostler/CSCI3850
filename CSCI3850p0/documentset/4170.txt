<P> White House spokeswoman Ginny Terzano said Usery and Reich were meeting with Deputy White House Counsel Bruce Lindsey and were expected to brief Clinton. The president had asked Usery to present his own proposals for settling the strike if the owners and players did not reach agreement by his deadline. </P>
<P> Earlier, White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry said he thought Usery might need to wait until Tuesday to present his recommendations for ending the six-month-old baseball strike to Clinton. Terzano said this seemed increasingly likely. </P>
<P> Clinton, meantime, offered a barbed comment on the continued impasse between the parties to the big league strike that disrupted the 1994 season last August and wiped out the World Series. </P>
<P> ``It's just a few hundred folks trying to figure out how to divide up nearly two billion dollars,'' the president said to reporters. ``They ought to be able to figure that out in time for the rest of us to enjoy this baseball season.'' </P>
