<P>  The United States developed many contingencies for Haiti but did not have a plan that dealt specifically with the situation created by former President Jimmy Carter's peace mission there, a senior U.S. official said Monday. </P>
<P> He also acknowledged that there are many unknowns about how the situation in the Caribbean nation will evolve, including what exactly will happen to instruments of repression like the armed forces. </P>
<P> ``I don't know and nobody knows,'' he said. </P>
<P> The official, speaking on condition that he not be identified, addressed reporters as U.S. troops were landing in Haiti. </P>
<P> They are the first wave of a U.S.-led multinational force aimed at restoring democracy and returning exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power. </P>
<P> ``You can have all the plans in the world and you can have figured out 87 different contingencies or variants for the situation that you're going to deal with and you'll always get the 88th in the event,'' the official said. </P>
<P> U.S. officials did considerable planning for the Haiti intervention but ``we did not have a plan specifically for this eventuality,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``We had a plan specifically for hostile entry, permissive entry, semi-permissive entry and what we're getting is somewhere between permissive and semi-permissive but we don't know exactly what the balance is,'' he added. </P>
<P> The administration is now reviewing the military, political and economic plans for Haiti in light of actual events on the ground, he said.  U.S. troops were prepared to land as an invasion force, but that scenario was averted when Carter, Senator Sam Nunn and retired General Colin Powell worked out a deal over the weekend in which the Haitian junta agreed to cede power by October 15. </P>
<P> Despite the uncertainty, especially regarding the repressive Haitian military and police, the official said that when Aristide returns to Haiti in the next few weeks ``there will be a very formidable military institution in that country and it will be us -- the United States and its coalition partners.'' </P>
<P> ``We are making new facts on the ground (and hence) one of the reasons why we're modulating what we say is because the big stick (of massive military force) is there and we can speak a little more softly,'' he said. </P>
