<P>  Police rescued an American woman missionary and a Panamanian woman from kidnappers who had abducted them for ransom hours earlier, the U.S. Embassy said Tuesday. </P>
<P> The two women, both members of the local Mormon church, were seized Monday afternoon in a poor neighborhood on the outskirts of the capital, embassy spokesman Lee McLenny said. </P>
<P> ``Later in the day, officers of the national police successfully rescued both women. A Guatemalan man was arrested,'' McLenny said. </P>
<P> The embassy did not identify the victims, but sources close to the police said the American woman was from California and the kidnappers had demanded a ransom of more than $50,000. </P>
<P> Kidnapping for ransom is a growing problem in Guatemala. Abductors usually target wealthy Guatemalans, but in April a seven-year-old U.S. schoolgirl was kidnapped and released a few days later. </P>
