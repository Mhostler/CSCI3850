<P>  Former hostage Terry Anderson filed suit Thursday against 11 government agencies for refusing to turn over documents related to his abduction in Beirut in March, 1985 and his seven years of imprisonment. </P>
<P> The former Associated Press chief Middle East correspondent is suing in U.S. federal district court to gain access to the documents, naming the CIA, the FBI, State Department and other agencies. </P>
<P> Anderson told reporters that he has filed Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for government documents, but many of the documents he has received are so heavily censored as to be useless. </P>
<P> He showed letters from government agencies telling him all the information should remain secret and he needs the notarized signatures of his captors, the Islamic Jihad or Hezbollah, before he can obtain any information on them because of U.S. privacy laws. </P>
<P> ``Who am I supposed to call to get that?'', he asks. ``Their public relations department?'' </P>
<P> He has published a book about his experience, ``Den of Lions,'' while working at Columbia University's Freedom Forum Media Studies Center. </P>
<P> Anderson was abducted after playing tennis on March 16, 1985 and released in December 1991 after protracted negotiations, marking the end of a spree of kidnapping dramas that began in 1983. Seventeen Americans as well as a number of Europeans were held hostage by pro-Iranian factions. </P>
