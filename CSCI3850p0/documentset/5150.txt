<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  O.J. Simpson's houseguest, Brian ''Kato'' Kaelin, testified Thursday about a black knapsack that suddenly appeared on the driveway of the football legend's home on the night his ex-wife and her friend were murdered. </P>
<P> Kaelin, a struggling actor propelled into the spotlight by the sensational double murder trial, said a blood spot discovered on the driveway by police was only 18 inches from where he first saw the knapsack. </P>
<P> The prosecution has suggested the knapsack was stuffed with bloody clothing Simpson wore when he murdered Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman outside his ex-wife's Brentwood townhouse on the night of June 12, 1994. </P>
<P> Prosecutors say the last time the knapsack was seen was when Simpson personally loaded it into the trunk of a limousine taking him to the airport for an overnight flight to Chicago. </P>
<P> The former star running back turned popular sportscaster, actor and TV pitchman, has pleaded not guilty in the knife murders, claiming he was at home waiting for the limousine when they were committed. </P>
<P> Kaelin said he noticed the bag by Simpson's Bentley after he had opened the gates to Simpson's estate to allow the limousine in. </P>
<P> He said he had initially left his guest house to investigate a loud thumping noise coming from a narrow walkway behind his room. At that point, he said, he could not remember the knapsack being on the driveway. </P>
<P> Detective Mark Fuhrman previously testified that he found a bloody glove on the walkway which matched one discovered at the murder scene. </P>
<P> Kaelin said he offered to put the knapsack in the limousine but Simpson stopped him, saying, ``I'll get it.'' </P>
<P> Chicago television stations reported Thursday that a viewer watching Kaelin's testimony Wednesday informed police he had seen a pair of sweatpants in a field not far from the Chicago hotel where Simpson had stayed the morning after the murders. </P>
<P> According to Chicago police, a pair of muddy sweatpants and a camouflage jacket were found in the field Wednesday night, but the clothing did not appear to have blood on it and apparently had not been there very long. </P>
<P> The items had been sent to Los Angeles police for examination. </P>
<P> Kaelin, who has become America's most famous houseguest, testified under questioning from prosecutor Marcia Clark that the knapsack was the only piece of luggage that Simpson put in the trunk. </P>
<P> The rest of the luggage was loaded by Kaelin and the limousine driver. Kaelin said that was the last time he saw the black knapsack. </P>
<P> Clark ended her dramatic examination, taking Kaelin in five and ten minute stages through the time period between 9:35 p.m. and 10:50 p.m. on the night of the murders, asking the witness if he knew where Simpson was at each point in the evening. </P>
<P> Kaelin answered ``No'' to each question. </P>
<P> The prosecution claims Simpson committed the murders at about 10:15 p.m. and had ample time to drive his white Ford Bronco the two miles from his mansion to his ex-wife's home, commit the murders, and drive back. </P>
<P> Under cross examination from defense attorney Robert Shapiro, Kaelin said Simpson did not appear upset or angry or annoyed during the time he was with him on June 12. </P>
<P> Kaelin, who had been Nicole Simpson's houseguest until he moved to Simpson's mansion in January, 1994, said Simpson knew his ex-wife was dating other men and did not seem concerned. </P>
<P> No hearing on the case has been scheduled Friday. </P>
