<P>  The Security Council took no immediate decision Thursday on an Arab group request for an urgent meeting on the continued building of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories, council sources said. </P>
<P> The request was made Wednesday in a letter to council president Legwaila Legwaila of Botswana from ambassador Roble Olhaye of Djibouti, current chairman of the group comprising Arab members of the United Nations. </P>
<P> During private council consultations on this and other topics Thursday the United States opposed holding a meeting, which it believes would impede the Middle East peace process. Non-aligned members supported the Arab request, the sources added. </P>
<P> The council president would consult further with representatives of the Arab group, Israel and other delegations. </P>
<P> One source speculated the council might hold a meeting next week but without adopting a resolution or issuing a statement. </P>
