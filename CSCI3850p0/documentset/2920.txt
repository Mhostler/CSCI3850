<P>  The Supreme Court turned its attention Wednesday to whether drinkers have the right to know the alcohol content on beer can and bottle labels. </P>
<P> The justices during the hourlong session appeared unswayed by the arguments of Justice Department attorney Edwin Kneedler seeking to uphold the long-standing federal law that bars alcohol content on beer labels. </P>
<P> In a case involving Adolph Coors Co., the high court appeared sympathetic to the view that the law represents an unconstitutional restraint on commercial speech in violation of the First Amendment. </P>
<P> Justice Sandra Day O'Connor noted that most states allow brewers to advertise the alcohol content of their beers, but the federal law bars brewers from including the same information on beer labels. </P>
<P> ``That just seems to me a very odd scheme,'' she said, adding that allowing the advertising ``weakens'' the government's reasons for the ban. </P>
<P> Kneedler attempted to justify the law, which only applies to beer, not wine or hard liquor. </P>
<P> He said Congress in 1935, right after the repeal of Prohibition, wanted to prevent ``strength wars'' among brewers competing to put as much alcohol as possible in their beer. Congress was concerned about malt brewers promoting their beers as an intoxicant. </P>
<P> Justice John Paul Stevens asked if there was a distinction between a drinker who wanted to get drunk as fast as possible, and a moderate drinker concerned about health and safety who wanted to know the amount of alcohol. </P>
<P> Was the government's concern about hard drinkers enough to sustain the law? Stevens asked. </P>
<P> ``For the most part, yes,'' Kneedler replied. ``The risks might be far worse,'' he said citing the dangers associated with alcohol, such as youngsters drinking, and unsafe driving. </P>
<P> Under questioning from Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Kneedler conceded there was no other food or beverage that the government does not tell consumers what is in the product. </P>
<P> Ginsburg also pointed out the federal government discloses a beer's alcohol content if a consumer asks for it. ``If the government gives this out, what sense does it make not to allow it on labels?'' </P>
<P> Kneedler repeatedly sought to defend the law, saying the alcohol industry has long been subject to the most stringent government regulations. </P>
<P> Bruce Ennis, a lawyer arguing for Coors, denounced the law as ``a ban on speech that is truthful, accurate, not misleading and important to consumers.'' </P>
<P> He said the law was adopted when it was hard to measure alcohol content for beer, but technology has changed and the information has long been easily obtained. </P>
<P> Ennis said consumers now prefer lower-alcohol beers. ''Higher is not necessarily preferred,'' he said, adding that Coors Light beer has 4.1 percent alcohol content and its regular beer has 4.6 percent. </P>
<P> ``But you can't know any of this by looking at the label,'' Justice Anthony Kennedy said, as the courtroom erupted in laughter. </P>
<P> A decision in the case is due before June. </P>
