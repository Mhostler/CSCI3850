<P>  Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said Monday the peace process in civil war-torn Liberia was again at a standstill and he raised the possibility of withdrawing the 85-member U.N. observer mission now serving there. </P>
<P> In a written report to the Security Council, he said this was one option to be considered when the current mandate of the U.N. Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL), established in September 1993, expired April 13. </P>
<P> The other option if the political stalemate continued would be to further reduce UNOMIL's military component and limit it to the provision of good offices, until the parties clearly demonstrated the political will necessary to reactivate the peace process. </P>
<P> On the other hand, if the various factions demonstrated a clear willingness to implement an agreement they signed in Accra, Ghana, on Dec. 21, the Security Council could maintain UNOMIL, with its original authorized strength of more than 360 before it was reduced last year. </P>
<P> But if the Accra accord was to be implemented, a large peacekeeping force called ECOMOG, fielded since August 1990 by the Economic Community of West African States, would have to be provided with the necessary resources. </P>
<P> While ECOMOG's costs were more than $90 million for a 12-month period, contributions to a U.N. trust fund designed to provide it with assistance totaled only $18.4 million, of which disbursements of $17.4 million had already been authorized. </P>
<P> If ECOMOG, now numbering about 8,430 troops, was unable to carry out its responsibilities under the Accra agreement requiring a total of some 12,000 soldiers, UNOMIL would be unable to fulfil its own mandate, Boutros-Ghali said. </P>
<P> Another option if the parties showed a willingness to abide by the Accra agreement would be an enhanced role for the United Nations in Liberia through the establishment of a U.N. peacekeeping force, comprising troops provided both by the ECOMOG contributing countries and by other U.N. members. </P>
<P> The secretary-general said the signing of the Accra accord and the entry into force of a cease-fire one week later had generated some hope the multi-sided civil war might be coming to an end. </P>
<P> ``However, two months later, the Liberian factions and political leaders are still haggling over the composition and chairmanship of the Council of State and have yet to show that they are genuinely committed to the fulfilment of their obligations under the Accra agreement. Moreover, their inability to re-establish a cease-fire verification committee, as stipulated in the Accra accord, threatens the already fragile cease-fire.'' </P>
