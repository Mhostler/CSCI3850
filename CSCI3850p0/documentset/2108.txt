<P>  A new study has raised fresh questions for those critics of health care reform who argue that it would seriously interfere with Americans' ability to get first-rate treatment. </P>
<P> The study suggests that leukemia patients who need bone marrow transplants may wait longer for treatment in the United States than patients in other countries. </P>
<P> In an evaluation of the timing of bone marrow transplants used to treat leukemia, a team led by George Silberman of the General Accounting Office in Washington found that U.S. patients were just as likely to receive transplants as patients in nine other economically-advanced countries that have national health insurance. </P>
<P> But the U.S. patients were likely to receive the transplants at a later stage of their disease, which increased the risks that they would not be successful. </P>
<P> ``Our findings challenge the assumption that the United States is unique in providing broad access to high-technology treatments,'' the Silberman team said in an article to be published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. </P>
<P> ``On no measure of the availability or appropriateness of transplantation ... did it (the U.S.) surpass the other nine countries studied.'' </P>
<P> Bone marrow transplants, in which the cells that build the body's blood supply are transplanted into a cancer patient, are the only known cure for chronic myeloid leukemia. </P>
<P> The countries studied in the comparison with treatment in the U.S. were Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden and the United Kingdom. </P>
<P> A second study, also published in the New England Journal of Medicine, compared the waiting time for knee replacement surgery in the United States with the same treatment in Ontario. </P>
<P> The researchers, led by Peter Coyte of the University of Toronto, found the typical waiting time for knee surgery in the United States was two weeks -- half the waiting time in Ontario. </P>
<P> There was little difference between the two countries in the levels of patients' satisfaction with their surgery. </P>
<P> In an editorial in the medical journal, Dr Steven Schroeder of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in Princeton, New Jersey, cautioned against placing too much weight to the findings, saying that in the bone marrow transplant study, for example, the data was incomplete or of questionable quality and ``small errors could have biased the results.'' </P>
<P> ``If anything,'' Schroeder said, ``these two studies probably understate the degree to which the United States leads the world in the frequency of expensive treatments, especially for people over 65.'' </P>
