<P>  The government of the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh has decided to distribute land that earlier belonged to Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao to the poor, officials said Wednesday. </P>
<P> They said Rao's family owned several hundred acres of land in the state's Karimnagar district that the prime minister surrendered to the government under a law restricting land holdings. </P>

<P> They said Rao and his family had declared 941 acres of land as surplus under the land-holding law, of which some 365 acres had already been distributed. </P>
