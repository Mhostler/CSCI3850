<P> The joint statement was released by U.S. officials after an hour-long meeting at this Indonesian beach resort between U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Japanese Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura. </P>
<P> ``They (Rubin and Takemura) shared their concern over recent exchange rate movements which by no means reflect the economic fundamentals,'' the joint statement said. ``They will continue to consult closely and to cooperate as appropriate on exchange market issues.'' </P>
<P> ``We all agreed that more stable exchange rates are in the interests of the world,'' Rubin told reporters after meeting Takemura. </P>
<P> The two men met on the fringes of a gathering here of finance ministers from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) group. Their countries had exchanged barbs over the dollar and trade in the run-up to the meeting, with Tokyo complaining Washington had not done enough to support its currency while the United States attacked Japan over its towering trade surplus. </P>
<P> The dollar has dropped more than 15 percent against the yen since the start of the year, hitting Japanese exporters hard and threatening to undercut the country's fragile economic recovery. </P>
