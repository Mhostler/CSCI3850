<P>  A Cuban newspaper Monday criticized the upcoming Summit of the Americas in Miami as an example of U.S. ambitions to dominate the region and called the exclusion of Havana a ``hostile gesture.'' </P>
<P> Cuba, the only country in the Americas not invited to the gathering beginning this Friday, has so far taken a quietly dismissive stance toward the summit. Clinton has invited heads of state and governments viewed as democratically elected. </P>
<P> An editorial in Trabajadores, Cuba's trade union weekly, said that ``despite appearances, the Miami summit will continue to be an expression of the rapacity of the United States towards the rest of America.'' </P>
<P> It said the best response to the exclusion of Cuba, the ''latest hostile gesture'' from the United States, was President Fidel Castro's comment in Mexico last week that ``it is an honor not to be invited.'' </P>
<P> The newspaper accused Washington of imposing a model of free market democracies as the only development model and of interfering with the sovereignty of Latin American nations. </P>
