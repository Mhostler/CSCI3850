<P>  Fighting continued overnight near Velika Kladusa in the north of the Bosnian Bihac enclave and some ground may have changed hands, the United Nations said Friday. </P>
<P> U.N. spokesman Lt-Col. Gary Coward said that some 52 detonations were recorded between midnight and 4 a.m. Friday morning. </P>
<P> He said a total of 580 detonations were registered Thursday, five times the daily average since the Bosnian Muslims, Croats and Serbs signed a New Year's Eve truce. </P>
<P> Coward said the shelling appeared to be coming from rebel Muslims and Croatian Serbs from the Krajina region of Croatia, who may have pushed the government 5th Corps back since they started attacking eastwards about a week ago. </P>
<P> Coward said Thursday's fighting consisted of ``company-level probing attacks in an easterly direction.'' </P>
<P> Although U.N. movement was restricted in the Kladusa area, he said some ground had probably changed hands. </P>
<P> ``Basically, we assess from the wave of fire that it's likely the confrontation line will have moved but how much we can't say,'' Coward said. </P>
<P> He did not say who gained territory. </P>
<P> Rebel Muslims led by local tycoon Fikret Abdic and the Krajina Serbs are not signatories to a four-month cessation of hostilities agreement which went into effect this month, halting most of the fighting elsewhere in Bosnia. </P>
<P> Serious cease-fire violations were reported in Sarajevo Thursday night. </P>
<P> Government-controlled Sarajevo radio reported four, possibly five, rifle-propelled grenades fired in the area of the Jewish cemetery late in the evening. </P>
<P> Coward could not confirm a Sarajevo radio report that the Bosnian Serbs besieging the city were to blame for the attack. </P>
