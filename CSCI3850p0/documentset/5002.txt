<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A top Indonesian military official Saturday welcomed plans by the United States to resume military training aid and sales of weapons to Indonesia. </P>
<P> ``It is good. The U.S. military seems to understand about Indonesia,'' armed forces commander General Feisal Tanjung told reporters. </P>
<P> A senior U.S. military official said Thursday the United States was willing to resume military training aid and weapons sales to Jakarta despite criticism of the government's human-rights record in the troubled province of East Timor. </P>
<P> Admiral William Owens, vice-chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he was satisfied Jakarta was dealing properly with issues over Indonesia's military involvement in East Timor. </P>
<P> ``From our standpoint in the military it seems when an issue is raised affecting the military's involvement in East Timor that appropriate action has been taken to address those concerns,'' Owens said. </P>
<P> Owens said in this context it was normal for the U.S. military to seek to re-establish the International Military Education and Training (IMET) fund with Indonesia and seek arms sales. </P>
<P> The U.S. Congress cut off IMET to Indonesia in 1992 to protest the November, 1991, massacre of up to 180 civilians during a funeral march in the East Timor capital, Dili. The IMET issue is due to be discussed by Congress at a date not yet disclosed. </P>
<P> Washington's relations with Indonesia have been hurt at times over allegations of human-rights abuses in the former Portuguese colony of East Timor. </P>
<P> The Senate voted last July to restrict small-arms sales to Indonesia, which invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed the territory one year later. </P>
<P> The United Nations has never recognized the annexation. </P>
