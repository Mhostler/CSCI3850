<DATELINE>WASHINGTON)  NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P> (Eds: Updates with Newsweek poll, previous  Democrats are regaining ground ahead of the mid-term congressional elections 10 days away, and President Clinton's popularity is rising because of his firm hand in foreign affairs, according to two new polls released Saturday. </P>
<P> Independent polls by Time Magazine/CNN and Newsweek taken this week indicate that more people approve of Clinton's job performance, which has been buoyed by policy victories in Haiti and his trip to the Mideast. </P>
<P> In the Newsweek poll, Clinton's approval rating has risen to 44 percent, deadeven with his disapproval rating. The survey was the first since April in which the president's disapproval rating has not been higher than his approval rating, the magazine said. </P>
<P> The Time/CNN poll said Clinton's approval rating has grown in the past two weeks to 48 percent from 44 percent. </P>
<P> Time/CNN also said that 34 percent of those interviewed this week said they thought the Democratic Party can do a better job than Republicans in handling the nation's problems. That score is four percentage points more than just two weeks ago. </P>
<P> Meanwhile, 31 percent of those polled said they thought Republicans could do a better job than Democrats, a drop of three percentage points from two weeks ago. </P>
<P> Asked whether they would vote for a Democratic or a Republican candidate if the election were held today, 40 percent of respondents in the poll said they would support a Democrat, as opposed to 35 percent two weeks ago. </P>
<P> In the Newsweek poll, Republicans retain a marginal edge in the upcoming elections over Democrats, 46 percent to 44 percent. No previous margin was given. </P>
<P> Clinton also received high marks for his handling of international relations, 59 percent and the situation in Haiti, 48 percent, the magazine said in its issue to be on newsstands Oct. 31. </P>
<P> But Clinton continues to draw high disapproval ratings on other key issues: health care reform, 58 percent, the federal budget deficit, 53 percent, the economy, 53 percent, crime 50 percent and gay rights 46 percent. </P>
<P> The Newsweek poll, however, shows that these views are based on a significant amount of misinformation: 59 percent of Americans polled think the economy is still in recession; 54 percent do not think the deficit has gone down since Clinton became president, and 65 percent think taxes on the middle class have gone up since Clinton became president. </P>
<P> Tony Coelho, the former California congressman who is now special political adviser to the Democratic Party, said Friday that new polls indicate the overall tide is turning. </P>
<P> Coelho predicted that Democrats will not be swamped at the polls as Republicans have been predicting publicly and as some Democrats have been privately fearing. </P>
