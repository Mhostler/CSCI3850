<P>  Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze said Wednesday that worldwide anarchy would result if Russia was unable to crush rebel Chechnya's drive for independence. </P>
<P> ``If Russia accepts the seccession of Chechnya, it would have to accept the breakup of Russia itself. This means the beginning of anarchy on the European continent and not only in Europe,'' he told Reuters in an interview. </P>
<P> Shevardnadze, whose country near Chechnya has lost large chunks of northern and western territory to separatist movements, last week voiced strong support for Moscow's military operation to crush Chechnya's three-year independence drive. </P>
<P> Shevardnadze, who personally requested the interview with Reuters, seemed to want to qualify his pro-Russian stance in the wake of indiscriminate bombing raids on the center of the Chechen capital Grozny. </P>
<P> The air strikes have left dozens dead and hundreds injured and prompted widespread international concern over what most nations had initially regarded as an internal Russian affair. </P>
<P> ``It is not enough to say that this is just Russia's internal affair. On the one hand there is the pain...these people are our neighbors and friends,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``I cannot act as a defender of the Russian government. But they have no other way out. I know no way of solving this problem other than through military means. All other ways have been exhausted during these three years.'' </P>
<P> Shevardnadze and Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev are bitter foes. </P>
<P> Shevardnadze still resents Dudayev for giving refuge to former Georgian President Zviad Gamsakhurdia, whose bloody overthrow paved the way for the former Soviet foreign minister's return to power in his Transcaucasian state. </P>
<P> After Boris Yeltsin moved to crush Dudayev, Shevardnadze put Georgian troops on alert in case they might be needed around the country's borders. </P>
<P> Thousands of ethnic Chechens live inside Georgia along its mountainous frontier with Chechnya, and some Chechens suggest that the area could make a good staging ground for guerrilla attacks against Russian troops if they are able to occupy most of the republic. </P>
