<P>  An Israeli research group said Monday violent attacks against Jews worldwide rose to 72 in 1994 from 42 the previous year. </P>
<P> The group, affiliated with Tel Aviv University, said incidents of anti-Semitism were up in Europe, the former Soviet Union, the United States and the Middle East. </P>
<P> The report distinguished between violent attacks which were life-threatening and incidents limited to harassment and vandalism. </P>
<P> It said violent attacks against Jews had risen worldwide to 72 in 1994 from 42 in the previous year. </P>
<P> Of the 32 states the group checked, the highest number of attacks, 16, was recorded in Britain followed by 15 in the United States and nine in France. </P>
<P> In the category of harassment and vandalism, 48 violent incidents were recorded in Britain, followed by 30 in the United States, France and Germany. </P>
<P> In South Africa and most South American countries incidents of anti-Semitism had dropped, the report said. </P>
<P> ``More and more we're seeing members of Islamic groups operating in Europe and carrying out attacks against Jews,'' Porat told a news conference. </P>
<P> ``The other thing we're seeing is a growing tendency by extreme right-wing groups to target Jews,'' she said. </P>
<P> The report links anti-Semitism in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union with political and economic instability, and extreme nationalism which have marked the transition from communism to democracy. </P>
