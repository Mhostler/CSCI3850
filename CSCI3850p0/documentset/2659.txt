<P>  Secretary of State Warren Christopher warned Thursday that Burma's junta would face increased isolation unless it moves toward democracy. </P>
<P> At a news conference at the end of a one-day visit to neighboring Thailand, he also said that in talks with Burma's military rulers earlier this month ``we offered Burma two visions of the future.'' </P>
<P> The first would require a move toward democracy and respect for human rights and would allow the country to ``rejoin the community of nations.'' </P>
<P> But he said if the regime continued to repress its people it could look foward to a second road that would lead to ``isolation and the continuing impoverishment of their people.'' </P>
<P> After the Burmese military put down a 1988 pro-democracy uprising with heavy loss of life the United States refused to deal with the regime and increasingly sought to isolate it. </P>
<P> But early this month, after a lengthy review that included intense debate among policymakers, the Clinton administration sent a senior-level delegation to Burma. </P>
<P> Christopher told reporters earlier Thursday the talks with Burma are ``quite narrow at this point but it may provide an opening.'' </P>
<P> He also expressed hope the junta might free from house arrest pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for her struggle for political freedoms. </P>
<P> Later, at the news conference, Christopher said the U.S. dialogue with Burma's military leaders was ``a step that gives us an opportunity to explore whether we should join other nations of this region in trying to improve relations.'' </P>
<P> He said the U.S.-Burma talks ``were somewhat promising. Some modest steps were taken or promised.'' </P>
<P> ``I don't want to overstate them but they related to Aung San Suu Kyi herself.'' </P>
<P> Christopher added: ``So generally speaking there were some modest steps taken or promised and we came away from the meeting encouraged enough at least to consider the process not closed.'' </P>
