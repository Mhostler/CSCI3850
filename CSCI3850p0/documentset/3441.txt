<P>  Deputy Defense Minister Boris Gromov, who commanded the Soviet retreat from Afghanistan, Monday bitterly criticized Russia's Chechnya war, saying he did not understand why young conscripts had to die there. </P>
<P> Gromov, in his strongest attack yet on President Boris Yeltsin's decision to crush rebel Chechnya, said the government had learned nothing from the disastrous 10-year Afghan campaign in which 14,500 Soviet soldiers died. </P>
<P> ``This was the result of sending in the troops, this woeful, badly-thought out move by the leaders of our former country, which placed their political ambitions and lives of people on the same level,'' he told a meeting of Afghan veterans. </P>
<P> ``We're seeing something similar going on now in Russia. No one is drawing the right conclusions from the experience we had 15 years ago,'' said Gromov. </P>
<P> ``The main thing I do not understand is for what reason our young and not so young people have to die.'' </P>
<P> The Kremlin sent in thousands of troops and hundreds of armored vehicles two weeks ago to crush Chechnya's three-year independence bid. </P>
<P> Russia's independent NTV channel said Yeltsin had prepared a decree firing Gromov and fellow deputy defense ministers Georgy Kondratyev and Sergei Mironov. </P>
<P> The move was ostensibly part of planned cutbacks in the armed forces but NTV said the real reason was that the three deputies did not agree with Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. The report was not officially confirmed. </P>
