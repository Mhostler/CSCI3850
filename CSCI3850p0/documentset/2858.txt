<DATELINE>GOMA, Zaire (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Aid workers said Monday they feared a backlash from angry Rwandan Hutu refugees a day after Zaire expelled 37 Hutus and handed them over to soldiers of the Tutsi-dominated Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) in Rwanda. </P>
<P> ``The camps are calm at the moment but things could get nasty once word goes around,'' an aid worker told Reuters. ``The expulsions ... could ignite rather than cool things down in this place.'' </P>
<P> Zairean authorities expelled 37 members of Rwanda's Hutu majority Sunday in what the regional governor said was a crackdown on crime following two days of violence in refugee camps that killed at least 19 people and wounded 77 refugees. </P>
<P> ``The government of Zaire decided ... it was no longer prepared to tolerate these kinds of criminals. They have been attacking forces of law and order,'' Gov. Moto Mumpenda said. </P>
<P> U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) officials in the border town of Goma said the expulsions were in contravention of international law on refugees and strongly protested the move. </P>
<P> But an official of the U.N. peacekeeping force in Rwanda told reporters in the capital Kigali that although UNHCR opposed forced repatriation such U.N. provisions did not cover criminal behavior. </P>
<P> A UNHCR spokeswoman in Goma said at least 19 people -- all refugees except for one Zairean soldier -- were killed and 77 were wounded by bullets in refugee camps Thursday and Friday. </P>
<P> All the wounded were refugees. Zairean troops clashed with camp residents following the killing of a Zairean soldier in a dispute with a refugee whose vehicle was still carrying Rwandan licence plates. </P>
<P> UNHCR spokeswoman Nici Dahrendorf said Zairean authorities were threatening more deportations and UNHCR headquarters in Geneva was raising the matter with the Zairean government. </P>
<P> ``There's bound to be a backlash and we may find ourselves caught in between,'' said Dahrendorf, adding Zairean authorities still held some Rwandans arrested in the aftermath of the shooting. </P>
<P> A search to find a British aid worker and four Zairean staff who vanished during clashes in Rutshuru camp northwest of Goma Friday entered a fourth day Monday with no word on their fate. </P>
<P> The search hit a snag when Zairean authorities Monday refused to allow a U.N. helicopter from Kigali to take part. </P>
<P> The 37 were the first Rwandans forced back to Rwanda by Zaire since nearly one million refugees arrived in July at the end of a three-month civil war won by the Tutsi-dominated RPF. </P>
<P> Some 16 aid agencies have pressed the United Nations to send a U.N. force to the Goma camps, home for an estimated 600,000 refugees, to end a reign of terror by Rwandan troops and militiamen loyal to former Hutu government ousted by the RPF. </P>
