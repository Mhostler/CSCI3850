<P> The Bavarian justice ministry spokesman said Tadic had been collected by helicopter from Munich's Stadelheim prison. </P>
<P> Tadic is accused of killing, raping, beating and torturing Croats and Moslems during Serb ``ethnic cleansing'' of Bosnia's Prijedor region. </P>
<P> He is alleged in one count to have murdered three prisoners at the notorious Omarska detention camp after beating them senseless and forcing a fourth to bite off their testicles. </P>
<P> Officials in the Hague expect Tadic to appear before the tribunal this month. His would be the first international war-crimes trial since the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials of German and Japanese World War Two leaders almost 50 years ago. </P>
