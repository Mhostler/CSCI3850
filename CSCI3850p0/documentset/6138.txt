<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The New York Rangers failed to help themselves in their desperate bid to qualify for the playoffs, but the defending Stanley Cup champions received crucial assists from Philadelphia and Washington on Friday. </P>
<P> Ray Ferraro scored two goals and set up another and Tommy Soderstrom turned aside 45 shots to lead the New York Islanders to a 4-2 victory over the Rangers. </P>
<P> The Islanders, long ago eliminated from the playoff picture, were only too happy to be a thorn in the side of their bitter local rivals, claiming the third victory in four meetings between the teams this season. </P>
<P> ``I hope they miss the playoffs, just because they're the Rangers,'' said Soderstrom. </P>
<P> The Rangers remained in the final Eastern Conference playoff spot, three points ahead of idle Montreal and one back of seventh-placed Buffalo, which lost to Washington. </P>
<P> Ferraro's second goal broke a 1-1 deadlock with 9:33 left in the second period and Mathieu Schneider extended the Isles' lead to 3-1 with a powerplay goal 57 seconds into the third. </P>
<P> The Rangers climbed to within 3-2 on Brian Noonan's powerplay tally with 6:21 remaining, but Marty McInnis scored into an empty net with 18 seconds left to end it. </P>
<P> In Hartford, Karl Dykhuis scored the winning goal with 3:11 left in the third period as the Philadelphia Flyers eliminated the Whalers from playoff contention with a 4-3 win. </P>
<P> Dykhuis' slap shot from the left point made its way through a maze of players and beat goaltender Sean Burke to break a 3-3 deadlock. </P>
<P> Just under three minutes earlier Jocelyn Lemieux had tied the game for the Whalers with his second goal of the game. </P>
<P> Rod Brind'Amour had two goals and an assist and Eric Lindros notched his 29th goal in the first period for the Flyers, who had already clinched the Atlantic Division title. </P>
<P> Paul Ranheim had a goal and an assist for the Whalers, who had been battling the Rangers for the final East playoff berth in recent weeks. </P>
<P> At Washington, Joe Juneau had a goal and an assist and Jim Carey made 19 saves as the Capitals clinched a playoff berth for the 13th straight season with a 5-1 victory over the Buffalo Sabres. </P>
<P> Alexander Mogilny scored the only goal for the Sabres, who could have locked up a playoff berth with a victory. </P>
<P> Juneau scored with Washington up two men 8:38 into the game and assisted on Steve Konowalchuk's tally with 6:44 left in the third to make it 4-1. </P>
<P> Peter Bondra notched his league-leading 32nd goal of the season for the Capitals. </P>
<P> In Pittsburgh, Kevin Stevens scored 5:39 into the second period to break a tie and Jaromir Jagr and Ron Francis each had two assists as the Penguins moved back into first place in the Eastern Conference with a 4-1 win over Boston. </P>
<P> The win gives Pittsburgh 61 points on 29 wins, one victory more than the Quebec Nordiques, who also have 61 points. </P>
<P> Stevens' 14th goal of the season gave the Penguins a 2-1 edge and Ken Wregget made it stand up with 33 saves, including 21 over the final two periods. </P>
<P> Steve Heinze scored Boston's lone goal with 39 seconds left in the first period. </P>
<P> Joe Mullen, who had a short-handed tally, Shawn McEachern and Larry Murphy also scored for Pittsburgh. </P>
<P> At New Jersey, Bobby Holik and Claude Lemieux scored third-period goals as the Devils clinched their sixth straight playoff berth with a 3-1 victory over the Florida Panthers. </P>
<P> Martin Brodeur made 19 saves for New Jersey, which broke a four-game winless streak and moved to within one point of Boston for fourth place in the Eastern Conference. </P>
<P> Scott Mellanby scored the lone goal for Florida, which remained four points back of the Rangers. </P>
<P> ``Even with the loss, we've still got a chance (to make the playoffs,'' said Panthers coach Roger Neilson. ``But we had a golden opportunity tonight.'' </P>
<P> In San Jose, Arturs Irbe made 29 saves for his third shutout of the season against the Los Angeles Kings as the San Jose Sharks moved into the final playoff spot in the Western Conference with a 4-0 victory. </P>
<P> Craig Janney and Kevin Miller each had a goal and an assist for the Sharks, who have 39 points, one better than Edmonton and two points ahead of Winnipeg and Los Angeles. </P>
<P> Irbe has four of his eight career shutouts against the Kings, who dropped to 1-7-2 in their last 10 games. </P>
<P> In Vancouver, Russ Courtnall and Jyrki Lumme each had a goal and an assist and Kirk McLean stopped 28 shots as the Canucks clinched a playoff berth with a 3-1 victory over the St Louis Blues. </P>
<P> Roman Oksiuta also scored for Vancouver, which strengthened its hold on sixth place in the Western Conference. The defending conference champions lead Dallas by three points with two games left for each team. </P>
<P> Greg Gilbert scored for the Blues, who have virtually locked up the third seeding in the Western Conference. </P>
