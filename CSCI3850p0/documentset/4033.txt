<P>  The following are excerpts of the book ''I Want to Tell You'' by accused double murderer O.J. Simpson in response to letters, messages and questions from the general public. </P>
<P></P>
<P> ``During those first nights in jail I was so depressed, not only about what was going on with me, but imagining the pain of Nicole, the loss of Nicole. I was hurting, I was hurting real bad -- the worst pain of my life.'' </P>
<P> ``The incredible effrontery of your '100 percent not guilty' lie boggles the imagination. A chronic wife beater, coming from a violent 'sport' earning obscene money, is a pathetic excuse for a man. Now there's enough circumstantial evidence to convict a dozen people. Get off your backs with your expensive lawyers trading on your celebrity. This circus costs us taxpayers too much. See the light and plea bargain,'' read a letter from Helen Stanton of Los Angeles. </P>
<P> ``I want to state unequivocally that I did not commit these horrible crimes. I loved Nicole, I could never do such a thing. </P>
<P> ``How could anybody say I could kill this woman? How can anybody say that? Don't they understand that I'd jump in front of a bullet for Nicole? That I'd jump in front of a train to protect my family, to protect any member of Nicole's family? </P>
<P> ``Trust me, I never would have taken Nicole from our two little children. I would have taken myself out of their lives, not Nicole out of their lives.'' </P>
<P> ``Dear O.J. 'Juice' Simpson: I know you didn't kill Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. I'm a big fan of yours when you played for the 49ers. I am 11 years old.'' -- Letter from Justin Caudill of Rialto, California. </P>
<P> ``The first week almost killed me. Along with the grief I was having over Nicole's murder, I literally felt I was murdered. I felt there were three homicides. Some unknown killers murdered Nicole and Ronald Goldman; now the press was murdering me,'' O.J. Simpson on the media coverage. </P>
<P> ``I don't believe in the legal system anymore. I do believe in people, individual people within any system. Right now I have to get 12 people to listen to all the facts, to listen to me, and for the first time in my life that's not going to be easy,'' O.J. Simpson on the legal system. </P>
<P> ``I know in my heart that the answer to the death of Nicole and Mr. Goldman lies somewhere in the world that Faye Resnick inhabited,'' Simpson wrote about Faye Resnick, the author of the book, ``Nicole Brown Simpson: Diary of a Life Interrupted.'' Resnick was acquainted with the football star's ex-wife. </P>
<P> ``I wish everybody had an A.C. in his life as a friend. Next to the word ``friend'' in the dictionary should be a picture of A.C.,'' Simpson, writing about his closest friend A.C. Cowlings, whose Bronco he drove in the slow-speed pursuit by police that was televised live to millions of viewers. </P>
