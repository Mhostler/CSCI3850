<P>  Nearly half of Americans surveyed said Susan Smith, the woman who confessed to drowning her two young sons, should be executed if found guilty, a People Magazine poll released Friday found. </P>
<P> A national sampling of 1,033 adults conducted by the ICR survey group found that nearly 50 percent believed Smith should go to South Carolina's electric chair, while only 33 percent opposed that. </P>
<P> The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus three percent and was conducted between Feb. 23 and Feb. 26. The magazine goes on sale Monday. </P>
<P> While many people continue to feel outrage and hostility toward Smith, residents in her Union, S.C. hometown softened their views when they realized she could be electrocuted, the magazine said. </P>
<P> ``The prosecutor asking for the death penalty, well, that changed this town in a matter of minutes,'' says Carlisle Henderson, a local radio host told the magazine. </P>
<P> ``The very same people who were calling into the show a few weeks ago yelling 'Kill her' are now calling in to say, 'Well hang on, let's pray for her.''' </P>
<P> Smith confessed Nov. 3 that she was confused by romance and financial troubles when she pushed her car down a boat ramp into a nearby lake with 3-year-old Michael and 14-months-old Alex inside. </P>
<P> A conviction for the murders of two people who were under age 12 carries the death penalty. </P>
