<P> ``My iron play was really good, excellent, awesome,'' he said, gaining momentum just as he had after bogeying the 10th. </P>
<P> ``I don't want to say the course was playing easy, because I was playing so well.'' </P>
<P> Norman would have joined Elkington at 140 if not for his bogey at 18. He was still, naturally, pleased with his round. </P>
<P> ``I've done what I wanted to, and that's to get back into it,'' said Norman, who shot one-over 73 on Thursday. </P>
<P> Failing to take advantage of the conditions was Nick Price, who saw his quest for a third successive major title fizzle when he posted a 73 for a five-over-par 149 total. </P>
<P> ``I think we'll see some good scores today,'' said a disappointed Price, the British Open and PGA Championship title holder who was trying to match Ben Hogan's triple championship feat of 1953. </P>
<P> ``The course is just sitting there. It's there for the taking.'' </P>
<P> Jack Nicklaus, who began the day one shot off the lead, bogeyed three of the first five holes to fall back. </P>
<P> Two-time champion Nick Faldo, who shot 70 Thursday, remained at two under par through 12 holes. </P>
<P> U.S. amateur sensation Tiger Woods shot his second successive 72 to stand at even-par 144 along with John Daly, who moved up with a 69. </P>
<P> Daly's playing partner, twice Masters champion Seve Ballesteros, shot 68 for 143, a total shared by Tom Watson and Curtis Strange. </P>
<P> One shot better was Mark McCumber after a 69. </P>
