<DATELINE>ZAGREB, Yugoslavia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  U.N. observers reported rising tensions along U.N.-patrolled buffer zones between Croatian government and separatist Serb forces in the countdown to the expiry of a U.N. peacekeeping mandate at midnight Friday. </P>
<P> They said battle tanks had appeared in a Serb-held enclave of Croatia near Serbia and Croatian commandos violated a U.N.-controlled zone in the waning days of the U.N. mandate. </P>
<P> The U.N. Security Council hopes to pass a resolution on a revamped United Nations mandate before the deadline, but operational details are unlikely to be agreed until late April, suggesting a period of volatility on truce lines. </P>
<P> Croatia's overriding condition for an extension of the mandate -- the use of international troops on its borders to cut off rebel Krajina Serbs from arms supplies -- has been rejected by the breakaway Serb minority. </P>
<P> Western officials are desperate to sew up a new mandate to foster Croatian-Serb peace talks and avert a wider conflict beyond Bosnia where new fighting has undermined a cease-fire. </P>
<P> Chris Gunness, a U.N. spokesman, said nine T-55 tanks and some artillery pieces had been seen in the Serb-held Eastern Slavonia region of Croatia bordering Serbia. </P>
<P> The weapons were not listed on U.N. inventories of Krajina Serb military hardware drawn up when a Croatia-wide cease-fire took effect a year ago, he told a news conference. </P>
<P> U.N. Lt.-Col. Gary Bauleke said it was possible the weapons came across the Danube River border from Serbia but U.N. observers had no proof of their origin. </P>
<P> Gunness said a U.N. inquiry failed to substantiate Croatian allegations that 900 Yugoslav troops with some 25 tanks had slipped into Slavonia to bolster Krajina Serb forces in any renewed war with Croatia. </P>
<P> ``UNPROFOR has found no evidence of formed Yugoslav army companies in Sector East (Eastern Slavonia),'' he said. </P>
<P> Croatia contends that Krajina Serbs are obtaining military support from Serbia and Serb-held Bosnia and has demanded a U.N. clampdown on the borders to isolate its insurgent minority. </P>
<P> Bauleke said UNPROFOR had no evidence of ``sizable reinforcements'' entering Serb-held Croatia in recent weeks. </P>
<P> But U.N. observers did spot several military ferries with undetermined cargo crossing the Danube to the Croatian side last week. The U.N. lodged a protest with Serb authorities. </P>
<P> Tensions have also resurged along Croatia's southern tip on the Adriatic coast where borders with Serb-held Bosnia and the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro converge. </P>
<P> U.N. special envoy Yasushi Akashi protested to Croatia over the discovery on Sunday of two Croatian police commandos inside a U.N.-controlled zone on the Prevlaka peninsula facing Montenegro across the narrow Bay of Kotor. </P>
<P> ``They had been clearly wading through the sea possibly to avoid anti-personnel mines along the beach. UNPROFOR had been informed by the Croatian army that there were no Croatian military in the area,'' said Gunness. </P>
<P> ``But later that night UNPROFOR found telescopic equipment, sleeping arrangements for seven men, telephone lines and anti-tank weapons in tunnels near where the two men were initially detected.'' </P>
<P> U.N. spokesmen said other danger signs included trench- digging by combatants in buffer zones, isolated artillery fire, fresh restrictions on U.N. patrols and a Croatian encroachment on the southern Krajina from a Croat-held strip of Bosnia. </P>
