<DATELINE>AUCKLAND, New Zealand, April 3 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Czech President Vaclav Havel said on Monday that former communist countries were gaining momentum in their drive for NATO membership. </P>
<P> ``There are a number of indications that we are seeing a new momentum on the subject of future membership of the new democracies in the North Atlantic alliance,'' Havel told Reuters in Auckland at the end of a five-day visit to New Zealand. </P>
<P> ``One year ago, NATO membership did not seem likely. It did not seem possible until we joined the European Union. But that of course is a process that will take years to accomplish,'' Havel said. </P>
<P> ``But now it appears that things are beginning to change, which may be to some extent attributable to the strengths of arguments that the central European nations are bringing forward concerning their future membership of the alliance,'' he said. </P>
<P> Havel said an inter-governmental conference of the European Union (EU) scheduled for early next year ``should progress towards setting a timetable for future expansion of the Union.'' </P>
<P> Becoming a full EU member was likely to take the Czech Republic several years, but it hoped to achieve that goal before the year 2000, he said. </P>
<P> Havel reiterated the Czech Republic would apply for EU membership before the conference, following the example of Poland and Hungary. </P>
<P> He said joining the EU would take longer than entering NATO because it entailed ``more requirements, more demands that have to be met.'' </P>
<P> Havel has often said membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation is a crucial foundation for Prague to join the EU. </P>
<P> The Czech Republic and other former Eastern Bloc countries have been taking part in NATO's Partnership for Peace programme, which offers shared training and officer exchanges but no security guarantees or timetable for membership. </P>
<P> Havel said that during his New Zealand visit he had gained Wellington's firm support for the Czech Republic's entry to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), scheduled for later this year. </P>
<P> His trip, with senior cabinet members and more than 40 Czech business representatives, was part of a four-nation tour to strengthen trade ties with the Asia-Pacific region. The Czech delegation visited Australia last week and was due to leave Auckland on Monday for the Philippines, then Singapore. </P>
<P> Havel said he found in New Zealand ``some sources of inspiration for our own economic transformation.'' </P>
<P> The Czech Republic has made major reforms since the collapse of Communism in 1989, privatising almost 80 per cent of state-held assets and achieving relatively low inflation and unemployment. </P>
<P> ``It is our objective to establish a presence in this dynamically developing region and to get some anchorage both politically and economically,'' Havel said. </P>
