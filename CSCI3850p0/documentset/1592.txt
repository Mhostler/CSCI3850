<P>  South Africa's top Zulu politician, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, defied his king's ban on Shaka Day celebrations Sunday to address a second rally marking the birth of their Zulu nation. </P>
<P> But the rally in the battle-weary black township of KwaMashu, like one addressed by Buthelezi Saturday in the rural town of Stanger, passed off peacefully -- despite widespread fears of factional violence. </P>
<P> Glossing over the fact that King Goodwill Zwelithini had cancelled this year's festivities commemorating the 19th century founder of the Zulu nation, Buthelezi told 15,000 supporters he would fight to enshrine the Zulu monarchy in South Africa's post-apartheid constitution. </P>
<P> ``We have reached another crisis worse than that in which we and our monarch found ourselves in the months prior to (South Africa's first all-race) elections,'' Buthelezi, home affairs minister in Nelson Mandela's coalition government, told a packed stadium. </P>
<P> ``I want to state that our fight to secure the Zulu monarchy is a fight for a democratic South Africa,'' he added to cheers from Zulus dressed in leopard skins and brandishing traditional weapons such as sticks, clubs and spears. </P>
<P> But he said the Zulu king should be a figurehead with no executive powers. ``Across the world executive kings and queens had been replaced by constitutional monarchs. KwaZulu cannot turn history back on itself,'' he added. </P>
<P> ``There is no room in the new South Africa for an executive king unless our agenda is to destroy the monarchy itself.'' </P>
<P> The king cancelled the celebrations saying he feared for his life after supporters of Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party stormed the royal residence or kraal during a visit by Mandela, leader of the rival African National Congress. </P>
<P> The Inkatha supporters were angry at an invitation from the king for Mandela to attend the celebrations. </P>
<P> The king, 45, also broke off relations with Buthelezi, his powerful 65-year-old uncle. </P>
<P> Violence monitors and human rights groups said last week a power struggle between the king and Buthelezi could erupt into open conflict among the country's nine million Zulus. </P>
