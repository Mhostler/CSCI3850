<P>  Fred Couples made the first ace of his life Sunday and used the hole-in-one to successfully defend his title at the $1 million Kapalua International golf tournament. </P>
<P> Couples broke up a close battle by stroking an 8-iron 168-yard into the cup on the 11th hole and finishing with a three-under-par 70 for an 11-under 279 total that gave him victory by two strokes over third-round leader Bob Gilder. </P>
<P> ``Watching that ball roll in the hole was almost as shocking as watching George Foreman win on Saturday night,'' Couples said, referring to the 45-year-old boxer becoming the oldest heavyweight champion ever by knocking out Michael Moorer. </P>
<P> Equally elated was Couples's caddie, Joe LaCava. Couples had promised LaCava the car the tournament was giving away should he happen to ace the 11th hole. </P>
<P> ``That was my first hole-in-one ever playing golf,'' said Couples, who collected a first prize of $180,000. ``It was very exciting and I did promise Joe the car if I won one. A promise is a promise.'' </P>
<P> The ace capped off a stretch that won the tournament for Couples. He scrambled to save bogey on the eighth hole after hitting into a hazard behind the green, and then made a birdie on the next hole from eight feet. He saved par from off the green on the 10th hole before his memorable shot at 11. </P>
<P> ``That was a crucial stretch for me,'' he said. ``I could have just as easily made double-bogey, birdie, bogey, par and been well behind Gilder at that point.'' </P>
<P> Gilder, the 1988 winner here, shot a 73 for 281. Second-round leader Tom Lehman finished alone in third at 283 after a 72. </P>
