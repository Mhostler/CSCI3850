<P>  The European Union should suspend any aid to Rwanda channeled through the government, the EU's executive body, the European Commission, recommended Wednesday as it condemned a weekend massacre of refugees in a Rwandan camp. </P>
<P> The EU is the world's main donor of humanitarian aid to Rwanda, providing nearly $1 billion since October 1993. </P>
<P> ``The Commission feels that subject to consultations ... aid going through the Rwandan authorities should be suspended,'' Commission spokesman Nikolaus van der Pas said after a weekly meeting of the EU's executive body. </P>
<P> ``The Commission firmly condemns the events which have taken place and which led to this appalling massacre,'' he added. </P>
<P> Between 2,000 and 8,000 Hutus were killed by the mainly Tutsi army in Kibeho camp in southwest Rwanda Saturday, according to various estimates from the U.N. aid mission to Rwanda. </P>
<P> The Commission said it planned to discuss the issue as soon as possible with the 15 EU member states, the European Parliament and independent aid agencies. </P>
<P> Aid channelled through independent agencies -- about 42 percent of the total -- would not be affected, van der Pas stressed. Another 41 percent is given through U.N. agencies and other international organizations. </P>
<P> The Netherlands Monday stopped $30 million of aid pledged to the Rwandan government and Tuesday Belgium suspended direct aid. </P>
<P> The Commission will remind the Rwandan government that further aid depends on respect for human rights and pursuit of efforts for national reconciliation, especially in view of the length of the conflict and the number of victims, van der Pas said. </P>
<P> It will examine next week its position on humanitarian aid and whether to focus more on longer-term rehabilitation projects and will consult African organizations, such as the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC). </P>
<P> Members of the Rwandan government have long said they preferred rehabilitation aid and wanted the camps closed. </P>
<P> Officials said the EU would have to reconsider pouring aid into refugee camps which the Kigali government was intent on closing and in which Hutu militias were regrouping. </P>
