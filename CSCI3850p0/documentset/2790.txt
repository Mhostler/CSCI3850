<P>  Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Wednesday that U.S. officials were consulting with NATO allies following new air strikes in Bosnia on further action to prevent the fall of Bihac. </P>
<P> ``We are contacting our colleagues in NATO about further action that might be taken in the Bihac pocket,'' said Christopher. He did not specify whether that might include further military strikes. </P>
<P> Christopher said the United States was encouraging establishment of an exclusion zone against heavy weapons in Bihac and supporting the U.N. call for a cease-fire in the Bihac pocket. </P>
<P> ``So we are encouraging each of those actions that might relieve the pressure on the Bihac pocket and the city of Bihac,'' Christopher said. </P>
<P> ``We'll be working at that today,'' he said. ``It it is a serious situation.'' </P>
