<P>  British satirist Peter Cook, famed for his comedy partnership with Dudley Moore, died Monday at the age of 57 from a gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hospital officials said. </P>
<P> Cook, who was also a major shareholder in the satirical magazine Private Eye, had been admitted to a London hospital last week and died in intensive care, a hospital spokesman said. </P>
<P> Cook, an anarchic wit who influenced a generation of British humourists, sprung to fame in the 1960s when the Cambridge University review ``Beyond the Fringe'' transferred to London's West End and then to Broadway. </P>
<P> He was hailed as the founding father of contemporary British satire. </P>
<P> Cook co-starred in the review with Moore, who went on to become a Hollywood star in films like ``10'' and ``Arthur,'' Jonathan Miller, later a prominent director, and Alan Bennett, now one of Britain's most prominent playwrights. </P>
<P> At the age of 21, Cook opened The Establishment, billed as Britain's first satirical club. Its charter members included the novelists Somerset Maugham and Graham Greene. </P>
<P> But he was perhaps best known in Britain for his ``Pete n' Dud'' partnership with Moore in the television show ``Not Only But Also'' -- a series of surreal dialogues that became a major hit. </P>
