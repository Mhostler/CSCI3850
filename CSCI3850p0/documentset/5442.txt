<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Pakistan has smashed the bulk of its heroin factories and arrested all but two of 12 leading drug barons in a stepped-up battle against narcotics, the country's anti-drugs chief said Tuesday. </P>
<P> Maj-Gen. Salahuddin Tirmizi, head of the Anti-Narcotics Force, said two big raids since January had broken the back of the heroin production industry in one northern province. </P>
<P> The extradition of two drug barons this week to the United States was further proof of Pakistan's commitment to rolling back booming drug production and trafficking, he said. </P>
<P> Hours before she was set to leave on an official visit to the United States, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said Tuesday she would not allow drug traffickers in her country. ``We don't want to give a bad name to Pakistan,'' she said. </P>
<P> The two swoops in North West Frontier province near the Afghan border hauled in eight tons of heroin and nearly 200 tons of hashish, Tirmizi said. </P>
<P> ``This is the start of it,'' he told Reuters in an interview. ``The bulk (of heroin output) has been taken out.'' </P>
<P> Last year Pakistan was believed to be the third largest cultivator of illicit opium in the world after Burma and Afghanistan, according to the U.S. government. </P>
<P> According to U.S. estimates based on satellite pictures, poppy cultivation rose 16 percent in Pakistan last year and opium production grew to 160 tons from 140 in 1993. </P>
<P> ``Pakistan made only modest counter-narcotic progress in 1994,'' a U.S. government report released last month said. </P>
<P> But Pakistan, alarmed at exploding drug abuse among its 125 million people -- one U.N. estimate says it has three million addicts -- is trying to show Western critics it is committed to fighting the problem. </P>
<P> In January authorities wielding new legal power froze assets worth $70 million belonging to seven alleged drug lords. </P>
<P> They followed up with two raids in the tribal Khyber Agency, which Washington called a significant step. ``Our information is that in Khyber Agency, there are no more factories,'' Tirmizi said. </P>
<P> Tirmizi said five or six laboratories which refine opium into heroin remained in the even more remote Mohmand Agency, where Islamic fundamentalists launched a rebellion against the government in late 1994. </P>
<P> Authorities would eventually swoop down on those laboratories, he said, but not right away. </P>
<P> ``Certain areas are inaccessible, physically and in terms of the hostility of the tribesmen,'' he said. ``So it will take some time. We will let the dust settle down and then we will go for other areas also.'' </P>
<P> Sunday, two days before Bhutto's scheduled departure for Washington, Pakistan extradited two alleged drug barons to the United States. The move came hours after a high court rejected appeals by Mirza Iqbal Baig, Anwar Khattak and five others. </P>
<P> Tirmizi said he had asked the United States for eight helicopters to bolster his fight, and Britain had pledged two. </P>
