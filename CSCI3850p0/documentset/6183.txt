<P>  The White House said Monday it would be an uphill fight to get Dr. Henry Foster confirmed as surgeon general but the administration was still upbeat about Senate hearings that start Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``I think it's safe to say that it's uphill but I think it's also safe to say that he makes an enormously positive impression that can make that uphill fight less of a climb,'' spokesman Mike McCurry said. </P>
<P> Foster, a 61-year-old obstetrician from Nashville, Tenn., has been under fire from conservatives for conflicting statements he made about the number of abortions he performed -- and for having carried out the procedures at all. </P>
<P> McCurry said he thought the Senate confirmation hearings would be a tough fight but that prospects were still good for President Clinton's nominee. </P>
<P> ``Dr. Foster will get a hearing. He will make a very impressive case. And as he makes that case and as others testify to his career and what it's been about, we think many senators who are currently undecided or withholding judgment will find him a very impressive nominee,'' McCurry said. </P>
<P> Clinton was to play host at the White House Monday afternoon for a group of young people who have been through one of Foster's programs aimed at building self-esteem and reducing the teen-age pregnancy rate. </P>
