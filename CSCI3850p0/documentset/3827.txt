<DATELINE>ROME (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Italy's new Prime Minister Lamberto Dini said Wednesday his ``government of experts'' could have its limited reform program implemented within a few months and then resign to make way for early elections. </P>
<P> His remarks were a clear olive branch to the ``Freedom Alliance'' coalition of his predecessor Silvio Berlusconi, whose backing in parliamentary confidence votes next week will be vital to the chances of his government's survival. </P>
<P> Berlusconi, ousted from office last month when the Northern League party pulled out of his coalition, insisted again Wednesday that support for Dini would come only in return for a firm commitment that early elections would be held in June. </P>
<P> Dini, speaking at a news conference after his first cabinet meeting, made clear he did not have the power to set a date, a task soley for President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. </P>
<P> But he said he believed no more than ``a few months'' would be needed for his cabinet, made up of professionals from outside parliament, to carry out the limited four-point program of economic and institutional reform he has set as its agenda. </P>
<P> ``Once these things have been done the government could hand back its mandate,'' Dini said in response to a question. </P>
<P> In a separate written statement he said his government did not believe it could replace political parties. </P>
<P> ``(It) feels duty bound to carry out an unavoidable emergency task until political forces chosen freely by the voters are able to form a government more representative of popular sovereignty,'' the statement said in a reference to elections. </P>
<P> Berlusconi's Forza Italia party and its allies from the far right National Alliance and other conservative groups have said they will oppose Dini in key parliamentary confidence votes in parliament next week without a guarantee of June elections. </P>
<P> The coalition, which then included the League, powered to triumph in general elections last March and says League leader Umberto Bossi's mutiny makes a return to the ballot box vital. </P>
<P> They have accused Scalfaro, who Wednesday rejected the claims, of being part of a ``palace coup'' to block early elections and put Dini in the saddle for as long as possible. </P>
<P> Berlusconi, a billionaire media mogul, again alleged that Scalfaro had reneged on a promise to set June 11 as an election date in return for an interim non-partisan government led by Dini, who was Treasury Minister in the previous administration. </P>
<P> But he said there was still time before the confidence votes in the 630-seat Chamber of Deputies and the 325-strong Senate for a deal between Dini and the Freedom Alliance. </P>
<P> ``Postponing elections is a flight from reality...It's as if politics didn't exist,'' Berlusconi said. </P>
<P> ``We want a firm commitment to a certain date for elections (or) we will vote against this government.'' </P>
<P> Despite the threat, Dini said he was confident of winning the necessary support in parliament. Financial markets, a bellweather of Italy's political mood, appeared to agree. </P>
<P> They recovered some poise after a disastrous Tuesday on hopes that Dini, a former central banker, would make it. </P>
<P> A senior member of Berlusconi's Forza Italia party, Raffaele Della Valle, said the group might give temporary support to the government, while the Marxist party Communist Refoundation left the door open to possible abstention. </P>
<P> The bulk of the League plus centrist and leftist groups argue that an overhaul of the electoral system and curbs on media ownership are required before Italians vote again and want no time limit set on Dini's tenure. </P>
<P> The dour Dini has set himself four tasks for government, including a mini-budget to stop the forecast 1995 state deficit, set at 138.6 trillion lire ($85 billion), from rising. </P>
<P> Dini, who has kept his Treasury portfolio, said 1995 revenue could be higher than expected. He envisaged a supplementary budget of not more than 15 trillion lire ($9.3 billion) to cover higher debt repayment from interest rate rises. </P>
