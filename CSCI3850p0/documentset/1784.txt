<P>  Hundreds of Haitian refugees held here are eager to return to their homeland to serve as police officers for a new government led by exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. </P>
<P> By Monday morning, 644 of the about 13,000 Haitians at the camp had volunteered for Haiti's new public safety force, said U.S. Marine First Lieutenant Pete Mitchell, a spokesman for the U.S. military task force running the refugee camp. </P>
<P> Mitchell said representatives of Aristide's government were continuing to recruit detainees at the camp. </P>
<P> He had no information about when the volunteers, all boat people intercepted at sea this summer, would return to Haiti. </P>
<P> The men and women recruited were issued gray t-shirts and black shoes at Guantanamo, to differentiate them from the general refugee population, and were being trained at the base. </P>
<P> ``They're being trained to be public safety officers. They march, they go through drills and that sort of thing,'' Mitchell said. </P>
<P> The blue-uniformed police force in Haiti today is notorious for its political role and often brutal and violent treatment of Haitians who oppose the Caribbean nation's military regime. Many Haitians are petrified of the police. </P>
<P> In Port-au-Prince, officials said Monday more than 40 police officers from four countries began monitoring the Haitian police and teaching them traditional police techniques. </P>
