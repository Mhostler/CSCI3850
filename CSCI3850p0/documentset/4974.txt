<P>  Ivory Coast's government said Thursday it wanted to extend the death penalty to curb a surge in violent crime -- with public executions for particularly horrific cases. </P>
<P> ``Violent crime ... has reached an intolerable level,'' Information Minister Danielle Boni-Claverie said on state television. </P>
<P> ``If we want to save our country, because it is a question of that, draconian measures are urgently needed.'' </P>
<P> Ivory Coast has had the death penalty on the statute book since before independence in 1960 but since then no death sentence has been carried out. Capital punishment in the country, though never used, would in theory be by firing squad. </P>
<P> The penalty could be carried out publicly to strengthen its deterrant effect, Boni-Claverie said, but only for ``particularly odious'' crimes which deserve ``exemplary sentences.'' </P>
