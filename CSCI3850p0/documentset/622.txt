<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Former U.S. Solicitor General Kenneth Starr, named to replace Robert Fiske as independent prosecutor for the Whitewater investigation Friday, is seen as an even-handed lawyer despite his Republican credentials. </P>
<P> Starr, 48, was often mentioned as a possible Supreme Court nominee during the years of Republican administrations but never received the nod. </P>
<P> ``All-around nice guy and always a bridesmaid, never the bride when it comes to Supreme Court appointments,'' The Washington Post said of him in October 1992. </P>
<P> Starr was a clerk to former Chief Justice Warren Burger in 1974-75 and then went into private practice. In 1981, he became counselor to William French Smith, former President Ronald Reagan's first attorney general. </P>
<P> Three years later, the Texas-born Starr was appointed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Colombia Circuit, a job he could have held indefinitely. </P>
<P> However, asked by then-President George Bush to serve in his administration, Starr agreed reluctantly to leave the bench in 1989 and become solicitor general. </P>
<P> In this post, Starr was the government's chief litigator before the Supreme Court, where he argued 25 cases, including some extremely controversial and divisive lawsuits on abortion rights and school prayer. </P>
<P> While on the Appeals Court bench, Starr gained the reputation of being an honest broker despite his conservative convictions. </P>
<P> David Vladek of the Public Citizen Litigation Group told The Washington Post that Starr was ``universally trusted because he's a fair broker, a square-shooting kind of guy.'' </P>
<P> Leaving government in early 1993, Starr could have had his pick of jobs. He joined the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis but his days in the public spotlight were not over. </P>
<P> He was quoted as telling colleagues at a Bar Association dinner he was considering running for the Republican nomination for the Senate race in Virginia against Oliver North, the ex-Marine at the center of the ``Irangate'' scandal. </P>
<P> But Starr, who is active in Virginia Republican politics, never emerged as a candidate. </P>
<P> Then last year, he served as a neutral arbiter for the Senate ethics committee reviewing the diaries of Senator Bob Packwood for information relevant to its probe of sexual harrassment allegations against the Oregon Republican. </P>
<P> Married in 1970, Starr has three children. </P>
