<P>  Sen. Bill Bradley introduced a bill Tuesday that would increase the federal cigarette tax by 400 percent in an effort to discourage smoking. </P>
<P> ``Smoking now kills an estimated 419,000 Americans every year -- more than alcohol, heroin, crack, automobile and airplane accidents, homicides, suicides and AIDS combined,'' the New Jersey Democrat said in a statement. His bill would raise the federal tax on cigarettes from 24 cents to $1.24 a pack. </P>
<P> ``Increasing the tax on cigarettes and other tobacco products allows us to use the most potent weapon we have at our disposal to discourage smoking,'' Bradley said. He said a 10 percent increase in the price of cigarettes was estimated to reduce smoking by four percent. </P>
<P> Similar bills by Bradley failed in 1991 and 1993. Republicans from tobacco-growing states now control several key House and Senate committees, making passage even more difficult. </P>
