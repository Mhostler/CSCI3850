<P>  Schizophrenics' brains have an abnormally low level of a protein involved with processing information, a Canadian scientist said on Monday. </P>
<P> Lalit Srivastava, a molecular biologist at Montreal's McGill University, said this means that schizophrenics, on a biochemical level, lack the flexibility to process information and may be overwhelmed by information they cannot handle. </P>
<P> He said in a telephone interview that he does not yet know if the low level of the molecule that makes the protein is a cause or a consequence of schizophrenia. But he believes the discovery will spur new research into drugs that might help treat the disorder. </P>
<P> This molecule, an early form of the neural cell adhesion molecule, produces a protein that is part of ``neuronal plasticity,'' the ability of neurons to rearrange themselves to accommodate learning and memory. </P>
<P> The research is being published in Tuesday's edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. </P>
<P> Scientists have discarded old theories of schizophrenia as an emotional disorder and have come to regard it as a physicial disease of the brain, but the biochemical basis of schizophrenia is not fully understood. </P>
