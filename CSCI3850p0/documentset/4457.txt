<P>  U.N. envoy to Afghanistan Mahmoud Mestiri returned to Islamabad Tuesday vowing not to give up after his plan for a transfer of power in Kabul from President Burhanuddin Rabbani foundered at the eleventh hour. </P>
<P> ``I would not describe it as a failure,'' he told reporters at Islamabad airport as he arrived from Kabul for an overnight stay. He said he would go back to Kabul Wednesday to announce the next phase of his peace process. </P>
<P> ``We have not given up,'' he said. ``It can only be a failure if the U.N. gives up and we will never do that.'' </P>
<P> U.N. officials in Kabul said Mestiri would brief his colleagues in Islamabad on his talks with Rabbani and his top commander Ahmad Shah Masood, as well as with the new Islamic Taleban militia seeking to take charge of Kabul's security. </P>
<P> Mestiri had hoped to arrange for Rabbani to hand over to a representative council of about 30 Afghan political leaders Monday, but late objections by Rabbani and a demand by the Taleban for control of Kabul upset his timetable. </P>
<P> ``We have some consultations, some details to discuss with some people, then we hope to make an announcement about the next phase of the peace process tomorrow in Kabul,'' Mestiri said. </P>
<P> He might appoint some sort of a commission to come up with ways to resolve the deadlock between Rabbani and Taleban, diplomatic sources said. </P>
<P> Asked if the failure of his efforts would mean the collapse of the peace process, Mestiri said: ``I wouldn't say collapsed, we don't use this word collapsed. But if there is no next stage, nothing to say, then it would be a very bad development.'' </P>
<P> He said the United Nations was against involving Taleban in the proposed interim governing council. </P>
<P> ``They are a different sort of force than the Afghan parties, a new force. We should talk to them, see what they want, but we don't think they should be represented on the mechanism.'' </P>
<P> Monday, Mestiri, a former Tunisian foreign minister, told reporters in Kabul that the rival Afghan factions were using the presence of Taleban to adjourn the peace process. ``But they have themselves a big problem because they are still opposed to each other and all of them are opposed to the Taleban.'' </P>
<P> Mestiri said his plan was not dead, but could not be implemented right away. ``I think we will have peace, but not in the near future, not for some time.'' </P>
<P> Mestiri held ``productive and encouraging'' talks with Rabbani and Masood Monday night, one of the envoy's advisers said. </P>
<P> U.N. officials, who asked not to be named, said it might be several weeks before any transfer of power took place. </P>
