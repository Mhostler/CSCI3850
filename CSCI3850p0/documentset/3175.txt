<P>  States grappling with rising health care costs and coverage for the uninsured vary widely in the kind of health problems they confront, a new study showed Tuesday. </P>
<P> Overall, Hawaii, a leader in state-level health reform which requires businesses to insure most workers, has the fewest health problems. </P>
<P> Mississippi has the most severe problems, according to the study conducted for the National Institute for Health Care Management, a research organization founded by private health care companies. </P>
<P> President Clinton's efforts at comprehensive national health reform died in Congress this year. </P>
<P> But many states are experimenting with health reforms on their own. </P>
<P> The study, carried out by the respected health consulting firm Lewin-VHI, ranked states based on several criteria, including how much of a state's resources were devoted to health care, what portion of the people were uninsured, and whether the health system produced good results, for instance a low rate of ``avoidable'' cancer fatalities from such diseases as colon or cervical cancer. </P>
<P> Hawaii had the lowest rate of uninsured people -- 6.1 percent, but it ranked sixth on health care costs. Nevada was the highest, with 22.1 percent, more than one in five people, uninsured. </P>
<P> Alaska had the lowest spending on health, when measured as a share of the state's gross domestic product. In Alaska, it was 6 percent, compared to 17.5 percent in West Virginia, which ranked 50th. </P>
<P> But Alaska ranked 19 for overall health outcomes, while West Virginia lagged far behind, at 44. Utah ranked first. </P>
<P> Generally, southern states had the worst health situation. But when ranked by a special index measuring vulnerable populations -- AIDS patients, frail elderly, undocumented immigrants and teen-age births -- the states with the biggest burdens were California, New York, Florida, Texas and New Jersey. </P>
