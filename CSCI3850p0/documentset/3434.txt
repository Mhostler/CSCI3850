<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Turkey said Monday its security forces had killed almost 4,000 Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) rebels this year. </P>
<P> Unal Erkan, governor of the 10-province area in southeastern Turkey under emergency area, told a news conference that 3,905 PKK members had been killed and more than 3,000 arrested since the beginning of the year, Anatolian news agency said. </P>
<P> ``The organization has received blows it can't recover from and is facing starvation this winter. It is in a state of panic,'' Erkan said. </P>
<P> He did not give casualties suffered by the security forces. Both sides in the 10-year-old conflict give exaggerated accounts of their combat successes. </P>
<P> Erkan said the PKK had killed more than 900 civilians, most of them elderly men, this year. More than 80 children were among the dead, he said. </P>
<P> President Suleyman Demirel said last week that about 14,000 people had been killed in the PKK's fight to establish a Kurdish homeland in southeast Turkey. </P>
