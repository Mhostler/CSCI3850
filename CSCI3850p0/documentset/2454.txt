<P>  Some 648,000 Israelis, or about 12 percent of the population, lived below the poverty line last year even as the economy boomed and the consumer society flourished as never before, a report by a government institution said Monday. </P>
<P> The National Insurance Institute report said the number of poor in 1993 ``rose only by a small amount. But what should be noted is the increase among the elderly and families with many children.'' </P>
<P> Poor people were defined as households living on less than half of the average national wage, which the Central Bureau of Statistics put at $1,327 a month. </P>
<P> The report said poverty increased faster in previous years, when hundreds of thousands of Russian immigrants arrived in Israel, but was now following a different pattern. </P>
<P> The number of new immigrants among the poor dropped but the number of poor elderly people and large families grew, it said. </P>
<P> The government expects Israel's economy to grow by seven percent this year. </P>
