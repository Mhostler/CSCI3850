<P>  Defense Secretary William Perry said Thursday he would ask Congress for money to build up U.S. forces in South Korea if the agreement freezing North Korea's nuclear program fell apart. </P>
<P> Perry told the Senate Armed Services Committee that President Clinton was about to approve the buildup last June ``when we were preparing for confrontation with the North Koreans'' and before a breakthrough led to the agreement. </P>
<P> ``If this agreement is not implemented, I will have to come back to the Congress seeking supplemental funds to fund those augmented military forces in (South) Korea,'' he said. </P>
<P> Perry made the comment in passing as he defended his $258 billion defense request for next year to the committee. </P>
<P> It came after a statement by another U.S. official Wednesday that the agreement could fall apart if Pyongyang continues to refuse to deal directly with Seoul. </P>
<P> North Korea has agreed to freeze a nuclear program U.S. officials said could have produced dozens of nuclear weapons in return for 500,000 tons of oil and two power-producting nuclear reactors that do not easily produce weapons fuel. </P>
<P> Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord said Wednesday that the United States is ``prepared to lose the whole agreement'' if North Korea refuses to deal with South Korea. </P>
<P> Pyongyang has said the new electricity-producing nuclear reactors must come from some country other than South Korea, a demand Lord has described as a ``deal breaker.'' But he believes the North will yet accept South Korean reactors. </P>
<P> North Korea rejected Thursday U.S. calls for resuming dialogue with South Korea as part of its nuclear agreement, arguing that the two issues were separate. </P>
<P> ``The implementation of the DPRK (North Korea)-U.S. Framework agreement is one thing and inter-Korean dialogue is quite another,'' said a statement carried on the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) and monitored in Tokyo. </P>
<P> Perry said he was only days away from recommending to President Clinton last summer a buildup of the kind of U.S. forces needed to fight the first days of a war when former President Jimmy Carter won a breakthrough that led to the nuclear agreement. </P>
