<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Two Swedish hostages freed by Marxist guerrillas after a five-month kidnap ordeal said Saturday they taught their captors chess, gave them geography lessons and learned to hide from army helicopters in the bush. </P>
<P> Tommy Tyrving and Danny Applegate, tanned and smiling after being reunited with their families in Bogota, told reporters they were terrified when Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels snatched them from a hydroelectric dam project in northwestern Colombia. </P>
<P> ``I think we received good treatment,'' said Applegate, speaking through an interpreter. ``We were never tied up or threatened.'' </P>
<P> Ironically, the two men said their most anxious moments came when army helicopters flew over the remote mountain areas where the band of 15 to 20 guerrillas held them. ``These overflights forced us to hide everything we had and disappear from the view of the helicopters,'' said Tyrving. </P>
<P> Both men were in good spirits, but said they had lost weight because of the long distances they were forced to walk each day. </P>
<P> ``We walked for five hours a day or more,'' said Tyrving. ''It's as if we had walked 1,200 kilometers (700 miles).'' </P>
<P> Swedish ambassador Sven Julin and officials of Skanska, the Swedish multinational that employs them, all denied that a ransom was paid, which would contravene Colombian law. </P>
<P> Applegate and Tyrving said they taught their mostly illiterate captors chess and a Swedish game called varpa, which consists of throwing a ball at a stick. They also drew maps to show where Sweden is located. </P>
<P> A number of other foreigners are currently being held by rebels, including an Austrian, two Italians and several Americans. Asked for a message for the rebels, Applegate said: ''The only message I have is that they should respect human rights.'' </P>
