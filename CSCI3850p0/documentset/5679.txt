<DATELINE>JERUSALEM, April 12 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Tension between the PLO and Islamic groups in the Palestinian-ruled Gaza Strip remained high on Wednesday but both sides rejected assessments that a civil war was looming. </P>
<P> Diab Al-Louh, a top PLO official and head of the information department in the Palestinian self-rule Authority, told Israel's army radio up to 300 members of Hamas and Islamic Jihad had been arrested in Gaza in a crackdown following the killing of seven Israelis and a U.S. woman on Sunday. </P>
<P> ``You cannot define the situation as if we are on the brink of civil war,'' he said. </P>
<P> Hamas clergyman Sheikh Sayid Abu Musbah denounced the arrest campaign but told Army radio: ``Hamas will not turn its rifles on the Palestinian Authority.'' </P>
<P> In his most sweeping action against Islamists since gaining control of the Strip last May, Palestinian Authority leader Yasser Arafat ordered hundreds of militants rounded up and moved to disarm members of the two Moslem groups. </P>
<P> Newly-established military courts in Gaza sentenced two militants to long prison terms that provoked what appeared to be a thinly-veiled threat by Islamic Jihad against the Palestinian Authority on Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``It must know that the fighters who were able to hit the enemy where it was most painful and impossible, are able to respond at the right time and against the right target,'' the group said in a statement datelined Beirut. </P>
<P> The U.S. welcomed Arafat's decision to partially disarm militants and urged him to continue the crackdown. Israel and the U.S. have pressured Arafat to curb Islamic militants who have killed scores of Israelis in suicide bombings, to salvage the 1993 PLO-Israel peace deal. </P>
<P> The Palestinian Authority's justice head, Freih Abu-Medein, announced a decision to collect rifles but allow Palestinians to carry pistols. </P>
<P> The Islamic Jihad said it would only comply with the measure if Jewish settlements in Gaza were dismantled and said the Strip was ``on the verge of civil war because of the stupid policies of (Yasser Arafat), the head of the self-rule authority.'' </P>
<P> Around 4,000 Jews live in Israeli settlements in Gaza, the fates of which are supposed to be decided in talks on the final agreement between Israel and the Palestinians due to begin next year. </P>
<P> Hamas's military wing said Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin would pay for the crackdown. </P>
<P> ``It (Hamas) calls on him (Rabin) also to prepare as many coffins as possible for his soldiers and his settler pigs because our response towards these arrests will be against our primary enemy and it will come as soon as possible and in the midst of the Zionist entity (Israel),'' its statement said. </P>
