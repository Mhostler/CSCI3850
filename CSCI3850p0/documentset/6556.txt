<P>  Michel Garretta, the former head of France's national blood bank who was jailed for distributing AIDS-tainted blood products, has been released on parole, a spokeswoman for Paris's La Sante prison said Monday. </P>
<P> Garretta was freed automatically for good behavior after serving 30 months, more than half his four-year sentence imposed in 1992 for fraud and criminal negligence in the country's worst modern public health scandal. </P>
<P> More than 1,250 hemophiliacs were infected by the tainted products in the mid-1980s. More than 400 have since died. </P>
<P> Witnesses said Garretta may have been in a police van which drove out of Paris' La Sante prison early Monday. But some press reports said he may have been released secretly Sunday for security reasons, before any announcement was made. </P>
<P> He had been eligible for parole since February but the Paris prosecutor had prevented his release, fearing angry protests from hemophiliacs and relatives. </P>
<P> Garretta was the head of the National Blood Transfusion Center in 1985 when officials used up AIDS-tainted blood stocks to save money rather than import products disinfected by a new heating technique. </P>
<P> Legal sources said Garretta would remain under judicial control and was barred from leaving the European Union. </P>
<P> Like seven former government officials, including Socialist ex-premier Laurent Fabius and two of his former cabinet ministers, he is being probed to determine whether he could face the much more serious charge of poisoning. </P>
<P> Judicial sources said the former officials were suspected of helping delay testing blood products for the AIDS virus until France had developed its own version of an existing U.S. test. </P>
<P> The blood scandal contributed to the demise of the Socialists who were routed in a general election in 1993. </P>
