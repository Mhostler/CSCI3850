<P>  Cuba is threatening to unleash another exodus of refugees if Congress tightens the three-decades-old ban on U.S. trade with the island nation, the Washington Post reported Wednesday. </P>
<P> It said Cuba had told the State Department, through diplomatic channels, that a refugee outflow would be ``difficult to control'' if Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C., succeeded with his bill to tighten a U.S. embargo by punishing companies abroad that do business with Cuba. </P>
<P> Administration officials said Cuba warned that it would not be able to live up to its promise, negotiated last fall, to prevent refugees from heading for the United States in makeshift rafts and other vessels, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> Cuba agreed to limit migration after President Clinton, responding to the exodus of 32,000 people last summer, agreed to guarantee Cubans 20,000 immigration visas yearly. </P>
<P> The two countries are due to resume talks on migration issues in New York next week. </P>
<P> ``Our best guess is that the Cubans will want to establish they are reliable partners in the migration agreement, and at the same time, lay down a marker that if the trade ban is toughened, they will find it difficult to live up to commitments,'' one official was quoted as saying. </P>
<P> The Helms bill has not been officially introduced in Congress, but it has sponsors in the House and the Senate. </P>
<P> It aims to undermine Cuba's drive to attract foreign investment to help revive its economy, still grappling with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. </P>
<P> About 22,000 of last summer's refugees remain in a camp at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. </P>
<P> The Post said the State Department has allowed 8,800 parents and children to come to the United States under an ``extreme hardship'' clause, with another 2,000 to 4,000 likely to arrive in coming weeks. </P>
