<P>  The newborn child of a 62-year-old woman, the world's oldest woman to give birth, has been baptized in the Roman Catholic Church despite Vatican criticism of her artificially assisted pregnancy, her doctor said Monday. </P>
<P> Dr Severino Antinori, the woman's gynecologist and a controversial fertility expert, said a hospital chaplain in Rome had baptized the son of Rosanna Della Corte, who gave birth a week ago after a donor's eggs fertilized by her husband's sperm were implanted in her uterus. </P>
<P> The Vatican has called the artificially assisted pregnancy morally reprehensible but Antinori said the baptism, which took place Sunday, proved the birth was legitimate in the eyes of the Catholic Church. </P>
<P> ``I was very moved by this baptism because we are all very close to the Church,'' Antinori told reporters. ``If (the boy) has been baptized it proves that we are still in the fold.'' </P>
