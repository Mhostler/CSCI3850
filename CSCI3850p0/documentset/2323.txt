<P>  Demonstrators on all sides of the abortion issue flocked to Pensacola's courthouse Monday for the start of the trial of a former minister charged with killing a doctor who performed abortions and his clinic escort. </P>
<P> A group of about a dozen supporters of Paul Hill, charged with the July 29 shotgun murders of Dr. John Britton and James Barrett, his clinic escort, milled in front of the M.C. Blanchard Judicial Center. </P>
<P> Donald Spitz from Virginia and Andrew Cabot from New Hampshire held a sign that read, ``Murderers deserve death. Abortionists are murderers.'' </P>
<P> Cabot said Hill approved the sign and was it was made with his blessing. </P>
<P> Before the July 29 incident, in which Barrett's wife, June, also was slightly wounded, Hill was a regular guest on television and radio espousing his belief that the murder of abortion doctors is justifiable homicide because it protects the lives of unborn children. </P>
<P> One of Hill's supporters, who made it into the courtroom was Daniel Ware of Houston. But he was escorted out of the building and questioned by police because he was wearing a T-shirt reading, ``January 1973 - January 1993: Two decades of the legalized murder of unborn babies.'' </P>
<P> ``I'm here to support Paul and his actions. The only thing he's guilty of is saving innocent lives,'' he said. </P>
<P> Earlier this year, Ware faced federal firearms charges after transporting guns and ammunition on a Greyhound bus, but a jury failed to convict him on the charges. </P>
<P> A small group of volunteer clinic escorts also stood before the courthouse, with signs that said, ``Keep abortion legal.'' </P>
<P> Anna Burkholder of Pensacola said the escorts were outside the courthouse at the request of June Barrett, who said she wanted to be sure her husband's murder was not forgotten. </P>
<P> ``She didn't want people to forget an escort had also been killed,'' she said. </P>
<P> Vicky Conroy, a prominent local abortion opponent came to protest both violence and abortion. ``There are basically three sides out here -- pro-life, pro-choice and pro-life violence,'' Vicky Conroy said. ``We're on the side for all life, born and unborn, and we do not support killing of any kind.'' </P>
<P> The protesters were quiet, most simply standing still and holding their signs. </P>
<P> But Pensacola's police were ready for worse, with uniformed officers visible on the street unmarked cars circling the courthouse and special weapons teams based on top of the building's roof. </P>
