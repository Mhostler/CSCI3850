<DATELINE>WINTON, Australia, April 6 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Thousands of Australians led by the prime minister flocked to a small outback town on Thursday to celebrate the centenary of the nation's unofficial anthem ``Waltzing Matilda'' -- a ballad about a wandering vagrant who commits suicide. </P>
<P> ``Waltzing Matilda,'' one of Australia's best known tunes, was first publicly performed at a hotel in the central Queensland town of Winton 100 years ago. </P>
<P> To many Australians, it is better known even than the official anthem, Advance Australia Fair, adopted in 1974. </P>
<P> ``It hits a nerve with the Australian people,'' said centenary patron Slim Dusty, a country singer who will sing the song at the Great Northern Hotel on Thursday night at a dinner attended by Prime Minister Paul Keating. </P>
<P> Written by bush poet Banjo Paterson, the song tells the story of a ``swagman,'' a vagrant who walked outback roads looking for work. </P>
<P> The swagman is caught stealing a sheep that wandered into his camp site beside a water hole on a private property north of Winton. </P>
<P> Confronted by police and the property's owner, the swagman jumps into the water and drowns himself rather than be arrested. </P>
<P> ``It means pride,'' said Irving ``Swaggie'' Campbell, who claims to be one of the few remaining swagmen. </P>
<P> Campbell said he came to Winton after walking for three weeks along a stock route from a town more than 200 km (140 miles) to the south. </P>
<P> The overwhelming majority of Australians now live in towns and cities along the coast, but centenary organisers on Thursday said Waltzing Matilda's outback message of defiance still held universal appeal. </P>
<P> ``They might not want to live in it (the outback) but they want to identify with it,'' said organiser, local chemist Peter Evert, as country music stars, bush poets and whip-crackers performed along the town's main street. </P>
<P> The celebrations will continue until April 14. </P>
