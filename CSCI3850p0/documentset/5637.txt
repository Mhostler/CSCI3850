<P>  The Argentine Catholic Church admitted on Monday it bore a burden of guilt for not doing enough to prevent bloodshed and human rights abuses during the military's ``dirty war'' on leftists in the late 1970s. </P>
<P> In response to allegations that Navy chaplains offered moral support to officers who took part in ``death flights'' where detainees were thrown into the Atlantic, five senior Argentine bishops issued a public statement of remorse. </P>
<P> ``We will surely carry on our consciences for the rest of our lives our repentance for not having done much more to prevent young people who belonged to our Church from choosing guerrilla violence, and to prevent the repressors from committing such aberrations against human rights,'' they said. </P>
<P> About 4,000 people died and 10,000 disappeared after the military staged a coup in 1976 and kidnapped anyone remotely suspected of sympathising with the Montonero guerrillas. </P>
<P> Argentina has relived the nightmare since ex-Navy captain Adolfo Scilingo's televised confession earlier this year about the ``death flights''. One newspaper said on Monday he had been offered $1.5 million by a Hollywood studio for his story. </P>
<P> Scilingo said officers who took party in torture and murder were offered moral support by the Catholic church. </P>
<P> The country's best-known rights group, the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, said the church had plenty of reason to feel guilty. ``The church knew that military chaplains participated at the jails getting confessions from prisoners,'' they said. </P>
<P> Pagina 12 newspaper also accused former Papal Nuncio in Argentina Pio Laghi of being an accomplice of the military juntas. The bishops rejected this charge, saying he actually helped politicians escape from the clutches of the military. </P>
<P> The ``dirty war'' debate took a bizarre turn on Monday when an ex-policeman's girlfriend said he tortured her after she urged him to confess to an alleged 300 kidnappings and 36 killings. </P>
<P> Mirta Cabrera told local radio from her hospital bed the ex-policeman beat her and subjected her to the ``submarine'', a torture which involves holding the victim's head under water, after she told him: ``Why don't you confess? Find a priest.'' </P>
<P> The ex-policeman told the same program minutes later: ''She's completely mad. I never took part in repression''. </P>
