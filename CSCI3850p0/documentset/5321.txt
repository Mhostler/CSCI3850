<P>  Unidentified callers told Japan's major television networks Thursday a doomsday cult was responsible for shooting the nation's police chief and named the next targets, Jiji news service said. </P>
<P> Takaji Kunimatsu, director general of the National Police Agency, was shot by a man wearing a surgical mask, a police spokesman said. </P>
<P> Kunimatsu, the country's top police officer, was seriously hurt but is not in critical condition after a six-hour operation, police said. The attacker fled on a bicycle. </P>
<P> ``Listen carefully. I will tell you this only once. The Aum Shinri Kyo (Supreme Truth Sect) shot Kunimatsu,'' an anonymous caller told Nippon TV network, according to Jiji. </P>
<P> Police and the networks refused to comment on the Jiji report. Police had been receiving daily prank phone calls and anonymous letters threatening them since they started the raid on the Aum sect last week. </P>
<P> ``Next will be Mr Inoue and Mr Omori,'' the caller said, and hung up. </P>
<P> Yukihide Inoue is Japan's police superintendent-general and Kunimatsu's deputy, and Yoshio Omori is the head of Cabinet Information Research Office, Japan's main intelligence agency. </P>
<P> ``Stop investigating Aum,'' an anonymous caller told TV Asahi. He also said Inoue and Oomori were the next targets. </P>
<P> The doomsday cult, linked to the March 20 nerve gas attacks on the Tokyo subway system, denied its involvment. </P>
