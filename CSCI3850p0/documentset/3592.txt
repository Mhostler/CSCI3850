<P>  A radical Palestinian group said Thursday that four of its members were killed by Israeli forces in a clash in a West Bank village and it vowed to continue attacks on Israel. </P>
<P> Maher Al-Taher, spokesman for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, led by George Habash, told Reuters that four Israeli soldiers were wounded in the Wednesday clash in the village of Beit Liqia near Ramallah. </P>
<P> ``A group of the front's strugglers clashed with a unit of the Israeli special forces in Beit Liqia Wednesday evening Jan. 4. Four of the PFLP's fighters were martyred in the clash,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``The PFLP pledges to its martyrs that the military operations and other forms of struggle against the Israeli occupation will continue until the achievement of our peoples' rights...,'' the PFLP spokesman said. </P>
<P> Israeli security sources said Wednesday that Israeli undercover forces shot dead four Palestinians in Beit Liqia after gunmen fired on them. </P>
<P> The killings brought to seven the number of Palestinians slain by Israeli soldiers in the West Bank this week. </P>
<P> The Marxist PFLP has claimed several attacks against Israeli targets in the occupied territories and in south Lebanon after a 1993 PLO-Israeli peace deal was implemented in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho. </P>
<P> The PFLP spokesman said Israeli security forces launched a wave of arrests following Wednesday's clash and that Palestinians in surrounding towns announced a general strike. </P>
<P> Meanwhile a spokesman for the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front, which also opposes the Israeli-Palestinian peace deal, said Palestinian police arrested its representative in the Gaza Strip. </P>
<P> ``The Palestinian police have arrested struggler Jamal al-Batrawi, central committee member and representative of the PPSF in the Gaza Strip as part of its represssive arrest campaign against the leadership of the opposition,'' a PPSF spokesman said. </P>
<P> ``We warn the Palestinian police that continuation of arrests will lead to dangerous consequences... we also affirm that these repressive measures will not deter us from continuing our struggle against Israel and all those collaborating with it,'' he said. </P>
<P> The PFLP and the PPSF belong to a 10-member radical Palestinian alliance which vowed to wreck the PLO-Israel deal. </P>
