<P>  German sculler Andre Willms gave himself the best birthday present ever by winning the men's single sculls at the world rowing championships Sunday. </P>
<P> The 22-year-old from Magdeburg snatched the title from favorite Xeno Mueller of Switzerland, who has broken the world record twice this year, with a high-rating push for the line. </P>
<P> ``The tailwind was so strong and the conditions so fast I knew I could raise my rate without losing any power,'' Willms said in an interview with Reuters. ``This is the greatest birthday present ever.'' </P>
<P> No more than a length separated the six finalists for the first 1500 meters but with 500 meters to go Willms had taken the lead with Mueller only five tenths' of a second behind. </P>
<P> Willms, who stroked Germany's quad to world and Olympic gold in 1993 and 1992, raised his rate to 41 strokes a minute to break clear of the Swiss sculler. </P>
<P> ``I knew I had to row fast in the last 500 metres but it wasn't until I had crossed the line that I definitely knew that I had won.'' </P>
<P> Willms won by two-thirds of a length in a time of 6:46.33 minutes while Slovenian Iztok Cop, another newcomer to the event this year, took the bronze. </P>
<P> The German student said he had never regretted giving up his place in the quad for the single. </P>
<P> ``I prefer the single and it's an important event. I never had any doubts about my decision.'' </P>
<P> He remains modest about his achievements, however, and plays down any suggestion that he may be the new Thomas Lange, reigning Olympic champion and three-times world champion. </P>
<P> Lange, 29, is taking a year off rowing to concentrate on his medical studies but plans to defend his Olympic title. </P>
<P> ``Lange will come back and both he and I want to row in Atlanta in 1996. I am looking forward to racing him for the seat,'' Willms said. </P>
