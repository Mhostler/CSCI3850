<DATELINE>YAOUNDE, Cameroon (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Cameroon's government has reacted angrily to a U.S. statement calling on President Paul Biya's government to speed up democratization and improve its human rights record. </P>
<P> Government spokesman Augustin Kontchou Koumegni, in a statement in Monday's Cameroon Tribune, described the U.S. communique as unacceptable. </P>
<P> ``First of all it has the appearance of a lesson given to kindergarten children under the threat of the cane,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``No single stage of the democratization process was the result of external pressure; rather it has always been the work of a people proud and jealous of its sovereignty.'' </P>
<P> He went on to say that ``no journalists are in administrative detention in Cameroon'' and ``the opposition is freely carrying out its activities.'' </P>
<P> In the past three months, security forces in the central African country have detained numerous opposition militants and broken up political meetings and rallies. </P>
<P> In the northern town of Maroua, 29 militants from the National Union for Democracy and Progress, the biggest opposition party in parliament, have been held since the beginning of August without trial. </P>
<P> Last Friday, the director of the weekly Le Nouvel Independant, Ndzana Seme, detained since October 14 on charges of insulting the president, was sent back to prison after the first hearing of his trial was cancelled. </P>
<P> The U.S. communique, issued November 22, criticized suppression of opposition activities and urged the government to educate security forces to exercise restraint in their treatment of detainees. </P>
<P> ``Security forces in a democracy must not be used to suppress the opposition but rather to assure the safety of all citizens and to guarantee their right to expression and assembly. Detainees should be brought to trial rapidly or released quickly,'' it said. </P>
