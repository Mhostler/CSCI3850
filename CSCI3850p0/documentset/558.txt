<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Argentine police detonated a small bomb found at Buenos Aires metropolitan airport Tuesday, two weeks after a blast killed nearly 100 people at the offices of the main local Jewish group. </P>
<P> The device, which officials said appeared designed to produce noise but not destruction, was found during a one-day general strike backed by transport workers and other opposition trade unionists. </P>
<P> No one had yet claimed responsibility for planting it. </P>
<P> Air Force Police Major Nestor Padilla told reporters the device was made up of a clock, batteries, wiring and apparently a small explosive charge. </P>
<P> It was found in a restaurant bathroom on the first floor of the Jorge Newbery airport at the edge of the River Plate, bordering central Buenos Aires. </P>
<P> Disposal experts removed the package and detonated it in an isolated part of the airfield, Padilla said. </P>
<P> DyN news agency said the explosion, although carried out 600 yards away, rattled the windows of the airport. Air force officials could not immediately say what kind of detonators had been used for the controlled explosion. </P>
<P> The lounge of the private Argentine airline Austral where the bomb was found was temporarily evacuated, Padilla said. </P>
<P> The airport, serving mainly domestic destinations, was closed for 45 minutes. Flights resumed later. </P>
<P> Police gave no indication of possible suspects. </P>
<P> The incident came during a partially successful one-day general strike against government economic policy. The stoppage had crucial support from transport workers, whose participation made it difficult for many employees to reach their workplaces. </P>
<P> Earlier Tuesday, transport police scuffled with strikers who were trying to disrupt flights at the airport. </P>
<P> Although protestors have set fire to buses in previous anti-government strikes, it is almost unheard of for bombs to be planted. </P>
<P> A huge bomb, blamed by the government on Islamic fundamentalists, ripped through the headquarters of Argentina's main Jewish organizations July 18, killing at least 96 people. </P>
