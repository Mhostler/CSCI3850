<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Jordan's powerful Islamic Action Front Party, a strident opponent of U.S. policies, said Sunday its deputies would boycott President Bill Clinton's address to parliament. </P>
<P> Clinton will visit Amman Wednesday to attend the signing ceremony of a landmark peace treaty with Israel and address a joint session of Jordan's upper and lower houses of parliament. </P>
<P> ``Our position is not to participate in any session of parliament attended by Clinton or to meet him under the dome of the house or anywhere else,'' the Front's spokesman, Hamza Mansour, told Reuters. </P>
<P> The Front, with 16 deputies, is the largest political party in the 80-seat house, dominated by centrists who support King Hussein's peace moves with Israel. </P>
<P> Mansour said they had not decided yet on the form their boycott will take. </P>
<P> Islam required that a guest be welcomed, but Clinton would not be treated as one because of his animosity to the Arab and Islamic nation (Umma), Mansour said. </P>
<P> ``Clinton is an enemy of our Arab and Islamic nation in Jordan, Palestine, Iraq, Libya, Sudan and elsewhere,'' he said. </P>
<P> Mansour said Clinton was largely responsible for the Jordan-Israel treaty which the Front viewed ``as legitimizing the Zionist occupation of Palestine.'' </P>
<P> He likened Clinton's participation in the signing ceremony to ``the perpetrator of the crime attending the funeral of the deceased.'' </P>
<P> Mansour said the government had cracked down on groups opposing the peace treaty, arresting people after Friday's main noon prayers in a number of mosques around the country. </P>
<P> The government was not immediately available for comment. But several officials said some imams -- officials who lead Friday devotions -- had slammed peace moves with Israel. </P>
