<P> The accord, which did not mention the U.N. airlift to government-controlled Sarajevo shut down by Serb gunfire last week, emerged a few hours after a U.N.-brokered Serb-Muslim agreement to exchange hundreds of war prisoners. </P>
<P> It had been hoped the prisoner deal would create momentum for an unblocking of UNPROFOR resupply and U.N. humanitarian aid convoys frozen by Serb forces in retaliation for a punitive NATO air raid on a Serb target near Sarajevo. </P>
<P> A joint UNPROFOR-Serb statement released in Pale said UNPROFOR logistics and U.N. refugee aid convoys could resume Sunday. It also pledged efforts to restore and guarantee water, gas and electricity supplies ``on a reciprocal basis'' in the Sarajevo region and elsewhere in Bosnia. </P>
<P> Finally, it said, ``mutual readiness has been expressed to renew communications links in order to attain an agreed resolution of all possible incidents so as to avoid a deterioration of (Serb) relations with UNPROFOR.'' </P>
