<P>  Rioting inmates at a Sao Paulo state penitentiary have threatened to start killing 36 hostages one by one until their demands are met, a state Justice Ministry spokesman said on Wednesday as officials sought to negotiate a settlement. </P>
<P> About 400 security agents surrounded Tremembe prison, 85 miles north of Sao Paulo city, in the morning as the riot moved into its third day. About 700 of the 1,700 inmates have rioted, according to officials. </P>
<P> Family members gathered outside the penitentiary shouted for their relatives inside to cease the rioting. Inside, state negotiatiors held talks. </P>
<P> ``The Minister of Justice remains in the penitentiary to avoid a police action,'' a spokesman for the Sao Paulo state Justice Ministry told Reuters. </P>
<P> The spokesman said there had been no reports of hostages being killed. The hostages include five children, 13 prison officials and 23 relatives of prisoners. </P>
<P> The prisoners are demanding the closing of the maximum security section of the prison and the jail in nearby Taubate town, where they claim inmates are tortured. </P>
<P> An advisor to the Penitentiary Affairs Ministry said the claims are being investigated. </P>
