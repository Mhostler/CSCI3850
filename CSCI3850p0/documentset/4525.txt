<P>  Iraq is telling its people the United Nations oil embargo will fizzle out this year despite U.S. moves to head off action at the U.N. for an easing or lifting of the ban. </P>
<P> U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Madeleine Albright starts visits to several U.N. Security Council members Friday to counter attempts by Russia and France for a let up in the stringent regime of Iraq's sanctions. </P>
<P> State-run Iraqi newspapers said the move was proof of U.S. isolation at the council and pointed to the success of Baghdad's efforts in turning most of its members to Iraq's side. </P>
<P> ``America is cornered at the Security Council. It is concerned of the pressure that is building up for a lifting of sanctions,'' the official al-Iraq said in reporting Albright's actions. </P>
<P> President Saddam Hussein, in a cabinet meeting Thursday, told his nation that ``God willing the (Iraqi) ship will safely sail to the other side of the river,'' in reference to a quick end to the oil embargo slapped on Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in 1990, sparking the Gulf War which drove Iraqi troops out. </P>
<P> The official line in Baghdad is that no matter how hard Albright tries, the world, particularly Europe, will not forsake its economic interests for ``Washington's whimsical interpretation of U.N. resolutions.'' </P>
<P> Baghdad diplomats also believe that industrialists and businessmen flocking to Iraq comprise an indication of how desperate Western firms are for a resumption of trade with Iraq. </P>
<P> ``This is a place where business speaks louder than political considerations,'' a diplomat said. </P>
<P> The diplomat said pro-Iraqi business groups in Britain, France and Germany were giving Iraq ``the lever needed for an easing of the embargo.'' </P>
<P> A large delegation of British businessmen was in Iraq this week, vowing not to let the chance of having a chunk in Iraq's future trade slip away from Britain. </P>
<P> Businessmen from France, Spain, Germany and other Western countries are much in evidence in Baghdad throughout the year. </P>
<P> Iraq is organizing an international oil conference early in March and officials say giant Western firms will be in attendance. </P>
<P> ``No one can ignore Iraq in the oil market,'' an oil ministry official told Reuters. </P>
<P> Albright's tour is at the request of President Clinton and will include Britain, the Czech Republic, Italy, Argentina and Honduras, all countries with seats on the Security Council. </P>
<P> The visit will exclude France, Russia and China, countries with veto power at the council, as they have already made clear their desire to have the ban on Iraqi oil exports lifted once Baghdad meets U.N. weapons demands. </P>
<P> Babel, Iraq's most influential newspaper published by President Saddam Hussein's eldest son, Uday, said, this week, the U.S. would be committing ``a grave error'' if it continued in its anti-Iraq attitude. </P>
<P> ``The American intransigence no longer has any legal or logical justification,'' it said. </P>
<P> Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister, Tareq Aziz, has repeatedly blamed the U.S. for prolonging the sanctions and adding to the suffering of the Iraqi people. </P>
<P> However, U.N. inspectors charged with overseeing the dismantling of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction as required under terms of the Gulf War cease-fire have consistently declined to say that Baghdad has totally met their requirements. </P>
<P> Rolf Ekeus, the chief U.N. arms inspector, left Baghdad earlier this week and said he had not been able to resolve differences over Iraq's past biological warfare research. </P>
