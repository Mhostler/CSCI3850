<P>  A French philosopher said Friday that President Francois Mitterrand, suffering from prostate cancer, confided to him last month that doctors estimated he had no more than six months to live. </P>
<P> Jean Guitton, 93, said Mitterrand, due to step down as president in May after 14 years in power, visited him at his Paris home Nov. 17 to discuss the afterlife. </P>
<P> In an interview with RMC radio, Guitton quoted Mitterrand as telling him: ``I have a fatal illness, and the doctors looking after me, in particular my main doctor, say that I cannot live more than six months.'' </P>
<P> Socialist Mitterrand, 78, has said that he wants to serve out his term despite painful treatment for cancer, but has not publicly disclosed when doctors fear he might die. </P>
<P> The Elysee presidential palace had no comment on Guitton's remarks. </P>
<P> Mitterrand has cut back on his public appearances and has appeared increasingly gaunt after a second operation, during the summer, for prostate cancer. Friday, he met Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi in the southern French town of Aix-en-Provence. </P>
