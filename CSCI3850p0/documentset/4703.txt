<P> White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Campbell first talked to White House chief of staff Leon Panetta Friday morning about his move, then talked to Clinton about it by phone. </P>
<P> McCurry said it appeared the decision for Campbell, the only Native American in the Senate, was based on local political factors in Colorado. </P>
<P> He said Clinton and Panetta tried to talk him out of it, questioning whether the move really fits ``with what your public service is all about,'' but that Campbell had already made up his mind. </P>
<P> Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle said Campbell had also informed him of his decision. Daschle said he was surprised and disappointed but that, ``We wish him well and I still consider him a friend.'' </P>
<P> Campbell joins Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby as the second Democrat to turn Republican since Republicans seized control of the House and Senate in Nov. 8 elections. </P>
