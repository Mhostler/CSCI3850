<P>  OPEC ministers elected former Nigerian Oil Minister Rilmanu Lukman as the group's new secretary-general Tuesday, ending months of speculation over the politically touchy issue of filling the top post. </P>
<P> ``I am very happy,'' Lukman told Reuters as the oil ministers wound up their year-end meeting on the island resort of Bali. He added he would ``continue the goal OPEC has set for itself.'' </P>
<P> Lukman, who served as Nigerian oil minister from 1984 to 1989, was seen as a compromise candidate to break a deadlock between Iran and Venezuela. </P>
<P> Lukman, 56, took over as president of OPEC during the worst of the 1980s oil glut, when prices had crashed from $40 a barrel to $10. He himself called this period OPEC's ``darkest hour.'' </P>
<P> OPEC had been unable to agree on a replacement at its June meeting for Indonesia's Subroto, whose term ended this summer. </P>
<P> A quiet but skillful negotiator, Lukman commanded respect and support from both sides of the OPEC divide -- the conservative Arab members led by Saudi Arabia and price hawks led by Iran. </P>
