<P>  Several U.S. legislators plan to visit North and South Korea in April to study the political situation on the divided peninsula, the South's domestic Yonhap news agency said Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``Several senior U.S. senators and congressmen are planning to visit South and North Korea at the same time in April to study the situation,'' Yonhap quoted ruling party lawmaker Rha Woong-bae as saying on his return from the United States. </P>
<P> Rha said he held political discussions while in the United States, including the nuclear accord agreed between Washington and Pyongyang last October. </P>
<P> Rha said he stressed that South Korea should play a leading role in the project to provide communist North Korea with new nuclear techonology. </P>
<P> ``I said if North Korea declines the South's central role and the U.S. accepted this, it would be difficult for South Korea's National Assembly to approve payment for KEDO (Korea Energy Development Organization),'' Rha told Yonhap. </P>
<P> The United States, South Korea and Japan are heading an international consortium to supply North Korea with light-water nuclear reactors under the nuclear agreement reached in Geneva. </P>
<P> Pyongyang agreed to freeze its existing nuclear reactor program, which Washington believes was designed to make atomic bombs, in exchange for Western aid for the new nuclear technology and U.S. steps toward diplomatic recognition. </P>
<P> South Korea set up a task force Monday to deal with the multi-billion dollar project to provide communist North Korea with new nuclear technology. </P>
<P> Light-water reactors are less suitable for making bomb-grade plutonium than the North's existing graphite reactors. </P>
