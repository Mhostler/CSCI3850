<P>  A former miner was convicted Friday of second-degree murder for setting a bomb that killed nine workers at a gold mine in Canada's Arctic territory in 1992. </P>
<P> Roger Warren, who was on strike at the Giant mine in Yellowknife when the blast occurred, was charged with nine counts of murder in Northwest Territories Supreme Court. </P>
<P> The jury was in its fifth day of deliberations when it issued its verdict in the 11-week trial. </P>
<P> Nine men who crossed union picket lines were killed instantly by the explosion as they rode a rail car to their underground work stations at the mine in September 1992. </P>
<P> Warren, 51, confessed to police in 1993 that he triggered the explosion. But at his trial Warren pleaded innocent and said he falsely confessed because voices in his head had told him to and because of stress. </P>
<P> During the more than two-month-long trial, prosecutors contended that the confession had been truthful and said Warren gave them details about the explosion that only the bomber would have known. </P>
<P> The bitter labor dispute and mine explosion sharply divided this normally close-knit frontier community of 15,000 people. </P>
