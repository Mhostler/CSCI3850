<P>  A suspect in India's biggest spy case has been charged under an anti-corruption law with illegally accumulating more than $100,000 in a sex, money and secrets scandal, court officials said Wednesday. </P>
<P> The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) told a judge in the southern town of Trivandrum late Tuesday that D. Sasikumaran amassed wealth far beyond his regular income as a senior scientist with India's rocket program. </P>
<P> CBI special prosecutor V. Anil Kumar told magistrate C.D. Anil that a representative of the Russian space agency Glovkosmos, Chandrasekharan, had helped Sasikumaran amass the wealth, a huge sum in India. </P>
<P> Chandrasekharan, a Bangalore-based businessman, is the alleged kingpin of the network which, officials claim, stole rocket and submarine communications secrets for foreign countries. </P>
<P> Indian newspapers have reported the spies had links in Pakistan, Germany and Sweden. The Swedish embassy in the capital Delhi said Wednesday it had no comment, while German and Pakistani diplomats were unavailable for comment. </P>
<P> The CBI prosecutor successfully sought an extension of the protective custody of Sasikumaran and Chandrasekharan, saying their ``extreme isolation'' was required for further investigation into the spy ring, court sources said. </P>
<P> The corruption charges would be separate from any possible prosecution under the official secrets act. </P>
<P> Six people have been arrested and at least 20 are under surveillance in the case. </P>
<P> They include Sasikumaran and another scientist at the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), Nambi Narayanan. </P>
<P> Defense officials said the secrets pertained to highly confidential ``flight test data'' from India's experiments with rocket and satellite launches. </P>
<P> India hopes one day to carve a niche in the profitable satellite launch market. It denies the space rocket program is being used to develop long-range missiles. </P>
<P> The ring is also alleged to have leaked secret technology for submarine communication. The technology, called Very Low Frequency (VLF), allows submerged vessels to communicate with ships without surfacing or raising their antennae. </P>
<P> India is believed to be one of five countries to possess this sophisticated technology which ensures underwater communication without fear of detection. </P>
<P> VLF was developed by the ISRO's Liquid Propulsion Systems Center, where Sasikumaran and Narayanan worked. </P>
