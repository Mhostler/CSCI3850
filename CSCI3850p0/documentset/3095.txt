<P>  The New Aspiration Party (NAP) has pulled out of Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai's government after voting against a key reform measure in parliament, NAP officials said Friday. </P>
<P> The withdrawal will force Chuan to carry on ruling with a minority in the Lower House of parliament, where he now commands only 143 of the 360 seats. </P>
<P> NAP Secretary-General Phisan Moonlasartsathorn, announcing the decision, said: ``To demonstrate our political method and our firm policy on local administration, the NAP announces its withdrawal from the current coalition.'' </P>
<P> On Thursday, the NAP combined with the lower house opposition and upper house senators in a joint session of parliament to reject two constitutional amendments that Chuan considered crucial to his hopes for democratic reform. </P>
<P> The vote was 310-158 and 319-153 against the proposals, which would have created new local government councils to be elected for fixed terms. </P>
