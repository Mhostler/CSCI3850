<P>  Philippine prosecutors on Monday filed charges of illegal possession of guns and explosives against six Moslem fundamentalists suspected of links to Moslem radicals on trial in New York for the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Centre. </P>
<P> President Fidel Ramos, in a statement, said the arrest of the six ``signifies our strong resolve to be an effective partner of the world in countering terrorism.'' </P>
<P> ``I would like to assure our countrymen and our friends in the international community that the Philippines is commited to do its part in maintaining global peace and stability,'' he said. </P>
<P> Bail was denied on the recommendation of prosecutors. The six are being held under maximum security at national police headquarters in Manila. </P>
<P> Intelligence officers said the six were suspected to be involved in a plot to carry out terror bombings intended to disrupt the Philippine congressional elections next month. </P>
<P> They did not say what the supposed targets were and what the group hoped to gain from the bombings. </P>
<P> ``This will serve as a lesson to other nationals they should not engage in any foolishness in our country,'' prosecutor Afable Cajigal told reporters. </P>
<P> Their arrest came three months after police raided a Manila apartment and uncovered an alleged plot by Islamic extremists to kill Pope John Paul during his Manila visit in January and to blow up two U.S.-based United Airlines jumbo jets as they approached Hong Kong. </P>
<P> One suspect, Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, escaped during the raid but was arrested in February in Pakistan and deported to the United States to face trial as an alleged mastermind of the World Trade Centre bombing. </P>
<P> Police identified the six as Jordanians Hedi Yousef Alghoul, 28, and Isam Abdelhadi Mohamad, 29, Syrian Mohamad Isamel Deib, 23, Omani Nabil Al Riyami Nasser, 25, Palestinian Wail Rached El Kaatib, 26, and Aseraf Abdul Alyazouri Rahman, 28, from the United Arab Emirates. </P>
<P> The six, arrested on Saturday in a housing compound in the Manila suburb of Kalookan, were brought in handcuffs to the prosecutors' office for an inquest on Monday. </P>
<P> Evidence allegedly seized from their hideout and presented during the inquest included three handguns, two grenades, bags of gunpowder, dynamite and ammonium nitrate, detonating cords and other bomb making materials, officials said. </P>
<P> The six denied the charges and accused police of planting the evidence against them. </P>
<P> If found guilty, they are each liable to prison terms ranging from 12 years to life, prosecutors said. </P>
<P> Police said they were members of a group called ``Likah Asept Al-Islamiya (The Islamic Saturday Meeting),'' allegedly a fundamentalist group. </P>
<P> Alghoul, identified by the police as the alleged leader of the group, has been in Manila for at least nine years and was an electronics engineering graduate in one of the capital's main technical schools. </P>
