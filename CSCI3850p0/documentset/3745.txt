<P>  China has executed 35 people for forcing women into prostitution and for drug trafficking, a senior court official said, according to the Chinese News Service on Friday. </P>
<P> Liu Qinghai, vice-president of the Higher People's Court of southern Guangdong province, said provincial courts had recently successfully prosecuted 183 cases involving 269 people, the service said. </P>
<P> Liu said 35 were executed, 13 were sentenced to death suspended for two years, 15 to life imprisonment and 145 were sentenced to five years or more in prison. </P>
<P> Several of those executed were from other provinces. Under the pretext of finding work for young women they had deceived girls from their home villages, including friends and even relatives, into coming to Guangdong, Liu said. </P>
<P> They had then forced the women into prostitution, he said. </P>
<P> The drug trafficking involved rings operating across several provinces, Liu said. Some of the executed had been convicted of previous crimes, been released and returned to their old ways, he said. </P>
<P> In a campaign in the second half of last year against pornography, gambling and drug trafficking, authorities detained more than 1,400 people, of whom some 900 were sentenced to five years or more in prison, to life imprisonment or to death, Liu said. </P>
<P> Guangdong courts would continue to crack down on such crimes in the new year, the service quoted Liu as saying. </P>
