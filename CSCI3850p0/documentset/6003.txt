<P>  The United States, breaking with past practice, has sent two diplomats from Moscow to Chechnya to look for missing American disaster relief expert Frederick Cuny, U.S. officials said Monday. </P>
<P> No U.S. officials have been to Chechnya since Russia launched an attack on the separatist region Dec. 11. The operation, which is still continuing, has been sharply criticized by Washington. </P>
<P> But State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said last week it had been decided to change the policy because of concern for Cuny, who was last heard from April 9. </P>
<P> State Department officials said Monday that by Sunday the two diplomats had reached the neighboring republic of Ingushetia on their way to Chechnya. ``Their mission is to find any lead that would lead to him (Cuny),'' one said. </P>
<P> Cuny had been working for the Soros Foundation to set up a hospital in Dagestan, near Chechnya, and to bring humanitarian supplies to people left homeless by the war between Moscow and Chechen separatists. </P>
