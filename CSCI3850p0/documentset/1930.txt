<P>  Israeli forces expelled 26 villagers from the occupied zone in south Lebanon Tuesday, accusing them of links to pro-Iranian guerrillas, security sources said. </P>
<P> Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Bouez denounced the expulsions and said the action undermined the Middle East peace process. </P>
<P> The sources said the deportees, many in night clothes, arrived at a Lebanese army checkpoint at Bater on the edge of the zone at dawn. </P>
<P> They said they were driven from their homes at the village of Kfarhouna to a military barracks in the Christian town of Jezzine north of the zone but inside territory controlled by Israeli forces and their militia allies. </P>
<P> A spokesman for the deportees, who declined to be identified, said they were told that ``two or three'' villagers in Kfarhouna were connected to the pro-Iranian Hizbollah whose guerrillas attack Israeli and allied forces almost daily. </P>
<P> ``They told me...go and tell the officials and clergymen that we are not ready to sit at the road to monitor who is placing the explosives,'' he said. ``They told us that we can't return to Kfarhouna.'' </P>
<P> A delegation from the deportees visited top political and religious officials, including House Speaker Nabih Berri. </P>
<P> Bouez, who met the delegation at Berri's headquarters, described the expulsions as a ``transfer'' operation of civilians and said they were another means used by Israel to put pressure on Beirut. </P>
<P> He called on the United Nations and the sponsors of the Arab-Israeli negotiations ``to assume their responsibilities regarding an issue that undermines the peace process.'' </P>
