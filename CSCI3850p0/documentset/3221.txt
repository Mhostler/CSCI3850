<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  California's bankrupt Orange County won court approval Wednesday for a $200 million credit line from BankAmerica Corp, clearing the way for the government to pay its mounting bills. </P>
<P> U.S. Bankruptcy Judge John Ryan gave interim approval to the credit line, which had been in place before the county revealed its huge investment loss and filed for bankruptcy. </P>
<P> The credit line will allow the county to meet its payrolls on Friday and to clear securities sales in the financial markets as its tries to recoup whatever it can from its shattered investment fund. </P>
<P> The credit line also gives Orange County an unlimited credit card facility that enables the public to purchase servies from the county. </P>
<P> The county, facing $2 billion in losses from bad investments, entered bankruptcy last week and has been working frantically to come up with a system to meet payrolls, bills and interest payments on its debts. </P>
<P> BankAmerica and the county sought to extend payroll processing and allow the county to continue purchasing services by credit card, but the bank said it was unwilling to offer the credit without a court order. </P>
<P> The financial crisis continued to cause shock waves far away from the wealthy California county. In Washington, federal regulators invited state and local government groups to meet to discuss ``sound investment practices'' in the wake of the crisis. </P>
<P> ``Recent reports of significant losses of taxpayer funds due to risky investment practices have concerned all of us,'' Frank Newman, deputy secretary of the Treasury Dept., wrote in a one-page letter to nine groups. </P>
<P> ``I hope that we can work together, sharing our joint expertise in these matters, to ... protect the investment of taxpayers' money,'' Newman said. </P>
<P> Newman was writing to groups on behalf of the President's Working Group on Financial Markets, which was established in 1988 in response to the October 1987 stock market crash. </P>
<P> Moody's Investors Service Inc., meanwhile, said Orange County officials were now trying to muster $488,175 for an interest payment due on Jan. 1 and would probably miss a Dec. 15 deadline to transfer the funds to its trustee in bankruptcy. </P>
<P> The Board of Supervisors, meeting again in Santa Ana, also approved a new governmental structure to deal with the biggest bankruptcy ever by a U.S. municipality. </P>
<P> ``Business as usual is unacceptable,'' Supervisor Roger Stanton said. ``It's like being on a battlefield, we have to make decisions on the spot.'' </P>
<P> Under the new structure, Supervisor Gaddi Vasquez will coordinate the board's management of bankruptcy, while chief administrator Ernie Schneider will create a team to deal with day-to-day issues. </P>
<P> The Bankruptcy judge on Tuesday approved an interim plan that would allow the county to begin selling some of the fund's $8 billion in securites. </P>
<P> Officials are concerned about the sales because of belief among market participants that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates again next week. </P>
<P> Such a move would worsen the losses, which already account for 27 percent of the portfolio's value. The initial losses stemmed from a risky investment strategy -- which proved wrong -- that rates were going to fall this year. </P>
<P> The bankruptcy also continues to send shock waves through this affluent, conservative enclave, the home of Disneyland and the political powerbase for Republicans like Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. </P>
<P> Six participants in the investment pool, whose funds have been frozen by the bankruptcy, said Wednesday they are considering litigation against the county. </P>
<P> ``They're considering all their options,'' Ronald Rus, an attorney with Rus, Milibanks, Williams and Smith in Irvine, Calif., said. ``I expect there will be'' litigation, he added. </P>
