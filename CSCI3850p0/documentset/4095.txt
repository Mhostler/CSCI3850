<P>  The Fox television network proved there's no success like excess with its airing Tuesday night of the made-for-television movie ``The O.J. Simpson Story.'' </P>
<P> The movie, which had been soundly panned by critics, drew the highest rating ever for a Fox television film, Cindy Ronzoni, a Fox spokeswoman, said Wednesday. </P>
<P> About 17.4 million Americans tuned in to the two-hour movie, she said. </P>
<P> ``It was the highest-rated movie ever to air on Fox,'' Ronzoni said. She added Fox executives were not surprised by the results. ``I think there's so much interest.'' </P>
<P> The airing of the movie came one week after the opening of Simpson's trial for the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman. The entire trial is being broadcast live by three cable television channels, and opening statements were also carried live by the three major networks. </P>
<P> The film, starring Bobby Hosea as O.J. Simpson and Jessica Tuck as Nicole Brown Simpson, drew an 11.2 rating and a 17 share. The rating figure represents the number of homes watching a particular program. The share figure represents the percentage of households watching television at the time and tuned in to a particular program. </P>
<P> Fox's previous highest-rated movie was ``Diehard'' which on July 19, 1993, drew a 10.8 rating and an 18 share. </P>
<P> Daily Variety, the trade publication, had noted that Fox delayed the airing of the movie until the jury was sequestered. </P>
<P> ``They're not missing anything,'' Variety said. </P>
