<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Malaysia Friday outlawed a radical Islamic sect that has grown rich and powerful while arousing security concerns around Southeast Asia. </P>
<P> Al Arqam, a mystical Sufi sect that believes an Islamic messiah is coming soon before a prophesied doomsday, can no longer run its many businesses and schools or spread its teachings, Malaysia's National Fatwa Council Chairman Ahmad Tajuddin Abdul Rahman told a news conference. </P>
<P> The government and religious leaders will use a battery of laws against the sect. </P>
<P> The ban makes it illegal for Malaysia's Muslims, about half the population of 19 million, to own, print or sell any of the group's literature, films, audio cassettes, posters, advertisements and other materials. </P>
<P> Under the decree, binding only on Muslims, Al Arqam will have to shut down its more than 200 schools in Malaysia. Its businesses can no longer carry the sect's logo. Al Arqwam claims assets of more than $115 million. </P>
<P> ``They can't stop us from holding classes in our homes or under a tree. They can't stop us from reciting the Koran,'' an Al Arqam spokesman said. </P>
<P> A lawyer for the group filed a defamation suit on Friday against the director of the Islamic Center, the government's division of Islamic affairs. </P>
<P> The suit in part alleges that the Islamic Center falsely accused the group of maintaining an army in Thailand. The spokesman said Al Arqam would probably file another suit soon challenging the legality of the ban. </P>
<P> Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad told reporters Friday that the group was actually planning to use force but had never started an army. </P>
<P> ``They did advocate some form of military action. They didn't actually get down to setting up this army of theirs but they have a pamphlet which said that at some stage we need some kind of force to achieve our target. That is what we are referring to,'' Mahathir told reporters. </P>
<P> Mahathir said that while he did not view Al Arqam as a political threat, he opposed their teaching of a deviant version of Islam. </P>
<P> ``We are not afraid of them as it is made out but it is important that people especially children do not grow up with that kind of understanding of Islam,'' he added. </P>
<P> Malaysia began a public campaign against the sect two months ago, saying it was training several hundred suicide warriors in Bangkok. Thailand has denied the claim. </P>
<P> The National Fatwa Council, a group of Islamic scholars appointed by the king, listed a dozen reasons why the group should be banned. </P>
<P> Among them was a charge that Al Arqam leader Ashaari Muhammad claimed to have had a dialogue with the Prophet Mohammad. ``This crumbles the main foundation of Islam because it means that the Koran and Hadis are not yet finished and complete.'' </P>
<P> Al Arqam, which claims 100,000 members in Malaysia and many more around the world, believes a movement is rising in the East that will hand a ``black banner'' of Islamic revival to a messiah who will appear soon in Central Asia. </P>
<P> ``They are the biggest threat faced by the government since the communist threat,'' Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Hamid Othman told reporters Friday. </P>
<P> ``Anything that spreads through religion is not easy to eradicate,'' he said. </P>
