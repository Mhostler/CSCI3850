<P>  PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat said the Nobel Peace Prize awarded to him and two Israeli leaders Friday was for all the Palestinian people. </P>
<P> ``It is a great privilege for me and a great honor,'' he told reporters after the Norwegian ambassador to Egypt informed him of the award through a letter from Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland. </P>
<P> ``This prize is not in fact for myself,'' Arafat added. ``It is for my people, who have suffered much, for our martyrs, for our prisoners, for our children, so we can have lasting peace.'' </P>
<P> Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said: ``I congratulate President Arafat. He deserves it for the brave acts he has carried out for the Palestinian cause. </P>
<P> ``I also take the opportunity to congratulate both the prime minister and the foreign minister of Israel (Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres) because also they are brave men who took courageous steps,'' Mubarak added. </P>
<P> PLO negotiator and self-rule official Nabil Shaath said: ``I think Mr. Rabin and Mr. Peres have been the courageous partners of Mr. Arafat and I think the three of them, together with many others obviously, have led the way to peace. </P>
<P> ``I say to Mr. Rabin and Mr. Peres -- Continue on this path of partnership and peace with Mr. Arafat. Let not the aberrations and the small prices that come in our way stop the real progress towards the real thing, which is continuing the peace process,'' he said. </P>
<P> In her letter to Arafat, released by the PLO, Brundtland said: ``The decision is a just recognition of your personal courage and should bring hope to all people who have been working openly and quietly for a peaceful evolution in the Middle East.'' </P>
<P> ``Although so much has been achieved, there are still many problems to be solved ... It is our hope that the advantages of peace can be made tangible for people throughout the Middle East,'' she added. </P>
