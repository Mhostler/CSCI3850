<P>  Neutral Switzerland, which sat out World War II while rejecting thousands of Jewish refugees, will mark the 50th anniversary of the conflict's end with low-key ceremonies Sunday. </P>
<P> The government, which at first resisted public pressure for a national commemoration, agreed in March to send the cabinet to a joint Christian-Jewish religious service and to join a memorial session of parliament. </P>
<P> Officials said President Kaspar Villiger's speech to parliament was expected to touch on debate over Switzerland's policy from 1938 of turning back Jews seeking to escape Nazi Germany. </P>
<P> ``The darkest spot on Switzerland's record remains the refugee policy,'' historian Ruedi Brassel-Moser told the Zurich newspaper Tages Anzeiger. </P>
<P> Swiss diplomatic records released last year revealed that Bern sought and received a secret agreement from Hitler's Germany to help close the Swiss border to refugee Jews. </P>
<P> Under the pact, Germany stamped passports held by Jews with a ``J,'' allowing Swiss border guards to reject Jewish travellers while allowing other Germans to cross. </P>
<P> The conservative-dominated Swiss government coalition last year condemned the ``J''-stamp in retrospect as racist but has resisted calls from leftist politicians to go farther and issue a formal apology to Jews. </P>
<P> The coalition in March also rejected a call by a socialist member of parliament to erect a monument to Jews and other refugees turned back by restrictive Swiss rules during the war. </P>
<P> Critics including Socialist Party leader Peter Bodenmann say the two ceremonies for the war's end are too modest compared to national celebrations in 1989 marking the 50th anniversary of the mobilization of Swiss defense forces at the war's start. </P>
<P> ``The Swiss establishment continues to repress recent history,'' Bodenmann wrote in the weekly Weltwoche. </P>
