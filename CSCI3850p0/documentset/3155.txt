<P> By David Luhnow  Nearly 1,000 U.S. troops will be sent to Panama for increased security at Cuban refugee camps where recent riots injured 221 American soldiers, U.S. military officials said Monday. </P>
<P> An infantry battalion from Ft. Bragg, North Carolina and an engineering battalion from Ft. Hood, Texas are slated to arrive late Monday and early Tuesday at U.S. Howard Air Force Base in Panama, officials said. </P>
<P> They will join some 2,000 U.S. soldiers already taking part in operating and guarding Cuban refugee camps in Panama that were rocked by riots last week, injuring 211 Americans and 28 Cubans. </P>
<P> ``Our primary concern is the safety of our troops and the Cubans in the camps,'' Capt. John Leggett, spokesman for the U.S. military in Panama, told reporters. </P>
<P> Leggett said the additional troops will stay in Panama until the United States relocates about 8,500 Cuban boat people brought here when the U.S. Coast Guard picked them up this summer. </P>
<P> The transfer comes as part of a crackdown by U.S. forces after more than 1,000 Cubans angry at U.S. policy forbidding the refugees from relocating to the United States broke free from the camps and attacked the troops guarding them. </P>
<P> An additional 28 Cubans were injured Sunday during a U.S. raid on the camps to detain refugees who took part in the riots and move them to a tighter security area. </P>
<P> U.S. soldiers raided another camp early Monday to detain an additional 36 Cubans, officials said. No Cubans or U.S. soldiers were injured during the raid, according to officials. </P>
<P> Some Cubans who talked to reporters Monday during a visit by the refugees with family members outside the camps said they feared repression by the U.S. military for the riots. </P>
<P> ``There is a very harsh climate within the camps right now, and everyone fears the soldiers, especially the children,'' a refugee, who wished to remain anonymous, told reporters. </P>
<P> The U.S. military, which has about 9,000 soldiers stationed in Panama, has said it will not allow more violent riots and will protect American soldiers by ``any means necessary.'' </P>
<P> Soldiers, some armed, ringed the camps Monday in a continued display of U.S. force. </P>
<P> U.S. officials said they have no plans to reestablish telephone service to the camps that was damaged during the riots. Officials added they also do not intend to rebuild tents for school, a library and a recreation area that were destroyed by the Cubans. </P>
<P> U.S. officials believe about 10 Cuban refugees that escaped from the camps during the revolt are still missing. Leggett said officials were mistaken in earlier estimates of 31 Cubans missing. </P>
