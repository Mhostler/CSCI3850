<P>  Lisa Marie Presley said in a statement Monday she married pop superstar Michael Jackson in a secret ceremony outside the United States 11 weeks ago. </P>
<P> The statement was issued by Jackson's production company, MJJ Productions. </P>
<P> In the statement, Lisa Marie, the daughter of the late Elvis Presley said, ``My married name is Mrs Lee Marie Presley-Jackson. My marriage to Michael Jackson took place in a private ceremony outside the United States 11 weeks ago. </P>
<P> ``It was not formally announced until now for several reasons; foremost being that we are both very private people living in the glare of the public media. We both wanted a private marriage ceremony without the distraction of a media circus. </P>
<P> ``I am very much in love with Michael, I dedicate my life to being his wife. I understand and support him, we both look forward to raising a family and living happy, health (sic) life together. </P>
<P> ``We hope our friends and fans will understand and respect our privacy.'' </P>
<P> Jackson's publicist, Lee Solters, who had previously adamantly denied that the couple were married, refused to comment on Lisa Marie's statement Monday. </P>
