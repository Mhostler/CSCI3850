<P>  Players and owners said Thursday they will keep seeking an agreement to salvage the baseball season although a strike Friday appears likely. </P>
<P> ``If you can't get it done today, and (there is) no particular reason to think we can, you try tomorrow and the next day until you get it done,'' player representative Donald Fehr said on NBC's ``Today'' program when asked if a strike would end the 1994 season. </P>
<P> Richard Ravitch, chief negotiator for club owners, agreed negotiations would continue. </P>
<P> ``Of course,'' Ravitch said. ``We don't want this to happen. We've done everything we can.'' </P>
<P> A strike would be the eighth stoppage in 23 years for baseball, including a 50-day strike in 1981. </P>
<P> The Clinton administration has offered its assistance in reaching a new contract. </P>
<P> ``As soon as we think they can be be helpful, we would suggest it,'' Ravitch said. ``They haven't suggested anything they can do that would be helpful.'' </P>
<P> Owners, who say many clubs are financially pinched, want a cap on player salaries. Fehr says a cap would mean paying players less than they are worth and the owners can take steps on their own, such as changing their revenue-sharing formulas, to ease their problems. </P>
