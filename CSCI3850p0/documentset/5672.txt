<P>  The top U.S. immigration official predicted that applications for citizenship would double to 800,000 this year and said she would ask Congress for permission to ``nearly double'' the $29 million the agency now spends on naturalizing new citizens. </P>
<P> In an interview published in Wednesday's Washington Post, Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner said the agency would also seek help from community groups in streamlining the application process. </P>
<P> The additional funding would not come from tax revenues, but would be generated by application fees from the rising number of people seeking U.S. citizenship, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> Meissner said the money would be used to hire more INS examiners to handle the crush in district offices around the country. In Los Angeles, for example, some 2,500 applications come in daily, an increase of about 500 percent from one year ago. </P>
<P> Californians passed a law last November to limit state services such as schooling and medical services to illegal immigrants -- prompting the upsurge in applications for citizenship. </P>
<P> The rise in applications has resulted in large backlogs, with some applications taking up to 15 months to process. </P>
