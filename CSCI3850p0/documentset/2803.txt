<DATELINE>SCHLESWIG, Germany (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Four German young men went on trial amid tight security Thursday accused of firebombing a synagogue in Luebeck, the first such attack on a Jewish place of worship since the Third Reich. </P>
<P> About an hour into the trial the court adjourned until Friday after defense lawyers said their clients would not make any more statements Thursday. </P>
<P> Court sources said the defendants, aged between 20 and 25, were charged with arson and five counts of attempted murder in the March attack in the northern port city. The five people inside the synagogue at the time escaped unhurt but the building was badly damaged. </P>
<P> Thousands of Germans held marches and vigils after the firebombing, protesting against a surge in outbreaks of far-right violence since the country's unification in 1990. </P>
<P> Before Thursday's trial began, visitors and journalists entering the court room were searched and a glass barrier was erected to separate the defendants from the public. </P>
<P> Two of the youths repeated earlier confessions that they had participated in the attack. </P>
