<P>  With titles ranging from management know-how to romantic novels by Danielle Steel, U.S. booksellers opened a big exhibition of their wares in Havana Tuesday, the first of its kind in communist-ruled Cuba. </P>
<P> But the atmosphere of cordial cultural exchange was slightly marred when the head of the U.S. Interests Section, the lone U.S. diplomatic representative in Havana, was initially barred from entering the opening ceremony of the First Exhibition of U.S. Publishers. </P>
<P> Some organizers said section head Joseph Sullivan had not been invited. One official said that was in retaliation for U.S. authorities preventing the head of the Cuban Interests Section from attending a recent event in Washington. </P>
<P> He did not give details. </P>
<P> Sullivan eventually was allowed in after the apparent intervention of the president of the Association of American Publishers, Nicholas Veliotes, and the head of the Cuban Book Institute, Pedro Pacheco. </P>
<P> The two groups are organizing the exhibition along with the Cuban Book Chamber. </P>
<P> Some 38 U.S. publishers, including leading names, are presenting more than 6,000 titles at the exhibition, which opened in Havana at a ceremony attended by Culture Minister Armando Hart and Abel Prieto, head of the Cuban Union of Artists and Writers. </P>
<P> Pacheco said it was fitting there should be exchanges of books and a ``cultural and trade dialogue'' between two countries bound together by people such as U.S. writer Ernest Hemingway, who spent years fishing and writing in Cuba, and Cuban national hero Jose Marti, who spent years in the United States. </P>
<P> Veliotes said the aim was for U.S. and Cuban publishers to get to know each other better and for U.S. publishers to look at a potentially big, very literate market. </P>
<P> The exhibition had first been suggested four years ago but had taken this long to get off the ground, he said. </P>
<P> Sales of cultural material such as books are exempt from the 33-year-old U.S. embargo against the communist-ruled country, Veliotes said. But Cuba's shortage of foreign currency is the main block to business. </P>
<P> Veliotes said another objective of the exhibition was to bring with the books ``the message of the value of freedom of expression that is the basis of our industry and our society''. </P>
<P> The exhibition offers Cubans a readers' tour of capitalist America. The books are glossy and wide-ranging compared with what Cuba, mired in an economic crisis, is able to produce at home. </P>
<P> Titles such as ``Principles of Marketing,'' ``Consumer Behavior'' and ``Human Capitalism'' are on display, along with a huge range of scientific, computer and medical texts, sports and cookery books and children's tales. </P>
<P> There are also current affairs books such as ``Letters to Olga,'' a book on the Czech human rights movement by Vaclev Havel, biography, and fiction ranging from airport novels to classics by Mark Twain and Hemingway. </P>
