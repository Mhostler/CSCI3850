<DATELINE>LUANDA, Angola (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Angola's President Jose Eduardo dos Santos is expected to meet UNITA rebel leader Jonas Savimbi in the Zambian capital, Lusaka, a senior U.N. official in Luanda said Sunday. </P>
<P> ``We think the meeting is going to be in Lusaka,'' the official said. ``Dos Santos has agreed and Savimbi has not disagreed.'' </P>
<P> ``We are hoping it will be before the end of the month.'' </P>
<P> Isias Samakuva, head of the UNITA delegation to a joint commission working in Luanda to oversee implementation of a Nov. 20 peace agreement, will travel to the UNITA headquarters of Bailundo in the central highlands Monday to deliver a message from Dos Santos to Savimbi, he said. </P>
<P> The letter proposes that the meeting take place in Lusaka during a meeting of the countries bordering South Africa, the official said. </P>
<P> The peace agreement was signed in Lusaka by Dos Santos, but Savimbi failed to turn up and chief the UNITA negotiator at the Lusaka talks, Eugenio Manuvakola, took his place. </P>
<P> Government presidential spokesman Aldemiro Vaz de Conceicao said last week that Dos Santos had already received a message from Savimbi expressing a willingness to meet. </P>
<P> In previous public statements, UNITA said Savimbi was willing to meet Dos Santos outside Angola but the government said it should happen inside the country. </P>
<P> No more details of the proposed meeting were immediately available. </P>
<P> The U.N. official said about 190 U.N. military and police observers of the U.N. Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM) had arrived in Angola but deployment of many of them had been delayed because of delays in providing logistical support. </P>
<P> Large quantities of equipment, including generators, vehicles and office equipment are due to arrive from Somalia and Mozambique, where large U.N. operations are being scaled down, but have not arrived on schedule. </P>
<P> A number of civilian support staff supposed to back up the U.N. military and police observers will not arrive soon because the U.N. budget approved Dec. 15 had failed to include a provision for the staff, he added. </P>
<P> The United Nations has said it needs a report from Angola special representative Alioune Blondin Beye, saying the cease-fire is holding before approving the deployment of almost 7,000 U.N. peacekeeping troops agreed in Lusaka. </P>
<P> Both sides reported various cease-fire violations to the joint commission in January. A U.N. Security Council meeting is planned for Feb. 8. </P>
<P> The Lusaka agreement aims to revive 1991 accords which collapsed when UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola) rejected defeat in U.N.-sponsored elections in 1992 and returned to war. </P>
<P> Angola's civil war erupted upon independence from Portugal in 1975. </P>
