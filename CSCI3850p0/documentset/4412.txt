<P>  The White House said Friday that President Clinton had allotted $145 million in flood aid for Georgia, Florida and Alabama, and that the biggest share of the money would go to Georgia. </P>
<P> The funds are to help the three Southern states continue their recovery from flooding and damage caused last summer's tropical storm Alberto. </P>
<P> ``We will continue to stand by the people of Georgia, Florida and Alabama as they do the hard work of recovering from last summer's storms, rebuilding their homes, repairing their roads and restarting their businesses,'' Clinton said in a statement. </P>
<P> It said the money would come from this year's appropriations for the Housing and Commerce departments, and that $95 million would be dedicated to Georgia communities where most of the storm damage occurred. </P>
<P> A White House official said the funds for Georgia would bring the total federal aid sent to that state to support post-disaster economic recovery efforts to more than $408 million. </P>
