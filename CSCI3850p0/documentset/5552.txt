<DATELINE>BONN, Germany (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Prominent conservative politicians and writers urged Germans Friday to reject the majority view that May 8, 1945, the end of World War II in Europe, stands only for their country's liberation from Nazi tyranny. </P>
<P> The day also marked the start of the brutal expulsion of ethnic Germans from eastern Europe, oppression in eastern Germany and Germany's division into two hostile states, the 280 signatories said in a public manifesto. </P>
<P> Opposition Social Democrats (SPD) promptly demanded Bonn's Development Minister Carl-Dieter Spranger withdraw his signature from what it denounced as a nationalist trick to rehabilitate ``pre-democratic, authoritarian thinking.'' </P>
<P> Chancellor Helmut Kohl's spokesman Peter Hausmann said the government had sympathy for the initiative but also linked the day to sorrow for Holocaust victims and fallen German soldiers. </P>
<P> The manifesto, entitled ``May 8, 1945 - Against Forgetting'' and printed in the newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, accused politicians and the media of presenting a one-sided view of the Third Reich's defeat as only a day of liberation. </P>
<P> ``This day meant not only the end of National Socialist (Nazi) tyranny but at the same time the beginning of the expulsion terror, new oppression in the east and the start of the division of our country,'' it said. </P>
<P> ``Any history that muzzles, suppresses or relativizes these truths cannot be the basis for the self-image of the self-confident nation we Germans must be in the European family of peoples to exclude comparable catastrophes in future.'' </P>
<P> The appeal was a broadside against the post-war political correctness that has long minimized the ordeals that ordinary Germans suffered for supporting Adolf Hitler and his war. </P>
