<P>  British statisticians using new techniques said Thursday they could find no consistent link between nuclear installations and leukemia in children. </P>
<P> Several studies have shown people living around certain nuclear installations are more likely to develop cancers such as leukemia, while others have discounted any link. </P>
<P> Researchers at Oxford University used a new statistical method to look at how many cases there were of leukemia around 23 nuclear installations in England and Wales. They found no more than would normally occur in a population by chance. </P>
<P> ``There is no evidence of a general increase of childhood leukaemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma around nuclear installations,'' they reported in the British Medical Journal. ``This particular new method ... deals with the problem when you've got some possible source of pollution or whatever,'' said Gerald Draper, one of the researchers who worked on the study. </P>
<P> ``It looks at the rates at which these events occur and looks at the distance from the source. If there was an effect going on you would expect it was worse closer to the installations.'' </P>
<P> But Draper said figures showed children living near nuclear installations were no more likely to get leukemia than any other children with one exception -- around the controversial Sellafield plant in northern England. </P>
<P> ``This method detected the well-known excess of cases near the nuclear processing plant at Sellafield; this is entirely due to six cases in the neighboring village of Seascale and remains unexplained,'' the BMJ said in a statement. </P>
<P> The Imperial Cancer Research Fund and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine started a three-year study last November to see whether there is any link between the exposure of fathers to radiation at work and leukemia in their children. </P>
<P> It will look at the families of 60,000 past and present employees in the nuclear industry. </P>
<P> Scientists have recorded high levels of childhood leukemia around some nuclear power plants in Europe and the United States for years, but have never established that the radiation levels usually found there caused the disease. </P>
