<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Clinton's approval rating has dropped seven percentage points in the past two weeks but support for the Republican majority in Congress also fell, according to a new poll released Tuesday.  In the CNN/USA Today Gallup poll of 1,003 people, with a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points, 42 percent of respondents approved of the way Clinton was handling his job while 48 percent disapproved. </P>
<P> In a poll taken Feb. 3-5, Clinton's approval stood at 49 percent with 44 percent disapproving. </P>
<P> The poll also found growing skepticism of the way the Republican-controlled Congress is doing its job, though more people trusted the Republicans to guide the country than Clinton. </P>
<P> Thirty-five percent approved of the way Congress was doing its job, down from 38 percent two weeks ago, with an unchanged 53 percent disapproving. </P>
<P> Approval of House Speaker Newt Gingrich fell from 38 percent to 36 percent and approval of Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole fell from 58 percent to 51 percent. </P>
<P> Asked whether Republican policies were taking the country in the right direction, 52 percent agreed, a fall of three percentage points since early February. </P>
<P> More ominously for Republicans, 69 percent thought that proposed Republican spending cuts were unfair to some sections of society. </P>
