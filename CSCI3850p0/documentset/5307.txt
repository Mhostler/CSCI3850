<P>  Most people getting rid of unwanted furniture hold tag sales. </P>
<P> Donald Trump, who's converting his lavish Mar-A-Lago resort home in Palm Beach, Fla. into a private club, is selling many of its furnishings and artwork at a Christie's auction Thursday in New York. </P>
<P> The sale features something for everybody: there's a pair of Louis XIV commodes, starting at $100,000 to $150,000, and a George III style cut-glass and gilt-metal chandelier for $15,000 to $20,000. </P>
<P> Or there' are 23 green porcelain plates, originally bought at Macy's, for $200 to $400, and five macrame pillows for $100. </P>
<P> In between there are some 200 pieces of furniture, wall hangings, vases, candle holders, pieces of pottery, chandeliers, mirrors, rugs and more. </P>
<P> The ornate Mar-A-Lago estate was built by heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post, the only child of breakfast cereal magnate C.W. Post, in the 1920s on a 17-acre site along the Atlantic Ocean. At the time she was married to stockbroker E.F. Hutton. </P>
<P> Post died in 1972, leaving the estate to the federal government for use by presidents and visiting dignitaries. But in 1972 the government returned the property to the Post Foundation, and Trump bought it in 1985. </P>
<P> Trump is planning to open a Club Mar-A-Lago. He said he will use proceeds from the sale -- estimated to reach $1 million -- for preservation of the landmark estate. </P>
