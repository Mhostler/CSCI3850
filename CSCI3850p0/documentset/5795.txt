<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Spain Monday summoned the British ambassador in Madrid to express its displeasure at Britain's position during the fish dispute between Canada and the European Union, which ended with a weekend deal in Brussels. </P>
<P> ``The ambassador is being called to the ministry today and he will be informed of Spain's displeasure at Britain's attitude from the beginning of this dispute until the very end,'' Foreign Minister Javier Solana told reporters. </P>
<P> Speaking before leaving for New York, he said the EU is an association of countries with a ``subtle equilibrium'' and that when a member breaks this it has serious consequences. </P>
<P> The five-week dispute began March 9 when Canada seized a Spanish fishing boat in international waters and demanded a new agreement for Greenland halibut aimed at conserving stocks. </P>
<P> Spain filed a complaint with the International Court of Justice in The Hague, and despite the weekend agreement is not withdrawing it. It is also maintaining a new visa requirement for Canadian citizens visiting Spain. </P>
<P> Britain and Ireland sided with Canada in the dispute, which ended with an agreement which Spanish fishermen's leaders say will cut Spain's catch by 80 percent and double Canada's. </P>
<P> Thousands of jobs are expected to be lost in the Galician fishing industry. Galician president Manuel Fraga Monday wrote to the British and Irish ambassadors expressing his surprise and disgust at their failure to support Spain, and attacking Canada for its ``aggression'' against Spanish boats. </P>
<P> ``The Canadian government has assumed powers in the open seas, its ships have attacked Galician boats which were fishing legally ... and it was instransigent in Brussels negotiations,'' he said in his letter to the British ambassador. </P>
