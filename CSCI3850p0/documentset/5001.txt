<P>  Angry British fishermen showered a government minister with flour Friday, accusing him of making too many compromises with Spain over access to European fishing grounds. </P>
<P> Fisheries Minister Michael Jack, visiting the southwestern port of Plymouth, found himself face to face with angry protesters who blocked his path and let off orange marine smoke flares. </P>
<P> Jack was showered with flour as he returned to his car, which was then blocked by demonstrators. </P>
<P> Television pictures showed him retreating from the port area on foot, his dark overcoat spattered with white. Two men were arrested, police said. </P>
<P> The fishermen were protesting a European Union agreement earlier this year giving Spanish fishermen, whose fleet is Europe's biggest, access to waters around Ireland from which they were previously barred. </P>
<P> Britain abstained in the EU vote. One fishermen shouted at Jack: ``You are supposed to be our representative but you are more concerned about the Spanish than us.'' </P>
<P> The British Conservative government has been criticized at home for not breaking ranks with its EU partners and siding with Canada in its fisheries dispute with Spain. </P>
<P> Canada seized a Spanish trawler on the high seas last week alleging illegal fishing. </P>
