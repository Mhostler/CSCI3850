<DATELINE>GAZA (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Riding a bicycle with explosives strapped to his body a Palestinian suicide bomber killed three Israeli soldiers and wounded six members of the security forces near a Jewish settlement in Gaza Friday. </P>
<P> The militant group Islamic Jihad said one of its guerrillas, 21-year-old Hisham Ismael Hamad from Gaza City, carried out the attack to avenge the killing last week of activist Hani Abed in a car-bombing blamed on Israeli agents. </P>
<P> Gaza hospital sources said six Palestinians, including a senior police officer, were also wounded in Friday's blast on a checkpoint guarded jointly by Israeli and Palestinian forces near Netzarim settlement. </P>
<P> The attack is likely to increase Israeli pressure on PLO chairman Yasser Arafat to curb Islamic opponents of last year's Israel-PLO peace deal in Palestinian-ruled Gaza where Israel maintains several settlements. </P>
<P> Islamic Jihad said the bombing was ``an initial and quick'' response to Abed's death in southern Gaza on Nov. 2. </P>
<P> The group vowed to continue attacks against Israeli soldiers ``on all of the land of Palestine from the (Jordan) river to the Mediterranean Sea.'' </P>
<P></P>
<P> ``A terrorist riding a bicycle detonated explosives which he was carrying on his body near a group of soldiers standing next to an IDF (Israel Defense Forces) post in the Netzarim junction in the Gaza Strip. </P>
<P> ``As a result of the explosion three reserve officers were killed and four soldiers, one border policeman and one police officer were injured.'' </P>
<P> The attack came three days after a conciliatory meeting in Gaza between Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. </P>
<P> An Arafat aide said the PLO leader condemned the attack and convened his Higher Security Council in Gaza for an emergency meeting to discuss what steps to take. </P>
<P> ``President Arafat, who is following the situation very closely ... has asked me to condemn the operation in his name regardless of its source,'' aide Khaled Salam told Reuters. </P>
<P> ``He asserted that the Palestinian Authority and its bodies will take all necessary and deterrent measures to deal with the situation,'' Salam said. </P>
<P> Israeli Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer called on Arafat to act. </P>
<P> ``All the expectations that Arafat would be in control of the territory are not being realized,'' Ben-Eliezer said. </P>
<P> Israeli army chief Lt. Gen. Ehud Barak said an Israeli-Palestinian liaison committee was meeting in Gaza to discuss security. </P>
<P> ``We consider the Palestinian Authority responsible for uprooting this kind of terrorism inside their territory,'' Barak told reporters at the scene of the attack. </P>
<P> Israel maintains nearly 20 small settlements, guarded by its army, inside Gaza which came under Palestinian rule in May. </P>
<P> Less than a month ago, a suicide bomber of the Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas blew up a bus in Tel Aviv, killing himself and 22 others, most of them Israelis. </P>
<P> Israel is reluctant to extend Palestinian self-rule beyond Gaza and Jericho to the rest of the West Bank until it is satisfied that Arafat can rein in Islamic militants. </P>
