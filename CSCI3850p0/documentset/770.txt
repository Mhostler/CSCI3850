<P>  The White House acknowledged Sunday that it may have to dump Deputy Treasury Secretary Robert Altman as the highest ranking casualty of the Whitewater affair. </P>
<P> `Hanson, the Treasury Department's general counsel, was also up in the air because of heavy congressional criticism of her testimony three weeks ago on the Whitewater investigation. </P>
<P> ``I've talked with (Treasury) Secretary (Lloyd) Bentsen. He's talking with both Roger Altman, Jean Hanson, as well as the chairman of and members of that committee'' about whether trust can be restored, ``but no decisions have been made.'' </P>
<P> The two most senior Democrats on the Senatellary in the Whitewater real estate venture. </P>
<P> Panetta praised Altman, a 48-year-old ex-investment banker credited with a big role in some of President Clinton's biggest economic wins, including his budget and congressional passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement. </P>
<P> ``He's been very good on the economic plan, very good on trade issues,'' the chief of staff said. ``He's provided great leadership for this administration. He's obviously made some mistakes. He admitted those mistakes during the course of the hearings on the Hill.''  ``I think the real question is can he re-establish ... the confidence of the Senate in his job,'' Panetta said. </P>
