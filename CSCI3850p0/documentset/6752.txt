<P>  The Japanese economy will grow by only half as much as previously estimated, denting growth forecasts for the whole industrialized world, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said Monday. </P>
<P> Figures released in Paris by the rich nations' think-tank showed Japan's gross domestic product (GDP) growing by just 1.3 percent this year compared with the 2.5 percent forecast made six months ago and by 2.3 percent in 1996, down from 3.4. </P>
<P> Japanese officials blamed the soaring yen for paring its exports, although they were less pessimistic than the OECD. The think-tank assumed a dollar at 83.73 yen in its latest survey, compared with 96.40 in its December estimates, they said. </P>
<P> Like Japan, Germany too would suffer from a strong currency. But, taking account of the export-friendly slump in the dollar, the OECD revised up its forecasts for U.S. growth. </P>
<P> That would also mean falling prices, known as deflation, since the surging yen has made imports much cheaper. The OECD predicted a decline of 0.3 percent in consumer prices compared with 0.6 percent inflation it had previously predicted. </P>
<P> The revision to Japanese GDP was the main element in marking down growth estimates for the whole 25-nation bloc to 2.7 percent in 1995 from three percent and to 2.7 percent next year from the 2.9 percent forecast in December, OECD chief economist Kumiharu Shigehara told reporters in Paris. </P>
<P> The U.S. economy would grow a bit faster than foreseen at 3.2 percent this year and 2.3 percent in 1996. </P>
<P> Forecasts for Europe as a whole were little changed, although Germany, whose currency has also appreciated dramatically against the dollar, would suffer next year. </P>
<P> An official of the Japanese Economic Planning Agency said in Tokyo, however, that the OECD may well have underestimated the boost the economy would get from the government's latest budget, which passed into law only last week. </P>
<P> The OECD, which holds its annual ministerial meeting this week, last gave forecasts in its semi-annual Economic Outlook in December. It gave the following forecasts, in annual percentage change with December's projections in brackets: </P>
