<DATELINE>BOMBAY, India (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Up to 27 million people were due to vote Sunday in India's western state of Maharashtra in a second round of assembly elections seen as crucial to Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's government. </P>
<P> A record 75 percent of 26 million voters cast their ballots in the first round Thursday, even though widespread confusion over the introduction of voter identity cards prevented nearly 45,000 people from voting. </P>
<P> The ruling Congress party is riven by internal dissension and smarting from election defeats in three southern states in November. Defeat in Maharashtra and five other states voting in the next two weeks could increase dissent and might precipitate early general elections, politicians say. </P>
<P> The elections will also determine the fate of Maharashtra Chief Minister Sharad Pawar, a Rao rival who staked a claim to the Congress leadership, and thus the prime minister's job, in 1991, in succession to the assassinated Rajiv Gandhi. </P>
<P> Now Pawar is struggling to hold on to power in India's most industrialized state, whose capital is Bombay, the country's financial and commercial center. </P>
<P> Opinion polls have predicted that an alliance between India's main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Hindu militant Shiv Sena would emerge as the biggest group in a hung assembly. </P>
<P> The latest poll, by the independent Center for Media Studies, said Congress was unlikely to win more than 65 or 70 seats out of a total of 288. </P>
<P> The BJP-Shiv Sena alliance was seen winning 125 to 130 of the seats, just short of an overall majority. </P>
<P> With the centrist Janata Dal party predicted to win between 45 and 50 seats, the balance of power could lie in the hands of a loose alliance of independents and small left and centrist parties. </P>
<P> In Bombay, which votes Sunday, the most emotional issue was the emnity of Muslims for Congress after Pawar jailed a large number of them under tough anti-terrorist laws following 1993 bomb attacks which killed 260 people in the city. </P>
