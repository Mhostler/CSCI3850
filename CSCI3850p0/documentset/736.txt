<DATELINE>GOMA, Zaire (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A Zairean boat carrying about 20 people was hit by machinegun fire and sank in Lake Kivu off the Rwandan border town of Kibuye Thursday, a French army officer said Friday. </P>
<P> All people on board were presumed dead, said Colonel Alain Rambeau, spokesman for the French humanitarian Operation Turquoise set up in southwest Rwanda. </P>
<P> No French troops witnessed the incident but he said the report was based on reliable, detailed witness accounts. </P>
<P> Rambeau said the sinking took place at the edge of Rwandan territorial waters but outside the French-protected ``safe zone.'' </P>
<P> It was believed to be the first such incident since French troops were deployed in the area late June, he said. The French are scheduled to leave in 10 days' time at the end of a two-month U.N. mandate. </P>
<P> It was not clear who was on board the boat. Zairean coffee smugglers regularly cross Lake Kivu from Rwanda to Zaire and refugees have also fled by boat. </P>
