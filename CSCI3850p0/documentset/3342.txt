<P>  Is Rep.NNewt Gingrich a modern day Scrooge from Charles Dickens' ``A Christmas Carol''? </P>
<P> That's what a coalition of charities and religious groups said Tuesday, claiming that the Republican Party's so-called Contract with America will make thousands more Americans hungry. </P>
<P> With Christmas only four days away, the groups offered images of the mean-spirited, tightfisted Scrooge in arguing that the Republican contract would cut food aid by a total $30 billion by 2000, and take Food Stamps away from six million people. </P>
<P> ``The Dickens-like specter of hungry Americans, of malnourished children, and frail elderly persons whose lives are shortened by lack of nutritious food is morally repugnant,'' said Christine Vladimiroff, president of the Second Harvest food bank network. </P>
<P> Republicans say the Contract, drawn up by incoming House Speaker Gingrich of Georgia, helped sweep them to majorities in both chambers of Congress in Nov. 8 elections. </P>
<P> Gingrich has proposed that charities, not government, take more of the burden of welfare, and sparked controversy by calling for the children of unmarried mothers to be put in orphanages. </P>
<P> Six charities and religious groups said they rejected the Personal Responsibility Act proposed in the Contract, which would convert federal nutrition programs into block grants for states. </P>
<P> Fifteen states, including Texas, Ohio, Georgia, Kentucky and Michigan would lose 20 percent or more of their funding in the 1996 fiscal year, the Food Research Action Center, one of the groups attacking the Contract, said at a news conference. </P>
<P> Texas, Louisiana, Washington, Delaware, Maryland and the District of Columbia would lose 30 percent or more of their food assistance funding next fiscal year, the group said. </P>
<P> States would also have to slash the number of people receiving Food Stamps by up to 40 percent or cut benefit levels, currently averaging 75 cents per person per meal, by 20 percent, it said. </P>
<P> Food Stamps, half of whose beneficiaries are children, are vouchers redeemable at food stores. The poorest ten percent of the population benefits from the program. </P>
<P> Salvation Army spokesman Raymond Peacock said his group welcomed the debate on welfare, but feared that legislation would ``go too far and push millions of people into more desperate situations.'' </P>
<P> ``Government feeding programs are working and should not be part of the reform debate,'' Peacock said. </P>
