<DATELINE>BERLIN, March 27 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  U.S. and North Korean negotiators met for a third day of talks on Monday to try to solve an apparent stalemate over Pyongyang's nuclear programme. </P>
<P> North Korea's chief negotiator Kim Jong-u arrived in driving snow at the U.S. mission in eastern Berlin with his nine-member delegation. He smiled and waved at reporters but declined to comment on the talks. </P>
<P> U.S. officials have also released little information, fearing media reports could upset the delicate balance of the talks, which are due to last until Wednesday. </P>
<P> The two sides disagree on what type of light-water reactor should be supplied to North Korea as part of an overall nuclear accord signed between the two states last October. </P>
<P> North Korea froze its nuclear programme and stopped building graphite-moderated reactors which produce more of the plutonium that can be used to build an atomic weapon. </P>
<P> In return, the United States said North Korea would be supplied with light-water reactors. </P>
<P> The United States has told the North Koreans that the only offer on the table was the supply of two reactors manufactured in South Korea. </P>
<P> Pyongyang has rejected modern nuclear technology from South Korea, citing safety problems, although many observers believe its real motive is to avoid any dependence on its arch-rival. </P>
<P> North and South Korea are still technically at war as no peace treaty was signed after the 1950-53 Korean War. </P>
<P> South Korean media on Monday reported that both sides failed to make any headway in talks on Sunday and said the fate of the October accord could hang on what happens on Monday. </P>
