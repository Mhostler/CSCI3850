<P>  The head of the international police group Interpol appealed Wednesday for the decriminalization of drug abuse. </P>
<P> Interpol Secretary General Raymond Kendall told an international narcotics conference that education and mandatory treatment for drug addicts would often help more than making criminals of them and locking them up. </P>
<P> ``I favor decriminalization'' of drug abuse, he said. </P>
<P> Shortly before, hardline French Interior Minister Charles Pasqua told the same conference that drugs had eclipsed nuclear weapons as a global menace and that only ``defeatists'' favored solutions like decriminalization. </P>
<P> ``One argument is that we should classify drugs and that 'soft drugs' could be covered by a different legislative treatment and benefit from legalization or depenalization,'' he said, sitting near Kendall. </P>
<P> ``What problem would be solved by the legalization of cannabis?'' he asked an audience of about 50 experts at the headquarters of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. </P>
<P> ``None, in my opinion,'' he said. ``There are no 'soft' drugs.'' </P>
<P> ``Drug trafficking threatens to plunge us into a new conflict on a global scale. An all-out war against drugs should be launched around the world by the international community,'' Pasqua added. </P>
<P> While Kendall said he favored decriminalization, he said he bitterly opposed any formal legalization of drugs. </P>
<P> Kendall said legalization would encourage abuse by making drugs more widely available. Decriminalization would mean drug abusers could be ordered to take treatment to get over their addiction as a substitute for jail or fines. </P>
<P> The international drug trade is estimated to be worth $400 billion a year -- enough to threaten to destabilize democracies, Kendall and Pasqua agreed. </P>
<P> Kendall, expanding on arguments for decriminalization made earlier this year, said Sweden provided perhaps the best model of how to handle drug abuse. </P>
<P> He said Stockholm had invested heavily in education and medical, psychological and social rehabilitation programs for abusers. In Sweden, ``the number of drug addicts has fallen and especially the number of addicts hit by AIDS,'' he said. </P>
<P> By contrast, many other nations spent too much cash on trying to stop smuggling rather than discouraging consumption. </P>
<P> He said a recent study in the United States showed 73 percent of all cash spent on fighting cocaine went to stopping trafficking in the country while just seven percent went to reducing domestic demand. </P>
<P> Interpol, based in the southern French city of Lyon, groups 174 member nations. </P>
