<P>  Eleven soldiers and seven civilians in a bus were killed Thursday night in an ambush by Marxist guerrillas in a remote area of western Colombia, army sources said Friday. </P>
<P> The attack, near the town of Tado in the Choco jungle region 170 miles west of Bogota, was blamed by authorities on the pro-Cuban National Liberation Army (ELN) which operates in the area. </P>
<P> ``A group of guerrillas blew up and raked with gunfire a bus in which about 20 people were traveling, including some military,'' an army official told Reuters. </P>
<P> After the attack the guerrillas seized the dead soldiers' weapons and fled into the jungle. </P>
<P> It was the bloodiest guerrilla attack since President Ernesto Samper took office August 7 offering talks with the rebels to find a negotiated solution to Colombia's 30-year-old guerrilla war. </P>
<P> The country's biggest group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) said Thursday it was interested in the offer but the smaller ELN has not yet formally replied. </P>
<P> Colonel Gustavo Mantilla Ortiz, commander of the nearby army brigade, said in a radio interview that the military would investigate why the soldiers, in contravention of rules, were traveling in a passenger bus. </P>
<P> The Choco region is one of Colombia's poorest and most backward and in recent years has been infested by guerrillas and drugs traffickers. </P>
