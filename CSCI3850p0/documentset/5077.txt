<DATELINE>KEY BISCAYNE, Fla.(Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Steffi Graf of old and a renewed Mats Wilander dominated the stadium court action at the $4.1 million Lipton Championships Tuesday. </P>
<P> Graf ripped apart Judith Wiesner of Austria, giving up just eight points in the first set and 11 in the second to her hapless fourth-round opponent in a 6-0, 6-1 rout. </P>
<P> The 30-year-old Wilander appeared to turn back the clock to 1988, when the Swede was on top of the tennis world, as he cruised into the Lipton quarterfinals. </P>
<P> Wilander, who won three of four Grand Slam events in 1988, breezed past Jan Siemerink of the Netherlands for a 6-4, 6-2 victory. Wilander, ranked 128, has lost just two sets in four rounds. </P>
<P> Australian Rachel McQuillan, at 88 the lowest ranked woman left in the field, scored her third upset of the week, and by far her biggest, when she took out ailing fourth-seeded American Lindsay Davenport 7-6 (7-3), 6-2. </P>
<P> Davenport has been suffering from a cold and lost form and energy after the first set. </P>
<P> Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina, the fifth seed, swept past 14th-seeded South African Amanda Coetzer 6-1, 6-1 to join McQuillan in the quarterfinals. </P>
<P> Third-seeded Czech Jana Novotna, seventh seed Kimiko Date of Japan and eighth-seeded German Anke Huber also claimed quarterfinal berths with straight sets victories. </P>
<P> Although Graf has won the only two tournaments she has played this year, she was plagued late in 1994 and at the start of 1995 by injuries. Last year her results were patchy, especially her first round exit at Wimbledon. </P>
<P> However on Tuesday, Graf, seeded second and ranked second in the world, simply pounded her opponent into oblivion with a barrage of wicked groundstrokes. </P>
<P> Graf reached a 6-0, 5-0 lead with three match points against Weisner's serve before the 20th-ranked Austrian managed to salvage a sliver of pride by winning five consecutive points to hold onto her serve and win a game. </P>
<P> Graf cleaned up in the next game, winning it at love to take the set 6-1 and seal the victory. </P>
<P> ``It was definitely the best match I played for quite some time,'' Graf said. ``I don't think I could play better.'' </P>
<P> Wilander also benefitted from a little luck as a net cord winner hopped beyond Siemerink's reach to give the Swede a break for 4-1 in the second set. </P>
<P> Siemerink fought hard, serving up winners to hold on for 5-2, but Wilander served out the match 6-2 with a clean forehand pass down the line. </P>
<P> ``When you suddenly feel like you can win again your perspective changes completely,'' Wilander said. </P>
<P> ``I've got the momentum going for me for sure. I think what I'm using most is my experience but also my legs. I'm still able to get around the court pretty good and I don't feel like an old man.'' </P>
