<DATELINE>LONDON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A fanatical British pop fan has changed his name to include the titles of his favorite group's records. </P>
<P> And for good measure, Antony Hicks added the names of the original line-up of the group, Level 42. </P>
<P> Hicks this week signed legal papers changing his name to ``Ant Level Forty Two The Pursuit Of Accidents The Early Tapes Standing In The Light True Colors A Physical Presence World Machine Running in the Family Running in the Family Platinum Edition Staring At The Sun Level Best Guaranteed The Remixes Forever Now Influences Changes Mark King Mike Lindup Phil Gould Boon Gould Wally Badarou Lindup-Badarou.'' </P>
<P> Ant, of Truro in southwest England, only told his wife after changing his name, a comparatively easy legal procedure in England. </P>
<P> ``Some people might think I am crazy,'' he told a reporter. </P>
<P> But the 23-year-old, who has still not seen his favorite group play live, says he has not finished yet. </P>
<P> ``If they release any album or single I will alter my name to have the new title incorporated in it,'' he said. </P>
