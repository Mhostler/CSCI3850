<DATELINE>JAKARTA, May 4 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Indonesia's media, largely muzzled for the past year, has won at least a symbolic victory with a court decision in favour of the banned Tempo magazine, academics and journalists said on Thursday. </P>
<P> Some of them also said the administrative court's ruling that the ban was illegal reflected a gradual but significant step towards more open government in President Suharto's Indonesia. </P>
<P> ``Whatever may happen, yesterday's court ruling is, indeed, an important milestone in our press history,'' the Jakarta Post newspaper said in an editorial. </P>
<P> ``Hopefully it will not only strengthen the commitment to strive for more democracy but also function as a reminder to all of us that the times are changing.'' </P>
<P> The media has long been a key voice for change in Indonesia, firmly ruled by former general Suharto since the chaotic 1960s. </P>
<P> But after a brief flurry of local and international protest against last June's closure of three news weeklies -- Tempo, Detik and Editor -- the press has been mostly muted. </P>
<P> Few expect an immediate rebirth for Tempo or a sudden easing up on existing publications now. </P>
<P> Information Minister Harmoko, whose ministry closed down the three outspoken political weeklies, said on Wednesday he planned to appeal against the Tempo decision. </P>
<P> In the surprise ruling, greeted by a cheering courtroom, a three-judge bench upheld suits by Tempo founder Goenawan Mohamad and Tempo employees, saying the publishers had not been allowed to defend themselves against the ban. </P>
<P> The bans followed a series of magazine articles challenging decisions of several key ministers and targetting corruption allegations against senior officials. </P>
<P> Whatever the final outcome of the Tempo case, commentators said the decision was a boost to journalists still battling oblique censorship and cowed into skirting sensitive issues. </P>
<P> Journalists said existing publications remained subject to informal but specific government warnings on a weekly basis. Members of an independent journalists' group, AJI, have been arrested, harried underground and forced out of their jobs. </P>
<P> Few expect any sudden change after Wednesday's ruling. </P>
<P> ``Only when they are free again, and free to publish, will the world be convinced by Indonesia's aspiration s to regional leadership,'' the British-based anti-censorship group Article 19 said of the continuing detention of three AJI journalists. </P>
<P> Diplomats and academics differ over reasons for the past year's assault on the press, although some said Suharto himself may not have wanted the crackdown to be so harsh. </P>
<P> Some said the court's move would work to his advantage by bolstering Indonesia's credibility overseas, dented by crackdowns on the media, labour and dissent. </P>
