<P>  Kuwait Tuesday distributed the first compensation it has received as a result of Iraq's 1990-91 occupation, passing on $1,397,500 to 303 people who suffered the death of a close relative or serious personal injury. </P>
<P> Officials said that, despite the limited amount, the payments had considerable symbolic importance because they reinforced the principle of compensation for acts of international aggression. </P>
<P> ``The death of loved ones and personal injuries cannot be compensated for by money, but nevertheless the obligation of the aggressor to pay monetary compensation for the damage he caused should become an established deterrent rule between nations,'' an official statement said. </P>
<P> Compensation officials began processing the U.N.-approved payments at a ceremony attended by Finance Minister Nasser al-Rodhan on the fourth anniversary of Iraq's invasion. </P>
<P> Kuwaiti individuals, firms and state agencies have so far lodged a total of $94 billion in claims with the Geneva-based U.N. Compensation Commission. Under ceasefire terms, Iraq must compensate all losses from its invasion and occupation. </P>
