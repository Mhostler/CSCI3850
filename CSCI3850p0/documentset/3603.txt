<P>  Two of India's most beautiful women, recently crowned Miss Universe and Miss World, are facing off in a battle for local markets between two U.S.-based cola giants, the Asian Age newspaper said Friday. </P>
<P> It said Coca-Cola had signed up Sushmita Sen, India's first Miss Universe, in an advertising campaign to promote the soft drink. </P>
<P> Coca-Cola had apparently been prompted to seek Sen's help to check a rival campaign by Pepsi-Cola, which already has a campaign featuring Aishwarya Rai, the current Miss World. </P>
<P> ``When Miss Rai won, so did Pepsi,'' the Asian Age said. </P>
