<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Cambodian troops have recovered the bullet-riddled bodies of 17 Thai forest workers killed last week by Khmer Rouge guerrillas in a Cambodian border area, officials said Monday. </P>
<P> Soldiers found 10 bodies late Sunday after recovering seven Saturday. Officials said about 20 workers were killed by the rebels in the jungle area. </P>
<P> The Thai logging firm employing the workers said 13 survivors of the shootings had arrived back in Thailand but they still had to account for three. </P>
<P> Sriko Bau Joom, 45, a wounded survivor of the massacre, told Reuters last week he and 32 other Thai workers were rounded up and shot by Khmer Rouge guerrillas after demands for a $200,000 ransom were not met. </P>
<P> The killings took place in Chaom Khsan district of Prear Vihear province about 25 miles from Thai border, he said. </P>
<P> The Khmer Rouge has denied any involvement in the massacre. </P>
<P> The radical Khmer Rouge, responsible for the deaths of more than one million Cambodians during a reign of terror from 1975 to 1978, boycotted last year's U.N.-sponsored elections and has been waging a low-level key guerrilla war against the Cambodian government. </P>
