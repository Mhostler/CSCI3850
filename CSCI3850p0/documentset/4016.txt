<DATELINE>FEZ, Morocco (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Three men, two of them French nationals, were sentenced to death Saturday by a Moroccan court for ``acts of terrorism'' including an attack on a hotel last year in which two Spaniards were shot to death. </P>
<P> The three, Hamel Marzouk, Redouane Hammadi and Stephane Ait Idir, are all of Algerian origin. Marzouk and Ait Idir, a former fighter in Afghanistan, are French nationals. </P>
<P> They were among 17 men and one woman, all of Moroccan or Algerian origin, arrested after the attacks in 1993 and 1994 in the Moroccan cities of Fez, Marrakesh, Oujda and Casablanca, where a McDonalds restaurant was also attacked. </P>
<P> Another French national, Kamal Benakcha, was sentenced to life in prison along with two other accused. The woman, Naima Azil, was given a six-month suspended sentence and fined $55. </P>
<P> The charges included armed robbery, premeditated and attempted murder and creation of a criminal gang. </P>
<P> The death sentence is rarely carried out in Morocco. The last execution was in 1993 when a police commissioner was put to death for a series of rapes and murders in Casablanca. It was the first execution in 20 years. </P>
<P> The prosecution at the Fez criminal court had demanded the death penalty for six men during the trial, which opened on Jan. 10. The court sat for more than 12 hours to consider a verdict and a plea for clemency from French and Moroccan defense lawyers. </P>
<P> The other 11 accused men were sentenced to prison terms ranging from one year to 10 years. </P>
<P> Some of the men testified that they were given orders by a man they called the ``prince,'' now in prison in Germany and the subject of an extradition order. </P>
<P> Some of the men testified that they were lured to Morocco under false pretences while others said they received orders from a ringleader in Germany to smuggle weapons into Morocco, some of which they said were destined for neighboring Algeria. </P>
<P> Two of the men, Ait Idir, 22, and Hammadi, 24, said they were recruited in France by Abdelillah Zyad, alias Rachid, who is in prison in Germany, and another man they said was his deputy. </P>
<P> They said Rachid had taught them about Islam and led them to believe they would be going to fight for the Muslim cause in Bosnia. </P>
<P> Instead, they were sent to Morocco, where Rachid told them Muslims were oppressed. </P>
<P> ``I remember how Rachid used to tell us after our return from Afghanistan, of the misfortunes of Muslims in Palestine and Bosnia where children were dying and pregnant women were disemboweled. He said it was the same in Morocco but on a different level,'' Hammadi told the court in his testimony. </P>
<P> The defense lawyers argued that the men could not receive a fair trial because the alleged ringleader had not been heard. </P>
<P> Authorities describe the suspects as ``terrorists'' bent on destabilizing Morocco. Police seized dozens of guns, thousands of rounds of ammunition and other military gear in a mountain village house owned by the father of one of the wanted men. </P>
<P> Relations with neighboring Algeria, where the army-backed government is locked in battle with Muslim fundamentalists, suffered after Morocco accused Algerian security services of training the gunmen. </P>
<P> Algeria denied the charges and closed its border with Morocco after Rabat required Algerian citizens to obtain visas to enter Morocco. </P>
