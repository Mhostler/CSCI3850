<P>  Lord Bernard Delfont, the 84-year-old doyen of the Grade family which dominated postwar British entertainment, died Wednesday, his family said. </P>
<P> Delfont and his elder brother Lew Grade arrived in Britain just before the outbreak of World War I, the sons of Russian Jewish emigres Isaac and Olga Winogradsky. </P>
<P> Over most of this century, they created an entertainment dynasty which shaped cinema, commercial television and the theatre in Britain. Their nephew, Michael Grade, is currently head of Channel Four television. </P>
<P> A former Charleston dancer and theatrical agent, Delfont won his big break bringing the Folies Bergere revue from Paris to London and New York. In 1979 he branched into cinema and became chief executive of entertainment company EMI Ltd. </P>
<P> In 1983 he founded First Leisure Corporation in a management buyout from hotel group Trusthouse Forte. He floated it on the stock market a year later and the company has grown to include assets including the Blackpool Tower and London theatres. </P>
<P> He worked every day except Monday and insisted he had no hobbies. He believed that despite his great age he had much to offer his fellow company directors. </P>
<P> ``I can remind them that business is never always good, nor always bad because I have seen so many business cycles before,'' he said in a 1992 interview. </P>
<P> A First Leisure spokesman said Delfont had died suddenly after complaining of feeling breathless and dizzy. </P>
<P> He is survived by his wife and three children. </P>
