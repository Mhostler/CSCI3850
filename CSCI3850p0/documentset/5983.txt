<P>  U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali ``condemned energetically'' the government of Rwanda Monday for the weekend killing of thousands of Rwandans and offered assistance to the survivors. </P>
<P> He told a news conference his office in New York had issued a statement on the massacre, which he blamed on government forces, and added that the killings would do nothing to bring peace to the country. </P>
<P> ``I don't know what the decision of the Security Council will be but we are trying to offer the maximum of humanitarian assistance for the victims of this massacre which will certainly not help to obtain peace in this very poor country,'' he said. </P>
<P> Rwanda government forces rushed Monday to disperse displaced Hutus back to their homes after thousands were slaughtered at the weekend in the southwestern camp of Kibeho. </P>
<P> A controversy was raging over exactly how many Hutu men, women and children were shot, blown up by mortars, bayoneted or trampled to death when Tutsi soldiers of the Rwanda Patriotic Army opened fire at the camp Saturday. </P>
<P> The latest official U.N. estimate put the victims at 2,000 dead, lower than previous counts. </P>
<P> Boutros-Ghali was in Bandung for a meeting of 111-member Non-Aligned Movement. </P>
