<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Several thousand Venezuelan passengers were stranded at airports around the country Wednesday when authorities indefinitely suspended flights of the country's two leading domestic airlines. </P>
<P> Officials said the carriers, Avensa and Sivensa, were grounded due to an alleged $2.3 million debt with airport authorities. </P>
<P> The airlines responded that they did not owe any money and the authorities' action was illegal. </P>
<P> Angry passengers packed the Maiquetia International Airport outside Caracas, waiting in vain all day for flights within Venezuela and to other destinations in the Western Hemisphere, including Miami. </P>
<P> But the airport's director general, Domingo Uzcategui, said planes would only be allowed to leave if the companies pay costs up front for each flight. </P>
