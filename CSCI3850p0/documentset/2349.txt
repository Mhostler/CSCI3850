<P>  Roy Lichtenstein's ``I... I'm Sorry'' went to an American collector for $2,477,500, fetching the highest price Tuesday night at Sotheby's contemporary art auction. </P>
<P> The face of a pretty blonde with a tear falling from her eye is considered a summation of Lichtenstein's cartoon paintings and had an estimated sale price of $2 million. </P>
<P> The auction of 66 works started off strong but then almost came to a standstill during the sale's second half with most works barely making their lowest estimates. </P>
<P> Twenty-five percent of the works did not sell at all. </P>
<P> Both Christie's and Sotheby's lowered their sales' goals this fall by one-third because of disappointing auctions last May. The market has been in a slump since the late 1980s. </P>
<P> But Sotheby's did not even reach its more modest expectations. The grand total of the Tuesday auction had been estimated at $13.8 million to $19 million but the final total reached $12,150,550. </P>
<P> Among the evening's few high points were seven bidders contending for Andy Warhol's ``Let Us Now Praise Famous Men,'' which finally sold for $1,058,500, the second highest sale Tuesday. </P>
<P> Ellsworth Kelly's four striking panels, entitled, ``Green, Red, Yellow, Blue,'' brought in $805,500. </P>
<P> American collector Eli Broad bought Lichtenstein's ``I... I'm Sorry'' for $2,477,500. </P>
<P> ``It was an incredible night for Pop Art and for Warhol,'' said Sotheby's New York director Anthony Grant.'' This is a connoisseur's painting and a lot of people got a buzz about it. I expect a Warhol renaissance.'' </P>
<P> A crowded gallery geared for more excitement when two Willem de Koonings, ``Monumental Woman'' and an untitled oil and pastel on paper, were sold for twice their estimates, $695,500 and $596,500 respectively, making their way into the top 10 sellers. </P>
<P> Grant conceded that competition is tough for living artists, such as Susan Rothenberg and James Rosenquist, whose paintings attracted little interest Tuesday night. </P>
<P> ``Collectors are very selective now,'' said Grant, ``They wait for certain works by these artists.'' </P>
<P> Most of the buyers for the top 10 works were private American collectors or dealers. An Asian dealer bought the de Kooning ``Monumental Woman'' and a European collector purchased Claes Oldenburg's sculpture, ``Soft Light Switches: Ghost Version'' for $387,588. </P>
<P> In spite of the auction's lackluster close, Sotheby's officials were beaming after the sale. </P>
<P> ``I'm thrilled about the results,'' said Grant. ``Everything happened the way we thought it would happen. We had peaks and valleys. </P>
<P> ``But we have to do more editing. We don't want very long valleys.'' </P>
