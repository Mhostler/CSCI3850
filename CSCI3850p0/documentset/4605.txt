<P>  Almost 36 hours after two burglary suspects disappeared into the air conditioning system of a Sears department store, police said Monday they had given up searching the warren of ducts. </P>
<P> ``We'll wait a few days and see if we smell anything,'' said Sgt. Steve Jones, spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department, after describing a round-the-clock stakeout and search for the two men suspected of a ``smash-and-grab'' robbery of a Sears store at an Orlando mall. </P>
<P> Police played a cat-and-mouse game with the suspects starting before dawn Sunday, when deputies were staking out the department store. There have been a series of burglaries at area retailers. </P>
<P> Deputies spotted three men after noticing the store's glass door had been smashed. They captured one who had exited after he ran back inside. </P>
<P> But the other two got away, making their way into the warren of air conditioning ducts above the ceiling and eluding police for a day and a half. </P>
<P> Jones said the men might have escaped somehow from the sprawling two-story business. But otherwise, he said, they would have to come down at some point. ``It's like Chicken Little. We'll wait and see what falls through the ceiling,'' Jones said. </P>
