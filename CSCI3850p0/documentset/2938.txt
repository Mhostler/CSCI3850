<P>  Japan hanged a 44-year-old man Thursday in the country's first execution in a year, the daily Yomiuri Shimbun reported. </P>
<P> Yukio Ajima, 44, convicted of the triple murder of his girlfriend, sister and aunt, was hanged at Tokyo Prison, the Yomiuri said. </P>
<P> Ajima had been on death row since 1985 for stabbing the three after his 23-year-old girlfriend turned down his marriage proposal. </P>
<P> Justice Ministry officials, under standing execution rules, refused to confirm or deny the report. </P>
<P> Japan's last executions were in November 1993 when four people were hanged. There had been a four year hiatus in executions until their death, raising hopes among human rights groups that the end was in sight for capital punishment. </P>
<P> The report on Ajima's death comes just after the government issued the results of a poll saying three out of four Japanese supported capital punishment. </P>
<P> According to a Prime Minister's Office poll released last Saturday, 73.8 percent of the 3,000 surveyed adults said they felt the death penalty should stay, saying lighter punishments could cause a rise in violent crimes. </P>
<P> ``We fear that his execution was politically timed to express the Justice Ministry's will to continue carrying out capital punishment disregarding the growing controversy,'' Amnesty International spokesman Makoto Iwai said. </P>
