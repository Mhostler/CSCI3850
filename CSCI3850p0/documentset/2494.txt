<P>  Wall Street stocks are likely to stage a short-term rally on dramatic Republican victories in the U.S. mid-term elections, but the outlook for more lasting gains is uncertain, analysts said late Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``The markets probably will welcome the fact that there are Republicans who are likely to move policy in Washington in a less interventionist direction,'' said Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs International. </P>
<P> ``The liberal agenda is certainly dead as far as I can see,'' said Michael Metz of Oppenheimer & Co. </P>
<P> ``It's been a dramatic rejection of much of what the Democrats, particularly the Clinton Democrats stand for,'' said Robert Stovall of Stovall/Twenty-First Advisers. ``It will probably energize the markets for a few days anyway, maybe through Friday,'' he said. </P>
<P> The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 22 points to 3831 Tuesday in what some traders called a ``Republican rally.'' </P>
<P> But Stovall and other analysts noted stocks and bonds have been taking their cues lately from Federal Reserve policy. Five hikes in short-term interest rates since the beginning of February have stalled the stock market in its tracks. </P>
<P> Traders and analysts almost without exception expect a sixth increase when the Federal Reserve's policy-setting group meets Nov. 15. The only debate is whether the increase will be half a percentage point, three-quarter percentage point or even a full point. </P>
<P> Albert Soria, first vice president and foreign exchange trader at Kansallis-Osake-Pankki in New York, said the strong Republican gains may encourage the Fed to go ahead with an increase in rates that is on the high end of the expectation. He said the Fed may be emboldened by a message from voters they they have had enough of free-spending policies. </P>
<P> Hormats said the strong Republican gains could be followed by a process of reconciliation between the Republicans and the Democrats or they could lead to political confrontation which would probably be bad for financial markets. </P>
<P> He noted that President Clinton may be prompted to move toward the political center only to find that many moderates have left the Congress and new members occup the extreme positions. ``That could lead not just to gridlock but to confrontation,'' he said. </P>
<P> Analysts said while the stock market may be buoyant for a few days it is hard to pick out any specific stocks or groups of stocks likely to make sharp gains on the election results. </P>
<P> ``The health care stocks have already realized some months ago that nothing (in health care reform) was going to happen,'' said Oppenheimer's Metz. He said they could face a slight further rebound but that also reflects the fact the group has been adjusting to new dynamics in the health care field that are independent of anything being done in Washington. </P>
<P> Brett Discher, a trader with Dain Bosworth in Minneapolis, noted that gambling issues rallied Tuesday in anticipation voters in several states would approve measures legalizing gambling or liberalizing existing programs. However Florida voters turned down legalized gambling. </P>
<P> But Discher said the stock market overall would probably rally on the strong Republican win. ``I think you will see some follow-through,'' he said. ``The markets have been looking for a reason to go up.'' </P>
<P> Oppenheimer's Metz said the Republican gains could lead to a stepped up investigation of the Whitewater affair, bringing continued hearings and revelations. </P>
<P> A currency trader at a major bank in New York noted that the foreign exchange markets were calm in the initial reaction to the election results. </P>
