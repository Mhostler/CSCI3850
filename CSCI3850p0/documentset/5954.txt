<DATELINE>KAMPALA, Uganda (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Ugandan troops sealed off the residence of a senior Sudanese diplomat in Kampala after he refused to hand over a cache of weapons, including mines, rifles and ammunition, officials said Sunday. </P>
<P> They said about 50 soldiers had surrounded the residence of Hayder El-Hadi Omer, the Sudanese military attache, one of 14 Sudanese diplomats ordered to leave the country last week. </P>
<P> Sudan protested against what it called a flagrant violation of the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations. A Sudanese foreign ministry statement also charged that Sudan's diplomats in Uganda had been shot at and beaten up. </P>
<P> A colonel in Ugandan military intelligence said recently that the sophisticated new weapons being used by Ugandan hardline Christian rebels have been provided by Khartoum. </P>
<P> A Ugandan military spokesman told Reuters the attache's residence was cordoned off Friday night after he ignored an order to surrender the cache, which included military uniforms. </P>
<P> ``We have surrounded the residence at Nakasero (a residential suburb) to pressure him to hand over the weapons. We shall stay until he complies,'' the official said. </P>
<P> The official said the army had positioned two armored personnel carriers and several other heavily-armed vehicles at the residence. </P>
<P> Sudan-Uganda relations have deteriorated in recent weeks. Uganda accuses Sudanese diplomats in Kampala of helping rebels in northern Uganda, while Khartoum says Uganda supports the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), which has been fighting Khartoum forces since 1983. </P>
<P> The military attache, a lieutenant-colonel in the Sudanese army, was among diplomats given two weeks to leave the country last Friday, when Uganda told Sudan to cut its mission to the same size as Uganda's in Sudan. </P>
<P> A foreign ministry statement said not more than five diplomats would be allowed to remain at the embassy. Uganda's mission in Khartoum at present is manned by three diplomats. </P>
<P> Sudanese ambassador to Uganda Einayet Abdel Hameed Mohammed said Saturday the expulsion would make it more difficult to end suspicion between the two countries. </P>
<P> Uganda says Sudanese aircraft bombed northern Uganda border areas in January. Sudan said any bombs that hit Uganda were dropped by accident and were aimed at rebel positions in south Sudan. </P>
<P> Late last year Kampala ordered Sudanese military observers then based in northern Uganda to leave the area. </P>
<P> Heavily-armed Ugandan rebels of the fundamentalist Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), based on the border with Sudan, slaughtered 82 civilians abducted on a rampage through northern Uganda, a Ugandan military officer said Saturday. </P>
<P> The LRA wants Uganda to be ruled strictly by the tenets of the Bible's Ten Commandments. </P>
<P> For years its fighters were ill-equipped, advancing into battle covered with nut oil they thought would turn bullets to water or throwing bottles they said would explode like grenades. </P>
