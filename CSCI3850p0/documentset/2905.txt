<P>  Russian scientists are working on secret Sino-Russian nuclear projects in south China, Hong Kong's Eastern Express newspaper reported Wednesday. </P>
<P> The newspaper said officials of both sides had confirmed the existence of the projects in Haikou and Shenzhen. </P>
<P> It said the deals were struck during a covert trip to China earlier this month by the minister and vice minister in charge of Russia's nuclear industry. </P>
<P> A $10-million joint venture, the China-Russia Nuclear Company. has been established in Shenzhen just across the border from Hong Kong by the two countries' nuclear industry monopolies, the newspaper reported. </P>
<P> Russia's first deputy minister of Nuclear Power Engineering, Vitaly Konovalov, was in Shenzhen last weekend. He was accompanying his minister Viktor Mikhailov in China on what the Russian embassy in Beijing called a private visit, the paper said. </P>
<P> It quoted Kong Fandai, president of the joint company, as saying three Russian scientists were already working for the firm in Shenzhen. </P>
<P> ``Once we enter production in late 1995, we will continually bring in more and more of their scientists because this is Russia's strong point,'' Kong said. </P>
<P> International concern has been rising over the export of nuclear technology from Russia since the disintegration of the Soviet bloc. </P>
<P> The paper said details on the projects were hazy, but quoted Mikhailov as saying that ``super clean'' isotopes imported from Russia for civilian use was one area of the deal. </P>
