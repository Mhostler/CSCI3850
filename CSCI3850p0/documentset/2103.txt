<P>  A drowning giant panda was rescued by villagers from a river in China's southwest Sichuan province and has been named after its rescuers, the Xinhua news agency said Wednesday. </P>
<P> Woodcutters jumped into the Dadu River and pulled the panda to the bank using ropes and poles after sighting a floating ``stump-like thing,'' that turned out to be a panda struggling in the water, the agency said. </P>
<P> They then warmed up the animal with their own clothes. </P>
<P> The female panda has been named ``Lulu'' to honor its rescuers, who are residents of Luding County, the agency said. </P>
<P> The panda is on its way to a new home, the provincial Chengdu Zoo. </P>
<P> The incident happened Oct. 3, Xinhua said. </P>
<P> Logging, poaching and other incursions into wilderness areas have left only 1,000 giant pandas alive in the wild. </P>
<P> Through captive breeding, China has reversed a decline in the giant panda population that had threatened their survival, but the majority of the animals now live in captivity. </P>
