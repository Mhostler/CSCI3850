<P>  A controversial bill allowing poor elderly parents in Singapore to sue their children for support moved closer to law Wednesday. </P>
<P> Parliament forwarded the bill to a seven-member committee which will fine-tune it. </P>
<P> The Maintenance of Parents Bill, proposed by academic and nominated member of parliament Walter Woon, has provoked opposition, with people calling it unwarranted and un-Asian. </P>
<P> But Woon and other supporters say it is aimed only at those few children who can afford to take care of their parents but refuse. </P>
<P> One opponent, Lew Syn Pau, told parliament: ``The few bad hats who neglect their parents for whatever reason do not justify the introduction of such a law. It is like using a sledgehammer to kill a fly. </P>
<P> ``Many of us would not even think of suing our doctors, dentists or teachers, even if they do a bad job, let alone our children. Having to sue our children is an indictment of ourselves, that we brought them up badly in the first place.'' </P>
<P> Most ruling party members supported moving the bill forward, including Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew and Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. </P>
<P> Woon told parliament the bill was meant to complement rather than replace moral education. ``We are fooling ourselves if we think we have a perfect Confucian society where all children look after their parents.'' </P>
