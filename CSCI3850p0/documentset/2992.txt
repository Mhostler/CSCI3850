<P>  Survivors from the doomed liner Achille Lauro said Sunday they owed their lives to its cruise director and her staff, who calmly shepherded passengers into groups to evacuate the blazing ship. </P>
<P> Tour guides Renate Strumberger and Elfi Hettwer said Nadia Eckhard, the South African cruise director, was the heroine of the disaster. </P>
<P> ``Nadia and her team, both South Africans and Britons, whose job really was to organize entertainment and everyday life for the passengers, is the real heroine of the fire,'' said Hettwer. </P>
<P> ``They organized the passengers into nationality groups so everyone would understand orders in their own language and they're the ones who really handled the evacuation,'' said Hettwer, who is from Bamberg, Germany. </P>
<P> Survivors lined the decks of the U.S. Navy cruiser Gettysburg as it brought them to safety in the Red Sea port of Djibouti Sunday. Many wore civilian clothing donated by the crew or parts of U.S. Navy uniforms from the ship's stores. </P>
<P> Strumberger, a 27-year-old from Kaernten, Austria, was still guiding them -- wearing a Detroit Pistons basketball team sweatshirt donated by the crew. </P>
<P> Among her wards was the widow of Gerhard Szimke, 67, of Berlin, who died of a heart attack during the initial hours of the blaze and whose body was still aboard the Achillo Lauro when it sank in the Indian Ocean Friday. </P>
<P> ``Everyone has been very protective of Mrs. Szemkey. It's very sad, because they had no children and now she's suddenly all alone,'' Strumberger said. </P>
<P> A Briton also died when he was struck on the head as he boarded a lifeboat. </P>
<P> While some French, Italians and Swiss were aboard the Gettysburg, about 130 of the 165 survivors were German, mostly members of the same tour group. </P>
<P> Nearly 1,000 passengers and crew abandoned the Achille Lauro Wednesday after a fire broke out in the engine room and they were transferred to 10 rescue ships off the coast of Somalia. The blue-hulled liner sank after a final explosion ripped through its bows at dusk Friday. </P>
<P> Other rescue ships were bringing survivors to the Kenyan port of Mombasa Sunday. </P>
<P> Those aboard the Gettysburg praised the generosity of its crew when they spoke to reporters who arrived on a French military helicopter while the missile-launching cruiser was still at sea. </P>
<P> ``The crew were absolutely marvelous,'' said British-born Allison Panne, from Maidenhead, England, who was aboard the Achille Lauro with her Italian husband, Luigi, and their children Andrew, seven, and Alexander, three. They live in Sorrento, Italy. </P>
<P> Alexander celebrated his seventh birthday aboard the Gettysburg Saturday and was showered with gifts by the crew. </P>
<P> ``It was great. I got some computer games and a big cake,'' said Alexander, who was wearing a baseball cap with the name Gettysburg on it. </P>
<P> The arrival of the survivors aboard the Gettysburg was also a shock to its crew, who were on a six-month mission from their base near Jacksonville, Fla. </P>
<P> ``When we saw the Achille Lauro on fire at sea, it was like a nightmare on earth,'' said Petty Officer Lewis Mullins, 28, of Detroit, Mich. </P>
<P> Cook Robert Butts, 27, of Nashville, Tenn., said: ``This was all a blessing to us, to be able to help. Many of us pine away for our families and small children back home, and helping these people who have lost their clothing and money really puts everything into perspective. Our own troubles don't seem so bad after all.'' </P>
