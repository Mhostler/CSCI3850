<P>  Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic Monday poured cold water on hopes Belgrade might recognize Bosnia and Croatia's independence soon. </P>
<P> ``Our stand was established three years ago -- we are open to recognition of former Yugoslav republics as independent states when conditions for that are met,'' the official Tanjug news agency quoted him as saying at a news conference with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen in Belgrade. </P>
<P> ``We do not wish to repeat the mistake the European Community and then others in the international community made by prematurely recognizing the former Yugoslav republics. That was not wise,'' he said. </P>
<P> Belgrade argues recognition can happen only when conflicts in Bosnia and Croatia involving Serb minorities are settled. </P>
<P> Officials from the so-called Contact Group -- Britain, France, Germany, Russia and the United States -- are due in Belgrade Tuesday to offer Yugoslavia some relief from trade sanctions in a fresh bid to restart the stalled peace process. </P>
