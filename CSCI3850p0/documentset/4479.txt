<P>  An Arab-Israeli meeting in Amman on Palestinian refugees has been postponed, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Wednesday. </P>
<P> The meeting, at the level of foreign ministers, was meant to take place next Sunday between Israel, Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinians. Moussa gave no reason for the postponement and did not say if they had set a new date. </P>
<P> The meeting would discuss the fate of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank during the Middle East war of 1967. </P>
<P> In the agreement it signed with the PLO in 1993, Israel said it was willing to discuss letting 1967 refugees back but it has given no promises on numbers or on the timing. </P>
<P> Palestinians say the fate of at least 800,000 Palestinians is at stake and that Israel is expected to eventually let back any who wanted to enter the Palestinian self-rule areas. </P>
<P> The negotiations do not cover Palestinians who left what is now Israel during the Arab-Israeli war of 1948. </P>
