<DATELINE>TEHRAN, Iran (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said Friday the United States was mostly hurting itself by trying to isolate Tehran. </P>
<P> In a sermon at a mass Friday prayer meeting, broadcast on Tehran radio, Rafsanjani said the United States was ``acting in a retaliatory and irrational way on Iranian questions because of two or three serious defeats America has suffered.'' </P>
<P> He said Washington's decision in March to block a $1 billion oil deal between Conoco Inc and Iran only hurt the U.S. firm as several non-U.S. companies were willing to cooperate with Tehran. </P>
<P> ``American politicians are acting so much out of grudge that they are cutting their own economic veins,'' Rafsanjani added. </P>
<P> He told the crowd that U.S. pressure on Germany, Japan, France and other states had mostly failed. ``These (countries) did not yield to America and went their own way.'' </P>
<P> But Rafsanjani admitted that the United States had succeeded in getting Japan to delay the payment of a loan to Iran, but Tehran was willing to accept some defeats for the sake of principles. </P>
<P> His remark triggered the traditional ``Death to America'' chant from the crowd that had gathered at Tehran University. </P>
<P> In Washington, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Thursday Japan withheld the loan payment because of U.S. efforts. </P>
<P> ``Now, that happens...because we've been trying to show the rest of the world that Iran is in a category almost all by itself in what they're doing to undermine the (Middle East) peace process and projecting terrorism around the world. So what we do has a real effect,'' Christopher added. </P>
<P> Rafsanjani reminded the faithful that Russia had refused to end its nuclear cooperation with Iran despite U.S. pressure, reiterating that the program was strictly peaceful. </P>
<P> ``Feeling these defeats, U.S. politicians are acting irrationally. They are lying right out,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``It is shameful for the defense minister of a superpower such as America to lie and say that Iran is storing chemical weapons on islands in the Persian Gulf,'' he added in reference to remarks by Defense Secretary William Perry on a recent Gulf tour. </P>
<P> ``This behavior is undignified of a superpower that should have control over its nerves and find the roots of its defeats,'' said Rafsanjani. </P>
