<DATELINE>HYANNISPORT, Mass.(Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Rose Kennedy, the matriarch of America's most famous political family, lost two sons to assassins' bullets but never allowed herself to cry in public. </P>
<P> She died Sunday at the age of 104, surrounded by family at her home in Hyannisport. </P>
<P> In a long life of triumphs and tragedies, she always showed the grace and courage under pressure that is the hallmark of the Kennedys. </P>
<P> ``How you cope is important -- not the events themselves,'' she once said. </P>
<P> Four of Rose Kennedy's nine children died violently. Her eldest son, Joseph, was killed in World War Two; her daughter Kathleen died in a 1948 plane crash; President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas in 1963; and in 1968 Sen. Robert Kennedy was murdered in Los Angeles as he campaigned for president. </P>
<P> She did not weep at the funerals of John or Robert, though millions of Americans did so openly. Rose believed grief ought to be private -- something to be borne behind closed doors. </P>
<P> Her tragedies were not limited to the deaths of her children. Her eldest daughter, Rosemary, now in her seventies, was born mentally retarded and placed in an institution. For years Rose worked behind the scenes to help other parents of retarded children. It was her often-stated belief that ``God never sends us a cross that is too heavy for us to bear.'' </P>
<P> Her daughter-in-law, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, remembered Rose on one sad occasion taking her hand, squeezing it and saying: ``Nobody's ever going to feel sorry for me.'' </P>
<P> ``And I thought, 'God, what a thoroughbred,''' Onassis, who died of cancer in June 1994, recalled. </P>
<P> Described by John as the glue that held the family together, Rose lived out the last years of her life in a rambling, wooden Victorian house built by her husband, Joseph Sr, overlooking a bay in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. </P>
<P> A devout Catholic, in later years she became too frail after a series of strokes even to attend mass at the local church. Her only outings were being taken for walks in a wheelchair by family members. </P>
<P> Born Rose Fitzgerald on July 22, 1890, she was the descendant of Irish immigrants who fled the great hunger and settled in Boston, then a city polarised by new Irish immigrants and old-line Protestant families. </P>
<P> Her father John (Honey Fitz) Fitzgerald was a colourful politician who in 1906 was elected mayor of Boston. </P>
<P> Rose became known as the belle of Boston as she accompanied her father to public events. At his side she met many of the prominent figures of the day, including Presidents Grover Cleveland and William McKinley and the English tea merchant Sir Thomas Lipton, rumored to have been a suitors. </P>
<P> But the man she chose to marry in 1914 was an ambitious young Harvard-educated lawyer, Joseph Patrick Kennedy, who at 28 became the youngest bank president in the country. </P>
<P> While Joseph built the fortune that eventually fueled the political hopes of three of his sons -- John, Robert and Edward (Teddy) -- Rose busied herself with raising a family. </P>
<P> With her husband frequently away on business, Rose instilled in her children a sense of loyalty, purpose, intellectual curiousity, self-discipline and humor, later hailed across the country as the Kennedy style. </P>
<P> In her memoirs, ``Times to Remember'', she recalled: ``In my years as a mother of young children, Dr Freud was only a name and (child psychologist) Dr Spock was a boy.'' </P>
<P> ``She instilled in us the four most important things in our lives,'' her only surviving son, Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, said on her 100th birthday, which Rose was too frail to attend. ``Her love of family, her sense of history, her interest in politics and a commitment to serving others.'' </P>
<P> The simply written memoir made it seem that she turned the kitchen table into a miniature version of Congress, forcing her children to discuss the political issues of the day. </P>
<P> In 1937, after years spent raising her children, Rose Kennedy re-entered public life when her husband was appointed U.S. ambassador to Britain by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. </P>
<P> Rose worked tirelessly to build her son's political careers. In 1952 she held a series of tea parties for ladies to help John's tough battle against the popular Henry Cabot Lodge for a Massachusetts Senate seat. </P>
<P> ``It was those damn tea parties that beat me,'' Lodge said. </P>
<P> After the car accident at Chappaquiddick, Mass., in 1969 in which a young woman, Mary Jo Kopechne, died in a car driven by her son Edward, Rose insisted that he run for re-election despite the controversy. </P>
<P> At the age of 80, Rose vowed that if Edward wanted to run for president she would campaign for him. And in 1980 when she was 90, she campaigned in wintry Iowa when Edward began an unsuccessful attempt to take the nomination from Jimmy Carter. </P>
<P> Rose Kennedy's later years were touched by scandal when actress Gloria Swanson claimed in her autobiography that she had a long affair with Joseph Kennedy Sr, who died in 1969. Rose skirted the issue, saying he was merely her manager. </P>
<P> A devout Catholic throughout her life, she was honored by the church, which made her a Papal Countess. She often turned to religion to help her through her tragedies, but she also said she would do anything to keep busy in times of stress. </P>
<P> She once wrote of her composure during Robert Kennedy's funeral: ``If I had broken down in grief I would only have added to the misery of others.'' </P>
