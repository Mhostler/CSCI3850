<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A top army general and two other soldiers were killed when a car bomb, believed to be the work of Basque separatists, rocked the heart of Madrid during rush hour Friday morning, officials said. </P>
<P> General Francisco Veguillas, director-general of defense policy, was passing in his armor-plated car when the bomb exploded in Plaza Ramales, just 200 yards from the Royal Palace. </P>
<P> Veguillas' bodyguard and driver were also killed and 14 people were injured in the blast, which ripped through the triangular square at 8.45 a.m. (2.45 a.m. EDT), shattering windows and engulfing parked cars in flames. </P>
<P> The force of the blast, composed of around 44 lbs of explosive, hurled one of the bodies onto a nearby balcony, witnesses said. </P>
<P> No one immediately claimed responsibility for the blast, but the Basque separatist group ETA has often targeted military officers in its 25-year armed campaign for an independent Basque state. </P>
<P> Local officials had little doubt who was behind the attack, with the ruling Socialists condemning the ``futile terrorism.'' </P>
<P> ``ETA assassins and those who support them are seeing their own members desert and are taking note of their isolation from the vast majority of the Basque people,'' a statement said. </P>
<P> ETA's last major attack in the capital took place just over a year ago when five soldiers and two civilians were killed in two separate car bombs in June. </P>
<P> They last struck June 1 when an army general was shot dead on his way to work, prompting fears ETA had managed to re-establish an active unit based in Madrid. </P>
<P> Another officer was killed by a bomb attached to his car May 23. </P>
<P> ``We are tired of cursing these assassins. They target that which is most sacred -- life itself,'' Madrid mayor Jose Maria Alvarez del Manzano said at the scene. </P>
<P> Friday's attack struck at the heart of the city's old section, close to the Puerto del Sol square -- a favorite meeting-place for both tourists and locals. </P>
<P> The area of maze-like, cobbled streets contains several historical buildings. One of the city's landmark churches, the Iglesia de Santiago, was damaged by the blast. </P>
<P> The injured included several members of the Spanish National Dance Company which is based in the Plaza Ramales, close to the headquarters of the old Royal Guard,. </P>
<P> ``There was an explosion and I threw myself to the ground. I then stayed on my knees, praying,'' one witness told Efe news agency. He said he saw a props van belonging to the dance company engulfed in flames. </P>
<P> Police were mounting a special operation to try and track down those responsible for the attack which coincides with one of summer's busiest traffic weekends as millions of people leave the capital at the start of traditional August vacation. </P>
<P> Road blocks were being set up on motorways leading out of the city and helicopters will also take part in the operation. </P>
