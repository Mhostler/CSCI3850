<P>  U.S. Coast Guard cutters Tuesday picked up hundreds more Haitian refugees attempting to flee their troubled homeland for asylum in the United States. </P>
<P> The Coast Guard said 658 Haitians on 20 boats had been picked up by early Tuesday afternoon, following a record 3,245 in 70 boats taken from the sea on Monday. </P>
<P> Monday was by far the busiest day in the 13 years the United States has been intercepting Haitian refugees at sea. The previous record was 1,635, set May 20, 1992. </P>
<P> The Coast Guard also said Tuesday that two refugees had drowned Monday as it attempted to rescue them and 205 others from a 40-foot sailboat. </P>
<P> The boat, overflowing with desperate refugees, was listing amid heavy waves and high winds about 10 miles off Haiti when sighted Monday afternoon by the Coast Guard Cutter Hamilton. </P>
<P> The refugees aboard were frantically trying to bail water from the sinking vessel when the Hamilton neared them, but the boat took on water so rapidly that it sank with 135 people still on board. </P>
<P> Two refugees drowned, and two among the 133 rescued had to be flown immediately to the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba for treatment. </P>
<P> Also on Monday, two observers reported that more than 150 Haitians drowned when a small boat overloaded with 200 refugees capsized about a mile off the Haitian coast. </P>
<P> Including Tuesday's interdictions, 14,904 Haitians have been picked up at sea in 1994, including 6,542 in July. </P>
<P> A flood of 11,627 Haitian boat people has been picked up since June 16, when the United States began a more liberal policy of interviewing refugees on their asylum requests. </P>
<P> Before June 16 the United States repatriated Haitians picked up at sea without interviews. </P>
<P> More than 50,000 Haitians, most of them crammed onto flimsy and overloaded boats, have fled their homeland since democratically elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was overthrown in a bloody 1991 coup. </P>
