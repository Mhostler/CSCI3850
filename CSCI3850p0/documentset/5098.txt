<P>  Britain's Queen Elizabeth said Wednesday happy memories of her last visit to South Africa 48 years ago, before apartheid, were mixed with sadness at the length of the apartheid era. </P>
<P> ``But in 1995 we meet in a new South Africa which has rejoined the Commonwealth ... and is working hard to overcome the legacy of the years of apartheid and prejudice,'' said the queen, who celebrated her 21st birthday during the last royal tour. </P>
<P> The queen previously visited South Africa with her father King George VI in 1947, a year before the then pro-apartheid National Party came to power and began institutionalizing its policies of racial segregation. </P>
<P> At Port Elizabeth's Vista University, she was greeted by hundreds of cheering students gathered along the entry road to the university, where the lunch was being hosted by Eastern Cape Premier Raymond Mhlaba. </P>
<P> There was no sign of trouble at the university, where students of the Azanian Students Congress (AZASCO) have been boycotting classes for the last few weeks. </P>
<P> Just before the queen's arrival, police busily scrubbed away anti-monarchist slogans that read ``To hell with the colonial queen. Viva AZASCO'' from the university entrance. </P>
