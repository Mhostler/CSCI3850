<P>  During a youthful, wild ride around South America on a motorcycle, revolutionary Che Guevara seduced the wife of a good friend and was responsible for a house burning down, according to a recently discovered diary. </P>
<P> ``The Motorcycle Diaries'' which go on sale in the United States and Britain in May, were kept secret for years because ''it doesn't exactly reflect a very politically correct Che,'' publisher Colin Robinson told Publisher's Weekly editor Maureen O'Brien in this week's edition of the magazine. </P>
<P> The magazine said the diary, written by the Latin American revolutionary leader when he was 23, was originally published in Italy, where it sold more than 300,000 copies. </P>
<P> ``In the diaries, you can see him playing with the basic ideas of justice, inequality and freedom, but you also see him as a young tearaway,'' Robinson is quoted as saying of Guevara, who fought with Cuban leader Fidel Castro and was killed by security forces in 1967 in Bolivia. </P>
<P> ``During that year on the road, he falls in and out of love, drinks a ton of red wine, seduces the wife of a good friend and, during a brief stint as a fireman, oversleeps and a house burns down as a result,'' said Robinson, managing director of publisher Verso. </P>
<P> Booksellers who stock the diaries will be given T-shirts and store posters bearing a rare picture of Guevara wearing his trademark black beret while biting into ice cream. </P>
