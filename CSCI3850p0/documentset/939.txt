<P>  The flow of Cubans from their Communist-ruled homeland to the waters off Florida continued Monday despite the U.S. decision to turn the refugees away. </P>
<P> Coast Guard officials said 900 Cubans had been picked up by early afternoon, most from makeshift, unseaworthy rafts made from inner tubes and wood. </P>
<P> Another 1,293 were rescued Sunday, the highest one-day total since the Mariel Boatlift in 1980 when 125,000 Cubans reached southern Florida over several months. </P>
<P> Including Monday's 900, the Coast Guard said it has rescued 6,418 Cubans in August, and 11,449 in all of 1994. </P>
<P> In a typical incident, two brothers picked up over the weekend had spent several days at sea on a raft made of tree limbs lashed to several inner tubes. Without storage for water or food, or any shelter from the tropical sun, the two were dazed and exhausted when the Coast Guard reached them. </P>
<P> Coast Guard officials have said they are concerned about the number of Cubans who likely perish trying to make the 90-mile crossing to Florida, but they have no way of telling how many actually die at sea. </P>
<P> Empty, overturned boats and rafts are a common sight in the Florida Straits. </P>
<P> Earlier in the day, Defense Secretary William Perry urged Cubans not to take to the sea. ``It's a very dangerous operation,'' he told a news conference in Key West, Florida. </P>
<P> Since late last week, the United States has changed its policy for Cubans so rafters picked up at sea now are taken to the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay on Cuba rather than being released to friends and relatives. </P>
<P> Those who make it to Florida are being held at a detention center near Miami. </P>
<P> Perry said that 25 ships -- 19 Coast Guard cutters and six Navy ships -- were already working on the Cuban rescue effort. He said three more Navy ships were due to arrive in the next 24 to 48 hours. </P>
