<P>  The leaders of the powerful Cali drug cartel denied Monday that they used death threats to chase away reporters who were in their Colombian hometown to cover their flight from justice. </P>
<P> Brothers Miguel and Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela, who allegedly control most of the world's cocaine trade, sent a letter to a local newspaper rejecting charges that their cartel had threatened reporters who were covering a search for them by a special army and police team. </P>
<P> ``There is nothing more false or biased than such a statement,'' said the letter, addressed to the Bogota daily El Espectador. ``We have always believed that an anonymous threat is a coward's weapon.'' </P>
<P> The daily reported Sunday that newspaper and television reporters were forced to leave the southwestern city of Cali with their families after receiving numerous death threats. </P>
<P> It said six reporters received messages on their beepers and telephone answering machines saying: ``We're tired of so much scandal. Now the color will be red.'' Another threat reportedly said: ``Be careful. We're going to give it to you.'' </P>
<P> But the brothers say that isn't their style. </P>
<P> ``No matter how grave the offence, slander or lie ... it would never bring us to threaten ... even the most humble of journalists,'' read the letter, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters. ``We firmly believe in judicial tribunals as the only valid way to settle differences no matter how great.'' </P>
<P> Richard Freddy Munoz, who works for the nightly television news program QAP, told Reuters Monday he had brought his wife and three children to Bogota seeking police protection. </P>
<P> Miguel Angel Arango resigned as editor of El Caleno in Cali after receiving similar threats, the paper said. </P>
