<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Stars & Stripes, beneficiary of a series of rules changes at the America's Cup, invoked two rules -- one real, the other facetious -- as grounds for hope in its current dire straits. </P>
<P> After losing the first three races of the best-of-nine series decisively, the Americans on Tuesday admitted Team New Zealand had a faster boat in Black Magic I than the Young America yacht they borrowed from defeated defender rival PACT 95, thanks to a novel rules interpretation. </P>
<P> A reporter at the news conference after Race 3 said that at the risk of asking a silly question -- Stars & Stripes tactician Tom Whidden graciously interjected there was ``no such thing in this game'' -- he would like to ask the Americans whether there was now a danger of the America's Cup leaving San Diego. </P>
<P> ``That IS a silly question,'' Stars & Stripes helmsman Paul Cayard said off-microphone with a laugh. </P>
<P> Said Whidden: ``Actually, what I would say is that I think the two big improvements they made in the rules this time is that there are nine races instead of seven, so that'll work to our advantage a little bit, and the second rule where you swap boats every third race.'' </P>
<P> That brought gales of laughter, but Team New Zealand helmsman Russell Coutts, often a bit stiff in press conferences, had the last laugh. </P>
<P> ``Don't you think you guys have swapped boats enough?'' Coutts asked. </P>
