<DATELINE>PRETORIA, South Africa (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  South African President Nelson Mandela Friday dismissed speculation he had been ill during a two-week holiday in Saudi Arabia. </P>
<P> ``I have never been in better physical condition,'' he told reporters at Waterkloof air force base near Pretoria on arrival from the Gulf. </P>
<P> Referring to reports that he had been to a hospital in Saudi Arabia for tests because of prostate trouble, Mandela said he believed the rumors were deliberately orchestrated by ``people who derive some personal benefit knowing there would be a fall in the stock exchange.'' </P>
<P> South Africa's financial rand fell almost six cents on the dollar on the reports Tuesday before making a mild recovery after the rumors were officially denied. </P>
<P> Mandela said he visited a Saudi Arabian hospital to look at progress in research. </P>
<P> Referring to an operation in 1991 where he had a benign cyst removed from his bladder, Mandela said he has had regular blood tests since then. </P>
<P> ``There is no basis whatsoever for these allegations,'' he said. </P>
<P> Mandela, 76, had an operation for cataracts in July. Officials have expressed concern over his heavy workload, and a senior aide said last week his schedule would be cut back. </P>
<P> Asked what he did during his holiday besides visiting the hospital, Mandela said he had been invited by Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah to several lunches and dinners at the chambers of commerce in Riyadh and Jeddah. </P>
