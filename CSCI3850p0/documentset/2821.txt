<DATELINE>TOKYO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Sony Corp had dismal news for the second time this month when it announced Friday that its legendary chairman Akio Morita was stepping down nearly a year after a stroke laid him low. </P>
<P> The feisty Morita had disappeared from public view after he was struck by a cerebral hemorrhage Nov. 30 last year, confining him to a wheelchair and making him incapable of carrying out his duties. </P>
<P> Sony's board accepted his resignation Friday morning, after the 73-year-old chairman asked to step down Wednesday last week -- one day before Sony announced a $2.67 billion write-off linked with its 1989 purchase of Columbia Pictures. </P>
<P> Analysts said the timing of Morita's decision to quit could have been linked to the write-off. </P>
<P> This had helped plunge the group's half-year pretax profit 279.96 billion yen ($2.82 billion) into the red. </P>
<P> It also confirmed what many said when Sony bought Columbia -- that at $3.4 billion, it had paid way over the odds to get into Hollywood, in a vague hope that a magical ``synergy'' between electronic hardware and movies would make the movie company far more valuable than it appeared. </P>
<P> Hurt by the write-off, Sony's shares fell for four trading days in a row on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. They lost 13.4 percent of their value until Thursday but then rose Friday on a technical correction to end 130 yen up at 5,160. </P>
<P> Sony executives were quick to deny any connection between the two events Friday, saying Morita's decision was prompted by concern about how the company would appear overseas, with a chairman unable to perform his duties for so long. </P>
<P> It had nothing to do with the financial news, Managing Director Nobuyuki Idei told a news conference. </P>
<P> ``I expect there will be that kind of interpretation, but it has nothing to do with this,'' he said. ``It's a completely different subject.'' </P>
<P> The position of chairman -- traditionally more of a ceremonial post in Japan than in America and Europe -- will be left unoccupied, while Morita will support President Norio Ohga as the ``founder and honorary chairman.'' </P>
<P> Morita is one of Japan's best-known and outspoken businessmen, feared in business circles for his sharp tongue. </P>
<P> He used this in the 1980s to berate managers in America and Europe for their obsession with short-term profits, and in the 1990s to chide those in his own country for their rigidity and unwillingness to open up to the outside world. </P>
<P> But the public will remember him more for his role in giving birth to the Walkman portable stereo, and bringing a host of other electronics products -- from the first Japanese tape recorder to the compact disc -- within the grasp of ordinary consumers. </P>
<P> His flamboyant career ground to an abrupt halt when he suffered a cerebral hemorrhage that required surgery and left him nearly paralysed on his left side. </P>
<P> His departure comes after nearly a year of taking no part in Sony's business, and so is unlikely to have any immediate effect on the company's operations. </P>
<P> But analysts said the decision to leave the chairman's post vacant might indicate rumbles at the top concerning the recent massive write-off -- it was president Ohga who masterminded the Columbia purchase. </P>
<P> ``Ohga still seems pretty much in control but maybe the feeling is that things have gone so badly that he's about to lose day-to-day control,'' said Barry Dargan of S.G. Warburg's Tokyo office. </P>
<P> Even before his illness, age had meant Morita was more a father figure than a manager in his later years at Sony. </P>
<P> These coincided with the end of Sony's golden age, when time and again it trumped rivals and wowed consumers around the world with a string of hit products. </P>
<P> But these dried up after the compact disc and camcorder in the 1980s, and the company began its foray into Hollywood. </P>
<P> ``These don't show the management in a particularly good light,'' said David Benda, senior analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities' Japan branch. </P>
<P> ``The timing may be intended as a signal that new management is in order -- it could be meant as an example.'' </P>
