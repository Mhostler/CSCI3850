<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The blast that devastated a U.S. government office building in Oklahoma City triggered stepped-up security at federal facilities nationwide Wednesday. </P>
<P> White House spokesman Michael McCurry said a number of federal buildings around the country had received threats after the blast, which law enforcement attributed to a bomb of up to 1,200 pounds hidden in a car. </P>
<P> ``We have directed that federal buildings take any necessary precautions ...,'' McCurry said. </P>
<P> Phoned-in bomb threats forced temporary evacuations of federal office buildings in several cities, including Boston, Miami, Santa Ana, Calif., Birmingham, Ala., Wilmington, Del., Portland, Ore., Boise, Idaho, and Carswell Air Force Base in Fort Worth, Texas. A bomb scare also forced the evacuation of Boston's City Hall. </P>
<P> White House security, already tight, was boosted, with more uniformed police in view and lunchbags and other objects subjected to X-ray scrutiny. At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, U.S. Capitol police heightened security around the Capitol and other congressional office buildings. </P>
<P> ``We are taking additional precautions in response to the bombing in Oklahoma City and we are monitoring developments in the course of the investigation into the incident,'' Sgt. Dan Nichols, a Capitol police spokesman, said. </P>
<P> Bomb-sniffing German shepherds and their handlers took up positions outside the downtown headquarters of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF). The Securities and Exchange Commission said it had put in place ``heightened security measures'' at its Washington headquarters. </P>
<P> Bobby Browning, an ATF spokesman in Atlanta, Ga., said ATF offices around the country had begun receiving threatening phone calls shortly after news of the Oklahoma City blast. </P>
<P> The explosion occurred on the second anniversary of the April 19, 1993, federal raid on the compound of the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas, about 275 miles south of Oklahoma City. At least 71 cult members died in a fire after the FBI tried to storm the building and end a 51-day standoff. </P>
<P> The Oklahoma blast was the biggest act of suspected terror in U.S. history, overtaking the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in New York which killed six and injured 1,000 others. </P>
<P> Stricter security was also reported in Denver and in Chicago, where guards at all city buildings were told to watch for suspicious activity. </P>
<P> The Central Intelligence Agency said it was working with law enforcement officials through established channels to determine if there was a foreign hand in the Oklahoma City blast. </P>
<P> ``We are definitely engaged in assisting the law enforcement authorities in looking for any signs of foreign involvement,'' David Christian, a CIA spokesman, said. </P>
<P> FBI officials said it was too soon to know if the attack was the work of guerrillas with political motives, leaving open the possibility that it was carried out by a disgruntled loner. </P>
<P> The blast at the nine-story Alfred Murrah federal office building in Oklahoma City killed at least 20, including 17 children, and injured more than 100. Officials expect the death count to climb much higher because there are many still missing. </P>
<P> The Federal Aviation Administration said it was in constant touch with the intelligence community, although no connection had been drawn between the Oklahoma blast and U.S. aviation. ''If there's a need, we can heighten (security measures) in a heartbeat,'' spokeswoman Liz Neblett said. </P>
<P> Five workers were unaccounted for at an office of the Defense Investigative Service which was damaged in the explosion, the Pentagon said. </P>
