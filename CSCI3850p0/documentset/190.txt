<P>  A judge in the Dominican Republic said Tuesday he is prepared to fly to the United States and bring court records to prove that he married pop superstar Michael Jackson to Elvis Presley's daughter, Lisa Marie, last May. </P>
<P> Civil Court Judge Hugo Alvarez Perez, reacting to denials from Jackson's spokesman that the marriage never took place, called such charges ``horrible lies.'' </P>
<P> ``It is a horrible lie to say now that there was no wedding. I can prove the authenticity and legality of that marriage,'' the judge, who presides over the civil court in the northern town of La Vega, said. </P>
<P> ``I am prepared to travel to the United States to take the records, with the permission of the pertinent Dominican authorities, so that an expert on the matter can verify that these are their signatures,'' he added. </P>
<P> Jackson's spokesman, Lee Solters, denied the report. He repeated the denial Tuesday. ``This is a recording. There was no marriage,'' he said, expressing his disapproval of being constantly asked about it. </P>
<P> But he said he did not know if Presley, 28, and Jackson, 35, knew each other or whether they traveled together to the Dominican Republic last May. </P>
<P> A spokesman for the Dominican Republic's Immigration Department told Reuters that both had entered the country that month. </P>
<P> Handwriting expert Charles Hamilton told Reuters that he was ``75 percent sure'' that the signature appearing on the alleged marriage certificate belongs to Michael Jackson. </P>
<P> Hamilton, who said he has examined over 30 Jackson signatures and is famed for exposing the ``Hitler Diairies'' as a forgery, added in a telephone interview with Reuters, ``My intuition tells me it's right, that it's okay. </P>
<P> ``The Jackson signature mimicks very well the characteristics of his handwriting. It's fluent, fluid and swift, without any of the ordinary characteristics of forgery. A forger's signature would show slow, deliberate strokes with splicing, and there's none of that in the document.'' </P>
<P> He added, ``The size is characteristic of Jackson's writing. Very large strokes. He's been known to fill an 8 by 10 inch page with his name.'' </P>
<P> Alvarez Perez noted that there is no reason to make up a ceremony of that nature and he indicated that the marriage was recorded under under number 188 on page 88 of Book 54 of civil weddings for 1994. A copy of the document was given to Reuters. </P>
<P> ``If Jackson wants to deny it, that's another matter,'' the judge said. </P>
<P> Alvarez Perez insisted that he has known one of the singer's attorneys for some time and that their first meeting occurred at the beginning of May at Santo Domingo's Hotel Embajador. </P>
<P> Originally, the wedding was planned for May 18, but it was postponed due to the country's electoral problems, he said. </P>
<P> ``On May 17, the attorney called me at home and told me that the wedding was going to be postponed because of the electoral problems that arose in the Dominican Republic.'' </P>
<P> He said that it was not until May 24 that the lawyer contacted him again. ``He told me that they would probably arrive at the La Romana (tourist complex) that same night.'' </P>
<P> Alvarez Perez spoke with Jackson's attorney the following day and the marriage took place on the 26th. </P>
<P> ``I had both their passports in my hands and those documents were used to fill out the marriage certificate,'' he added. </P>
