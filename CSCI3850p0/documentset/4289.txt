<P>  A U.S. citizen and a British citizen have been kidnapped by an armed group of bandits in northern Nicaragua, an army spokesman said Friday. </P>
<P> About 15 troops loyal to the well-known rebel leader ''Charro'' captured Sarah Howard, a British citizen, and a U.S. citizen identified as either Gary Hicks or Alan Hicks, 51 years old, army spokesman Capt. Milton Sandoval told reporters. </P>
<P> He said the two were seized Thursday. </P>
<P> ``They (the hostages) were from an international organization that is performing a study of the countryside in the area,'' Sandoval said. </P>
<P> The kidnappings took place near San Jose de Bocay, about 150 miles north of Managua, Sandoval said. </P>
<P> The kidnappers were requesting that the Catholic Church, an Organization of American States mission and local news reporters be summoned to the area to negotiate the safe return of the hostages, Sandoval said. </P>
<P> Several hundred men armed with military weaponry continue to roam the mountainous northern countryside of Nicaragua. </P>
<P> Authorities consider them to be common criminals rather than political guerrillas because they have not laid out political demands. </P>
