<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Syria Monday warned of a nuclear arms race in the Middle East unless Israel signs the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). </P>
<P> Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara, in Cairo to attend a meeting with his counterparts from Egypt and six Persian Gulf states, also accused the Jewish state of obstructing peace talks with Damascus. </P>
<P> Shara said if Israel refused to sign the global pact that aims to curb the spread of nuclear weapons, ``this means it will open up the region to a race for nuclear armament.'' </P>
<P> He was speaking at the end of the first session of a meeting of the eight Damascus Declaration states -- Egypt, Syria, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates which met for five hours and adjourned until Monday. </P>
<P> Before leaving, Shara held a separate meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa. Egypt has been rallying Arab support for its insistence that Israel sign the NPT when it comes up for extension in Geneva in April. </P>
<P> Diplomats said the Egyptian hosts would take the opportunity of the meeting to press their Arab allies to join them in opposition to Israel's stand. Asked if the ministers could agree on a united stand on the NPT, Moussa replied: ``Why not?'' </P>
<P> Egypt, along with many other states, believes Israel has nuclear weapons and says its refusal to sign the treaty threatens regional security. </P>
<P> Israel has never denied nor confirmed reports of its nuclear program but says it will keep out of the treaty until comprehensive peace in the region eliminates the potential threats from countries such as Iran, Iraq and Libya. </P>
<P> Bahrain's minister, Sheikh Mohammed Bin Mubarak al-Khalifa, told the opening session that peace with Israel was a strategic choice but peace required Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, south Lebanon and other occupied Arab territory. </P>
<P> Such emphasis on the land-for-peace principle is crucial to Syria, which fears its deadlocked negotiations with Israel are being forgotten as Arabs edge closer to peace with the Jewish state. </P>
<P> Egypt, which became the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with the Jewish state in 1979, hosted a four-way summit in Cairo Thursday that brought together Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and King Hussein of Jordan. </P>
<P> Jordan and the PLO signed separate peace deals with Israel last year, leaving Syria and its ally Lebanon as the last two of Israel's immediate neighbors holding out against peace on the terms Israel is now offering. </P>
<P> Syria Sunday blasted Rabin for what it called his ``obstinate stance'' at the Cairo summit on outstanding issues in the PLO deal and criticized his refusal to give a commitment to a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which Israel occupied in 1967. </P>
<P> Three years of negotiations have made little headway, with Syria insisting Israel completely withdraw from the Golan and Israel saying it wants Damascus to agree to establish full diplomatic ties before it reveals the extent of its pullback. </P>
<P> Shara refused to comment on the four-way summit and said ``Israel has been the one obstructing the peace process for three years.'' </P>
<P> He said the foreign ministers had stressed the importance of another summit in Alexandria, Egypt, where Egypt and Saudi Arabia gave Syria an implicit promise that Arab countries would not normalize relations with Israel before Syria struck its own deal. </P>
<P> Egypt, Syria and the six Persian Gulf countries signed the Damascus Declaration after the Gulf War in 1991. Its vision of economic, political and military cooperation has failed to materialize, and diplomats said the ministers were expected to discuss an Egyptian proposal on a structure for economic coordination. </P>
