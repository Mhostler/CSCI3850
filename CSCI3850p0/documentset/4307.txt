<P>  A Dublin professor has unearthed 300 poems by Samuel Taylor Coleridge after a 20-year search that took him to five continents, the Sunday Times reported. </P>
<P> The discovery could lead to a reappraisal of Coleridge, one of the great names of English literature best known for the poems Kubla Khan and The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. </P>
<P> ``There are a hell of a lot of new poems. They change your understanding of Coleridge,'' Jim Mays, head of English at Dublin's University College, told the newspaper. </P>
<P> Mays, a Coleridge scholar for 35 years, tracked down the poems in private collections and homes as far apart as Russia and New Zealand. One was in a barn. Another was framed on a wall, known only to its owners. </P>
<P> Coleridge (1772-1834), one of the founders of the Romantic movement, was thought until now to have written 300 poems. </P>
<P> The new finds, unprecedented in scale for a major literary figure, confirm Coleridge's eccentric reputation, according to the Sunday Times. One is an elegy to his broken shaving pot. </P>
<P> ``There are texts about buggery, gout, ingrown fingernails and lesbian lovers. One is in Greek and Hebrew about a friend who has trouble sustaining erections with his frisky new wife,'' the paper said. </P>
<P> It is not only the subject matter that is off-beat. </P>
<P> One poem is written on a piece of pale seaweed, while another seems to have been written in blood on a piece of Coleridge's skin that peeled off in the bath, the Sunday Times reported. </P>
