<P> An Alpine police spokesman said in a television interview that the quake, which occurred at 7:33 pm CDT (8:33 EDT), caused only slight damage, such as cracks in buildings and broken windows. There were reports of some small fires caused by broken gas mains. </P>
<P> Alpine resident Dan Akers told Houston CBS affiliate KHOU- TV that some people were hurt by articles falling from walls or bookshelves. </P>
<P> The quake was felt in an area stretching from Roswell, N.M. to San Antonio, Texas and as far north as Dallas. </P>
<P> Students at the University of Texas in Arlington, between Dallas and Fort Worth, told reporters they felt a shaking sensation and saw furniture rattle. </P>
