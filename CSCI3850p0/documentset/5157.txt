<DATELINE>PHNOM PENH, March 24 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Cambodian Interior Ministry ordered police on full alert after hearing that Khmer Rouge guerrillas planned attacks in Phnom Penh during the Khmer New Year next month, a spokesman said on Friday. </P>
<P> ``We know for sure that they will create terrorist activities during the New Year ceremony,'' Major-General Teng Savong told Reuters. </P>
<P> Teng Savong said police intelligence pointed to small units of rebels infiltrating the capital in April. </P>
<P> ``We have already organised forces to safeguard the security for the festival,'' he said. </P>
<P> Khmer New Year, Cambodia's biggest Buddhist festival, is scheduled for April 13 through 15, two days before the date on which Khmer Rouge guerrillas claimed victory over the U.S.-backed Lon Nol government in 1975. </P>
<P> The Khmer Rouge on Friday claimed to have made major battlefield gains during the dry season and ``liberated'' 16 northern villages from the government. </P>
<P> Phnom Penh has so far been safe from Khmer Rouge attacks but defence analysts and diplomats have long been concerned about the potential for urban terrorism in the city. </P>
<P> ``According to their plan, they will act on New Year but we are careful before, during and after the ceremony,'' the general said. ``They'll act in the capital to show that they are still strong.'' </P>
<P> In a broadcast monitored by Reuters in Phnom Penh, clandestine Khmer Rouge radio reported that rebel fighters had launched attacks on Tuesday and Wednesday that ``crushed three army positions'' in the north of Battambang province. </P>
<P> ``We killed six on the spot, wounded nine and captured two,'' the radio said, adding that the guerrillas had siezed a large amount of weapons and ammunition. </P>
<P> In a separate broadcast, the rebels said they had inflicted a severe blow on Tuesday to the army's dry season operations in the country's far north. </P>
<P> Hundreds of government soldiers have been wounded in fighting in Preah Vihear and Siem Reap provinces in the north since January. </P>
<P> Scores are also believed to have died, but an accurate death toll is difficult to ascertain because the government does not release casualty figures and the dead are usually cremated on the battlefield. </P>
<P> The Khmer Rouge, responsible for the deaths of at least one million Cambodians during its brutal rule in the 1970s, continues to wage a low-level guerrilla war in support of its self-declared provisional government. </P>
