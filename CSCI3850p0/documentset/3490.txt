<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Two municipal agencies fired a new legal broadside against Orange County, Calif. Thursday, filing motions in U.S. Bankruptcy Court challenging the troubled county's distribution of property tax revenues. </P>
<P> U.S. Trustee Marcy Tiffany, who is supervising the administration of the county's bankruptcy case, said that the filings by the two southern California water districts were ``an unfortunate event,'' but would not lead to a breakdown of negotiations between the county and its creditors. </P>
<P> ``Negotiations are proceeding,'' Tiffany said. </P>
<P> But she warned that a breakdown in negotiations could lead to more bankruptcies by cities and other public entities dependent on money frozen in the county's investment pool. </P>
<P> ``I am concerned there could be more Chapter nine bankruptcies as a result of this (a breakdown in talks),'' Tiffany said. ``But I'm optimistic it can be averted.'' </P>
<P> The motions were filed separately by the Santiago County Water District and the Yorba Linda Water District, both of which invested in Orange County's bankrupt investment pool, said Ron Rus, an attorney for the water districts. </P>
<P> They were the first motions to be filed on behalf of investment pool participants against the county, but Rus and other attorneys said the two motions would not be the last. </P>
<P> Separately, the city of Huntington Beach, Calif., said it would sue the county unless an agreement is reached by Jan. 6 to release frozen property tax revenues. </P>
<P> City officials said Orange County has withheld between $2 million and $2.5 million in property tax revenues. </P>
<P> Orange County filed for bankruptcy Dec. 6 following a loss of more than $2 billion on its $7.4 billion investment pool. The bankruptcy froze most of the investments of the more than 180 entities that have funds in the county portfolio. </P>
<P> ``The withholding of duly collected tax revenues is simply not acceptable,'' Victor Leipzig, mayor of Huntington Beach, said in a letter to a county supervisor. </P>
<P> He said the city may join several others, including Costa Mesa and Irvine, that are threatening legal proceedings against Orange County for withholding property taxes. </P>
<P> These legal battles loom as the beleaguered county is finding it may need to further reduce spending and cannot count on some of the income it had been expecting. </P>
<P> Last week's order by the Board of Supervisors that department heads save $40 million over the next six months may be inadequate, Orange County's lead attorney said Thursday. </P>
<P> Referring to the controversial $40 million figure, attorney Bruce Bennett said, ``That was the first step towards resolving the (budget) gap. As of right now, we don't have a precise number on what the gap will be or whether these steps will close it.'' </P>
<P> Separately, officials said the county does not expect to earn $120 million this fiscal year in interest on its investments, compounding its financial troubles. </P>
<P> Officials said the county budgeted for interest earnings of $120 million in the current fiscal year, which ends June 30, 1995. ``That money is probably gone,'' one official said. </P>
<P> The interest earnings were based on the county's extensive investments in the now-bankrupt investment pool. </P>
<P> Investors continue to unwind their holdings in the county portfolio. In New York, the Federal National Mortgage Association said it completed the purchase of $630 million of its structured notes from the investment pool. </P>
<P> Fannie Mae bought the notes at a discount, paid cash and did not exchange them for other securities, a spokesman said. </P>
<P> ``We paid a fair and economic price,'' he said. </P>
<P> The Orange County pool does not own any more Fannie Mae structured notes, he added. </P>
<P> BankAmerica Corp. unit BA Securities sold its collateral holdings, about $307 million in county securities. The sale was authorized early Thursday by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. </P>
<P> As the county struggles to deal with its obligations, the Board of Supervisors said it would make interest payments on six bond issues due Jan. 1 pending Bankruptcy Court approval. </P>
<P> The payments will total $3.9 million, Supervisor Gaddi Vasquez told a briefing. </P>
<P> But at the same time, Vasquez said, the county would not make set-aside payments due in December and January on certain notes. The December payment would have been for $34.7 million and the January payment $18.7 million, he said. </P>
