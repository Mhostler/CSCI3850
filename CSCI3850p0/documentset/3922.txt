<DATELINE>LONDON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  British and U.S. officials discounted a report Tuesday focusing responsibility on Iran instead of Libya in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet over Scotland that killed 270 people. </P>
<P> A Scottish newspaper, the Daily Record, had quoted U.S. Air Force Intelligence Agency files as saying that an Iranian diplomat paid $10 million for a guerrilla group to blast the airliner to pieces over the Scottish village of Lockerbie. </P>
<P> But one British government official said: ``It clearly doesn't represent evidence. It's something we were aware of ... it's not new and it was deemed not worthy of serious examination.'' </P>
<P> Describing the report as ``dud intelligence,'' he said it should be ``discarded.'' </P>
<P> In Washington, the U.S. Air Force discounted the document in question as a ``raw'' field intelligence report based on second- or third-hand information gathered from defecting Iranian pilots during the 1991 Gulf War. </P>
<P> ``It was a rumor and it was never substantiated,'' said Major Bob Watson, an Air Force spokesman. </P>
<P> State Department spokeswoman Christine Shelly said U.S. authorities had originally pursued the Iranian connection, but an exhaustive three-year investigation ``uncovered no credible evidence to support such a conclusion''. </P>
<P> ``Evidence connecting Libyan agents to the blast is conclusive,'' she told reporters. </P>
<P> The people who obtained the document, under U.S. freedom of information laws ``were reportedly the makers of the movie 'The Maltese Double-Cross', which was a desperate transparent attempt, financed by (Libyan leader Muammar) Gaddafi, to exculpate Libya from responsibility for murdering 270 innocent people,'' Shelly said. </P>
<P> All serious investigations into the story had concluded it was ``totally baseless'', she added. </P>
<P> Britain and the United States have consistently blamed Libya for the Lockerbie bombing, issuing arrest warrants in 1991 for two Libyan agents. The United Nations has imposed sanctions on Libya for refusing to hand over the men. </P>
<P> The Daily Record quoted the files as saying the attack was funded by senior cleric Ali Akbar Mohtashami, a friend of guerrilla leader Abu Nidal, as revenge for the downing of an Iranian passenger jet by the American warship USS Vincennes in July 1988. </P>
<P> The files were released to a Washington law firm in November after a four-year battle. </P>
<P> Libya, seizing on reports about the files, appealed Tuesday for sanctions imposed on it since 1992 to be urgently lifted. </P>
<P> ``Western allegations against the great Jamahiriya (Libya) are collapsing,'' state-controlled Libyan radio said. ``The unjust measures imposed on it must be lifted immediately.'' </P>
<P> But the British government officials Tuesday said the files dealt with an issue that was separate from the Lockerbie bombing. Moreover, they said, the files indicated that the information about Mohtashami was second or third hand. </P>
<P> Saying Britain had investigated Iran's possible involvement in the bombing at the time, the officials said they remained convinced of the strength of the case against the Libyans. </P>
<P> Conservative MP Sir Teddy Taylor has demanded that Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd tell parliament if and when Britain was made aware of the four-year-old document. </P>
<P> Taylor said: ``If the Americans did not tell the government, something will have to be pursued with the U.S. authorities. </P>
<P> ``And if the government was advised, it seems little more than unbelievable because at repeated meetings ... I was repeatedly told there was no evidence of any sort to implicate any other party than the Libyans.'' </P>
<P> Hurd is expected to reply to Taylor's inquiry officially later this week. Opposition Labor MP Robin Cook called for a full inquiry and asked whether the U.S. had shared the information with Britain. </P>
<P> ``If so, why for the last four years has the British government, British ministers, repeatedly denied that any other country originated the appalling attack on Lockerbie?'' said Cook. </P>
