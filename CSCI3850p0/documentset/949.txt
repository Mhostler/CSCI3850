<P>  Typhoon Fred pounded China's eastern Zhejiang province over the weekend, killing 25 people and causing havoc in a coastal region already battered by floods this year, the Xinhua news agency said Tuesday. </P>
<P> Two others were missing, Xinhua said. </P>
<P> The typhoon -- which also killed at least three people in Taiwan -- sank more than 70 boats and destroyed about 10,000 houses in Zhejiang, the agency said. Some 64,000 acres of farmland were left under water. </P>
<P> The agency said heavy rains lashed most of the province for 43 consecutive hours with rainfall exceeding nearly eight inches in some areas with flooding up to one three feet. </P>
<P> Tides in some areas, including Wenzhou, reached 20-year record high levels. </P>
<P> The Wenzhou airport was closed down, the agency said. Two highways were also closed due to landslides and storms. </P>
<P> Power supply and telecommunications in some counties were cut. The army was dispatched to combat floods. </P>
<P> The cost of property damage was not known. </P>
<P> Storms and floods earlier this year killed more than 1,400 people in Zhejiang, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangxi and Fujian provinces, causing more than $6.0 billion in losses to homes, industry and agriculture, according to official estimates. </P>
