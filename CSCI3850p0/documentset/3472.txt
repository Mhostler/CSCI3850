<P> ``The Armed Islamic Group will, God willing, continue its Jihad (fight) against all who stand in the way of achieving the supremacy on earth of God's sharia (Islamic law) and the establishment of a wise caliphate (Islamic state).'' </P>
<P> The statement was signed by Abou Abderrahmane Amine, named as the group's prince and identified by Algerian newspapers as the new leader of the group. </P>
