<P>  Brazilian President-elect Fernando Henrique Cardoso vowed Wednesday to transform Latin America's biggest economy through sweeping constitutional reforms. </P>
<P> Cardoso said in a speech before the Senate he would send Congress a package of constitutional changes in February. They will center on reforming the tax system and the economy, especially through increased privatization and opening up Brazil to foreign capital. </P>
<P> Cardoso urged legislative support for the reforms, saying, ''Brazil is in a hurry, not for miracles, but in the sense of having the right path and the right steps marked on that path. </P>
<P> ``It is up to us, the future president and the majority of Congress, to mark out this course and take the necessary measures, without stumbling, with firmness.'' </P>
<P> Cardoso, a free-market champion, takes office Jan. 1. He was overwhelmingly elected president in October on the strength of an anti-inflation plan he designed while economy minister. </P>
<P> Congress presents a potential obstacle to Cardoso's proposals, even though he has good support there and a strong mandate. Congress has 19 political parties and is known for lack of party discipline and failure to muster quorums. </P>
<P> Cardoso said Brazil, among the 10 biggest economies in the world, needed constitutional changes lifting restrictions on foreign investment and increasing the sale of state companies. </P>
<P> ``The privatization process should be accelerated and extended to other activities and companies of the energy, transport, telecommunications and mining sectors,'' he said. </P>
<P> Stock markets surged on Cardoso's comments, with the Sao Paulo bourse's Bovespa index rising 2.9 percent in heavy trade. </P>
<P> In his 90-minute speech before a packed chamber, Cardoso said the 1988 constitution needed to be stripped of articles that restrict the government's ability to control spending and taxes, thus fueling chronic inflation. </P>
<P> Cardoso said a key element of growth was ending protectionism restricting imports. Brazil last month had its first trade deficit since January 1987 as it lowered tariffs and the import-hungry economy surged. </P>
<P> Cardoso, a senator from Sao Paulo state, made his speech to resign formally from the Senate before becoming president. </P>
