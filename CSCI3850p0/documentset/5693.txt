<DATELINE>MOSCOW (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A huge fire swept a major Russian bank, Promstroibank, in the center of Moscow Wednesday evening, killing at least one person. </P>
<P> Fireman Igor Stepanov told Reuters one person was killed and another four injured, two of them badly, after the fire broke out at around 7:30 p.m. </P>
<P> Hundreds of onlookers gathered under the trees of leafy Tverskoi Boulevard outside the blazing six-story building, watching as 20 fire engines battled flames leaping from the top two floors. Three ambulances waited nearby. </P>
<P> The fire was still raging four hours after it broke out. Firemen said the old stucco building's wooden frame walls would make it easy for the blaze to spread back through the building. </P>
<P> A huddle of businessmen watched anxiously as senior bank officials roared up in cars to inspect their stricken property. </P>
<P> Another branch of Promstroibank, in Russia's second largest city St. Petersburg, was damaged when a fire broke out there three months ago. Firemen did not say what they thought had caused the Moscow fire or whether they suspected arson. </P>
