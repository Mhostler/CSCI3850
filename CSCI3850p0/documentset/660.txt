<P>  NATO is readying contingency plans to expand four so-called ``safe areas'' in Bosnia to ``exclusion zones'' which would prohibit the presence of any heavy weapons, the U.S. ambassador to NATO said Monday. </P>
<P> ``NATO planning is moving foward expeditiously ... in regard to what we call the strict enforcement of exclusion zones or the extension of the exclusion zones,'' Ambassador Robert Hunter told reporters. </P>
<P> The cities of Sarajevo and Gorazde have already been declared exclusion zones, and that status was used to justify Friday's NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serbs after the theft of heavy weapons from a U.N. depot outside Sarajevo. </P>
<P> However, there are four other designated ``safe areas'' in the former Yugoslavia -- Tuzla, Zepa, Srebenica and Bihac -- which could become exclusion zones under one of two conditions, Hunter said. </P>
<P> If any of the four safe areas underwent heavy weapons attack or if both NATO and the United Nations agreed there was a sufficient concentration of heavy weapons to indicate an attack was being prepared, the four other safe areas could become exclusion zones, he said. </P>
<P> Hunter said NATO was also planning how to get individual nations' U.N. peacekeepers out of former Yugoslavia if Yugoslavia's leaders decide this is warranted. </P>
<P> Hunter praised the NATO blockade of the Montenegran coast and the operation aimed at keeping Serbian planes on the ground as highly effective. </P>
<P> The sea blockade, known as Operation Sharp Guard and based in Naples, Italy, has challenged more than 37,000 ships, boarded 3,500 and turned back about 500 in the 18 months of its operation, Hunter said. </P>
<P> He said Operation Deny Flight, based at Aviano in northern Italy, has flown some 35,000 sorties since February 28, providing 24-hour air cover. </P>
