<P>  Workers Monday put the finishing touches on Denver International Airport while a caravan of hundreds of slow-moving vehicles undertook the arduous task of moving ground equipment from the old Stapleton International Airport. </P>
<P> The 53-square-mile airport is 16 months late and has missed four opening dates, making it a source of frustration to local officials and residents and the butt of numerous jokes on late night television. </P>
<P> ``Where we are today is that the jokes stop,'' Mayor Wellington Webb said on local TV while visiting the old airport. </P>
<P> To facilitate the move of de-icing machines, fuel tankers and other ground equipment, certain streets were closed to normal traffic for ``push night,'' as the move was called. </P>
<P> The new $4 billion airport is set to open just before sunrise Tuesday and while residents living near the old airport will be glad to hear the noise stop, others were sad to see the 65-year-old Stapleton close. </P>
<P> Road workers removed the partial veiling on street signs for the new airport. </P>
<P> A Federal Express cargo plane landed early Monday at the new airport, the first revenue-producing arrival. </P>
<P> United Airlines, which has about 67 percent of the flights in and out of Denver, will have the honor of the first flights taking off and arriving at the new airport. </P>
<P> Meanwhile, an airport bond investor Monday filed a lawsuit in federal court, alleging city officials misled holders about problems with delays. </P>
