<P>  Bangladeshi feminist writer Taslima Nasrin was quoted Wednesday as saying Islamic fundamentalist forces were gaining ground in her country and could one day take over power. </P>
<P> ``If the progressive forces do not organize, the fundamentalists will come to power one day,'' Nasrin, who fled to Sweden to escape death threats from Islamic militants, told the Swedish daily Svenska Dagbladet. </P>
<P> But she added that Bangladesh could not be compared with Algeria, Pakistan or Iran. </P>
<P> ``I mean the progressive (people) have a majority in our country, but they are not organized,'' she said. ``I think the fundamentalists will try to silence all the progressive voices in my country.'' </P>
<P> Nasrin has vowed to return to Bangladesh but does not know when she will be able to do so. She said she was willing to go to jail if that was the price she had to pay to be able to return. </P>
<P> Thousands of Islamic militants marched to Dhaka's main government office Wednesday calling for Nasrin's execution in the first major protest against her since she fled in August. </P>
<P> ``Bring her back, put her on trial and hang her,'' said a leader of the Islamic Constitution Movement. </P>
<P> The 32-year-old physician turned author flew to Sweden August 10, a week after Bangladesh's High Court granted her bail on a charge of insulting Muslim religious feelings. She had been in hiding since June to escape death threats and arrest. </P>
<P> Nasrin said she would renew her three-month visa which expires in a month but she had no intention of seeking asylum. </P>
