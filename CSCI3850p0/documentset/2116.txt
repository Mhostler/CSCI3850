<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A Rio de Janeiro electoral court Wednesday annulled the results of congressional and state legislature elections held earlier this month and ordered a new poll because of widespread fraud. </P>
<P> ``We are staring fraud in the face,'' Paulo Cesar Salomao, a judge on the seven-member Rio de Janeiro Regional Electoral Court plenary said in his verdict. </P>
<P> ``The vote was immoral and it was illegal because fraud reached gigantic proportions,'' he said. </P>
<P> The court voted six to one that the results of the Oct. 3 election be annulled and a new poll be held at a yet unscheduled date. </P>
<P> One member requested the army oversee all voting when the elections are reheld. </P>
<P> Police arrested 15 people accused of being involved in election fraud last week after they were found holding stamped ballots and accepting bribes to rig the vote-counting process. </P>
<P> Several civil servants hired to tally the votes were accused of changing the results and at least three of the judges in charge of the vote count received death threats. </P>
<P> The new election will not influence the results of the presidential or Rio de Janeiro state governor poll also held Oct. 3. </P>
