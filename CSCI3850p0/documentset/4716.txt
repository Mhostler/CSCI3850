<P>  Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev said here Saturday Moscow was considering whether to join an international consortium to underwrite a nuclear deal with North Korea. </P>
<P> He said he believed active participation by Russia increased the chances of success of the consortium -- the Korean Energy Development Organization (KEDO). </P>
<P> ``The scope of Russia's participation will be a measure guaranteeing the success of the effort,'' Kozyrev told a news conference at the end of a two-day visit to Tokyo. </P>
<P> The United States, South Korea and Japan announced Friday that KEDO would be launched formally after the conclusion of two days of meetings in New York on March 8-9. </P>
<P> The consortium will raise $4.5 billion needed to provide North Korea with new light-water reactors and alternative energy supplies, as pledged in a pact signed between Pyongyang and Washington in Geneva last October. </P>
<P> In return, North Korea will dismantle and eventually freeze a nuclear program widely suspected to be also producing nuclear weapons. </P>
<P> Kozyrev said Russia had been invited to join the consortium, and the issue had been discussed in his meetings with Japanese government leaders. </P>
<P> Kozyrev also touched on the as yet undecided issue of the nuclear reactor model to be provided to North Korea, saying a Russian model should be used because both nations were familiar with each other's facilities and technology. </P>
<P> North Korea has flatly refused to accept a South Korean model, although the United States has said it was a condition of the nuclear pact since Seoul had said it would finance the bulk of the project. </P>
