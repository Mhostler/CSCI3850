<P>  The John F Kennedy Library said Monday it would release for the first time secret tape recordings of meetings between President Kennedy and his national security advisers at the height of the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. </P>
<P> The tapes, to be released for researchers Wednesday, are of two meetings of the National Security Council Executive Committee at the White House on the mornings of October 18 and October 22, 1962, during which Kennedy and his key advisers weighed U.S. actions in response to the installation of Soviet missile sites in Cuba. </P>
<P> The Cuban missile crisis was the greatest foreign policy challenge of the Kennedy presidency and brought the world to the brink of nuclear war. </P>
<P> ``The meetings include a briefing on the location and type of missile sites photographed in Cuba; consideration of military and diplomatic options; and discussion of plans for communicating news of the crisis to the Congress, the press and the public,'' the Kennedy Library said in a statement. </P>
<P> ``These tapes represent raw historical material.'' </P>
<P> The tapes are the first to be released from 15 hours of tape recordings of National Security Council executive committee meetings on the crisis. </P>
<P> The Kennedy Library, which is part of the National Archives, said the tapes were reviewed without transcripts by the National Security Council and by several other government agencies before they were cleared for release. </P>
<P> The tapes total nearly three hours of sound recordings, with excisions totaling just over two minutes ``required for reasons of national security ... `` the Kennedy Library said. </P>
<P> The tapes are among 200 hours of secretly recorded Oval Office tapes that form an intimate record of crucial decisions made during the Kennedy presidency. </P>
<P> Most of the recordings remain classified despite frequent calls for their release by historians, library officials and even the Kennedy family. </P>
<P> ``We were able to release some sanitized recordings in the early 1980s. But these are the first complete tapes concerning a major foreign policy issue we have been able to release,'' said Frank Rigg, acting curator of the Kennedy Library. </P>
<P> President Kennedy ordered the taping system installed in the White House during the summer of 1962 and used it regularly between July 30 of that year and his assassination in Dallas on November 22, 1963. </P>
<P> At the time of his death, only his brother Robert, the president's personal secretary Evelyn Lincoln and two Secret Service agents were aware of the existence of the recording system. </P>
<P> The Kennedy tapes were kept secret until 1973, when their existence became public knowledge. The recordings were the private property of the Kennedy family which donated them to the Kennedy Library in 1975. </P>
