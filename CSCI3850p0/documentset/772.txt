<DATELINE>TORONTO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Dominique Wilkins scored 20 points, leading eight U.S. players in double figures as Dream Team II handily defeated Russia 137-91 to win the gold medal at the world championship of basketball Sunday. </P>
<P> Shaquille O'Neal added 18 points and 10 rebounds in 16 minutes as the United States finished the tournament with a perfect 8-0 record and outscored its opponents by an average of 37.8 points. </P>
<P> The only failure the U.S. team of NBA stars experienced here was falling short of the original Dream Team's average margin of victory at the Barcelona Olympics, 43.8 points per game. </P>
<P> ``We were on a mission today,'' said Indiana Pacers guard Reggie Miller, who had 11 points. ``The gold was waiting for us for two weeks, and today we went after it.'' </P>
<P> Earlier, Dino Radja scored 22 points and Arijan Komazec added 21 as Croatia defeated Greece 78-60 to earn the bronze medal. </P>
<P> Sergei Babkov scored 22 points to lead Russia, which played without Andrei Fetisov, the team's fourth-leading scorer and second-leading rebounder. He missed the game with an injured right leg. </P>
<P> Fetisov suffered the injury in Russia's only tournament defeat, Friday's 111-94 quarter-final round loss to the United States. He played less than four minutes in Saturday's 66-64 victory against Croatia in the semifinal game. </P>
<P> Without him, Russia was outrebounded 47-27 by the United States. </P>
<P> Sunday's U.S. victory was virtually assured by halftime when the Dream Team II led 73-40, showing the power, style and arrogance that turned opponents' games into nightmares. </P>
<P> The U.S. team shot 62 percent (53-of-86), including 28 of 39 first-half shots. </P>
<P> With two minutes left in the half, New Jersey Nets forward Derrick Coleman leaped off the bench to shout: ``Hey, can we get our gold medals at halftime?'' </P>
<P> The U.S. team, which scored the game's first nine points, also produced runs of 10-0 and 13-2 in the decisive first half. </P>
<P> The early explosion was in stark contrast to Saturday's 97-58 semifinal victory against Greece in which the United States shot just 32 percent from the floor in the first half. </P>
<P> The frivolity of the U.S. players continued during a second-half timeout, when Coleman and several teammates played an impromptu role in a sponsor's promotion, tossing socks and caps into the stands. </P>
<P> Coleman, who led the United States with 13 first-half points in 10 minutes, did not play in the second half. </P>
<P> When Steve Smith hit a 3-point shot with 7:30 to play, all 12 U.S. players had broken into the scoring column, and the Russians sustained their biggest deficit at 114-65. </P>
<P> Behind Wilkins, newly acquired by the Boston Celtics, and O'Neal, the crowd-favorite center from the Orlando Magic, Alonzon Mourning of the Charlotte Hornets scored 15 points, the Seattle SuperSonics' Shawn Kemp had 14, veteran guard Joe Dumars of the Detroit Pistons scored 13 and the Cleveland Cavaliers' Mark Price added 12. </P>
<P> ``As long as we send our best players and they agree to come,'' U.S. coach Don Nelson said, ``it will be a long time before the rest of the world catches up to us.'' </P>
<P> The Russians, who placed fourth at the 1992 Olympics won by the original Dream Team, found their foes here to be overpowering. </P>
<P> ``Dream Team II was fabulous in virtually every aspect of play,'' Babkov said. ``They were overwhelming. </P>
<P> ``I was fascinated by their defense. I was always moving into a wall, and I just couldn't penetrate it.'' </P>
<P> Russian captain Sergei Bazarevich said his team also felt the effects of its semifinal victory. </P>
<P> ``We were drained after our game with Croatia, not only physically, but also mentally,'' said Bazarevich, who scored 17 points. ``I think it's a pity we could not even match our own performance against Dream Team II in our first game here.'' </P>
<P> A crowd of 32,616 saw the game, the largest crowd ever at a world championship game. </P>
<P> Croatia, which lost to Russia 66-64 in Saturday night's semifinal 14 hours earlier, finished the tournament with a 7-1 record. </P>
<P> ``It was really hard for us to stand up at 9:30 this morning, so we could play this game,'' Radja said afterwards. </P>
<P> Fanis Christodoulou and Panagiotis Fasoulas each scored 12 points to lead Greece (4-4), which enjoyed two early four-point advantages but last led at 12-11. </P>
<P> Toni Kukoc scored 12 of his 14 points in the first half, during which Croatia used just six players and got no scoring from its bench in building a 36-32 lead at the break. </P>
<P> Not until Danko Cvjeticanin's jumper with seven minutes to play did the fatigued Croatians get their only two points from a reserve player. </P>
<P> Croatia ran off eight of nine points to start the second half and maintained a double-figure lead for all but 30 seconds of the final 16 minutes. </P>
<P> ``Today I would like to thank our big players,'' Croatian coach Giuseppe Giergie said. ``They played the most and the hardest and they deserve to be recognized.'' </P>
