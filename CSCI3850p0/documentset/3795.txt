<P>  Jordan's parliament Monday criticized Newt Gingrich, new speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, for saying he favored moving the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. </P>
<P> The lower house's foreign affairs committee said that, according to principles of the U.S.-led Middle East peace process begun in October 1991, the city's status should be determined in negotiations starting in mid-1996. </P>
<P> ``Making such statements is inappropriate in the present time of the peace process because of the negative repercussions it shall bear on all the parties concerned with the conflict,'' it said in a statement. </P>
<P> ``The Jordanian parliament sees in such statements a provocation of feelings of Muslims and Arabs all over the world.'' </P>
<P> Gingrich said on Israel Television Sunday he strongly favored moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. </P>
<P> The United States, in common with most countries, does not recognize Israel's claim to Jerusalem as capital of the Jewish state and says the holy city's status should be determined in negotiations. </P>
