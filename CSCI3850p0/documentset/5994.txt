<P>  A shipload of radioactive waste headed for a stormy end to its two month voyage Monday with nuclear activists gathered to protest and local officials threatening to bar it from port. </P>
<P> Demonstrators say the 14 tons of waste, a byproduct from spent fuel sent to France for reprocessing, is so dangerous that just touching it is enough to kill. </P>
<P> Flights over this northern Japanese port have been banned in case of an accident when the British freighter Pacific Pintail sails into port at dawn Tuesday. </P>
<P> The governor of the area announced Monday he would not give permission for the Pacific Pintail to dock unless Japanese power companies, which own the waste, promise not to store it in the village permanently. </P>
<P> About 1,000 demonstrators have camped in the area for days, awaiting the end of the ship's voyage from Cherbourg. </P>
<P> The environmental group Greenpeace says this is the most dangerous shipment ever made and 35 nations refused the ship passage through their waters during the voyage. </P>
<P> When the freighter docks it will face a Geiger counter examination for radioactive leaks. </P>
<P> The waste is scheduled to be temporarily stored at a facility in the port for up to 50 years while it cools and then buried permanently underground. </P>
<P> Aomori Governor Morio Kimura told reporters companies had not fixed a site for permanent burial and residents were worried the waste might be in their village forever. </P>
<P> He said unless an assurance was given on permanent disposal he would not allow the Pacific Pintail to dock. </P>
<P> Greenpeace said rubber dinghies flying anti-nuclear slogans would escort the Pacific Pintail to dock, and that there would be demonstrations on land. </P>
<P> Hundreds of riot police were already on duty at the port area where the cargo will be unloaded. </P>
<P> One protester eluded the cordon and tied himself to a 20 yard high crane which will be used to unload the cargo. </P>
<P> Dozens of protesters including Buddhist monks marched through the village, holding up banners saying: ``No! High-level nuclear waste. Stop bringing in nuclear waste.'' </P>
<P> Police also arrested several protesters who tried to force their way into the port through the main gate. </P>
