<P>  A ferry boat hijacked Thursday by people trying to go to the United States was returned to Havana by authorities Saturday with its passengers and the hijackers, state media said. </P>
<P> State radio said the ferry boat, the third to be hijacked from Havana bay in nine days, ran out of gasoline and drifted 12miles north of the capital. Cuban authorities refused to negotiate on the hijackers' demand for more fuel. </P>
<P> The hijackers are in detention and the passengers are safe, the radio said, without saying how many people were involved. </P>
<P> The spate of hijackings of ferries normally used to make the short crossing from Havana city to suburbs across the bay was the trigger for unrest in the capital Friday in which groups of people threw stones at police and smashed windows. </P>
<P> President Fidel Castro said Friday night that two policemen were killed in the latest hijack. State media have so far only identified one of the dead, 19-year-old Gabriel Lamoth. A meeting has been called in Havana's Revolution Square Sunday to pay last respects to Lamoth. </P>
<P> A ferry boat was hijacked Wednesday and more than 100 people, including the hijackers, went to the United States, while 76 Cubans returned home. </P>
<P> Still another ferry was hijacked on July 26. In that incident, 15 people went to the United States and 15 returned home. </P>
<P> Castro on Friday condemned U.S. authorities for receiving ''pirates'' with open arms. </P>
