<P>  A plan bringing together the best National Hockey League players for the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan is on the verge of final approval, ice hockey officials said Saturday. </P>
<P> ``I'm optimistic. I think it's pretty much wrapped up,'' International Ice Hockey Federation Secretary-General Jan-Ake Edvinsson told Reuters after an IIHF congress during the world championship here. </P>
<P> Despite some suspenseful games in the championship, notably Sweden's 3-2 semifinal win over Canada in sudden death, the quality of play has generally been scrappy due to the absence of top players whose teams were contesting playoff slots in the NHL's shortened season. </P>
<P> Sweden meet Finland in the final Sunday. </P>
<P> ``Dream teams'' of NHL players from Canada, the United States, Russia, Sweden, the Czech Republic and Finland clashing in the Olympics for the first time could mean an enormous boost for hockey all over the world. </P>
<P> Edvinsson said the IIHF, the International Olympic Committee and NHL officials had until July 10 to finalize a plan which now only requires the approval of the NHL Players Association. </P>
<P> Under a preliminary plan, requiring a 10-day closure of the NHL season, the six ``dream teams'' would fly in for the second phase of the Nagano tournament featuring round-robin play in two four-team groups followed by semifinals and a final. </P>
<P> In the first phase, eight other countries would contest the two remaining places in the second round. </P>
<P> An IIHF statement outlining a complex qualification system for Nagano said hosts Japan and the teams placed seventh and eighth at the Stockholm championship, France and Italy, were assured of berths in the first phase of the Olympic tournament. </P>
<P> The remaining five vacancies would be decided in two steps beginning with three European and one Asian tournament. </P>
<P> The four winners would then meet Germany, Norway and Austria, placed ninth, 10th and 11th in Stockholm, and Slovakia, winner of the 1995 Pool B event, in a qualification tournament. The top five teams gain Olympic slots. </P>
<P> A women's Olympic hockey tournament will be staged in Nagano for the first time featuring Japan and the best five teams from the women's 1997 world championship in Canada. </P>
