<P>  An informant said Thursday the FBI promised him $45,000 after he agreed to tape conversations that led to a murder-for-hire indictment against the daughter of Malcolm X. </P>
<P> Michael Fitzpatrick also told a court hearing he had used cocaine and crack prior to his involvement in the case. </P>
<P> He said he was paid $34,000 and expects to receive the balance plus expenses as ``compensation for having to relocate and adjust to a new life'' in the witness protection program he re-entered after Qubilah Shabazz was indicted in January. </P>
<P> Shabazz is charged in a federal indictment with trying to hire Fitzpatrick to kill Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, the man Shabazz's family blames for assassinating black activist Malcolm X 30 years ago. </P>
<P> Lawyers for the 34-year-old Shabazz called Fitzpatrick to testify before U.S. Magistrate Franklin Noel in their effort to have the indictment quashed. They contend Fitzpatrick entrapped Shabazz for profit and personal motives, pushing her into a plot that she was increasingly reluctant to pursue. </P>
<P> Fitzpatrick, also 34, said he signed a consent form with the FBI on Aug. 12, 1994, agreeing to be video-taped. On or about that date he said FBI Agent Dan Lund gave him an oral promise that he would be paid $45,000 for his trouble. </P>
<P> Fitzpatrick said he met Shabazz at a train station on her arrival from New York Aug. 12, took her to a hotel in a car supplied by the FBI and discussed the plot with her while the FBI made video and audio tapes. </P>
<P> He said he had signed earlier consent forms in late July agreeing to tape or be taped in telephone conversations with Shabazz, a former high school schoolmate. </P>
<P> Under questioning by a defense lawyer, Fitzpatrick said he was tossed out of the house he shared last July 4 after his roomates discovered he was using crack and cocaine. He also denied defense suggestions that an FBI investigation of a rare coin business where he worked pressured him to agree to be taped with Shabazz. </P>
<P> Fitzpatrick is a former member of the Jewish Defense League who was in the witness protection program once before after he turned informant in a 1978 plot by the militant group to bomb an Egyptian government tourist office in New York. </P>
