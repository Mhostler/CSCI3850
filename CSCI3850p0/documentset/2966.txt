<DATELINE>TUNCELI, Turkey (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Turkish forces say they killed 47 Kurdish guerrillas in three days' fighting in the eastern province of Tunceli after the rebels blundered into army ambushes while seeking food and shelter in bitter cold. </P>
<P> Tunceli officials said Friday thousands of soldiers backed by helicopter gunships had pounded Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) guerrillas in three locations but blizzards were hampering the army operation. </P>
<P> ``The fighting is getting very intense in some points, but although the rebels are still encircled, bad weather has slowed operations at times,'' an army official said. ``New operations are being suspended this morning due to bad weather.'' </P>
<P> The army last Saturday began a winter push against the guerrillas in Tunceli, which this summer became the scene of what one army officer called the biggest military operation in modern Turkish history. </P>
<P> Fighting intensified three days ago, when guerrillas, denied food and shelter by army tactics that included forcibly evacuating villages, entered areas they would normally steer clear of and clashed with the army. </P>
<P> About 10,000 troops took part in the week's clashes, backed by Super Cobra helicopters. </P>
