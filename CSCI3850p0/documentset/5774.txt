<DATELINE>SEOUL, April 16 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Two South Korean religious leaders returned home on Sunday from an illegal trip to the communist North by passing through the border village of Panmunjom, a Unification Ministry official said. </P>
<P> ``The two crossed over as scheduled at 11:30 am (0230 GMT),'' the official said. </P>
<P> He said the two would be taken to a hospital for a check-up before being questioned by prosecutors about their trip to Pyongyang. </P>
<P> Ahn Ho-sang, 93, head of the Daejonggyo faith which reveres Korea's mythical founder Tangun, and chief administrator Kim Son-jok entered North Korea via China on Tuesday without permission from the Seoul government. </P>
<P> The government had rejected Ahn and Kim's request to visit North Korea, and requested that the trip be delayed until after May because of rising tensions on the Korean Peninsula. </P>
<P> Unauthorised contacts with North Korea can be punished by up to three years in jail. South and North Korea are still technically at war since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce. </P>
<P> Ahn served as South Korea's first education minister from 1948 to 1950. In 1992, he was elected head of Daejonggyo, which has about 500,000 members. </P>
<P> According to a report by Pyongyang's official KCNA news agency on Thursday, the two visited what the North says is the 4,000-year-old tomb of Tangun. </P>
<P> According to legend, Tangun's father was the Son of Heaven and his mother a woman transformed from a bear. He establised the first Korean kingdom of Chosun, the legend says. </P>
<P> Last year, North Korea reported the completion of restoration work on the tomb. South Korean officials have said the body of North Korea's ``Great Leader'' Kim Il-sung, who died in July last year, might be buried in or near the tomb. </P>
<P> Before his death, Kim Il-sung had ordered it rebuilt and preserved as a way of boosting national pride and patriotism. </P>
