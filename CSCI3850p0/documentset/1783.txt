<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Colombia's prosecutor-general has begun an investigation into a possible second assassination attempt against the brother of deceased drug lord Pablo Escobar, a spokesman said Monday. </P>
<P> Roberto Escobar complained in a letter that someone had tried to shoot him as he walked on a patio in Itagui maximum security prison outside the northwestern city of Medellin. </P>
<P> He said a bullet whistled above his head. </P>
<P> It would the second attempt on his life since he was imprisoned in Medellin two years ago. Roberto was left partially deaf and blind last December after a letter bomb exploded in his face. </P>
<P> ``I have been the victim of a possible attempt (against my life) for the second time,'' read the hand-written letter, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters. ``(We) found the remains of a bullet that seems to have been shot by a nine-mm pistol with a silencer.'' </P>
<P> Although he had accused the rival Cali cartel for the bombing, he did not blame anyone for the shooting. </P>
<P> Roberto and other former members of the Medellin cartel surrendered in October 1992 after escaping from prison with Pablo Escobar three months earlier. </P>
<P> Escobar was shot dead by a special army and police team last December in Medellin. </P>
