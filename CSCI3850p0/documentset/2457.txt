<P>  Legal maneuvering in the Susan Smith murder case began Monday, a day after her two small sons were buried as she sat in a state prison cell charged with their murders. </P>
<P> Smith was charged with two counts of murder last week after police said she told them she drove her Mazda Protege into a nearby lake with her sons, Alex, 14 months, and Michael, three, strapped into their child safety seats. </P>
<P> No court proceedings have been scheduled for the next week, but the case is expected to be heard by a local grand jury by mid-December. To date, she has made no formal plea. </P>
<P> The case has riveted the attention of millions of Americans who had sympathized with the slight 23-year-old mother's initial story -- later proved a hoax -- that a black carjacker seized her vehicle and drove off with the two little boys in the back seat. </P>
<P> Circuit Judge John Hayes held a 45-minute conference call with defense attorney David Bruck and with prosecutor Tom Pope Monday to discuss the widespread media coverage of the case. </P>
<P> Hayes asked lawyers to stop disclosing information to the news media, Bruck said. </P>
<P> Bruck, a locally prominent criminal lawyer retained by Smith's family, said an informal gag order was requested after a series of media disclosures. </P>
<P> Meanwhile, Bruck and local police tried to minimize news reports quoting unidentified sources as saying another suspect might be charged in the high-profile murder case. </P>
<P> Both Cable News Network (CNN) and CBS Radio news reported that a possible accomplice might be arrested and charged with helping Smith carry out the slayings. </P>
<P> The judge expressed concern about a Cable News Network interview that contained segments of Smith's reported confession to police and a Newsweek magazine article reporting that Smith saw the elder child struggling to escape from his safety seat just before her Mazda Protege overturned and sank, Bruck said. </P>
<P> In an interview with CNN, Bruck denied the magazine's report and sought to back up his argument by releasing segments of a statement Smith gave to police, he said. </P>
<P> Smith, who was in the midst of divorce proceedings and had recently broken up with a boyfriend, remained jailed in isolation and under a suicide watch. </P>
<P> Bruck said he had not ruled out any potential defense strategy, including a claim of temporary insanity. </P>
<P> The attorney also responded to Georgia Congressman Newt Gingrich's campaign remarks about the Smith case. </P>
<P> Over the weekend, Gingrich referred to the murders of the two toddlers as evidence of ``how sick this society is getting'' and how the only way to bring about change is to elect Republicans. </P>
<P> ``I can't imagine how this heartbreaking tragedy could have anything to do with an election,'' Bruck said. </P>
<P> Prosecutors declined to comment about the case Monday. </P>
