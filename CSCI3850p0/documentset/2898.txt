<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A jury began deliberations Tuesday to decide whether rap artist Tupac Shakur and his road manager sexually molested a young woman or were victims of a fan seeking revenge. </P>
<P> Shakur, 22, and Charles Fuller, 23, are charged with forcibly sodomizing and sexually abusing the woman in Shakur's Manhattan hotel suite on Nov. 18, 1993. </P>
<P> They also face weapons possession charges. </P>
<P> During the monthlong trial, the 21-year-old woman testified she willingly slept with Shakur but never consented to having group sex with his friends. </P>
<P> Defense lawyers contend that the alleged victim became jealous and went into a rage after seeing Shakur with another woman, his former publicist, in the hotel suite. </P>
<P> The woman testified that Shakur's friends burst into the room where she and the rapper were making love, groped her and forced her to have oral sex with them. </P>
<P> The defense rested its case last week without calling the two accused men to testify. </P>
<P> Outside the courthouse Tuesday, Shakur denied forcing the woman to have group sex. </P>
<P> ``No matter what happens, innocent or guilty, my life is ruined. All you want to hear is that he's guilty and that the reign of terror is over, the outlaw is gone,'' he said. </P>
<P> Shakur said his accuser made up the story ``because hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.'' </P>
<P> If the jury of nine women and three men convicts Shakur and Fuller on the sodomy charge alone, they could be sentenced to up to 25 years in prison. </P>
