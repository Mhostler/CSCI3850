<P>  The U.S. Embassy in Kenya protested Thursday about the treatment of hundreds of homeless people after they were forced out of temporary camps by police for the second time in two weeks. </P>
<P> Police Wednesday dispersed more than 700 displaced people from three sites where they were dumped last month with promises they would be resettled. The people, mainly from the large Kikuyu tribe, were victims of bloody ethnic clashes in 1993. </P>
<P> They were among about 2,000 moved by police out of their camp at Maela in the western Rift Valley region over the Christmas weekend and dumped at Kirigiti and other sites between 40 and 110 miles from Nairobi. </P>
<P> ``The U.S. Embassy remains strongly concerned about the plight of the Maela clash victims that were recently abruptly relocated,'' a statement said. </P>
<P> ``According to the press reports we have seen they have now been violently evicted from these sites in dawn raids yesterday.'' </P>
<P> The statement, the second since the victims in Maela were moved out on Dec. 23 and 24, called on President Daniel arap Moi's government to respect the victims' basic human rights. </P>
<P> Witnesses said armed police raided at least three temporary camps early Wednesday, ordering about 700 people onto lorries. Some of those who refused were beaten and bundled aboard. </P>
<P> They were later dropped off in small groups at their places of birth as mentioned on their identification cards. Nairobi newspapers said their makeshift camps were flattened. </P>
<P> Many of the dispersed later made their way back to Catholic church premises at Kiambu and sought refuge there, local newspapers reported Thursday. </P>
<P> In a New Year's speech to the nation, Moi said that the displaced who had been moved from Maela by police should be dispersed as most people in Kenya did not own land. </P>
<P> Senior government officials say privately that the dispersed Kikuyu are frauds who never owned land and are trying to obtain it by masquerading as victims of the 1993 clashes. </P>
<P> But church leaders and opposition politicians insist that most of the people are genuine victims who have documents to prove they owned land. </P>
<P> Aid workers said they believed Moi decided that he no longer wanted the unsightly camps for displaced in Kenya. The crackdown began after Kenya had secured aid pledges from Western donors in Paris last month of up to $800 million. </P>
<P> Moi also lashed out at the U.N. Development Program (UNDP), saying although the agency criticized resettlement methods and efforts, he had not seen any of the $20 million it pledged for the project last year. </P>
