<P>  Greg Burgess, the 1992 Olympic silver medalist in the 200-metre individual medley, won the event at the U.S. national swimming championship Friday. </P>
<P> Burgess swam away from the rest of the field, his winning time of 2:00.90, 6/100ths of a second off his career-best and a second better than second place finisher Eric Namesnik. </P>
<P> Burgess though was not completely satisifed with his effort. </P>
<P> ``It's hard not to pay attention to the other swimmers in my event around the world because they're swimming so fast,'' Burgess, 22, said.'' I know I can swim faster than I did tonight. I didn't have the greatest summer of training, I was a little burned out.'' </P>
<P> Fourteen-year-old Whitney Phelps won the 200-meter butterfly in 2:11.04. </P>
<P> Other winners were: Carlton Bruner in the 1500-metre freestyle in 15:12.37 and Amy Van Dyken in the 50-metre freestyle in 25.37, finishing ahead of Olympians Angel Martino and Jenny Thompson. Barbara Bedord won the 200-metre backstroke in 2:11.29. </P>
<P> The seven-day competition served as the selection trials for the Sept. 1-11 World Aquatics Championships in Rome. First through fourth-place finishers in the 100 and 200 metre freestyles and all event winners as well as the top two in all other individual events qualified. </P>
