<DATELINE>SARAJEVO, April 20 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  U.N. special envoy Yasushi Akashi arrived in Sarajevo on Thursday to seek an extension of Bosnia's shattered ceasefire after France warned it might withdraw its peacekeeping troops. </P>
<P> ``Neither side has given up the war option. And that was the obstacle to the extension of the ceasefire,'' Akashi told reporters before meeting Bonsian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic. </P>
<P> As Akashi landed, Silajdzic rejected an extension of the battered four-month truce as demanded by France as a condition for keeping its troops in Bosnia, the local ONASA news agency reported. </P>
<P> ``We clearly emphasised the conditions under which we would accept a new ceasefire agreement. It is true that we have received demands, especially from the Contact Group to accept an extension, but there will be no extension,'' Silajdzic said. </P>
<P> The Moslem-led Bosnian government says the truce, due to expire on May 1, can be extended only if its Bosnian Serb foes accept a peace plan proposed by the Contact Group -- France, the United States, Russia, Germany and Britain -- or Serbia recognises Bosnia. </P>
<P> The plan would divide the country roughly in half between the two warring sides. </P>
<P> The Bosnian Serbs have also refused to extend the ceasefire. </P>
<P> Akashi said any truce negotiations must be followed up by diplomatic efforts to restart the peace process, stalled by the Bosnian Serb rejection of the Contact Group plan. </P>
<P> ``I think it is important for us to provide necessary space for further diplomatic negotiations. I have been calling on the international community to accelerate its efforts to get a political agreement,'' Akashi said. </P>
<P> ``There is a limit beyond which we cannot keep military stability on the ground, so our work is made very difficult because of a lack of progress on the diplomatic front.'' </P>
<P> The four-month truce is in tatters after fighting flared in central and nothern Bosnia last month and gained in intensity in the northwest Bihac pocket where it had never stopped. </P>
<P> Akashi said: ``We not only should try to extend the agreement but to strengthen it so that its compliance will be much more rigorous otherwise it will not be a serious agreement.'' </P>
<P> His mission coincides with deteriorating security in the Bosnian capital and angry words from France, which said the future of the U.N. mission had been called into question after two French soldiers were killed by snipers last week. </P>
<P> The U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution on Wednesday calling on the Bosnian government and their Serb foes to halt attacks on peacekeepers and agree to extend the truce. </P>
<P> Hours earlier, a mortar bomb hit the parking area of a barracks occupied by French peacekeeping troops in Sarajevo, damaging vehicles but causing no casualties. </P>
