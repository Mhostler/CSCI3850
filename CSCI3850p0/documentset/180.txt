<P>  Burma's military intelligence chief said he would accept an invitation to meet with an imprisoned opposition leader and Nobel laureate to show his government is willing to work with ``politicians who have opposed us in the past,'' The New York Times reported Tuesday. </P>
<P> The intelligence chief, Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt, did not set a date for the meeting with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, and said the timing could only be set after further deliberations within the junta, the report said. </P>
<P> It said a meeting between the opposition leader and the powerful military official would be at least a symbolic step toward political reform in the country also known as Myanmar. </P>
<P> In a story from Rangoon, the capital, the newspaper said. General Khin Nyunt was notably conciliatory in an interview toward the democracy leader who is the Oxford-educated daughter of the Burmese independence hero, Aung San. </P>
<P> ``Daw Aung San Suu Kyi is not an enemy,'' he was quoted as saying. ``In fact, she is the daughter of one of our generals. She is younger than me, and I think of her like a younger sister.'' </P>
<P> The freedom of Aung San Suu Kyi, who was put under house arrest in 1989 in a violent military crackdown on the democracy movement, is seen as key for Burma in its attempt to restore full diplomatic and trade relations with the United States and other Western countries, the report said. </P>
<P> ``We are willing to work hand in hand with politicians who have opposed us in the past,'' General Khin Nyunt was quoted as saying. He noted the military junta had signed settlements recently with rebel groups supported by Burma's ethnic minorities. </P>
<P> In February, the opposition leader was allowed to meet with a delegation led by a U.S. congressman -- her first non-family foreign visitors since 1989 -- and told them she was ready to meet with the general and other junta leaders at any time. </P>
<P> The invitation for talks was made by the lawmaker, Representative Bill Richardson, a Democrat from New Mexico, who has offered to mediate between the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner and the junta. </P>
<P> In the interview, General Khin Nyunt said it was too early to discuss an agenda for the meeting, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> It said diplomats and other Burmese officials said the meeting almost certainly would not occur before a national constitutional convention reconvened in September. </P>
