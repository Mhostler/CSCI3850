<P>  The landmark Eros statue in London's Piccadilly Circus is now protected from vandals by an electronic surveillance system that tells trespassers to keep off, an official said Tuesday. </P>
<P> The $60,000, 24-hour system is linked to a nearby security office and if anyone climbs the statue a disembodied voice from metal-encased speakers booms: ``Do not touch the statue. Please move away!'' </P>
<P> A spokesman for Westminster City Council said the system was fitted after a climbing vandal broke Eros' leg. </P>
<P> ``If people want to sit around the rim of the statue, no problem,'' the spokesman said. ``But if they insist on climbing, we will ward them off.'' </P>
