<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A majority of European Union members condemned Canada Thursday for what they said was continuing harassment of Spanish trawlers off the Newfoundland coast, but Britain abstained. </P>
<P> A French official said the condemnation had the support of the very large majority of EU states. </P>
<P> The EU Council of Fisheries Ministers ``condemns the latest unilateral action taken against vessels bearing the flag of a member state in violation of the rules and customs of international law and measures of the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization,'' an EU presidency statement said. </P>
<P> Officials said Britain refused to support the statement. </P>
<P> Britain said earlier it needed more evidence to support Spanish allegations that a Canadian patrol boat had cut the nets of a Spanish trawler. </P>
<P> It said it did not want to prejudice negotiations in Brussels to end the bitter dispute over fishing rights for Greenland halibut, also knonw as turbot. </P>
