<P>  A group of moderate House Democrats Friday called on Congress to postpone any new tax cuts until lawmakers took firm action to reduce the federal budget deficit. </P>
<P> ``Deficit reduction is the single biggest tax cut for all Americans. Deficit reduction keeps the growing economy moving in the right direction,'' said Indiana Democrat Tim Roemer. </P>
<P> Roemer and 19 Democratic colleagues introduced a resolution this week calling on Congress to make deficit reduction a high priority and to use any savings from spending cut legislation under debate to reduce federal red ink. </P>
<P> The House Republicans' Contract with America includes a host of new tax cuts estimated to cost $200 billion over five years. The tax breaks include a reduction in the capital gains tax rate and a $500-per-child tax credit. </P>
<P> Republicans have promised to pay for the tax breaks by cutting spending. In addition, President Clinton and House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, have come forth with their own proposals to cut middle class taxes. </P>
<P> Roemer and other Democrats said their constituents wanted Congress to use spending cuts for deficit reduction, not tax breaks. </P>
<P> ``I think Mr. and Mrs. America are right. I like everyone else would like to see tax cuts, but only if we're making progress ... in balancing this budget,'' said Alabama Democrat Glen Browder. </P>
<P> Some Senate Republicans have indicated that they are not inclined to go along with the deep tax cuts planned by the House Republicans. </P>
