<P>  Rap performer Tupac Shakur arrived in court Thursday with his head bandaged from a shooting wound at the start of the third day of a jury's deliberations on sexual molestation charges against him and his road manager. </P>
<P> Shakur, who co-starred in the movie ``Poetic Justice'' last year, was shot and wounded early Wednesday outside a Manhattan recording studio and robbed of $40,000 in jewels, including a diamond ring and several gold necklaces. </P>
<P> A hospital spokesman said Shakur signed himself out of Bellevue Hospital Wednesday night against doctor's orders. </P>
<P> One of his lawyers said Thursday the rapper checked out because he was concerned about his safety. </P>
<P> ``Bellevue was not secure and Shakur was afraid for his life,'' attorney Robert Ellis said. ``The place was crawling with cops who wanted to speak to him and Shakur doesn't trust them.'' </P>
<P> Shakur suffered a bullet graze to the head and gunshot wounds of the groin, thigh and hand, hospital official said. </P>
<P> Another man with him was shot in the abdomen. </P>
<P> Police said the attackers were three black men in their early 20s. </P>
<P> Shakur, 22, and road manager Charles Fuller, 23, are charged with forcibly sodomizing and sexually abusing a 21-year-old woman fan in a Manhattan hotel suite last year. They have pleaded innocent to all charges, including illegal weapons possession. </P>
<P> Shakur, with his wounded head and hand bandaged, arrived at New York State Supreme Court with Fuller but declined comment. </P>
<P> Judge Daniel Fitzgerald Wednesday explained the absence of the two defendants by telling jurors they were not there because of ``circumstances beyond their control.'' </P>
<P> The woman who brought the charges testified during the month-long trial that she and Shakur were kissing in his hotel room when three of his friends, including Fuller, burst in. </P>
<P> She said she cried hysterically and pleaded for mercy as one of the men tore off her clothes and held her down as the others took turns forcing her to have oral sex with them. </P>
<P> Defense lawyers contended that the victim became jealous and went into a rage after seeing Shakur with another woman in the hotel suite and was seeking revenge against the rapper. </P>
