<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Supreme Court Monday denied an appeal by Dow Corning Corp. challenging an award of more than $7 million in damages to a California woman who had sued over her injuries from the company's silicone gel breast implants. </P>
<P> Mariann Hopkins filed a personal injury lawsuit in 1988 against the company, owned by The Dow Chemical Corp. and Corning Inc., alleging that her rare autoimmune disorder -- mixed connective tissue disease -- had been caused by the breast implants. </P>
<P> Symptoms of the disease include extreme fatigue, weakness, muscle aches and arthritis. There is no known cure. </P>
<P> Hopkins first received the implants in 1976. Three years later she was diagnosed with the disease. Over the years, the implants had to be replaced several times, once after they ruptured. </P>
<P> A jury in San Francisco awarded Hopkins $840,000 in compensatory damages and $6.5 million in punitive damages. </P>
<P> Her attorneys presented evidence at trial that Dow Corning rushed development of the implants, failed to test them adequately and ignored knowledge of adverse health consequences from the implants. </P>
<P> There was testimony that Dow Corning implants experienced a high rate of rupture, in addition to silicon leakage. There also was evidence that no research had been conducted concerning the long-term health effects of the implants. </P>
<P> A U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the award in August, and Dow Corning appealed to the Supreme Court. </P>
<P> It raised a number of issues about the reliability and admissibility of the woman's expert scientific testimony and claimed the punitive damage award was unconstitutionally excessive. </P>
<P> But the high court rejected the company's appeal without comment or dissent. </P>
<P> Dow's stock was off 25 cents at $69.625 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while Corning was up 25 cents at $30.375, also on the NYSE. </P>
