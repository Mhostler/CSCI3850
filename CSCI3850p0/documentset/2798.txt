<P>  The chief investigator in the assassination of Mexico ruling party secretary general Francisco Ruiz Massieu said Wednesday he was resigning his post because of efforts by top party officials to block his investigation. </P>
<P> Deputy Attorney General Mario Ruiz Massieu, the dead man's brother, told a news conference he was also resigning in disgust from the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). </P>
<P> ``My resignation is due to the... resistance and obstacles the party has put in the way of the investigation,'' he told an audience of some 350 journalists and vociferous supporters who cheered and applauded. </P>
<P> In an unprecedented public attack on top PRI officials and on his own boss, Ruiz said he had unearthed evidence that would allow PRI party president Ignacio Pichardo Pagaza, party secretary-general Maria de los Angeles Moreno and Attorney General Humberto Trevino to be charged with ``various crimes''. </P>
<P> Ruiz did not say what crimes, but he has previously accused Pichardo and Moreno of ``conspiring'' with unnamed justice officials to block the investigation. </P>
<P> Pichardo and Moreno have denied the charges. </P>
<P> Ruiz said he had also found solid evidence against a ''political group'' which he suspects ordered the killing. </P>
<P> Further progress in the case depended on ``political decisions'' rather than police work, he said. </P>
<P> Francisco Ruiz Massieu was shot in the neck by a lone gunman as he left a Mexico City hotel Sept. 28. </P>
<P> The gunman was captured at the scene and about a dozen other people have since been arrested in the case. A former PRI member of the lower house Chamber of Deputies, Manuel Munoz Rocha, has been accused of organizing the killing and is a fugitive from justice.  Ruiz has said he believes a group of PRI politicians opposed to democratic reform, including some of national prominence whom he has not named, were behind his brother's killing. </P>
