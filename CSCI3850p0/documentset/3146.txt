<P>  Five Bangladeshi U.N. troops were wounded, one critically, when their armored vehicle was hit in a besieged Muslim enclave in Bosnia by a shell apparently fired by rebel Serbs across the border in Croatia, U.N. officials said. </P>
<P> ``Our initial information is the attack came from the west RSK (Repubiic of Serb Krajina) positions,'' U.N. spokesman Thant Myint-U told Reuters. He said it was not immediately clear whether the personnel carrier, which burst into flames, was hit by an artillery, mortar or anti-tank round. </P>
<P> The attack occurred in the government-held town of Velika Kladusa in the north of the Bihac enclave, which has been under assault by rebel Muslims allied with Serb forces. It was the second attack on the 1,200-strong Bangladeshi battalion, which was rushed into Bihac in October with few weapons and little equipment to replace a departing French contingent. </P>
<P> U.N. spokesman Jan Dirk van Merveldt said a missile from a multiple-rocket launcher landed near a Bangladeshi armored car Sunday as it was approaching a road-block. The U.N. patrol then came under small-arms fire, which punctured one tire. </P>
<P> Last week the United Nations announced that 400 of the Bangladeshis would be withdrawn from Bihac because of problems resupplying them, but they have been unable to leave because the Serbs in the breakaway Krajina area of Croatia have refused permission for them to cross their territory. </P>
<P> A U.N. spokesman in Zagreb said the Bangladeshis might have to request an emergency evacuation for the critically wounded peacekeeper. </P>
