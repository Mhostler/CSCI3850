<P>  A new poll shows for the first time that Argentina's May 14 election, in which President Carlos Menem is seeking a second term, could require a second round of voting, a leading pollster said on Monday. </P>
<P> ``Today, 12 days before the election, our data shows the possibility of a second round. Before, it was unthinkable -- it isn't any longer,'' Enrique Zuleta Puceiro said. </P>
<P> The Sofres-Ibope poll was carried out from April 21-29 and 1,600 people were interviewed. It showed Menem getting 41.6 percent of the vote and his main rival, Jose Bordon, at 34.7 percent. It is the first time a poll shows Menem falling behind the 10-point lead he needs to win in the first round. </P>
<P> The poll shows Bordon, a former member of Menem's Peronist party, gaining ground at the expense of his rival in major cities and is the favorite in the capital Buenos Aires and in Rosario, Argentina's second city. </P>
