<P>  Israel radio said heavy fighting broke out in south Lebanon Friday when Hizbollah guerrillas attacked Israeli and pro-Israeli forces, who retaliated with intense artillery fire. </P>
<P> ``The terrorists began with a heavy shelling of Israeli posts in the eastern sector. In the first round the terrorists fired 50 katyusha rockets, Sagger rockets and mortar bombs,'' it said. </P>
<P> The radio said Israeli army and pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army (SLA) gunners opened up heavy artillery fire after coordinated attacks by the guerrillas in the eastern and western sectors of the buffer zone Israel occupies in the south. </P>
<P> The Israeli army declined to comment on the fighting, but said it would release a statement on the situation in Lebanon later in the day. </P>
<P> The radio said the fighting erupted when the pro-Iranian guerrillas staged an early-morning offensive on an Israeli outpost in the zone's eastern sector. </P>
<P> ``The army and SLA have been shooting back and a heavy exchange of fire has ensued,'' it said. </P>
<P> Hizbollah has vowed to avenge a car bombing in Beirut Wednesday in which three people were killed, at least two of them members of the group. </P>
<P> Hizbollah blamed Israel for the bombing. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin Thursday turned aside reporters' questions about responsibility for the bomb, saying ``the answer to this must be found in Lebanon.'' </P>
