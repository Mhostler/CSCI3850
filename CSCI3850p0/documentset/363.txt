<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The space shuttle Columbia returned to Earth Saturday after a record-setting 15-day mission with seven astronauts, including the first Japanese woman to fly in space. </P>
<P> Marine Colonel Robert Cabana guided Columbia to a touchdown at 6:38 a.m. EDT at the Kennedy Space Center after a voyage of 236 orbits, or 6.1 million miles , breaking a nine-month-old shuttle flight endurance record. </P>
<P> Columbia, the oldest of the four winged shuttles, was able to break the record after foul weather Friday kept it from landing. </P>
<P> ``Excellent, excellent job,'' shuttle communicator Charlie Precourt radioed the crew from Mission Control in Houston after Columbia touched down at sunrise. </P>
<P> He said the new record of 14 days, 17 hours and 55 minutes brought NASA ``closer to the next giant leap for humankind -- when we live permanently in space aboard the international space station.'' </P>
<P> Americans observed the 25th anniversary of the historic Apollo 11 moon landing during the Columbia flight. </P>
<P> ``It's great to be home, and we're all feeling great,'' Cabana said. </P>
<P> Mission managers had worried about clouds and rainshowers that hovered near the shuttle runway early Saturday, but skies cleared to their satisfaction by the time Columbia fired its maneuvering engines to take it out of orbit. </P>
<P> With the shuttle still on its runway, technicians began removing perishable science samples which the six-man, one- woman crew used in flight -- including at least 25 Medaka fish and 32 Japanese red-bellied newts hatched during the mission. </P>
<P> In addition to Cabana, Columbia's crew included co-pilot James Halsell, flight engineer Carl Walz and mission specialists Don Thomas, Richard Hieb and Leroy Chiao. </P>
<P> Tokyo heart surgeon Chiaki Mukai, the first Japanese woman to fly in space, served as a payload specialist. </P>
<P> ``I came back safe and sound. I came back alive,'' an elated Mukai told a news conference several hours after Saturday's landing, adding that it felt strange to be back on Earth. </P>
<P> ``I feel gravity a lot. I feel as if somebody is pushing on my head and shoulders. I even feel the weight of this paper,'' she said, lifting a single blank page. </P>
<P> During the mission equipment problems posed a continual challenge in the European-built Spacelab science laboratory but NASA said only one of 82 scheduled experiments was not conducted. </P>
<P> The investigations represented 13 countries, six of the world's space agencies, and more than 200 scientists. </P>
<P> About half the research involved studies of how living creatures behave and reproduce while free of gravity. The other half involved working with molten metals in a containerless furnace, studies of how fluids and bubbles act in a weightless environment, and tests of gravity-free manufacturing processes. </P>
<P> The 63rd shuttle mission was Columbia's 17th. NASA said its oldest spaceship soon would be taken out of service for more than a year of maintenance and upgrades. </P>
<P> The next shuttle up for launch is Endeavour, tentatively set to fly August 18 with a crew of six on an Earth-mapping radar mission. </P>
