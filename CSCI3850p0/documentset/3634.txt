<DATELINE>KIGALI, Rwanda (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Twelve people were killed and at least 37 injured when unidentified armed gangs attacked Rwandan refugees in a camp in southwest Rwanda Saturday, U.N. officials said Sunday. </P>
<P> Australian and Canadian military medical teams flew to the area and evacuated six badly wounded Rwandans -- including a pregnant woman and three children -- to Kigali for emergency treatment. </P>
<P> The six were evacuated by helicopter and admitted to Kigali Central Hospital, which is run by an Australian military medical team. All six had gunshot wounds, and some appeared also to have been slashed with machetes, an Australian spokesman said. </P>
<P> One child, a girl, died later, but the others were reported to be in stable condition. </P>
<P> U.N. officials said the victims were members of the Hutu majority. </P>
<P> The U.N. force commander, Maj. Gen. Guy Tousignant, said it was not clear who was responsible for the attack, and the matter was under investigation. </P>
<P> The incident took place near Remera, close to the border with Burundi. </P>
<P> The attack was the latest incident in nine months of violence following the death of Rwanda President Juvenal Habyarimana last April. </P>
<P> Habyarimana's death in a plane crash -- along with President Melchior Ndadaye of neighboring Burundi -- sparked a wave of attacks in which up to a million members of the minority Tutsi ethnic group and moderate Hutus were killed. </P>
<P> Habyarimana's Hutu government later collapsed and fled into exile, along with an estimated two million refugees, mostly Hutus. </P>
<P> Armed Hutu gangs, made up of former members of the Rwandan army and militia, have been terrorizing refugees in camps in Zaire and Tanzania, and preventing them from returning to their homes in Rwanda. </P>
