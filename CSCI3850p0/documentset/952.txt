<P>  The United Nations said Tuesday it was worried about a trip to Sarajevo that Pope John Paul II plans to make September 8. </P>
<P> ``We are very concerned by the apparent lack of assurances for the visit from the Serbian side,'' said Paul Risley, U.N. spokesman in Zagreb. </P>
<P> But, asked if the U.N. will advise the Vatican not to go through with the trip, Risley said: ``The Vatican will have to make its own decision.'' </P>
<P> Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, whose forces ring the Bosnian capital, warned recently that the pope's safety could not be assured, saying Muslim-led government forces could try to shoot down his aircraft and blame Serbs. </P>
<P> His remarks were interpreted in Italy as a veiled threat to the pope's safety. </P>
<P> Orthodox Christian Serbs have accused the Vatican of siding with Roman Catholic Croats in the war in former Yugoslavia. </P>
<P> U.N. peacekeeping troops will provide security for the day trip September 8 to arguably the most dangerous destination the 74-year-old Pontiff has visited during his papacy. </P>
<P> The Pope's plane will have to land at an airport that sits across a Serb and Muslim frontline where mortar rounds and bullets have kept air traffic to a minimum in the last month. </P>
<P> U.N. envoy to former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi on Tuesday met the Vatican envoy to Croatia, Gulio Einaudi, to discuss arrangements for the trip. </P>
