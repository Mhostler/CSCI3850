<P>  Dennis Conner's America's Cup hopes suffered a double blow Saturday when he lost a vital match on the water and was stripped on land of a point he picked up in a previous race. </P>
<P> Conner's Stars & Stripes lost to Young America by 52 seconds and the international jury annulled his win Tuesday against America3 (cubed), with whom he is battling for the second spot in the defender finals. </P>
<P> Conner, now one point behind America3, has to win his match against the almost all-women's America3 on Sunday to avoid elimination. If he fails it will be the America's Cup legend's worst result in his 21 years of Cup sailing. </P>
<P> If he wins Sunday, there would be a climactic sail-off on Monday. </P>
<P> Young America had clinched its defender final slot earlier in the week. </P>
<P> The on-shore squabbles among the three defense teams continue to eclipse the on-the-water matches. </P>
<P> All three teams have protests outstanding. </P>
<P> The trigger point was when Stars & Stripes replaced its keel after the boat nearly sank on Sunday. Both America3 and Young America cried foul. </P>
<P> The international jury, after sitting for three nights, responded to two of America3's objections by annulling the first race Stars & Stripes sailed with its new appendage. </P>
<P> However, the ruling was relatively weak. The jury did find that Stars & Stripes had contravened the rules by not seeking mutual consent from the other teams for its change of keel. </P>
<P> But the jury annulled just one of the three races the boat sailed in its new configuration. The race will be re-sailed on Sunday. </P>
<P> Many felt that the ruling was political, made to ensure that Conner had a chance to stay in the game. </P>
<P> ``We are pleased that the jury ruled against Team Dennis Conner,'' said Vincent Moeyersoms, chief operating officer of America3. ``The remedy in no way vindicated Team Dennis Conner from their wrongdoing.'' </P>
<P> The jury was to reconvene on Saturday night to hear five outstanding protests. Four continue the keel saga while the latest -- Stars & Stripes against Young America -- had yet to be clarified. </P>
<P> Conner responded to his ill-timed loss by flying his protest flag against Young America on Saturday, declaring an objection over a technicality. </P>
<P> Microphones picked up the anxiety and dejection aboard Stars & Stripes on Saturday. </P>
<P> ``What really sucks about this whole thing there, America, is that we didn't give this bitch a proper burial when the keel fell off,'' a team member said. </P>
