<P>  A left-wing Israeli cabinet minister has proposed Israel buy peace from the Palestinians, his office said Monday. </P>
<P> Environment Minister Yossi Sarid's office said he made the proposal at Sunday's cabinet meeting during discussion of a ban on entry of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip and West Bank. </P>
<P> ``Sarid has repeated a proposal to pay the Palestinian Authority a billion shekels ($333.3 million) per year in order to permit a permanent closure on the one hand and in order to not create insufferable human and economic distress,'' a statement issued by Sarid's office said. </P>
<P> ``If it is possible to buy better security for a billion shekels and accelerate the peace process there is no better and justified deal,'' the statement said. </P>
<P> The ban was imposed after two suicide bombers from Gaza killed 21 Israelis north of Tel Aviv on January 22. The Palestinian Authority running self-rule in Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho condemns the ban as collective punishment. </P>
