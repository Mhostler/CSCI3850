<P>  Sylvester Stallone says he plans to persuade a major movie studio to set up a base Miami, his newly-adopted city. </P>
<P> In an interview published Sunday in the Miami Herald, Stallone, 48, said he also wants to help establish the city as a mecca for the arts, and to do his part to help address local problems. </P>
<P> ``I think Miami is a little bit more accepting, a little bit more forgiving and a little bit less critical,'' Stallone said of his new home. </P>
<P> He left Los Angeles last year and bought an $8 million waterfront mansion in Miami. Since then, he has hosted several charity events at his home and said he plans to become more active in community affairs. </P>
<P> ``I would like to see if I can bring a little something of what has brought me to where I am -- and contrary to my physical demeanor, that has been culture,'' Stallone told the newspaper. </P>
<P> Stallone, the muscular star of ``Rocky,'' ``Rambo,'' and the ''The Specialist,'' is reportedly commanding a record $20 million fee from Savoy Pictures to star in its next adventure film. </P>
<P> One of his plans is to convince Warner Brothers or another major Hollywood studio to build in Miami a sound studio, post- production facilities and a back-lot attraction open to the public. </P>
<P> ``To put a studio down here independently can be done without a great deal of trouble,'' he told the Herald. ``To do so with the blessing and support of a West Coast studio is not easy because that's kind of admitting something -- that the unwanted stepson has turned into a full-bodied, zestful contender.'' </P>
<P> Stallone's clout with Hollywood has already lured ``Fair Game'' with Cindy Crawford and Billy Baldwin to film some scenes in Miami. </P>
<P> Since he arrived in Miami, Stallone has become friends with singer Gloria Estefan and her husband, record producer, Emilio Estefan. Singer Madonna owns a multi-million-dollar mansion just a couple houses away from Stallone's home. </P>
<P> Stallone's neighbors said he is also active in community events, and sends a representative to regular neighborhood meetings to discuss drug problems in a local park and traffic flow. He has also indicated an interest in supporting the Wolfsonian Museum, the Miami Film Festival, the Miami City Ballet and other arts groups. </P>
