<P>  The Mexican government, pushing for peace with rebels in the southern state of Chiapas, said it has presented a framework for detailed negotiations. </P>
<P> The Interior Ministry said in a statement released late Tuesday that the proposal would be handed to Zapatista rebel leaders via the National Intermediation Commission (Conai), led by Catholic bishop Samuel Ruiz of Chiapas, who has acted as go-between since the uprising began 15 months ago. </P>
<P> It said the army has pulled out of villages in the region and ordered its troops to allow ``the free movement of (rebel) leaders and negotiators, assuring that they are not molested.'' </P>
<P> Army roadblocks have been dismantled and patrols have been reduced to the absolute minimum necessary to protect soldiers, the ministry said. </P>
<P> Just six weeks ago, President Ernesto Zedillo ordered thousands of troops into the dense Lacandon Jungle to capture leaders of the rebel Zapatista National Liberation Army, including its military chief Subcommander Marcos. But Marcos escaped and Zedillo resumed efforts at peace talks. </P>
<P> Rebel leaders said late last week that talks can not begin until the army pulls back to its positions of Feb. 8, giving up the big territorial gains of its recent offensive. They said they were renewing written contact with the government and were open to peace talks once their demand for an army withdrawal was met. </P>
<P> It was not clear if the government had agreed to that demand in its proposal, which was handed to the Conai on Tuesday, but the Interior Ministry said it had already taken a series of steps to reduce tensions and called on the Zapatistas to agree to face-to-face negotiations. </P>
<P> ``The interchange of letters cannot substitute for direct, intense, fluid and constructive dialogue,'' it said, adding that the rebels now had to prove ``their authentic will to negotiate.'' </P>
<P> About 150 people were killed in the first days of the rebellion. Although there has been little fighting since, the Chiapas conflict has been a constant political problem for the government and is complicating its efforts to restore investor confidence and pull the country out of a deep economic crisis. </P>
