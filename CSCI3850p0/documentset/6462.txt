<P>  Twenty people in a second Zairean town are suspected of being infected with the Ebola virus, now confirmed as causing an outbreak that has already killed dozens, the World Health Organization (WHO) said Thursday. </P>
<P> The United Nations agency also said it expected more cases of Ebola disease, a form of hemorrhagic fever, to occur ``in the vicinity'' of Kikwit, the epidemic's main site. </P>
<P> At least 59 people in Kikwit have died from Ebola virus, which causes fever, hemorrhage and vomiting as tissues dissolve. There is no known antidote. </P>
<P> Yet WHO said that, if people in direct contact with victims of the virus were given adequate protection, it should be possible to stop it spreading to the rest of Zaire. </P>
<P> In an official statement, WHO said that the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control, which analyzed blood samples from patients in Kikwit, had confirmed that the Ebola virus caused the outbreak of haemorrhagic fever in the city of 500,000. </P>
<P> When a team of WHO experts arrived at the 350-bed Kikwit hospital, they found it abandoned except for about 20 patients, according to the statement. Hundreds of exposed patients, joined by hundreds of staff, had apparently fled. </P>
<P> ``Given that many patients have left the Kikwit hospital, we must expect some additional transmission of the disease. However, we believe this will be limited to people who are in prolonged intimate contact with sufferers of the disease,'' said Dr. Ralph Henderson, an assistant director-general of WHO. </P>
<P> ``It is unlikely that this outbreak will have implications for Zaire as a whole or for international travel,'' he added. </P>
<P> The WHO statement said: ``The WHO team has also reports of about 20 suspected cases in a second hospital, about 60 miles from Kikwit, which received one of the patients from Kikwit.'' </P>
<P> WHO has sent an expert to investigate the 20 suspected cases at the hospital at Masengo, where an Italian nun is believed to have died this week after being taken there for treatment from Kikwit. A second Italian nun is also among the known victims. </P>
<P> Dr. Lindsey Martinez, a WHO viral specialist, told Reuters: ``Unfortunately, a second hospital is involved as one of the nuns was taken from the first hospital and transferred to Masengo. </P>
<P> ``It looks as if there is a second outbreak,'' she added. </P>
<P> Masengo lies some 60 miles west of Kikwit, along the road from Kikwit to the Zairean capital of Kinshasa. </P>
<P> A team of international medical experts, trying to prevent the further spread of the virus, is handing out sterile gowns and other protective clothing and equipment at Kikwit hospital. </P>
<P> At the request of Zaire's government, they are advising local health officials on the care and management of patients. </P>
<P> Ebola virus, first identified in 1976 in Zaire, is a very rare but highly fatal infection which has had mortality rates as high as 80 per cent, according to the Geneva-based WHO. </P>
<P> The only reported outbreaks were in Zaire in 1976 and Sudan in 1979. </P>
<P> The primary mode of transmission of Ebola virus is contact with contaminated blood, secretions or body fluids. </P>
<P> ``The virus is not easily transmitted, however, and requires intimate contact with an infected person, such as close nursing contact, or with contaminated materials,'' WHO said. </P>
