<P>  A U.N. peace broker held talks with Sierra Leone's military leader Friday and said both the government and rebels, holding at least 17 foreigners, had assured him of their cooperation. </P>
<P> Ethiopian diplomat Berhanu Dinka, special envoy of U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, began his mission by meeting Captain Valentine Strasser who took power in 1992 promising to end the war which is now four years old. </P>
<P> He is one of a flurry of envoys converging on Sierra Leone in response to a government call for help in ending the conflict which has killed about 5,000 people and spread to much of the country. </P>
<P> ``I was very much encouraged from what Captain Strasser told me about his government's position to the crisis,'' he told journalists. ``I am going to use all means in my power to find a lasting solution to the rebel war as they have also assured me of their cooperation in this regard,'' he added. </P>
<P> Foday Sankoh's Revolutionary United Front launched its revolt from Liberia in 1991. </P>
<P> Seven nuns are among 17 foreigners who have disappeared after rebel attacks since November. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has been in contact with the RUF over the captives. </P>
<P> A Commonwealth peace mission is expected to arrive in the capital Freetown Monday, a government official said. </P>
<P> Former colonial power Britain, the United States, Italy and the Netherlands have advised their citizens against visiting Sierra Leone. </P>
