<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark.(Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Special prosecutor Kenneth Starr has notified James McDougal, President Clinton's former business partner, that he is a target in the Whitewater investigation, McDougal's lawyer said Thursday. </P>
<P> ``Responding to my inquiries, Mr. Starr has informed us that Jim (McDougal) is, in fact, a target,'' said the lawyer, Sam Heuer. </P>
<P> He said Starr informed him in a letter he received Tuesday of his wish to interview McDougal as part of his probe into the Whitewater affair. </P>
<P> ``Mr. McDougal has given me every indication in the past that he has no desire to be interviewed by the independent counsel,'' Heuer added. ``My feeling is that, absent any type of interview, this thing (Starr's letter) would result in an indictment and trial.'' </P>
<P> McDougal was the Clintons' partner in the Whitewater real estate venture, in which the Clintons say they lost $69,000. McDougal also controlled Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan, the failed thrift seized by regulators in 1989 at a cost to taxpayers of more than $60 million. </P>
<P> Starr is investigating whether depositors' funds were improperly used to keep the Whitewater resort solvent or improperly channeled to back one of Clinton's Arkansas gubernatorial campaigns. </P>
<P> Interest in the Clintons' financial affairs flared after White House counsel Vincent Foster committed suicide in July of last year. Whitewater files were taken from Foster's office after his death and handed over to Clinton's personal attorney. </P>
<P> Heuer said Starr's letter ``starts a whole new ball game for us. I'll be attempting at every turn to ascertain what the independent counsel's office wants to discuss with Jim. </P>
<P> ``Jim has maintained throughout that he would prefer to tell his story to an independent jury of his peers,'' Heuer said. ``I don't guess anybody actually looks forward to a trial, but if that is what it takes to purge the country of this plague, then I suppose Jim is ready for trial despite his current health.'' </P>
<P> McDougal suffered a stroke in the 1980's and underwent surgery. He has also said he is taking medication for manic depression. </P>
<P> Heuer said McDougal had declined an ``invitation'' to appear before a federal grand jury approximately a year ago. </P>
<P> McDougal was acquitted in 1990 of federal bank fraud charges stemming from his ownership of Madison Guaranty. </P>
<P> The Clintons have denied any wrongdoing in the handling of their personal finances and David Hale, the only person to publicly accuse the president of illegal activity, has himself been convicted on Whitewater-related charges. </P>
<P> Hale, a former Little Rock judge, lawyer and businessman, pleaded guilty to mail fraud last March, becoming the first person convicted in the Whitewater investigation. </P>
<P> The ex judge, who has accused Clinton of pressuring him to make illegal loans, failed to contest a petition by the U.S. District Court to revoke his license to practice law in federal courts and has effectively been disbarred, his lawyer Randy Coleman said Thursday. </P>
