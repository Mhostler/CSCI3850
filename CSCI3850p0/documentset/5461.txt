<P>  Major power diplomats Tuesday agreed to push Bosnia's government to extend a truce already shot to pieces on the battlefield. </P>
<P> Senior officials from the five-nation Contact Group trying to forge a peace settlement in former Yugoslavia failed to unite on a key item at their London meeting, a deal offering Belgrade a gradual end to a U.N-trade embargo. </P>
<P> But the officials from the United States, Russia, Britain, Germany and France agreed they would press the Muslim-led government, which has already expressed reluctance to prolong the truce, to agree to an extension, diplomats said. </P>
<P> The four-month cease-fire, due to expire on May 1, has been shattered by fierce fighting in the past two weeks. </P>
<P> Diplomats said the Contact Group would try to solve its internal differences in the next weeks and hoped to travel to Balkan capitals to present a deal by the end of the month. </P>
<P> Before the meeting, diplomats said the Group might approve a French plan to offer rump Yugoslavia a gradual suspension of the sanctions imposed for backing warring Serbs in Bosnia in exchange for moves towards recognizing its neighbors. </P>
<P> Officials declined to comment on problems over the proposal but said there were ``fairly different viewpoints'' in the Group. </P>
<P> Russia is known to favor a quick end to sanctions but the United States views Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic as largely responsible for war in the Balkans and is reluctant to reward him. </P>
<P> The group believes Milosevic's recognition of Bosnia and Croatia would further isolate seperatist Bosnian Serbs, end Serbian nationalists' dream of a ``Greater Serbia'' and bolster the Sarajevo government. </P>
<P> But in Sarajevo a U.N. official said he doubted recognition would push the Bosnian Serbs any closer to agreeing to the Contact Group peace deal dividing Bosnia proposed last year. </P>
<P> ``What we're seeing is a desperate flailing around for some initiative to make it seem there's movement towards a negotiated settlement to the war,'' said a U.N. official who asked not to be named. </P>
<P> The Bosnian government says its Serb foes must accept the peace plan before it will stop fighting and says it believes cease-fires cement Serb control over the 70 percent of the country they hold. </P>
<P> The Sarajevo government has not yet responded to Tuesday's truce extension proposal. A United States official said on Monday he expected strong resistance to the suggestion from Bosnia's Muslim leaders. </P>
<P> It is unclear what effect extending the cease-fire will have on the situation on the ground, given that the truce has recently been shown scant respect by either side. </P>
<P> The Bosnian government launched a new two-prong offensive on March 20 and Bosnian Serbs responded by shelling U.N.-declared civilian ``safe areas.'' </P>
<P> The U.N. said Bosnia was relatively quiet Tuesday, apart from shelling in the northeastern Majevica Hills and a Serb artillery attack on the northwestern Bihac ``safe area.'' </P>
