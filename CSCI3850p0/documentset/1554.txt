<P>  The Canadian government has not followed through on its pledge to compensate Chinese-Canadians forced to pay a ``head tax'' entering the country at the turn of the century, a Chinese-Canadian organization charged Thrusday. </P>
<P> Six years after Canada reached a settlement with Japanese-Canadians interned during World War II, the head of the Chinese Canadian National Council, Victor Yukman Wong, said time was running out for Canada to redress the issue of Chinese immigrants. </P>
<P> The survivors of the tax, requiring Chinese immigrants to pay a fee to get into Canada, are now in their 80s and 90s. </P>
<P> ``Until recently, Canada has traditionally been a white, European country,'' said Wong. ``It has been that way because of its racist legislation.'' </P>
<P> The ``head tax'' of $50, which no other immigrant group was ever subject to, was implemented in 1885. By the time it was abolished in 1923, the fee had incresed to $500. </P>
<P> In 1923, the legislation was replaced by the Chinese Exclusion Act, which effectively cut off all further immigration from China. It was repealed in 1947. </P>
