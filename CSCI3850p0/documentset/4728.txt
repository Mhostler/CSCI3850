<P>  Australian newcomer Mark Philippoussis has had a dream week at the $328,000 MassMutual Tennis Championships even if he loses against Jim Courier in Sunday's final. </P>
<P> The 18-year-old Philippoussis powered his way past top seed Todd Martin 7-6 (7-3), 6-3 in Saturday's first semifinal clash. In the other semi, Courier, the second seed, rallied to bounce third seed Stefan Edberg of Sweden 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 6-4 in a battle of former top-ranked players. </P>
<P> ``I always hoped I could get this far,'' said Philippoussis, who pounded nine aces with a first serve clocked at 127 mph and a second that often hit 110. ``But I never thought it would happen so early in my career.'' </P>
<P> Philippoussis, who began the week ranked No. 272, could be the first qualifier to win an ATP Tour title since Spain's Jordi Burillo won at Bologna, Italy in 1993. </P>
<P> ``I'm just going to go out and play my game,'' he said of the championship. ``I'm playing well and have nothing to lose.'' </P>
<P> In only his fifth professional tournament, Philippoussis's power proved too much for the 12th-ranked Martin during the 77-minute upset. </P>
<P> ``I didn't win doing anything special,'' said the 1994 Wimbledon juniors finalist, whose stunning forehand was as effective as his serve. ``I just played solid and tough.'' </P>
<P> Without the benefit of a service break, Philippoussis took the opening set by dominating the tiebreaker. </P>
<P> ``When I got to the tiebreaker, I just charged to the net, attacked and made him pass me,'' he said. ``He gave me some easy volleys and missed a couple of passing shots.'' </P>
<P> Philippoussis got the only break he needed in the second game of the second set, ripping a backhand service return on break point for a 2-0 cushion. The Australian withstood only two break points. </P>
<P> Martin knew Philippoussis had a big serve, but he couldn't handle it. </P>
<P> ``I might as well have been a spectator,'' said Martin after his nine-match win streak was stopped. ``It was like I was watching him hit or miss. I was one of the few who enjoyed seeing him miss rather than hit. </P>
<P> Courier struggled to his second final of the year after blowing a 4-1 second-set lead and 3-1 advantage in the decisive set. </P>
<P> ``It's not pretty but it's over. That's the good news,'' said Courier, who improved to 6-4 including four straight wins, against Edberg. ``I have a chance to come back and play better. That's what I hope to do.'' </P>
<P> ``I hung in there mentally, and kept fighting. I had some many chances but I couldn't put it away. But I got it done. It's a W in the books and that felt good.'' </P>
<P> Courier got help when at 5-4 Edberg double-faulted away the first set. The American jumped to a 4-1 advantage before Edberg forced the tiebreaker. Courier blew a 4-0 lead before committing one of his eight double-faults at set point. </P>
<P> Again Courier held a 3-1 lead, this time in the third set before the Swede rallied for 4-all. But Edberg served his fifth double-fault of the match at game point. At 5-4, Courier closed out the match with a booming serve to the backhand side. </P>
<P> ``I should be happy to play three sets,'' said Edberg ``It could have been over in an hour. I never was in the match.'' </P>
