<P>  Hardline Northern Ireland Protestant politician Ian Paisley Thursday seized on controversial comments by the IRA's political wing as further evidence the guerrilla force's month-long ceasefire is a ploy. </P>
<P> Paisley said the refusal of Sinn Fein deputy leader Martin McGuinness to use the word ``permanent'' to describe the Irish Republican Army's ceasefire was a ``blatant threat.'' </P>
<P> Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, challenged British Prime Minister John Major to respond firmly to McGuinness's remarks and prove to the satisfaction of suspicious Protestants there were no secret deals to secure the IRA truce. </P>
<P> ``If that is what the British government is prepared to accept, then we can see the way this is going and it proves exactly what I have been saying that there is a deal struck,'' Paisley said. </P>
<P> Paisley accused Britain of weakening its resolve that the IRA or Sinn Fein guarantee a ``permanent'' end to hostilities. </P>
<P> If there was going to be peace it had to be built on the right foundations, Paisley told the BBC. ``You can't build on sinking sands and that is what they are trying to do,'' he said. </P>
<P> It is the second time in three days that newspaper comments by the Sinn Fein leadership have fuelled fears among Northern Ireland's pro-British Protestants about future IRA actions. </P>
<P> Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader currently on a U.S. tour, came under fire from Protestant politicians and British ministers after he said he could not rule out a new, more aggressive IRA leadership emerging if the present peace opportunity in Northern Ireland was not grasped. </P>
