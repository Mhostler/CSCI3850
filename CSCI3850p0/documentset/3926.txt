<P>  Palestinian police detained the chief spokesman of Islamic Jihad twice Tuesday, two days after the militant group said it killed 19 Israelis in a suicide bombing. </P>
<P> Abdallah al-Shami was taken away by Palestinian police for a second time from a wake for one of the two bombers in Gaza City, family members said. </P>
<P> ``They came this afternoon to the wake saying they had a warrant for his arrest and then they took him,'' Shami's brother told Reuters. </P>
<P> Earlier Tuesday, police in Palestinian-ruled Gaza detained Shami for two hours. When he was released, he told reporters: </P>
<P> ``It wasn't an arrest. They called me to a consultation and discussion about the present security and social situation the area is under after the operation which took place recently.'' </P>
<P> The PLO, which is under Israeli pressure to crack down on Muslim militants, pledged Monday to take action against Islamic activists when evidence of their involvement in anti-Israeli attacks is uncovered. </P>
<P> Shami said Monday the bombing in central Israel was a legitimate attack against Israeli occupation soldiers and part of an ``open-ended struggle against the enemy.'' </P>
