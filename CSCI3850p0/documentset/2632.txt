<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A violent demonstration outside the British ambassador's residence in Buenos Aires Tuesday marred the first day of a visit by Prince Andrew billed as a sign of reconciliation after the Falklands war. </P>
<P> A group of about 100 protesters including war veterans and fringe left-wing groups set fire to British and U.S. flags and charged police barriers. Police and mounted officers charged back with truncheons. </P>
<P> Police said dozens of protesters were arrested. A Reuters photographer saw one being carried away in handcuffs with his face covered in blood. </P>
<P> Prince Andrew was inside the residence when the protests took place but an embassy spokeswoman said he went on with a scheduled speech to businessmen as soon as police dispersed the crowd. </P>
<P> Argentina's President Carlos Menem has billed the prince's visit as a chance to promote dialogue favorable to Argentina's bid for the Falklands -- which it calls the Malvinas -- over which the two countries went to war in 1982. </P>
<P> Menem said after playing a round of golf with Prince Andrew, who arrived earlier in the day, ``If there is no dialogue then there is no rapprochement and therefore no possibility of recovering (the islands).'' </P>
<P> He rejected criticisms of the invitation, which a right wing deputy called a frivolity by a government preparing ``another betrayal of Argentine interests in the Malvinas.'' Argentine veterans denounced ``the decadent British royalty.'' </P>
<P> ``With that type of attitude there's no chance of advancing in the recovery of the islands,'' said Menem, who often states his conviction the islands will be in Argentine hands by 2000. </P>
<P> Prince Andrew, Queen Elizabeth's second son, saw combat in the 10-week war as a Royal Navy helicopter pilot in the task force Britain sent to oust Argentine ``invaders.'' More than 1,000 servicemen died, most of them Argentines. </P>
