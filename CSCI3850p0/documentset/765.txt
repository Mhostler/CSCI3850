<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  South Korean riot police clashed Sunday with hundreds of stick-wielding demonstrators guarding a campus where thousands of students had gathered for an outlawed pro-unification rally, witnesses said. </P>
<P> Defying a massive police presence, about 7,000 students massed at the campus of Seoul National University for the rally called to mark the 49th anniversary Monday of Korea's liberation from Japanese colonial rule. </P>
<P> Sporadic hit-and-run clashes erupted outside the gate, but there were no immediate reports of injuries or arrests. </P>
<P> At the inter-Korean border hamlet of Panmunjom, hundreds of North Korean youths held a pro-unification rally, domestic Yonhap news agency said. </P>
<P> South Korean authorites refused to allow the northerners to cross into the South to meet students and dissidents in Seoul, Yonhap said. </P>
<P> More than 20,000 riot police were deployed in the capital of Seoul since Saturday to thwart any banned rallies. </P>
<P> The Seoul government has said such a rally could be used by communist North Korea to destablise the South. Last week, South Korean police arrested two prominent dissidents for their alleged pro-communist activities. </P>
<P> Lee Chang-bok, 57, head of a dissident group organising the unification rally, and Hwang In-song, 42, a senior member of the group, were charged with supporting communist North Korea's policies and mourning the North's late Stalinist leader Kim Il-sung. </P>
<P> The detentions were the latest in a series of government crackdowns on pro-communist movements in the South since the death of Kim July 8. </P>
<P> The North's official newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, last week accused the Southern government of blocking the rally and ``brandishing the sword at random at the pro-reunification democratic forces.'' </P>
<P> The Seoul government launched its nationwide anti-communist drive last month when leaders of Hanchongryon, South Korea's radical student organization, set up altars at Chonnam University in the southwest city of Kwangju to pay tribute to the late North Korean leader, defying a government ban. </P>
<P> Liberation Day, marking the end of Japan's 35-year colonial rule, is celebrated both sides of the border. But dissidents and students in the South have regularly used the occasion to flout a law banning unauthorised contacts with the North. </P>
