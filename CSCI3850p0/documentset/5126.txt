<P>  Romanian authorities have arrested a member of the ultra-leftist Japan Red Army who tried to enter the country on a forged passport, Japan's Kyodo news agency reported Thursday. </P>
<P> Kyodo, quoting diplomatic sources in Vienna, said Romanian border guards arrested Yukiko Ekita, 44, and would soon deport her to a third country before final extradition to Japan. It did not say where in Romania she had been arrested. </P>
<P> A spokesman for Japan's National Police Agency said it had received no reports of the case and refused to comment further. All JRA members are wanted by Japanese police. </P>
<P> The JRA, believed to be based in the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon or in Damascus, was responsible for a series of bloody guerrilla attacks in the 1970s and 1980s. </P>
<P> In May, 1972, three JRA terrorists armed with machineguns and grenades killed 26 tourists and wounded 76 at Tel Aviv's Lod Airport. Two of the guerrillas were killed by Israeli police. The third, Kozo Okamoto, was captured but was freed in May, 1985, in an Israeli-Palestinian prisoner exchange. </P>
<P> The JRA is believed to have dwindled to 15 activists living in exile in the Middle East, where the end of the Cold War and regional peace negotiations have left the aging revolutionaries high and dry. </P>
<P> The JRA was last heard of publicly when an operative was arrested in New Jersey in 1988 after police found three home-made pipe bombs in his car, two days before he planned to blow up a U.S. Navy recruiting office. Two days later, two car bombs blew up outside a U.S. servicemen's club in Naples, Italy, killing four Italians and a U.S. servicewoman. </P>
<P> In 1977, Ekita was freed along with several other leftists awaiting trial in Japan after the JRA hijacked a Japanese airliner in India and demanded Tokyo release 12 prisoners in exchange for the hostages. </P>
<P> Because she was released through an extra-legal process, Ekita technically is still awaiting trial in connection with several bombings in Tokyo in 1974-75. </P>
