<P>  Major League Baseball officials Friday blasted the players' union position on minor leaguers, and said players not on the 40-man roster who refused to play in spring training games could be sent home. </P>
<P> The Major League Baseball Players' Association (MLBPA), on strike since last August, has said that minor leaguers who participate in spring training games, due to begin next week, would be considered strike-breakers. </P>
<P> ``Minor leaguers are not members of the union and do not derive any of the benefits from the MLBPA, such as strike benefits and licensing money,'' said Chicago Cubs president Andy MacPhail, one of three executives who announced the decision taken by Major League Baseball's Operating Committee. </P>
<P> ``The strike is not their fight and to include them, as the union appears to be doing, is unfair.'' </P>
<P> The committee's statement added that minor leaguers who refuse to participate could be sent home. </P>
<P> Union chief Donald Fehr warned earlier this week that anyone, including minor leaguers, who appeared in exhibition games would be considered a strike-breaker or ``scab'' player. </P>
<P> MacPhail responded by saying that minor leaguers have always played in spring training games and that spring games are exhibitions and not replacement games. </P>
<P> ``It is unfortunate that this union of millionaires would threaten minor league players who live on shoe-string budgets for performing their jobs,'' MacPhail said. </P>
<P> Sandy Alderson, president and general manager of the Oakland Athletics, said: ``The union's position will limit opportunities for minor league players who refuse to play. Their major league managers and coaches wil not be able to observe them under game conditions.'' </P>
<P> ``Minor league players have always played in exhibition games,'' Alderson added. </P>
<P> Dave Dombrowski, general manager of the Florida Marlins, said: ``To ask minor leaguers to sacrifice spring training games for a cause in hiwch they have no say is wrong.'' </P>
<P> The New York Yankees sent three minor leaguers home Thursday when they said they would not play in spring games. Manager Buck Showalter said the team would assume any player that practices Friday would be available for spring training games. </P>
<P> Full negotiations between the owners and players aimed at ending the six-month old strike are scheduled to resume Monday in Scottsdale, Ariz. Owners say they will use replacement players to begin the regular season as scheduled April 2 if no settlement is reached. </P>
