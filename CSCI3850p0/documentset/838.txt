<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  An American woman seeking custody of her murdered sister's children from their Jordanian father's family left Amman with the children Wednesday after a U.S. court gave her custody, relatives said. </P>
<P> ``We went to visit Lisa, 6, and Sami, 4, this morning, but we did not find them in the house,'' said their aunt, Miriam Abequa, the sister of Jordanian Muhammad Ismail Abequa. </P>
<P> Abequa is wanted by New Jersey authorities on charges that he killed his wife, Turkish-born Nihal. </P>
<P> ``We only found the two guards that used to stand outside the house,'' she told reporters. </P>
<P> The government had rented the house and placed them under the protection of the royal court until their custody issue was resolved. </P>
<P> Official sources said Nesima Dekour was headed for the United States via Germany after the New Jersey court gave her maternal custody rights over the two youngsters. </P>
<P> Abequa, a naturalized U.S. citizen, admitted to killing his wife in the couple's apartment after fleeing to Jordan with the two children. </P>
<P> He has been charged with premeditated murder and is in a local jail waiting to stand trial. </P>
<P> The United States has been pressing for the extradition of Abequa to stand trial in connection with the killing of his wife even though there is no treaty between the countries. </P>
<P> King Hussein and other Jordanian leaders promised U.S. officials during talks in Washington last month he would get a speedy and fair trial in Amman. </P>
<P> He also invited Dekour to visit Jordan to try to resolve the children's custody. </P>
<P> She moved into a government-rented house with the children on Thursday, but Abequa's mother and sister were allowed to visit them until the custody issue was settled. </P>
<P> Officials say Jordan turned a blind eye on their departure because the custody case was never taken to a local court. </P>
<P> ``It seems they were satisfied with the American court ruling giving Nesima Dekour and her mother joint custody,'' one official said. </P>
