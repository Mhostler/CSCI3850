<DATELINE>ISRAEL-JORDAN BORDER (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Yitzhak Rabin broke through two more barriers to Middle East peace Monday, becoming the first Israeli prime minister to openly cross the border to Jordan after 46 years of conflict and the first Israeli leader to meet the king publicly in Jordan. </P>
<P> Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan cut the ribbon at the border crossing about two miles north of the Red Sea ports of Aqaba in Jordan and Eilat in Israel. </P>
<P> Rabin then broke another peace barrier when he crossed the border openly and travelled to Aqaba where he held his first public meeting in Jordan with King Hussein after years of secret contacts. </P>
<P> Secretary of State Warren Christopher watched as an announcer told the assembled crowd at the border: ``Ladies and gentlemen, the border crossing between Israel and Jordan is now open.'' </P>
<P> Israel and Jordan signed an interim peace deal in Washington last month formally ending their state of war and committing to hold negotiations that will end in a peace treaty. </P>
<P> Acting on an announcer's cue, nine families of fallen soldiers from each side met in the middle, shook hands and exchanged gifts. War veterans -- senior officers from Israel and Jordan -- then did the same. </P>
<P> ``Friends say to us, 'The pace of events is too fast. We cannot keep up. Wait a moment','' Rabin told the small crowd of officials and journalists. </P>
<P> ``Your Royal Highness, our friends in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, we have waited 46 years. We have gone through war, pain and suffering. To prevent further loss and so on, we cannot wait even one day more,'' the Israeli leader said. </P>
<P> When the ceremony ended after about 30 minutes, Rabin passed through the new border passage into Jordan. </P>
<P> Witnesses said the usually dour Rabin was smiling and waving along with the crown prince as they crossed in a minibus in a long motorcade that arrived minutes later at the king's palace in Aqaba. </P>
<P> The king and Rabin shook hands warmly at the start of their first public meeting in Jordan. </P>
<P> Earlier, Crown Prince Hassan quoted in Hebrew from the Bible during the ceremony at the border where in years past Israelis and Jordanians fought wars. He said Israel and Jordan were ``turning the valley of troubles into a gate of hope.'' </P>
<P> ``Let the opening of this border gate in this particular location mark the foundation stone on which we intend to build our common future,'' the crown prince added. </P>
<P> He said work still lay ahead resolving issues, such as the marking of the border, standing in the way of a peace treaty. </P>
<P> Christopher is in the Middle East hoping to broker a deal between Israel and Syria, the staunchest holdout to peace with Israel among front-line Arab states. </P>
<P> ``Now the war is over. Now peace will prevail. Today Israel and Jordan are lifting the spirits of a wounded region by reminding it of the courage and honor, the compassion and sacrifice that two peoples can demonstrate in the search for peace,'' Christopher told the crowd. </P>
<P> ``A crossing point is open, a wall has come down,'' he said. Christopher told the crowd efforts by ``the forces of hatred'' to sabotage peace moves must not and would not succeed. </P>
<P> The border crossing will for the first time enable Israelis to cross openly into Jordan -- so long as they travel on another country's passport. </P>
<P> ``Our region is the birthplace of civilization. It is the crossroads of different cultures where their interaction has produced a sophistication that has enthralled mankind throughout the ages,'' the crown prince said. </P>
<P> ``Henceforth, third-country citizens will be able to marvel at this precious heritage,'' he said. </P>
