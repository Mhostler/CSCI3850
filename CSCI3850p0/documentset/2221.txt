<P>  Turkey has refused to admit a researcher from Amnesty International who wants to check allegations of torture and killings, the human rights group said Wednesday. </P>
<P> The group said both legal and illegal methods were being used to prevent it and the media from gathering information about alleged human rights violations in southeast Turkey, which has a large and vocal Kurdish population. </P>
<P> ``This ban contradicts the ``policy of openness relating to human rights issues' promised in a public statement made by the Turkish government in January,'' Amnesty said in a statement. </P>
<P> It also ``comes in a year which has brought an unprecedented volume of reports of human rights violations committed by security forces.'' </P>
<P> The Turkish embassy in London told Amnesty of the ban on Oct. 16, the statement said. It quoted the embassy as saying the researcher had been in illegal contact with the armed opposition Kurdish Worker's Party (PKK). </P>
<P> Amnesty denied it had met the PKK inside Turkey and had only met people claiming links with the organization outside Turkey to talk about alleged human rights violations. </P>
