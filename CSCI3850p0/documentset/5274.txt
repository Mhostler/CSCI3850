<P>  Canadian Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin said Tuesday some progress had been made during negotiations in Brussels between Canada and the European Union to resolve their fishing dispute. </P>
<P> ``These are good discussions. I think that both parties coming to the table are prepared to give a little ... I'm very pleased with the tone. But we'll have to wait and see,'' he told reporters at the United Nations. </P>
<P> He said he had no plans to fly to Brussels, ``but if at any point in time it became something that was worthwhile or constructive or necessary, or we were approaching closure, I would certainly consider it.'' </P>
<P> Tobin also said there had been no fishing Tuesday by the Spanish fishing fleet on either the ``nose or tail'' -- the disputed areas of the Grand Banks in the high seas off Newfoundland. </P>
<P> But he told a questioner: ``If there is action out there that is inconsistent with the needs of conservation, Canada reserves the right to call upon any one of the range of options open to us.'' </P>
<P> The fish fight between Canada and the European Union flared after Canada seized the Spanish trawler Estai in international waters March 9 on grounds it was violating conservation rules. On Sunday, Canada cut the net of one trawler and chased two others through a thick fog. </P>
<P> Tobin led about 50 reporters to a barge across the East River from the United Nations Tuesday to display a net with an illegally-fine mesh that he said had been used by the Estai to catch small, immature fish. </P>
<P> He later lunched with representatives of the European Union and of many countries which, like Canada, are attending a U.N. fisheries conference designed to head off just the kind of dispute that has erupted between Canada and Spain. </P>
<P> Tobin said he was extremely pleased at the ``clear consensus'' that had emerged that the conference would conclude successfully, with a binding convention. </P>
<P> ``What we really were debating was how to put in place enforcement rules that reconcile the needs of the coastal states with the rights of the distant-water fishing states,'' he said. </P>
