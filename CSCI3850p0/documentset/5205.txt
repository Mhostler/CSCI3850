<DATELINE>SINGAPORE, March 26 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Hundreds of Filipina maids working in Singapore and banned from praying in public for an executed colleague spent a quiet day off on Sunday in parks and shopping centres, closely watched by uniformed police. </P>
<P> Groups of police officers, carrying batons and revolvers, kept a vigil on the maids at the Lucky Plaza and Orchard Road shopping malls and adjoining parks for any illegal assembly. </P>
<P> On Sunday in the Philippines, the maid, Flor Contemplacion, was given a martyr's funeral in her home town San Pablo, hailed as a symbol of abused Filipino migrant workers worldwide. </P>
<P> Hundreds of mourners crowded the cathedral in San Pablo to witness the funeral of 42-year-old maid who was executed in Singapore's Changi jail on March 17 for a double murder in 1991. Impassioned Philippine pleas for a postponement were ignored. </P>
<P> Earlier on Sunday in Manila two grenades exploded outside the foreign ministry and a Singapore Airlines office, reflecting the unidiminished national rage at the execution. </P>
<P> No casualties were reported in either blast and only minor damage. </P>
<P> A Singapore police order, issued a few hours after Contemplacion was executed, banned assembly of Filipinos for organising public prayers. It said such an assembly is not permitted under the law of Singapore and police will not hesitate to take action against any person involved in it. </P>
<P> Eyewitnesses said the maids here spent their traditional day off in a normal manner. ``They sat on park benches chatting, sharing jokes and packed food,'' one eyewitness said. </P>
<P> They refused to talk to reporters. </P>
<P> ``In some cases, the police took away magazines carried by the maids and returned them after reading them,'' one witness said. </P>
<P> Almost 75,000 Filipinas work in the island state as maids. </P>
<P> The relations between Singapore and the Philippines plunged to its lowest depth after the execution of Contemplacion. </P>
<P> Ramos has banned maids from taking up new employment here. </P>
<P> Both the countries have recalled their ambassadors. Contemplacion has confessed the murder of another Filipina maid and a three-year-old Singaporean boy, but many in the Pbilippines believe she was innocent. </P>
