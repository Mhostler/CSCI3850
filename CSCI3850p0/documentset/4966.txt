<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Clinton administration said Thursday it had not ruled out further economic sanctions against Iran but voiced concern about their possible effect on the United States. </P>
<P> Undersecretary of State Peter Tarnoff declined to take a position on proposed legislation that would cut off all trade with Iran, but he ruled out for now administration support for a unilateral ban on trading of Iranian oil by U.S. company subsidiaries abroad. </P>
<P> ``The complications of this issue have led us to conclude at this point not to proceed with the type of prohibition (Sen. Lauch Faircloth) and Sen. (Alfonse) D'Amato have proposed,'' Tarnoff said, referring to an oil trade ban. </P>
<P> He emphasized the need for coordination with other countries to bring pressure on the Teheran government, adding that U.S. allies were unwilling to stop buying Iranian oil. </P>
<P> Tarnoff was testifying to the Senate Banking Committee two days after President Clinton barred the Houston-based oil firm of Conoco Inc. from completing a deal to develop two Iranian oilfields in the Gulf. </P>
<P> The legislation, introduced in the Senate by D'Amato with 26 co-sponsors, would bar American firms from buying Iranian oil for sale to third countries, a legal activity under current sanctions. </P>
<P> An industry official said that in 1994 American firms purchased from Iran about 600,000 barrels of oil a day, worth about $3.5 billion, for refining, resale or trading outside of the United States. </P>
<P> D'Amato, a New York Republican who heads the Senate Banking Committee, told Tarnoff that the U.S. sanctions imposed against Iran because of its alleged support of terrorism and its purchase of weapons of mass destruction were ``a myth.'' </P>
<P> Applauding Clinton's executive order banning the Conoco deal but complaining it did not go far enough, D'Amato said his legislation would put teeth in U.S. sanctions. </P>
<P> Tarnoff said the administration was analyzing D'Amato's bill and looked forward to discussing it with him. </P>
<P> ``We have considered other restrictions on American trade many times, and we are reflecting on them again today as part of the ongoing interagency review,'' Tarnoff said. </P>
<P> ``I would not rule out further actions as we review the feasibility and desirability of additional unilateral restrictions on U.S. ecomonic relations with Iran,'' he said. </P>
<P> But Tarnoff said the administration was concerned that some unilateral restrictions hurt Americans more than the Iranian government. </P>
<P> He said he did not believe that the United States would be able to convince its allies to bar trade with Iran in non-sensitive goods and Washington was focusing on denying Iran weapons and sensitive technology. </P>
<P> Tarnoff said imposing sanctions on foreign subsidiaries of American firms would lead to international litigation. </P>
<P> He also said that it would be difficult to keep track of Iranian oil because it was mixed with other oil in international trade. </P>
<P> Tarnoff said the aborted Conoco deal would have been the first major U.S. investment in Iran's petroleum industry since the 1979 Iranian revolution and ``it was immediately clear to us that it had to be prevented.'' </P>
<P> But D'Amato said Conoco had advised the government about the planned deal ``every step of the way'' as long ago as 1991. </P>
<P> He charged the administration had been ``disingenuous'' and had acted only after concern had been expressed in Congress. </P>
<P> Tarnoff acknowledged conversations had gone back several years but said the government had received ``bits and pieces'' of information. The actual deal ``came out of the blue as far as we were concerned,'' he said. </P>
<P> Michael Stinson, a Conoco vice president, told the committee the oilfields that were to have been developed at a cost of $600 million would have yielded about 3 percent of Iran's production quota set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. </P>
<P> He said the fields were located within sight of existing offshore fields in Dubai operated by a Conoco subsidiary and Conoco needed new production sources to sustain area operations and employment in Dubai. </P>
<P> Stinson said other countries would develop the field if Iran wished. </P>
