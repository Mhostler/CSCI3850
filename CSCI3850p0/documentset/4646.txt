<P>  Mongolia's security is best assured through good ties with its neighbors and growing prosperity and freedom, a senior U.S. official said during a visit to the landlocked country. </P>
<P> ``The best guarantee of Mongolia's security is a prosperous and free society... surrounded by prosperous and increasingly free neighbors, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and the Pacific region Winston Lord told reporters Tuesday. </P>
<P> Concluding a visit in which he met Mongolia's President, Punsalmaagiin Ochirbat, Lord said the United States supported what he called Mongolia's ``courageous efforts at economic reform and democracy.'' </P>
<P> He assured Mongolia of U.S. backing for its struggle to shift since 1990 to a democratic state after seven decades of support from Moscow as a communist Soviet satellite. </P>
<P> ``Mongolia is located in a geographically important area and it has two large neighbors,'' Lord said. ``Mongolia's security is best achieved by having good relationships with, above all, Russia and China.'' </P>
<P> The United States had growing interests in Mongolia, he said, adding that the huge landlocked country the size of western Europe was of strategic and economic importance. </P>
<P> He said he had held ``extensive'' discussions on security with Mongolia's leaders. </P>
<P> ``The U.S. will maintain a forward military presence in Asia which we believe contributes to its security and we conduct very useful bilateral miltary assistance and exchange programs with Mongolia,'' he said. </P>
<P> Mongolia's Defense Minister, Shagaliin Jadambaa, would visit Hawaii next month, he said. </P>
<P> ``A secure and independent Mongolia is a factor for stability in Asia,'' Lord said. </P>
<P> The United States would support Mongolia's security on its basis of remaining neutral and non-allied, he said. </P>
<P> He described his visit as an important symbol of the growing relationship between the two countries, adding that the United States would welcome Mongolia as a member of the World Trade Organization and would ``pursue this issue as energetically as possible.'' </P>
<P> Lord left Mongolia Wednesday for Beijing. </P>
