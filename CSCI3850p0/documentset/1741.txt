<P>  Police have widened their probe into the murder of the second leading Mexican politician this year to focus on ruling party legislators and politicians linked to powerful drug barons, press reports said Saturday. </P>
<P> Authorities failed to release details of the investigation into the murder Wednesday of Francico Ruiz Massieu, the second ranking leader of Mexico's long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, but speculation on who ordered the killing reached fever pitch. </P>
<P> The dominant conspiracy theory emerging is one of an unholy alliance between corrupt officials and drug kings, although the precise motive remains unclear. </P>
<P> The pro-government newspaper Excelsior said several legislators were suspected of involvement in the killing. </P>
<P> Press reports said Ruiz Massieu had made enemies during his 1987-1993 term as governor of the violent southwestern state of Guerrero. </P>
<P> Police have launched sweeps through the northern state of Tamaulipas, detaining many people in connection with the case, but have given no indication of a motive for the murder. </P>
<P> The state has become a center of drug trafficking and is the base of the Gulf Cartel's operations. </P>
<P> Ruiz Massieu's death, which came just over six months after PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio was gunned down at a campaign rally, has revived fears of both a bitter power struggle inside the PRI, which has ruled the country since 1929, and the mounting strength of drug lords. </P>
<P> The government has still failed to identify a motive in Colosio's assassination, and few Mexicans believe the arrested gunman acted alone. </P>

<P> An opinion poll published by the newspaper Reforma showed that 72 percent of people questioned believed that the murders of Colosio and Ruiz Massieu were linked. </P>
<P> Twenty-two percent blamed divisions inside the PRI and 15 percent blamed drug traffickers. </P>
