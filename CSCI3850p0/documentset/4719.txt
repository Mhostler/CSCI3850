<DATELINE>KIGALI, Rwanda (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Mass arrests have filled Rwanda's limited prisons to the bursting point and U.N. officials appealed Saturday for urgent help to prevent detention from becoming a death sentence. </P>
<P> More than 1,000 people have been arrested each week recently as the new Rwandan government pursues those suspected of taking part in genocide. </P>
<P> Between 500,000 and a million people, mainly Tutsis and moderate Hutus, were massacred in the central African country last year. </P>
<P> U.N. special envoy Shaharyar Khan said 23,000 people were now crammed into prisons designed for 4,000 and putting more people in them was effectively a death sentence because conditions were so bad and there was no functioning judiciary. </P>
<P> ``It's a powder keg,'' Khan told a news conference in the Kenyan capital Nairobi. He added that four to five people were dying daily from dysentery. </P>
<P> He called on donor countries who have pledged $600 million in aid to deliver now and help alleviate the problem. </P>
<P> ``The prisons are becoming perhaps priority number one. The United Nations is urging the international community to react with utmost speed,'' he added. </P>
<P> Most arrests were in the three provinces of Butare in the south, Gitarama in the center and Kibungo in the southeast. Most of the deaths were in prisons at Butare and Gitarama. </P>
<P> The discovery of new mass graves from the genocide made the situation more explosive, officials said, as it tempted civilians to take revenge if there was not quick legal action. </P>
<P> At least 4,500 skulls were found at one grave at Kigali's central hospital this week. </P>
<P> Khan said the death rate was rising in the prisons. </P>
<P> Rwandan government officials defended the arrests, saying they had to detain those responsible for the genocide. </P>
<P> ``We arrest guilty people, it's true,'' an official said. ``We have got to get those who hacked down innocent people. If we had the resources we would try them but we don't. So should these people be allowed to walk free? To kill again?'' </P>
<P> Detention centers known as ``cachots'' have been set up throughout Rwanda and aid workers said there was evidence of unlawful beating and torture of people detained in them. </P>
