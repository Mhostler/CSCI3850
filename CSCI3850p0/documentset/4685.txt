<P>  Safeguards should be developed to help pilots spot the previously unknown icing problem that may have sent an American Eagle flight hurtling into a soybean field last year, killing all 68 on board, the manufacturer of the plane said Thursday. </P>
<P> ``We need to get a detection system so that pilots are better prepared,'' said Kathryn Creedy, spokeswoman for Avions de Transport Regional, the Franco-Italian company that built the ATR-72 involved in the crash. </P>
<P> The icing problem, detailed at a National Transportation Safety Board hearing this week, involves the sudden development of supercooled water droplets that coat wing surfaces with sawtooth-shaped ridges of ice. </P>
<P> While freezing drizzle at ground-level is commonplace, less had been known about its development in clouds as high as 10,000 feet. </P>
<P> ``Our position is that this is a new phenomenon regardless of what went on in this flight'' and it caused the accident, Creedy said. </P>
<P> The board, which is wrapping up the week-long hearing, is expected to issue a final report on the cause of the accident in several months. </P>
<P> Paul McCarthy, a spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association, said the crew of the Eagle flight was surprised when confronted with the icing problem. </P>
<P> ``We need to change the certification standards and the design so no more pilots are surprised,'' he said. </P>
<P> Creedy and McCarthy, speaking to reporters during a break in the hearing, compared the discovery of the icing problem to the identification in the mid-1970s of the phenomenon of wind shear. </P>
<P> McCarthy said there were 18 crashes blamed on pilot error before wind shear -- caused by sudden microbursts of energy -- was found to be the cause of an Eastern Airlines crash at Kennedy International Airport in 1976. </P>
<P> Creedy denied published reports that the company was trying to blame the two-man crew of the Eagle flight for the crash 40 miles southeast of Chicago on a stormy Halloween night. </P>
<P> The crew of the Indianapolis-to-Chicago flight had activated the de-icing system 17 minutes before the crash. </P>
<P> But experts have said they believe ice suddenly built up on wing surfaces, causing the plane's autopilot to disengage and triggering a sudden deployment of its ailerons, wingtip devices that control roll. </P>
<P> The Eagle flight had been in a holding pattern for more than 30 minutes before it dove 9,000 feet into the ground. </P>
<P> Gilbert Defer, director of flight testing for Aerospatiale of Toulouse, France, which owns ATR along with Italy's Alenia SpA, told the hearing Thursday that tests he supervised had nearly duplicated the conditions faced by the Eagle flight before it crashed. </P>
<P> He said the test caused sudden rolls but the pilots were able to pull out of them using normal force on the control wheel. But he expressed doubt the crew of the Eagle flight could have recovered given the angle at which they were flying and certain features of the plane. </P>
<P> He said ATR is addressing the problem with new instructions for pilots and with a new de-icing system for the ATR-72 and the smaller ATR-42, both of which are popular with short-haul carriers in the United States and elsewhere. </P>
<P> The U.S. government has already restricted use of the planes in severe icing conditions and given warnings to pilots about how to control the plane in more moderate icing. </P>
<P> The new ATR system involves extension of the ``boot,'' a ridged, neoprene covering of the leading edge of the wing that can be inflated to break up ice when it forms. </P>
<P> He said the company will extend the boot covering almost twice as far back on the wing and will retrofit all planes with the new device, provided new tests at Edwards Air Force Base prove the system works. </P>
<P> The crash was the first worldwide involving an ATR-72, a twin-engine turboprop which has been on the market for five years. </P>
