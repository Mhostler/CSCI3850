<P>  Half a world away from his estranged wife and her plans for a high-profile return to public life, a relaxed-looking Prince of Wales got to grips Monday with one of his favorite topics, the environment. </P>
<P> Prince Charles spent the second full day of his visit to Hong Kong addressing an international congress on the environment in one of the most polluted corners of what remains of the British empire. </P>
<P> Charles appeared cheerful and confident, admitting he may be an incurable romantic. </P>
<P> His jokes with his hosts and in his speeches was in contrast to his stiff, long-faced visit to Asia in November 1992, when the Prince and Princess went to South Korea in what the British press labeled the ``togetherness tour'' just weeks before the pair split. </P>
<P> ``I was flattered to be asked, two years ago, (book early to avoid disappointment, Ladies and Gentlemen!) to act, with U.S. Vice President Gore, as a Joint President of this conference,'' Charles said in his opening speech. </P>
<P> He went on to express his regret at Gore's absence, suggesting the Vice President could find better excuses than the prince could for ``not flying for 14 hours non-stop across the Pacific to stand on a rostrum with your mouth feeling like the inside of a parrot's cage.'' </P>
<P> Extracts from a new book on the Princess of Wales, published Sunday, said she is planning a high-profile return to public life. </P>
<P> But Diana is holding back from the long-awaited announcement of a divorce from the heir to Britain's throne, believing time is on her side and a waiting game in her interests, extracts from the book said. </P>
<P> Security was unusually tight even for a royal visit, provoking complaints from the visiting British press corps and grumbles from local journalists. </P>
<P> Police bundled two would-be protesters away before they had a chance to protest about anything and the media were kept well away from the prince's retinue. </P>
<P> A group of men married to mainland Chinese women not permitted to reside in Hong Kong held a peaceful protest about their divided family status. </P>
<P> Two journalists made their own headlines by strolling into the Governor's country lodge where Charles was to stay upon his arrival Saturday from a visit to Los Angeles. </P>
<P> They swam in the pool and browsed through a small library before staff called the police. </P>
<P> Otherwise the visit attracted little attention from the colony's still-British subjects, three years before Hong Kong reverts to China on June 30, 1997. </P>
<P> Charles opened a cancer ward funded by a son-in-law of the late shipping tycoon, Sir Y.K. Pao, in the afternoon. </P>
<P> ``Who is he, mama, who is he?'' asked Chen Ka-wai, a leukemia sufferer aged two, as Charles gently teased the little girl at the Prince of Wales Hospital. </P>
<P> ``I am delighted to find there is a Prince of Wales Hospital here,'' Charles said as he unveiled the plaque. </P>
<P> Tuesday, the prince visit parts of Hong Kong's massive new $20.3 billion airport -- held responsible for jeopardizing the rare pink Chinese dolphin. He is also to address a British Chamber of Commerce luncheon and view a retirement parade for Gurkha soldiers. </P>
<P> Wednesday, Charles visits a public housing project and will view an experimental farm before leaving for London. </P>
