<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czech Republic (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A former Czechoslovak Communist Party boss was elected secretary-general of a new party dedicated to ``market socialism'' over the weekend. </P>
<P> Miroslav Stepan founded the Party of Czechoslovak Communists (SCK) in early March. It now has nearly 20,000 members, Stepan told a news conference after the SCK's constituent congress. </P>
<P> He said the new party would seek to achieve socialism, adding: ``It may as well be a market socialism.'' </P>
<P> The SCK does not acknowledge Czechoslovakia's split into separate Czech and Slovak Republics in 1993 and will seek to restore the Czechoslovak state, he said. </P>
<P> Stepan, 49, once a politburo member and the Prague city party boss, is one of the few top communists to have been jailed after the peaceful revolution in 1989. </P>
<P> He was sentenced to a four-year term for ordering the use of water cannon and tear gas in the late 1980s to crack down on peaceful anti-communist demonstrations. </P>
<P> It was cut to two-and-a-half years on appeal and Stepan walked free on parole after serving half his sentence. </P>
<P> While in jail, he wrote a book called ``Confessions of a Prisoner of the Velvet Revolution,'' which turned into a best-seller, selling 85,000 copies. </P>
<P> He started bringing together his old comrades after quitting the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia, the official successor to the pre-1989 party, because he believed it had become ``too reformist.'' </P>
<P> His new SCK does not recognize the last congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party after the ``velvet'' revolution in December 1989 as valid since it ``guaranteed the election of Vaclav Havel as president and adopted a program of disbanding the Party,'' Stepan said after his election. </P>
