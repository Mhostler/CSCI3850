<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Call it the case of the missing putter. </P>
<P> President Clinton said Tuesday he is a little bit nervous about playing in the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic charity golf match in Palm Springs, Calif., Wednesday, particularly because he noticed when he checked his golf bag that his trusted old putter has mysteriously disappeared. </P>
<P> ``I'll bet it got put in the bag of one of the men I was playing with,'' Clinton told reporters on the flight from Washington to San Francisco. ``It's an old Bullseye ... an old, beat-up putter that's at least 35 years old. It looks like something you'd find in an aging miniature golf course.'' </P>
<P> Clinton said he has a ``gazillion'' other putters, but that the missing one is the one he uses most. But he won't have it when he plays in a foursome with former Presidents George Bush and Gerald Ford and 92-year-old entertainer Bob Hope. </P>
<P> ``Actually I'm a little nervous about it,'' he said. ``I haven't played in a while. I've been so fixated on my work, you know, I haven't been thinking about golf.'' </P>
<P> Democrat Clinton will be the young whippersnapper in the otherwise Republican group. Ford, with whom Clinton played in August 1993 in Colorado, is in his 80s, and Bush is 70. </P>
<P> Despite his nervousness, Clinton said: ``I'm looking forward to it. I've always wanted to play golf with Bob Hope ... This year he called me and said, 'I really liked your State of the Union address but you'll speak even better if you come play golf with me.''' </P>
<P> As for the missing putter, Clinton, who insisted he is in California to talk about education and not just play golf, chuckled when asked if he thought foul play was involved. </P>
<P> ``That's what I think. One of the Republican holdovers on the White House staff pulled my putter out of my bag,'' he joked. </P>
