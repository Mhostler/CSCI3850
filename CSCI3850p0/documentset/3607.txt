<DATELINE>CONSTANTA, Romania (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Searchers battled icy seas Friday in a race against the weather to find as many as 54 seamen feared drowned in a double-sinking on Romania's Black Sea coast. </P>
<P> ``We'll continue to search for the sailor's bodies. For us a sailor never dies, he is only listed as missing, so we have to go on with our search,'' said port captain Marian Popescu. </P>
<P> Police said they had found seven bodies by late Friday. </P>
<P> Local sailors told harrowing stories of watching helplessly as the two ships sank within minutes in blizzard conditions and raging winds as waves crashed over them. </P>
<P> ``I saw a sailor clinging to the top mast and making desperate signs with a flag. Minutes later the ship listed and then it was swallowed by the waves,'' said tug mechanic Emil Covaci who watched one of the ships go under. </P>
<P> Fifty-four crewmen were missing and believed drowned after two bulk carriers sank one after the other in apparently unrelated accidents in blizzards and high seas overnight Wednesday. </P>
<P> The Maltese-flagged Paris and the Hong Kong-flagged You Xiu lost power in heavy seas Wednesday evening as they waited outside the Constanta breakwater. </P>
<P> Within minutes both ships had hit the huge finger of cement and rock which protects one of the largest ports on the Black Sea. Both sank quickly with no trace of survivors. </P>
<P> Liberty SRL, shipping agent for the You Xiu, said at least three of the bodies found so far were believed to be those of members of the ship's Chinese crew. </P>
<P> Agents for the Paris, said there were 23 Filipinos in the crew, three Greeks, including the captain, and a Bulgarian on board. The ship sailed into Constanta port on Dec. 14, 1994, to load 27,000 tons of bulk urea. </P>
<P> Covaci said his tug, the Viteazul, had tried to help. </P>
<P> ``We managed to get very close to the You Xiu and put the search lights on the ship, but it was absolutely impossible to get close enough to help its crew,'' he told Reuters. </P>
<P> The sinking of the 28,500-ton Paris and 29,500-ton You Xiu is the worst maritime disaster in Romania since a Romanian freighter sank in almost the same place in 1988 with 15 lost. </P>
<P> A transport ministry statement said the two ships had requested help within an hour of each other Wednesday evening when they were unable to put to sea under their own steam. </P>
<P> When the Viteazul arrived in the area the two ships were already in immediate danger of hitting the sea wall. Within 30 minutes the Paris hit the wall followed two minutes later by the You Xiu. They sunk in less than two hours. </P>
