<DATELINE>ARANYAPRATHET, Thailand, March 19 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Cambodian forces continued an attack on a Khmer Rouge guerrilla position on Sunday as hundreds of guerrilla civilian supporters prepared to flee across the frontier into nearby Thailand, Thai army and guerrilla sources said. </P>
<P> Cambodian government troops pounded the Khmer Rouge base at Kla-Nguab, 15 km (nine miles) south of the Cambodian border town of Poipet, with artillery shells and mortar bombs from Saturday night to Sunday morning, a Thai army officer based on the border said. </P>
<P> A guerrilla officer told reporters on the border that the Khmer Rouge had driven back an advance force of more than 200 government soldiers from the edge of the rebel base early on Sunday morning. </P>
<P> The rebel commander said government troops suffered heavy casualties while nine Khmer Rouge fighters were wounded. </P>
<P> The guerrilla officer also claimed that two government tanks and five army trucks were destroyed by guerrilla mines in the area. </P>
<P> The battlefield claims of Cambodian factions are often exaggerated. </P>
<P> The Khmer Rouge vowed to hold Kla-Nguab and the officer said more than 1,000 guerrilla reinforcements had moved into the area to confront the 1,500 government troops mounting the attack with the support of artillery and tanks. </P>
<P> Kla-Nguab is a Khmer Rouge logistical support base on the approaches to a major rebel stronghold at Phnom Malai, a long-term Khmer Rouge base in jagged mountains along Cambodia's western border with Thailand. </P>
<P> Hundreds of civilians, most of them believed to be family of Khmer Rouge fighters, were preparing to seek refuge on Thai soil to the south of the Thai town of Aranyaprathet but Thai authorities said for the time being they were not allowing them to enter the country. </P>
<P> Last year more than 20,000 civilian supporters and family of Khmer Rouge crossed into Thailand when Cambodian government forces attacked and briefly held the Khmer Rouge headquarters of Pailin. </P>
<P> The Cambodian government later criticised Thailand for trucking the refugees along the border and letting them cross back into a secure Khmer Rouge zone. </P>
<P> Bangkok argued that the civilians wanted to return to Cambodia but Phnom Penh authorities said the repatriation should have been overseen by international refugee agencies. </P>
<P> During the Khmer Rouge's 1975 to late 1978 period of rule one million Cambodians died of disease, starvation or were executed as enemies of the Khmer Rouge Maoist revolution. </P>
<P> The guerrillas signed a 1991 peace treaty but later rejected United Nations-supervised elections and remained in their remote jungle strongholds in the north and west of the country, launching attacks on government forces, roads and railways. </P>
<P> The Cambodian government says the rebel group has been seriously weakened by thousands of defections to the government side over the last year. </P>
