<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Iraq Thursday lambasted a statement by the leaders of the six Gulf Arab states for urging the United Nations to maintain sanctions on Baghdad until it honored all 1991 Gulf War resolutions. </P>
<P> The ruling Baath Party newspaper al-Thawra, in a front-page editorial, described the Gulf Cooperation Council leaders as ``short-sighted and politically blind'' for repeating like ``parrots'' Washington's anti-Iraq attitude like ``parrots.'' </P>
<P> ``The GCC statement reveals...which are the parties implementing the blind U.S. attitude, violating all norms, principles and calls for Arab reconciliation,'' the paper said. </P>
<P> Thawra said the backing of the U.S. ``accusations'' against Iraq indicated the Gulf Arab leaders ``harbored no good intentions to normalize relations with Iraq.'' </P>
<P> Leaders of Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and the United Arab Emirates ended a three-day summit in Bahrain Wednesday with a call on the Security Council to force Iraq honor all the resolutions related to its invasion of Kuwait. </P>
<P> The GCC leaders said Baghdad's recognition of the borders and sovereignty of Kuwait was an important step toward implementing U.N. resolutions, but they asked Iraq to show good intentions and refrain from ``any provocative or aggressive act'' threatening its neighbours. </P>
<P> ``It is really a funny thing'' retorted Thawra, saying if Iraq had those intentions in mind it would not have recognized Kuwait within new borders the U.N. established after the Gulf War. </P>
<P> It said Iraq was still eager to normalize ties with the GCC, but both Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have not yet shown their readiness, though they dropped phrases in earlier statements which angered Baghdad. </P>
<P> For the first time since Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, the GCC statement referred to the ``Republic of Iraq'' instead of ``the Iraqi regime.'' </P>
<P> They also dropped terms such as ``confrontation'' and ``pursuing pressure'' to continue economic sanctions on Iraq. </P>
<P> The paper doubted GCC countries apparent concern for the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq. </P>
<P> ``This claim is not true,'' it said. ``GCC leaders know that Kuwait and Saudi Arabia still continue conspiring against Iraq's unity by backing cessionists in the north.'' </P>
<P> Thawra said GCC leaders should know that pressure was building within the Security Council to ease the sanctions and that France, China and Russia were ``striving to rein the U.S. attitude and have the embargo lifted.'' </P>
<P> ``Their (GCC leaders) political short-sightedness has pushed them to the point of backing pro-Iran elements which recently conspired against Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.'' </P>
<P> ``Practices like these do not indicate political maturity or far-sightedness,'' Thawra said. </P>
