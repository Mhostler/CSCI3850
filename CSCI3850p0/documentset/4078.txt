<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Austrian Justice Ministry has given the green light to charge two Neo-Nazis allegedly responsible for a wave of letter bombs that swept Austria more than a year ago, a ministry spokesman said Wednesday. </P>
<P> The indictment against Franz Radl, 27, and Peter Binder, 27, accuses them of attempted murder in support of the revival of National Socialism (Nazism). </P>
<P> The charges, which will be brought officially by prosecutors in about two weeks, carry a maximum life prison sentence, the spokesman said. Under Austrian law, the justice ministry must first allow prosecutors to lay charges, the first step toward a trial. </P>
<P> The two are alleged to have been behind 10 letter bombs sent in December 1993 to prominent Austrians active in assisting foreign immigrants and refugees. </P>
<P> Five people, including then Vienna Mayor Helmut Zilk, were injured when four of the bombs exploded. Six of the letter bombs were intercepted by police and defused. </P>
<P> Radl and Binder have been under arrest for more than a year awaiting an indictment and trial. </P>
<P> The ministry spokesman said the trial was expected to take place later this year but gave no exact date. </P>
