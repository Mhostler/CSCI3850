<P>  A Nation of Islam representative Tuesday charged racism was behind two different local arenas refusing their premises for a visit by the group's head, Louis Farrakhan. </P>
<P> Rodney Muhammad, a Nation of Islam leader who runs a North Philadelphia mosque, has been charging on local radio shows that the bids were rejected because of racism and a push to keep Farrakhan out of Philadelphia. </P>
<P> The privately-owned Spectrum arena Monday rejected a proposal for Farrakhan to speak to a general audience. A Spectrum spokesman said the minister is too controversial, and his visit could spark violence. </P>
<P> The decision came a day after the city government disclosed to the Philadelphia Daily News that it turned down a bid for Farrakhan to speak to an all-male audience at a different site, the city-owned Civic Center. </P>
<P> City representatives said barring females violates local laws against discrimination in the use of publicly owned venues. </P>
<P> Kevin Vaughan, head of the Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations, said if the Nation of Islam wanted instead to allow women as well, the city would rent the Civic Center for a Farrakhan visit. </P>
<P> It has rented the Civic Center to Farrakhan for three visits in the past that were attended by males and females.  Muhammad said Farrakhan wants to focus on men when he visits Philadelphia this year as part of his ``Stop the Killing'' crusade, urging black men to stop murdering other blacks. </P>
<P> Farrakhan has himself been accused of racism and anti-semitism particularly after an aide, Khalid Abdul Muhammad, made a speech attacking, Jews, Catholics and prominent blacks. Farrakhan suspended Muhammad and called the speech ``vile'' but also said it had ``a lot of truths.'' </P>
