<DATELINE>PHNOM PENH, April 3 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The majority of Cambodians would support legalisation of the world's oldest profession in this impoverished country, according to a survey released on Monday. </P>
<P> The poll of 600 Phnom Penh residents showed 54 percent were in favour of making prostitution legal. </P>
<P> Forty six percent said they opposed the idea, but almost all respondents said that if prostitution was legalised it should be regulated by the government. </P>
<P> The survey was carried out by a local company, International Management and Investment Consultants Ltd (IMIC). </P>
<P> While prostitution is officially banned, local authorities have turned a blind eye to its many facades. </P>
<P> Phnom Penh boasts a flourishing industry of massage parlours, discos, karaoke bars, night clubs and late night coffee shops that serve as a front for prostitution. Most sex industry workers are either Khmer or Vietnamese. </P>
<P> A total of nine cases of full blown AIDS have been detected so far in Cambodia while estimates of the number of HIV cases run to 6,000 although public health officials say the figure is probably too conservative. </P>
<P> The Human Imunodefficiency Virus (HIV) is the virus which causes the fatal disease AIDS. </P>
