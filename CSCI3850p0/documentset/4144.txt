<P>  Two Florida groups are gathering signatures and grassroots support with the aim of putting an anti-immigration measure on the state ballot next year, the Miami Herald reported Sunday. </P>
<P> The movement was inspired by California's Proposition 187, which was adopted last autumn by that state's voters to bar illegal immigrants from schools, welfare rolls and hospitals. </P>
<P> More than 7 percent of Florida's nearly 14 million residents are not legal citizens, compared to nearly 15 percent of Californians and 8 percent of New York state residents. </P>
<P> In Orlando, a group called Save Our State plans to file papers in Tallahassee soon to become a political action committee, which would allow it to raise money for a November 1996 ballot measure, the Herald reported. </P>
<P> A second group, Floridians for Immigration Control, holds monthly meetings in suburban Fort Lauderdale to plan strategy among its grassroots members. </P>
<P> Although California voters overwhelmingly approved Proposition 187, it has had no impact because of pending court challenges. </P>
<P> ``There is a very real possibility, in Florida especially, that (a Proposition 187 measure) could succeed,'' said Thomas Boswell, a University of Miami immigration expert. </P>
<P> Many residents of Florida, one of the nation's fastest- growing states, said they are fed up with overcrowded schools, prisons and public hospitals. </P>
<P> The vast majority of the state's illegal immigrants live in South Florida, where many legal immigrants from Cuba, Nicaragua and the Caribbean, also object to their growing numbers. </P>
