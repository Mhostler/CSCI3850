<P>  Secretary of State Warren Christopher Tuesday appointed Nicholas Burns, a career diplomat who has specialized in Russia and the Middle East, as the new State Department spokesman. </P>
<P> Burns, 38, succeeds Mike McCurry, who was promoted to White House spokesman two weeks ago. </P>
<P> Unlike McCurry, a public relations expert and Democratic Party political campaigner, Burns is a professional foreign service officer who was seconded for the last five years to the White House's National Security Council. </P>
<P> Since 1993 he has served as NSC senior director for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia affairs. Previously he was director for Soviet and later Russian affairs. </P>
<P> Burns began his foreign service career as vice-consul in Cairo from 1983-85. He was political officer in Jerusalem from 1985-87, when he coordinated U.S. assistance to Palestinians in the West Bank, and held posts at the State Department in Washington from 1987-90. </P>
<P> Christopher said in a statement that Burns ``has built an impressive record of achievement as a foreign service officer and I am confident that he will continue that record as he returns from the White House to the State Department.''  A native of Wellesley, Mass., Burns graduated from Boston College. He also received a certificate in French from the University of Paris and a Master's degree in international relations from the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. </P>
<P> He is married and has three daughters. </P>
