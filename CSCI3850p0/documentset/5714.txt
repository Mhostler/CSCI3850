<P>  The U.N. special representative in the former Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi, said Thursday the three years of conflict there so far was not long compared to the time it took to find peace in the Middle East and other troubled regions. </P>
<P> He noted that a peace plan for Bosnia drafted by a five-nation contact group has not yet been accepted by all parties but added: ``It has taken many years for peace in the Middle East or peace in Northern Ireland or in Africa to really take roots.'' </P>
<P> Akashi said he was frustrated that ``our efforts in the former Yugoslavia have not come to the final end. But three years is not a long period in the history of humanity or even of the United Nations. </P>
<P> ``I am anxious and I am impatient for progress. But I think even if we do not see visible progress in the days and weeks to come, you might see a vastly different, much more hopeful situation before the end of the year.'' </P>
<P> He said the U.N. force in the former Yugoslavia had done ``quite a credible job'' in ensuring humanitarian supplies for some three million people, promoting cease-fires and military stability and exploiting opportunities for improving the quality of life, as in Bosnia's Muslim-Croatian federation. </P>
<P> ``Peace ultimately depends on the political will of the parties to the conflict and that will does not exist in sufficient amounts,'' he said. </P>
<P> Akashi said he told the Security Council this week that it would not be easy to renew a four-month cease-fire in Bosnia due to expire at the end of this month because the parties were ``unhappy with the way the agreement was honored, or dishonored, by the other parties.'' He said he would return Friday to his headquarters in Zagreb and travel next week to Sarajevo and the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale to initiate negotiations for a renewal of the accord. </P>
