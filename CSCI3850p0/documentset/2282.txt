<P>  Iran lashed out at the United States Friday, calling Washington's peace moves in the Middle East a trecherous plot. </P>
<P> Leading cleric Ayatollah Mohammad Emami Khashani told thousands of worshipers at Friday prayers at Tehran University that the United States was interferring in other countries' internal affairs under the pretext of achieving peace. </P>
<P> He spoke on the day President Clinton arrived in Kuwait on the last day of a tour that has taken him to Syria, Israel and Jordan, where he witnessed the signing of a peace treaty between Jordan and Israel. Saudi Arabia is the last stop on Clinton's itinerary. </P>
<P> ``Elaborating on the goals the U.S. pursued in the Middle East compromise plan, he (Khashani) remarked that the main target of this treacherous plot was to further strengthen Israel and suppress the combatant Muslim Palestinians,'' the official Iranian news agency IRNA reported. </P>
<P> Khashani said the Untied States was trying to dissolve Muslim culture and values ``into the corrupt culture of the West through expanding its dominance in the Middle East and all parts of the Islamic world.'' </P>
<P> ``He then referred to America's invasion of the Gulf and said that its claims of friendship with the regional countries were but mere lies, adding that the U.S. only aimed at expanding its dominance in the reigon,'' it said. </P>
<P> Iran has denounced the United States and the West for sending forces to the Gulf region to deter Iraqi troop deployments near the border with Kuwait earlier this month. </P>
<P> Khashani urged Iranians to take part in rallies Nov. 4 commemorating the takeover of the U.S. embassy in Tehran by Iranian students after the Iranian Islamic revolution in 1979. </P>
