<DATELINE>LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A Islamic prayer leader has appealed to Pakistan's Supreme Court to annul the acquittal of two Christians on blasphemy charges and restore an earlier death sentence on them, his lawyer said Thursday. </P>
<P> Lawyer Rasheed Murtaza Qureshi said the court would take up next week his appeal on behalf of the village prayer leader in Punjab province who originally accused three Christians of blasphemy against Islam two years ago. </P>
<P> Two of the Christians, Salamat Masih, 14, and Rehmat Masih, were convicted in February and sentenced to death. The third was killed by gunmen during the trial. </P>
<P> Punjab's High Court in Lahore overturned the death sentences, which brought an outcry at home and abroad, and acquitted the two Christians who, fearing a threat to their lives from Islamic militants, flew to Germany. </P>
<P> Prayer leader Fazle Haq accused the Christians of writing blasphemous remarks against Islam's prophet Mohmamad on chits thrown into his mosque and on the mosque walls. </P>
<P> Qureshi said his appeal, filed Wednesday, stated that the Lahore High Court had acted ``under international pressure'' and had refused his plea to bring more evidence against the accused. </P>
<P> Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said after the death sentences were passed in February that she would try to persuade parliament to change the blasphemy law enacted by late military ruler Gen. Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq. </P>
<P> Visiting German President Roman Herzog urged Pakistan at a news conference in Islamabad Wednesday to rewrite the law. </P>
<P> But a conference dominated by orthodox Islamists in Lahore last month decided to oppose Bhutto's move and called for a retrial of the two Christians. </P>
