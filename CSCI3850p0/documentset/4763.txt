<P>  Christian and Muslim organizations announced a plan Tuesday, on the fringes of the U.N. Social Summit, to organize joint relief and development projects. </P>
<P> ``We used to work separately. Now it is high time to not only co-exist but also to work together on aid projects. We must liberate ourselves from the past,'' said Secretary-General Kamel Al-Sherif of the International Islamic Council for Relief. </P>
<P> The aid scheme was set up at a Copenhagen meeting of the World Conference on Religion and Peace (WCRP), representing hundreds of millions of Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus and other believers. </P>
<P> The meeting established an inter-religion development action committee co-chaired by Sherif, a former Jordanian Minister of Islamic Affairs, and Lawrence Turnipseed, a Methodist pastor from the U.S. National Council of the Churches of Christ. </P>
<P> ``We will look at Africa and the Middle East and talk with the people on the ground to find two or three suitable pilot projects,'' Turnipseed told Reuters. </P>
<P> ``We are starting small but it will be the first time Christian and Islamic organisations have worked together.'' </P>
<P> He said his own organization managed a total of $50 million in relief and development aid annually. </P>
<P> Sherif's Islamic Council manages around $100 million. </P>
