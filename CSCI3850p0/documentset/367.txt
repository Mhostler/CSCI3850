<P>  Rains in recent days have brought temporary relief to drought-ridden White Sands Missile Range in southern New Mexico where military police shot to death 49 starving horses. </P>
<P> ``With rain in the last two days, temporary pools have formed,'' expanding watering options for the horses, said Larry Furrow, chief of public affairs for the missile range. </P>
<P> New Mexico typically has a monsoon season with afternoon rains daily beginning in late July and going into August. Since last week there has been some rain almost daily. </P>
<P> ``The immediate problem had been alleviated but it could be a bandaid. This could be all the rain we get,'' Furrow said. </P>
<P> The real problem remains that there are too many horses for the amount of feed on that land, he added. </P>
<P> New Mexico's unusually hot summer, with temperatures topping 100 degrees in recent weeks, drove a band of the animals in the range's north-central part to flock to shrinking water holes, eating all of the vegetation, he said. </P>
<P> He said an additional 73 horses have died from starvation in recent weeks. </P>
<P> ``We view this with revulsion, with sadness,'' he said in an interview this week. ``This is a terrible, terrible tragedy.'' </P>
<P> Range officials spotted the dying horses during a routine helicopter survey July 6. No animals have been shot since July 15 but officials warn that the problem is far from over. </P>
<P> The animals descend from domestic horses owned by ranchers before the Defense Department acquired the 100 by 40 mile property in 1945 to test missiles. The wild herd has multiplied over the years, overgrazing the range. </P>
<P> Tests done at the University of California at Davis on tissues of dead horses show that starvation not disease or dehydration killed the animals, he said. Leaving hay and alfalfa for the animals would not have been a solution because the horses are used to a diet of wild grasses, he added. </P>
<P> ``We know it's not going to be over until we reduce the herd. We're committed to fixing it this year,'' Furrow said. ``I want to make sure the well intentioned people who call in and say 'now that there's rain, the problem is solved' understand. Those poor animals have suffered. We want to make sure it doesn't happen again.'' </P>
<P> Some of the horses will be rounded up in late fall when it is cooler and the animals have regained their health and they will then be sold at auction, Furrow said. </P>
<P> Animal rights groups are drawing attention to the problem. Karen Sussman, a spokeswoman for the International Society for the Protection of Mustangs and Burros, visited the area last week and said she saw about 50 horses. </P>
<P> ``Some were thin, a majority were very thin. We saw about 12 or 15 in one area and about 35 more. We saw one stallion with its ribs showing,'' Sussman said, adding that by the time she got to the site, carcasses of dead horses had been buried. </P>
<P> She offered to organize a task force to solve the problem. But overtures from The Fund for Animals, headquartered in New York, were rebuffed by the commander of the missile range. </P>
<P> Heidi Prescott, president of the fund, said she received a letter from Brigadier General Jerry Laws saying ``There is nothing you can do to help us at this time.'' </P>
<P> Prescott said the group plans to send a biologist to the area in the first week of August. It offered its Black Beauty Ranch in Murchison, Texas to house some of the horses. </P>
<P> There are an estimated 1,300 to 1,500 feral horses on the range which can only support about 300 to 500 horses, said John Crenshaw, of the state's Department of Game and Fish. </P>
<P> What to do about the wild horses has been discussed in recent years, with biologists warning that the land could not sustain the horses and various governmental entities saying they are unable to take action because of the law. </P>
<P> The horses belong to the state's Livestock Board, but are under the U.S. Army's jurisdiction. In 1989, the Army sold some horses at an auction. When slaughter houses bought the animals, the public and animal rights groups protested. </P>
<P> In 1990, Congress appropriated $200,000 to allow some of the herd to be adopted as part of a federal Bureau of Land Management program but the funds went unspent. </P>
<P> ``This has become a screwed up problem with federal and state laws conflicting,'' said Steve England, New Mexico's State Veterinarian and a spokesman for the Livestock Board. ``While the horses are on the White Sands Missile Range they are under the care of the Army. They're their property.'' </P>
<P> John McKean, spokesman for New Mexico Governor Bruce King said: ``The governor is very concerned as governor and as a rancher. But we must apply the law consistently. It couldn't be clearer. The state may not go into the ranching business and must sell (the horses) at a mutually agreed price.'' </P>
<P> ``But they don't have to go to the slaughter house. If people are concerned they can step forward with their wallets and buy them,'' he said. </P>
