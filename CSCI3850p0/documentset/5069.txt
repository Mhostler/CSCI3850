<P>  Cuba's hope of a clean sweep of the Pan-American Games boxing was shattered Tuesday when one of its top fighters was eliminated for punching his opponent in the genitals. </P>
<P> Welterweight Juan Hernandez, the defending Pan-Am Games champion, threw the low blow during his quarterfinal bout with Hercules Kyvelos of Canada. </P>
<P> Kyvelos had been forced back onto the ropes when Hernandez, the world's top-ranked amateur boxer in his weight class, took a massive swipe and connected with the Canadian's genitals. </P>
<P> The 20-year-old student, on the Canadian team for the first time, keeled over in agony and still had tears in his eyes when the referee raised his arm and declared him the winner. </P>
<P> Cuba had been hoping to win all 12 weight categories at the Games and the 26-year-old Gonzalez, Goodwill Games gold medalist last July, was a heavy favorite in his category. Cuba won 11 out of 12 gold medals at the 1991 games in Havana. </P>
