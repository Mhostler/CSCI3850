<P>  Long-hitting Craig Stadler bludgeoned the long holes into submission to tie fellow American Rick Fehr for the lead after the third round at the $1.1 million Walt Disney World Golf Classic Saturday. </P>
<P> The rotund Californian used his length to birdie three of the par-5 holes on the Palm course, and he eagled the other for a flawless 5-under-par 67. </P>
<P> Stadler joined Rick Fehr at 15-under 201 with one round to play, one stroke in front of compatriot John Flannery, who had the day's lowest round, a 10-under 62 at Eagle Pines, the easiest of the three courses used for the tournament. </P>
<P> The cut was made at 4-under 212 and the 77 players to survive at last will be brought together for the final round on the Magnolia course. </P>
<P> Stadler, appropriately nicknamed ``The Walrus,'' won the San Diego PGA Tour stop in February, before quickly going into hibernation. </P>
<P> ``When I putt well I score well, and I don't putt well very often anymore,'' lamented Stadler, regarded as one of the tour's superior ball-strikers. </P>
<P> Stadler, 41, the 1982 Masters champion, has been putting better since receiving a tip during the PGA Championship in August. </P>
<P> ``I've putted well since the PGA,'' he said. ``I get over them and don't feel I'm going to miss them.'' </P>
<P> Stadler was satisfied with his driving and putting Saturday, but said poor iron shots had prevented him from having many birdie chances at the shorter holes. </P>
<P> Co-leader Fehr was not particularly happy with his four-under 68 at Eagle Pines. ``I was one under through 14 holes and not feeling very good about it,'' said Fehr, who birdied three of the final four holes. </P>
<P> ``I hit a lot of good shots but I also hit some poor shots. I haven't played very well the last two days but I'm still there.'' </P>
<P> Flannery, whose 62 was the day's lowest round by two strokes, has been in a dreadful slump, but he is reaping the benefits of three days of hard work before the tournament with a new swing coach. </P>
<P> ``I couln't go on playing the way I was playing,'' said Flannery, who is standing further from the ball and hitting his shots with a higher trajectory. </P>
