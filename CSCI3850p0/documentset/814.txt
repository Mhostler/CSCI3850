<NOTES> (Eds: Updates with Iran's envoy departure, Menem's remarks)</NOTES>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Iran's ambassador left Argentina Tuesday amid a diplomatic war dance over an anti-Jewish blast that last month killed nearly 100 people in Buenos Aires. </P>
<P> Ambassador Hadi Soleimanpour made no comments before flying back home for consultations. </P>
<P> But his embassy said in a press release, Argentina had no evidence to support international arrest orders for four former Iranian officials allegedly involved in the July 18 attack that razed a building housing Argentina's two main Jewish groups. </P>
<P> Speaking from Cordoba, 450 miles northwest of Buenos Aires, Argentina's President Carlos Menem defended judge Juan Jose Galeano's decision to issue arrest warrants. </P>
<P> ``(There is) valid evidence of participation of the Iranian community'' in the attack, Menem told reporters. </P>
<P> Judge Galeano's order earlier this month has come under intense fire from critics inside and outside Argentina after the credentials of his sole witness were called into question. </P>
<P> Iranian radio said earlier the envoy, threatened by Menem with expulsion last week, had been recalled for consultations about ``baseless allegations and propaganda'' being spread in Argentina. </P>
<P> ``Despite the official request by the Islamic Republic of Iran, no evidence or document has been put forward by the Argentine officials, but different Argentine circles have continued to repeat the baseless allegations made by either unreliable or politically biased sources,'' it said. </P>
<P> The four Iranian officials have begun a lawsuit in Tehran against judge Galeano, the radio said. </P>
<P> ``They have asked the Argentine judge to explain why they have been implicated in the case, when their authentic and credible documents show they had not entered Argentina from three to six months prior to the incident,'' he added. </P>
<P> This appeared to change the official version from a protest note last week, when Iran said the four had not set foot in Argentina since between nine months and six years ago. </P>
<P> Iran said Monday a report by judge Galeano was full of discrepancies and blunders. It reiterated previous statements that the diplomats were not in Argentina on the dates mentioned in the judge's report. </P>
<P> Bilateral ties are tense after the judge, acting on the testimony of Manouchehr Motamer, a disaffected Iranian, issued the arrest warrants last week. </P>
