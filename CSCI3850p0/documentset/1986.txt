<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A member of South Korea's ruling party said Thursday that the United States, in an effort to break a deadlock in Geneva talks, offered North Korea a five-year grace period before demanding inspection of Pyongyang's nuclear program. </P>
<P> Lee Sei-kee of the South Korea's Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) told a Seoul news conference that Washington had also proposed starting construction of a new light-water reactor for North Korea before Pyongyang allows the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog agency to make a full inspection of its nuclear facilities. </P>
<P> Under the proposal, North Korea would have to allow the inspections sometime within five years, he said. </P>
<P> Diplomats in Geneva said Wednesday that U.S. negotiators had made new proposals at the talks on reshaping North Korea's nuclear program, but no details were available. </P>
<P> A DLP spokesman quoted Lee as saying that if North Korea had five more years, nearly 75 percent of the proposed reactor would be completed before Pyongyang had to open up its nuclear sites. </P>
<P> ``That is the proposal the U.S. has given North Korea,'' the spokesman quoted Lee as saying. </P>
<P> ``But that is not really our position. South Korea had consistently said nuclear inspections have to be conducted before construction begins on the light-water reactor,'' the DLP spokesman said. </P>
<P> He did not say where Lee, a member of the national assembly foreign-affairs and national unification committee, got his information. </P>
<P> Lee first made his comments at a parlimentary session Wednesday. </P>
<P> Seoul has recently urged Washington to slow its push for a negotiated agreement with North Korea in the long-running Geneva talks. </P>
<P> President Kim Young-sam has said Seoul would push for United Nations sanctions against Pyongyang if the U.S.-North Korean talks fail. </P>
<P> Kim said in an interview this week that he saw no reason for the United States to hurry into an agreement with Pyongyang ``because it is North Korea which is desperate wanting to strike deals, not us.'' </P>
<P> Kim said North Korea ``is in a very difficult situation both politically and economically'' and was itself extremely keen to bring the Geneva negotiations to a conclusion. </P>
<P> The United States and North Korea have been meeting in Geneva since September 23 to formalize a preliminary accord worked out in August under which Pyongyang would freeze its current nuclear programme based on graphite technology. </P>
<P> In return, a U.S.-led international consortium would finance and supply it with a light-water reactor -- a type that produces only tiny quantities of plutonium, a key ingredient of nuclear weaponry. </P>
<P> The West suspects the isolated and secretive communist North may have already made one or two nuclear bombs using plutonium from its one graphite reactor, a charge Pyongyang denies. </P>
<P> But the North has prevented the United Nations watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, from inspecting two sites where the Americans say there could be proof that nuclear weapons have been produced. </P>
<P> U.S. officials say Pyongyang has introduced new terms during the current talks, including a demand for about $2 billion in compensation for lost energy, and still refuses to accept the principle of inspection of the two suspect sites. </P>
