<P>  A shortage of public toilets is drawing public fire in Shenzhen, China's most developed city, the Beijing-controlled China News Agency (CNA) said Wednesday. </P>
<P> There are only 31 public toilets in the entire 126-square-mile Shenzhen Special Economic Zone bordering Hong Kong, while in the capital, Beijing, there are 35 public toilets per 0.4 square mile, the Hong Kong-based CNA said. </P>
<P> According Chinese government regulations, there should be at least one public lavatory every 300 yards along the main roads, it added. </P>
<P> ``Tourists in Shenzhen, especially the very desperate, can't help but burst into hotels or restaurants, where they are looked on with disdain,'' it said. ``They complain a lot about the inconvenience. </P>
<P> ``Authorities in the city have decided to invest $795,000 to build 15 new public toilets there,'' it said. ``The money has been received, and work could start this month.'' </P>
