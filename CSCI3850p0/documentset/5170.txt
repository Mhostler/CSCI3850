<P>  An art exhibition opened in London Friday which lets visitors do everything that is usually banned in galleries, from touching exhibits to eating them and even taking them home. </P>
<P> The show at London's Serpentine Gallery is entitled ``Take me (I'm Yours).'' </P>
<P> It features mountain of secondhand clothes which people can take away and a vertical ``picture carpet'' of black-and-white prints which they can pocket. </P>
<P> Visitors on the first day also crowded around a vending machine that offered candy bars, flower seeds and wooden clothes pegs. </P>
<P> ``Everything is either touch-able, take-able, test-able or buy-able. Everything other gallery exhibitions are not,'' said spokeswoman Julia Little. </P>
<P> The event is organized by Swiss curator Hans Ulrich Obrist and 12 artists are showing their work. Entrance is free to the public, with a vodka company footing the bill for the exhibits that are taken away or eaten. </P>
<P> ``It's weird but quite good. You don't usually get to touch things in galleries. Usually you're only allowed to look,'' said student Amber Hinton, 23. ``I'm coming back.'' </P>
<P> But not all visitors were impressed. ``It's nonsense,'' said Trevor Lowe, a caterer. ``It's surprising what artists can get away with in the name of art.'' </P>
