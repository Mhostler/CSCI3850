<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A federal jury Monday convicted a Colombian drug cartel hitman in the 1989 bombing of an Avianca Airlines flight that killed 107 people. </P>
<P> The jury foreman, standing and facing U.S. District Judge Sterling Johnson in Eastern District Court in Brooklyn, responded ``guilty as charged,'' as each of 13 counts was read against Dandenny Munoz-Mosquera, 28, an explosives expert and hitman for the infamous Medellin cartel. </P>
<P> The 13 charges included two murders, numerous counts of cocaine trafficking and import, and five racketeering and conspiracy acts along with the mid-air explosion of Avianca flight 203 Nov. 27, 1989. </P>
<P> Munoz, who has tightly controlled his emotions throughout the six-week trial, closed his eyes as the foreman read the verdict. </P>
<P> Munoz, known as ``La Quica'' in Medellin, faces a maximum of life in prison without parole when he is sentenced March 3. </P>
<P> The U.S. government has claimed jurisdiction in the case because two U.S. nationals were killed on the Cali-bound Avianca which exploded shortly after it left Bogota, and the cartel distributed cocaine into the United States. </P>
<P> Assistant U.S. Attorney Cheryl Pollak said, ``We hope this will send a message down to Colombia that you cannot commit terrorist acts in connection with your cocaine trafficking and expect to get away with it.'' </P>
<P> This was the second trial on the same charges for Munoz. The first trial last July ended in a hung jury after eight weeks of testimony and deliberation when two women jurors fought each other and had to be separated by federal marshals. </P>
<P> Munoz was arrested Sept. 25, 1991 and convicted on a relatively minor charge of providing false identity papers. </P>
<P> Prosecutors relied on testimony from many high-ranking former cartel members turned informants. </P>
<P> Carlos Botero, an architect and professor who worked as a gun-runner for the Medellin cartel, described meetings with Raul Castro of Cuba to arrange trafficking routes, and with former Haitian military leader Raul Cedras and other Haitian military men in which $10 million was paid by the cartel to the Haitians as their share of drug profits. </P>
<P> Another witness, Max Mermelstein, who arranged import routes into southern Florida from Colombia, told the court of special weapons and explosives training that cartel members received from a colonel in the Israeli army. </P>
<P> Throughout the trial, witnesses placed Munoz at Escobar's side as his chief of security, bodyguard, hitman and explosives expert. </P>
