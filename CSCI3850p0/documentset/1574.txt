<P>  A British prison guard who attacked a neighbor while sleepwalking was put on probation Friday when a court ruled he was temporarily insane. </P>
<P> Robet Burnett, 28, of Sunderland in northern England was found not guilty of burglary with intent to rape after experts told the court that sleepwalkers had no control over their action. </P>
<P> While dressed only in his underwear, Burnett forced his way in a neighbor's house during the night and dragged her upstairs into a bedroom before he apparently woke up and returned home. </P>
<P> The court said he was suffering from insane automatism. </P>
