<P>  At least 36 Cubans have been arrested in recent days trying to enter the United States along the Texas border with Mexico, federal authorities said Thursday. </P>
<P> Although U.S. officials believed the Cubans had left for Mexico before the flood of boat people began toward Florida, they expressed concern that more Cubans may seek to enter the U.S. by first traveling to Mexico. </P>
<P> ``It is hard to predict what will take place,'' said U.S. Border Patrol assistant chief Guadalupe Aguirre in Laredo. </P>
<P> ``But people might look for alternative routes other than going to Florida. We have not yet seen an influx of Cubans as a result of this new wave. But if we do, we will be very concerned about it,'' he said. </P>
<P> At least 24 Cubans were arrested Sunday in Laredo after arriving by boat on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico sometime in July and then traveling by land to the U.S., Aguirre said. </P>
<P> The distance between Cuba and the Yucatan Peninsula is roughly the same as the distance from the island nation to the Florida Keys. Mexico has no special policy toward Cubans. </P>
<P> Another group of 12 Cubans made their way to the border this week after apparently arriving in Mexico by plane. They were arrested after crossing the Rio Grande River near Laredo. </P>
<P> The Cubans are being held at a detention facility in Port Isabel, near Brownsville in south Texas, authorities said. </P>
<P> Federal authorities also said Thursday that Cuban refugees may be sent to the Port Isabel facility and up to 50 other Cubans being held now may be sent to the facility this week. </P>
<P> The Port Isabel facility is one of the nation's largest immigration detention centers and is intended to accommodate about 1,000 people, according to a facility spokesman, but during earlier immigration crises has held several thousand more in temporary camps. </P>
<P> ``We have been asked to be ready to receive detainees if needed,'' the facility spokesman said. </P>
<P> Unlike Cubans currently trying to reach Florida, the Cubans recently arrested in Texas will appear before federal officials who will consider applications for political asylum since they were arrested in the United States, authorities said. </P>
<P> The exodus of Cuban rafters continued unabated Thursday with 476 Cubans plucked from small boats and makeshift rafts by dawn on their way to Florida, the U.S. Coast Guard said. </P>
<P> For the month of August, a total of 14,715 Cuban rafters have been picked up at sea, according to Coast Guard figures. </P>
