<P>  Mauritanian authorities Monday arrested the leaders of the country's two main opposition parties, accusing them of fomenting three days of riots in the capital Nouakchott, state radio said. </P>
<P> The radio said Ahmed Ould Daddah, leader of the main opposition Union of Democratic Forces, and Hamdi Ould Mouknas, head of the Union for the Progress of Democracy, were accused of organizing unrest that broke out after the price of a loaf of bread was increased by 25 percent Saturday. </P>
<P> Earlier Monday, the government announced a curfew from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. in a bid to restore order. </P>
<P> Police have fired tear gas in an attempt to disperse young protesters who erected barricades, stoned cars and smashed shop windows. </P>
<P> The price of the most common loaf of bread went up from 16 cents to 20 cents following the introduction of a five percent value added tax on food products and 14 percent for industrial supplies, which further raised bakers' costs. </P>
<P> Monday night, state television carried a message advising young people not to follow a path which would lead them to ``treason and crime.'' </P>
<P> The sparsely populated west African country of two million people which straddles the divide between Arab and black Africa last year detained a group of people accused of being members of a foreign-funded Islamic extremist organization. </P>
