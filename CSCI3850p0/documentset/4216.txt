<DATELINE>LONDON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Princess Diana won an out-of-court settlement Wednesday over ``Peeping Tom'' photographs of her working out in a gym just five days before the case was due in court. </P>
<P> Diana won an apology from gym owner Bryce Taylor and the Mirror Group Newspapers, as well as a guarantee the photographs would never be used again. </P>
<P> Taylor's fee -- he hoped to earn $1.56 million from worldwide rights -- will be donated to charity. </P>
<P> Diana was enraged by his invasion of her privacy and quite ready to face cross-examination in court, the first time a member of the royal family would have given evidence since 1891. </P>
<P> News of the settlement broke in a fax from her London attorneys during the night as the popular princess was touring Japan. </P>
<P> ``It's been settled and we're pleased,'' her press secretary told reporters in Tokyo with a grin on his face after Diana's moral victory over the voracious tabloid press. </P>
<P> ``Her Royal Highness is pleased that her determined stance in defense of her right to privacy has been so completely vindicated,'' her lawyers' statement added. </P>
<P> Taylor, who was expected to fly over from Auckland in New Zealand for the case starting Monday, declined to comment. </P>
<P> Taylor's common-law wife, Lesley Scott, would only confirm that a settlement had been agreed. </P>
<P> Taylor took the photos with a hidden camera at the LA fitness club in London. They were printed in November 1993, shortly before Diana announced she was withdrawing from public life because of press intrusion. </P>
<P> Taylor told reporters at the time: ``It was calculated, surreptitious, sly ... It's a free country. I didn't overstep the mark. I have done nothing illegal.'' </P>
<P> Diana sued both Taylor and Mirror Group Newspapers seeking the surrender of the photographs and an account of the profits made. She based her claim on breach of contract, confidence and good faith. </P>
<P> Mirror Newspapers reported a large increase in circulation because of the photographs. </P>
<P> Under the agreement thrashed out by lawyers, Taylor's fee, frozen by an earlier court ruling, will be paid to the princess. </P>
<P> A statement from her lawyer Mishcon de Reya said she would not benefit. ``A donation will be made to a charity of her choice,'' it said. Her legal costs have been met in full. </P>
<P> Diana also won a permanent injunction preventing any further use of the photographs. All copies and negatives are being sent to her lawyer to be destroyed. </P>
<P> Taylor used a high-tech camera hidden in a panel above the princess's head to capture her astride an exercise machine wearing a leotard and cycling shorts. </P>
