<P>  Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic said Thursday that Bosnian Serbs would accept an international peace plan in two weeks if sanctions against his country were lifted. </P>
<P> ``In that case, they (the Bosnian Serbs) would accept the plan in a very, very short time, maybe one week or two,'' he told a news conference. </P>
<P> Asked whether he had any assurances from the Bosnian Serbs that they would accept the latest peace proposals under those circumstances, Jovanovic said he had no guarantees. </P>
<P> ``We don't have any guarantees because we don't have any contact with them, but it is our very firm conviction that the acceptance of the plan would come in a very short time.'' </P>
<P> Jovanovic said the Bosnian Serbs argued that the sanctions against Yugoslavia would stay in place regardless of what it did and they have used this logic to mobilize support. </P>
<P> Lifting the sanctions would prove the Bosnian Serbs wrong and deprive them of this argument. </P>
<P> The U.N. Security Council imposed stringent economic sanctions on the rump Yugoslav federation, now comprising only Serbia and Montenegro, for supporting and arming it rebel kinsman in Bosnia-Herzegovina where they have seized control of 70 percent of the country. </P>
<P> Selected sanctions on air travel and cultural ties were suspended Wednesday but the trade embargo remains. </P>
