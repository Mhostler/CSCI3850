<P>  Bosnian government forces launched a furious attack against a rebel Muslim faction and its Croatian Serb allies in northwest Bosnia Thursday, a U.N. spokesman said. </P>
<P> ``About 6 a.m. this morning it would appear the Bosnian army started an attack in the area between Velika Kladusa and Mala Kladusa,'' said Lt. Col. Gary Coward, a U.N. spokesman in Sarajevo. </P>
<P> ``We recorded about 700 detonations and more than 1,700 small-arms rounds fired between six o'clock and half-past eleven. The Bosnian army liaison officer then acknowledged his side was attacking Abdic and RSK forces.'' </P>
<P> Forces loyal to the Muslim-led government are surrounded in the northwestern enclave of Bihac by rebel Moslems, led by business tycoon Fikret Abdic, and by separatist Serb soldiers from Bosnia (BSA) and Croatia (RSK). </P>
<P> Coward said there were unconfirmed reports of an Abdic-RSK counter-attack commencing after noon Thursday. </P>
<P> A badly-tattered truce agreed late in December between government forces and Bosnian Serbs never took hold around Bihac because neither Abdic nor Croatian Serb troops were party to it. </P>
<P> Troop movements and skirmishes in the area around Velika Kladusa in recent days alerted the U.N. to the likelihood of serious fighting. </P>
<P> ``I can't say it comes as a surprise,'' commented Coward. </P>
<P> The town of Bihac, south of Velika Kladusa, is a U.N.-designated ``safe area.'' Thursday's fighting took place at least 20 miles to the north. </P>
