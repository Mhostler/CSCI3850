<P>  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Tuesday that there was no solid evidence that guerrillas plan an attack when President Clinton during his Middle East trip, but security forces were ready. </P>
<P> ``I don't know that we have good hard evidence,'' Rabin said on NBC's ``Today'' program when asked about reports from the region that a guerrilla attack is planned to coincide with Clinton's visit. </P>
<P> He spoke as Clinton was leaving Washington for a tour of the Middle East, including stops in Israel, Egypt and Syria. </P>
<P> In the last few weeks, militant extremists have attacked within Israel's borders, abducting and killing a 19-year-old soldier, and blowing up a bus in downtown Tel Aviv that left 21 people dead. </P>
<P> Security forces in all the countries Clinton will visit have been put on high alert after reports that extremist groups were preparing to take action. </P>
<P> Secretary of State Warren Christopher said on the same program that the trip was worth the risk because it would help the peace process. </P>
<P> He also noted that he had traveled through the region a number of times without incident and the countries to be visited ``are quite capable of providing a very strong security net.'' </P>
