<P>  Four ground-to-ground missiles, believed fired from inside Croatia, hit the town of Cavin, in the Bihac region of northern Bosnia on Monday, causing severe damage and many civilian casualties, Bosnian U.N. envoy Muhamed Sacirbey said. </P>
<P> He told reporters a letter was being sent to the Security Council asking it to follow up a statement on Sunday condemning fighting around Bihac, a U.N.,-proclaimed safe area, and expressing concern at reports that Croatian Serbs were helping Bosnian Serbs in fighting against the forces of the Moslem-led Bosnian government. </P>
<P> Sacirbey had no other details of the reported missile attack. </P>
