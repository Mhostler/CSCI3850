<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Superior Court Judge Lance Ito Friday ordered critical O.J. Simpson defense witness Rosa Lopez not to leave for her native El Salvador Saturday as she had planned and to return to court to testify before the jury Monday. </P>
<P> The order came moments after Ito, in a surprise move, ordered the jury in the double-murder case back to court to hear the testimony of Lopez, who says she can provide an alibi for the football legend. </P>
<P> Simpson has denied murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman. </P>
<P> In a day of continuing surprises, Ito ruled that Lopez was likely to leave the country and not return. He initially ordered that she give her testimony on videotape Friday night to be played to the jury later in the trial. </P>
<P> Then, without informing the attorneys, he decided that the jury, who had been given Friday off, should be brought into court to hear what Lopez had to say. </P>
<P> The judge envisioned going until midnight if necessary, but chief prosecutor Marcia Clark said she had no one to take care of her two young children. </P>
<P> Ito, saying he admired Clark as a single parent looking after a five-year-old and a three-year-old, then decided to recess the case until Monday. </P>
<P> He told Lopez' lawyer, Carl Jones, that Lopez was a material witness and that he believed she would leave the country and not return. Without her promise to remain until Monday, the judge said, he would be forced to incarcerate her. </P>
<P> Lopez, speaking through an interpreter, tearfully begged the judge to let her catch her plane to El Salvador on Saturday night. </P>
<P> ``I want to leave, I don't want to be here any longer,'' she said between sobs. </P>
<P> ``All these reporters have destroyed my life. I can't go on anywhere. I don't known what else to say. I promised to come today because I was promised this would be finished today and I could go to El Salvador. </P>
<P> ``I wish with my heart that I could go tomorrow back to my country,'' she added. </P>
<P> After being assured by the judge that he would start her testimony promptly at 9 a.m. PST (noon EST) Monday, she said, ''I will do it for you, your honor.'' </P>
<P> The judge then brought the jurors into the court and apologized for having dragged them from their hotel at a minute's notice. </P>
<P> The normally immaculately dressed panel appeared wearing sweatsuits, jeans and shirts barely tucked into their waistbands. </P>
<P> Simpson, whose star status as a sportscaster, actor and TV pitchman has made the trial one of the most-watched criminal cases in history, has pleaded not guilty to the murders. </P>
<P> The prosecution claims Simpson drove the two miles (3 km) from his estate to his ex-wife's house in the Bronco, stabbed his ex-wife and Goldman to death and then drove back. </P>
<P> Lopez is expected to testify that she saw Simpson's white Ford Bronco parked outside his house at 10:15 p.m. on June 12, 1994, when the prosecution says he was in the act of committing the murders. </P>
<P> During Friday's all-day hearing in the absence of the jury, Lopez said she had been harassed by the media, was now estranged from her daughter because of the press attention, and that she feared for her life. </P>
<P> She was asked by prosecutor Christopher Darden, ``You respect Judge Ito, don't you. If the judge supplies you with a plane ticket, a hotel room, will you return?'' </P>
<P> Lopez then turned to Ito and said, ``I like you very much, your honor, but I won't come back. I will go to another country, sir. And I respect you very much.'' </P>
<P> Lopez, who was a live-in housekeeper at the home next door to Simpson's, came out of hiding to appear in court, explaining that for the past several days she had been living in another state. </P>
<P> Asked by defense attorney Johnnie Cochran why she had left California, Lopez said, ``Because the reporters won't leave me alone. I'm tired of looking at them. They have been harassing me.'' </P>
<P> Lopez, who has lived in Los Angeles for 27 years, said she was no longer welcome in her daughter's house, where she had lived on weekends while working as a housekeeper for Simpson's neighbors for three years. </P>
<P> ``I have to leave her house because she told me that if I came to testify she didn't want me in her home. That made me very sad,'' Lopez, speaking through an interpreter, told Superior Court Judge Lance Ito. </P>
<P> She broke down in tears when Cochran asked her if anyone else lived with her daughter. ``I have two granddaughters who I adore,'' she said. </P>
<P> Lopez said she had been babysitting her granddaughters until Tuesday when her daughter returned from a business trip to New York. The two argued, she said, and she was thrown out of the house and spent the night sleeping in her car. </P>
<P> She left the state the next morning. Lopez said the argument was over the case and it was because of that that she had nowhere to live in Los Angeles. </P>
