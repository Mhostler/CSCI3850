<DATELINE>WASHINGTON, (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  White House lawyer Bruce Lindsey, a close confidant of President Clinton, was reported Thursday to be a ``target'' in the federal investigation of the Whitewater land deal affair. </P>
<P> CNN reported that ``sources close to the investigation say independent counsel Kenneth Starr would like to indict Lindsey and two other long-time Clinton associates in Arkansas before a five-year statute of limitation deadline expires May 25.'' </P>
<P> There was no reaction from Lindsey, a deputy counsel at the White House and one of Clinton's closest long-time associates. </P>
<P> The CNN report said it remained unclear whether Starr has enough evidence to persuade a federal grand jury in Little Rock, Ark., to bring indictments before the deadline. </P>
<P> The indictments would involve alleged irregularities in connection with Clinton's 1990 campaign for re-election as governor of Arkansas, according to the report. </P>
<P> A spokeswoman for Starr in Little Rock declined comment on the report. </P>
<P> David Kendall, a lawyer representing the Clintons in the Whitewater probe, maintained the 1990 Clinton campaign followed the law. </P>
<P> ``The 1990 Clinton for governor campaign was at all times mindful of its obligations under the law and made every effort to comply with the law,'' he said. </P>
<P> The Whitewater probe started as an investigation of a mountain land development deal that the Clintons had made while they lived in Arkansas, but has now expanded to include campaign financing and other matters. </P>
<P> White House press secretary Mike McCurry, when asked about the report, said he did not know anything about it. </P>
<P> ``I don't know myself here, nor do I know if anyone at the White House knows,'' McCurry said. </P>
<P> The Washington Post reported Thursday that the focus of the probe moved to Lindsey after another friend of the president, banker Neil Ainley of Perryville, Ark., agreed to cooperate with the Whitewater probe. </P>
<P> According to the paper, Lindsey and others instructed Ainley not to report to the Internal Revenue Service five alleged cash withdrawals totaling $52,500 for Clinton's 1990 gubernatorial campaign. </P>
<P> Ainley admitted in court Tuesday that he hid large cash withdrawals by representatives of Clinton's 1990 campaign in violation of federal banking laws. One of the campaign operatives to receive the cash allegedly was Lindsey. </P>
<P> Ainley pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of two misdemeanors during his appearance in U.S. District Court in Little Rock. </P>
<P> After Thursday's CNN report, Clinton lawyer Kendall said the 1990 campaign made all required filings and publicly reported the ``get-out-the-vote'' expenditures stemming from the Perry County Bank withdrawals described in Ainley's plea bargain agreement. </P>
<P> ``The campaign had no involvement whatsoever in the alleged wrongful conduct, which is the subject of this plea, and would have had absolutely no reason to be involved,'' Kendall said. </P>
<P> He added that he did not know if Lindsey has been notified he has become a target of the probe. </P>
