<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A strong earthquake was felt through a wide area of northern California Saturday evening but there were no reports of damage or injuries, officials said. </P>
<P> The quake, measuring 6.6 on the Richter scale, was centered in the Pacific Ocean about 80 miles west-southwest of Eureka, a town on the northern California coast, said John Minsch, a geophysicist at the National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo. </P>
<P> He said the quake was felt in many coastal areas and as far south as the northern part of the San Francisco Bay area, 200 miles south of Eureka. </P>
<P> Residents of northern California coastal towns who called a San Francisco radio station reported feeling the quake, but they said the tremor caused no damage and did not even knock objects off shelves. </P>
<P> Minsch said a larger quake had been recorded in the same general area last September, but it was not yet known if this was an aftershock to the earlier tremor. </P>
<P> Earlier Saturday a 4.1-magnitude earthquake rattled South Lake Tahoe, a popular resort in the Sierra Nevada mountains of northern California, officials said. </P>
<P> The quake was centered about 20 miles southeast of Lake Tahoe, along the California-Nevada border, the National Earthquake Information Center said. </P>
<P> There were no reports of damage or injuries. </P>
