<P>  Sixteen-month-old Kumari, the first elephant ever born at Washington's National Zoo, collapsed and died Wednesday after a short illness, officials said. </P>
<P> Keepers said the rare Asian elephant, a favorite attraction for tourists visiting the zoo, collapsed about 2 p.m. Wednesday. Veterinarians tried for over 30 minutes to revive her without success. </P>
<P> Kumari came down with an apparent stomach ailment Saturday, stopped eating completely Sunday and had been receiving constant medical care. </P>
<P> The baby elephant, whose name means ``princess'' in Sinhalese, had a rocky start when she was born in December 1993. Only hours after her birth, her mother stepped on her head. </P>
<P> The total population of Asian elephants worldwide has fallen to less than 50,000. Zoo officials said they would continue their breeding efforts. </P>
