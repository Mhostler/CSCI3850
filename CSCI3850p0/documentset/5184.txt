<DATELINE>PHNOM PENH, March 25 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Cambodian Second Prime Minister Hun Sen on Saturday said a United Nations human rights office threatened with closure would be allowed to remain in the capital. </P>
<P> ``The centre for human rights in Cambodia was established by a resolution of the U.N.,'' he told an impromptu airport news conference after returning from New York. ``The closure is not a unilateral decision from Cambodia.'' </P>
<P> The United Nations Centre for Human Rights has been strongly critical of human rights abuses linked to the Phnom Penh authorities. </P>
<P> Following talks earlier in the week with U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Hun Sen said a senior U.N. official from New York would arrive soon in Cambodia to discuss the future of the office. </P>
<P> On Thursday, foreign embassies condemned a government request to end the presence of U.N. human rights monitors in the country. </P>
<P> ``We think it's a bad idea,'' a U.S. embassy spokesman told Reuters. ``The human rights centre is serving a useful function and we would not like to see it closed.'' </P>
<P> Co-Prime Ministers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen had earlier written to Boutros-Ghali saying the centre was no longer needed and could dent investor and donor confidence. </P>
<P> They also complained about the centre's negative reports on Cambodia's human rights record, but have since said they were willing to discuss the issue. </P>
<P> In a reference to Cambodia's most outspoken government critic, former finance minister Sam Rainsy, Hun Sen referred to opponents of foreign aid as being the equivalent of a ``second Pol Pot.'' </P>
<P> Pol Pot, the enigmatic and secretive leader of the Khmer Rouge guerrillas, ruled Cambodia for nearly four years of revolution from 1976-79 during which more than a million Cambodians died. </P>
<P> ``Before there were Khmer Rouge who always opposed all types of assistance -- that's Pol Pot,'' Hun Sen said. </P>
<P> ``Now we have a second Pol Pot who opposes aid to Cambodians. So, whoever opposes aid to Cambodia is a Pol Pot ally or the second Pol Pot.'' </P>
<P> Rainsy had earlier asked international donors to withhold aid because, he said, the government was corrupt and inept. </P>
<P> On Saturday, Ranariddh's cabinet office denied the First Prime Minister had ordered security guards removed from Rainsy's house last Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``The rotation of security guards at Sam Rainsy's house is not the duty of the First Prime Minister, but it is the duty of the Ministry of Interior,'' the faxed statement said. </P>
<P> A statement issued by Rainsy's office about the decision to recall the bodyguards held Ranariddh responsible. </P>
<P> On Thursday, the powerful Deputy Prime Minister and Co-Interior Minister, Sar Kheng, entered the debate by saying the order was issued by Rainsy's own party, the National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful and Cooperative Cambodia. </P>
