<P>  Muslim guerrillas attacked pro-Israeli militia posts Tuesday in a third day of fighting in south Lebanon, sources in the militia said. </P>
<P> They said a militiaman of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army (SLA) was wounded when the guerrillas shelled three SLA outposts near the southern town of Jezzine and then attacked one of the posts with anti-tank grenades and machine gun fire. </P>
<P> Jezzine, a predominantly Christian town, is north of Israel's nine-mile wide border occupation zone in south Lebanon but is effectively controlled by Israel and the SLA. </P>
<P> Lebanese security sources said Israeli gunners pounded simultaneously areas near the villages of Maydoun and Berket Jabour north of the zone on the western edge of the Bekaa valley. </P>
<P> The areas are used by pro-Iranian Hizbollah (Party of God) guerrillas who attack Israeli and SLA forces. There were no immediate reports of casualties from the shelling. The sources said 25 shells had exploded and the barrage was continuing. </P>
<P> Israeli planes and big guns have blasted guerrilla-held areas in south Lebanon in the past two days with air raids and artillery bombardments. </P>
<P> Two civilians and a guerrilla were killed in air strikes and shelling Sunday after Hizbollah fighters killed an SLA militiaman in the zone. Monday Israeli planes fired rockets in two sorties against guerrilla-held positions after guerrillas pounded two SLA positions with mortar fire. There were no reports of casualties. </P>
