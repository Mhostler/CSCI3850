<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  U.S. and Mexican officials met Friday in an attempt to nail down an agreement to open up Mexico to $20 billion in U.S. aid and the high-level talks were expected to go into the weekend. </P>
<P> The talks, which began Thursday, come as the dollar is under fire in currency markets, partly due to the protracted discussions on a deal thought to have been basically wrapped up. </P>
<P> The $20 billion program was unveiled by President Clinton more than two weeks ago but has since become bogged down in negotiations between the two sides over the terms and conditions. </P>
<P> The U.S. support was to anchor a roughly $50 billion aid package designed to tide Mexico over a cash and currency crisis brought on by a heavy reliance on short-term debt and a ballooning trade deficit. </P>
<P> On Thursday, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Mexican Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz tried to calm financial markets by assuring them that there had been progress in the discussions. </P>
<P> ``We're working very constructively together,'' Rubin said at the start of a meeting with the Mexican finance minister. </P>
<P> Administration sources said the two ministers continued their discussions Friday but declined to give any details beyond suggesting they were likely to go into the weekend. </P>
<P> While U.S. officials watched the troubled path of the dollar, Mexican authorities have seen their own woes deepen, with Mexican steel firm Sidek defaulting on some short-term debt contracted by its subsidiaries. </P>
<P> Moreover, Mexican authorities found themselves having to deal with a serious but unrelated financial difficulty with the decision of the country's insurance fund to take full control of the stocks of two banks. </P>
<P> Authorities Friday announced that the fund had taken over the stock of Banca Cremi and Banca Union, two stricken institutions caught up in an alleged network of fraud last year. </P>
<P> The aid package has faced tough questioning almost from the beginning. Lawmakers and Wall Street have been asking if the deal has sufficient protections to ensure the money will not be lost if Mexico cannot get its economy back on track. </P>
<P> At the same time, the United States wants to make sure Mexico makes the kind of hard choices necessary to reform its economy so the aid package succeeds in getting the country over the hump. </P>
<P> While the U.S. Treasury was mum on the state of the talks Friday, a Mexican official in Tokyo said it anticipated that a final deal would be struck by the middle of next week. </P>
<P> Marco Antonio Provencio Munoz, assistant undersecretary for economic and multilateral affairs at Mexico's foreign ministry, told a news conference discussions were centering now on the interest rates Mexico would have to pay in the U.S. package. </P>
<P> He denied reports the United States would receive a hefty 10 percent return on its aid. </P>
<P> Some U.S. lawmakers have criticized the Treasury for bypassing Congress in putting together the package, although the congressional leadership has endorsed the program. </P>
<P> The criticism has made the Treasury especially careful in negotiating the terms and conditions of the aid, particularly after an earlier loan guarantee package was given the cold shoulder on Capitol Hill. </P>
