<DATELINE>TOKYO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A second 13-year-old schoolboy hanged himself in a central Japanese town Tuesday, sparking fresh controversy about bullying and suicides, police said. </P>
<P> The boy's body was found on the same day that Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama held a special cabinet meeting to discuss the first death and Japan's Education Ministry urged teachers to crack down on schoolyard bullying. </P>
<P> The second boy, who was not identified, left no note explaining his death but it raised fears that there might be a wave of copycat suicides. Police said the body was found hanging from a ceiling beam at a workshop owned by his father. </P>
<P> Shoji Sota, vice principal of the school, said the boy's schoolmates had scribbled on his bag and injured his head by throwing a chair last October, Kyodo news service reported. </P>
<P> Kyodo said some classmates said they had seen the word ``die'' scribbled on the bag. The classmates said the boy was also depressed about recent poor examination results. </P>
<P> The latest young suicide lived in the town of Okazaki, next to the town of Nishio where 13-year-old Kiyoteru Okochi hanged himself last month, leaving a note saying that several classmates had bullied him into stealing money from his family. </P>
<P> The note said that over the period of a year the bullies extorted $10,000 from him, ducking him in a nearby river if he refused to pay. </P>
<P> The boy's poignant suicide note said: ``I just can't find any money to take to them today.'' </P>
<P> A major newspaper reported last week that at least 10 schoolboys had taken their lives because of bullying so far this year. </P>
<P> The suicides have put all aspects of Japan's strictly disciplined school system under the microscope. </P>
<P> In other recent signs of strains in Japan's school system, a teacher was suspended for hitting a pupil in the head every day for six months because he was inattentive, and a schoolboy playing truant died in a car accident while being pursued by a teacher in another car. </P>
<P> In a report it issued Tuesday, the Education Ministry announced an emergency survey of teachers and headmasters to gauge the extent of schoolyard bullying. </P>
<P> It also urged teachers to solve problems of stress caused by competition among students to pass university entrance examinations, and refusal by some students to attend classes. </P>
