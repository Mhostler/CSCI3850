<DATELINE>CYANGUGU, Rwanda (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  French troops clashed with militiamen in southwest Rwanda, a French officer said. </P>
<P> Foreign Legionnaires skirmished with a Hutu militia over three nights near Bugarama and inflicted casualties, Lieutenant Colonel Jacques Hogard said Sunday in Cyangugu in the French-declared ``safe zone.'' </P>
<P> ``We are hunting them,'' he said, adding that the legionnaires suffered no casualties. </P>
<P> The militia, known as the Interahamwe, are a French-trained force who played a leading role in massacring members of the Tutsi minority after the Hutu government launched a genocidal purge in April. </P>
<P> Now with the ex-government's army defeated by the Tutsi- dominated Rwanda Patriotic Front, the militia are coercing the Hutu population into joining them in exile and carrying out hit-and-run attacks on Tutsis. </P>
<P> ``Most of the militia are in Zaire. They come across for a few hours and try to threaten the population and order them to leave ... Sometimes they fire at us and too much is too much -- we return fire immediately,'' Hogard said. </P>
