<P>  Prince Charles had three separate affairs with Camilla Parker Bowles, who gave him the warmth and understanding he never found with Princess Diana, excerpts from a new book said Sunday. </P>
<P> In the latest episode of Britain's royal soap opera, the excerpts from the prince's authorized biography, published in the Sunday Times, also said he decided to separate from Diana because he thought she was denying him access to their two sons. </P>
<P> The excerpts said Charles turned to Camilla for the third time at the end of 1986 or early in 1987 after he felt his marriage to Diana had irretrievably broken down. </P>
<P> ``That they loved each other was not in any doubt: in Camilla Parker Bowles, the prince found the warmth, the understanding and the steadiness for which he had always longed and had never been able to find with any other person,'' said the book, by journalist Jonathan Dimbleby. </P>
<P> ``Their relationship...was later to be portrayed merely as a tawdry affair,'' he wrote. ``For the prince, however, it was a vital source of strength to a man who had been saddened beyond words by a failure for which he invariably blamed himself.'' </P>
<P> Dimbleby also revealed that Charles has been advised by the Church of England that he could remarry and still become king if his legal separation from Diana led to divorce. </P>
<P> The excerpts tell how Charles first had an affair with Parker Bowles -- then Camilla Shand -- in 1972, when he was a young naval officer. ``He lost his heart to her almost at once,'' Dimbleby wrote. </P>
<P> The book reveals glimpses of a gauche, unworldly suitor as he sailed the globe, acquainting himself -- as an observer -- with the inside of a Colombian brothel and declining an invitation to smoke marijuana in Hawaii ``with two spectacular blonde ladies.'' </P>
<P> The second fling with Camilla, now married to Andrew Parker Bowles, was in the late 1970s and ended just before his marriage in 1981 to Lady Diana Spencer. </P>
<P> Charles had virtually no contact with Camilla for five years before the breakdown of his marriage led him to renew what Dimbleby calls ``the most intimate friendship of his life.'' </P>
<P> The biography also said Charles intends to create a new royal house of Mountbatten-Windsor after he is crowned king, ending the exclusive use of the Windsor name, established in 1917 by King George V, Queen Elizabeth II's grandfather. </P>
