<P>  The Vatican sought Thursday to defuse a dispute within Austria's Roman Cathlolic Church by appointing a future successor to Cardinal Hans Hermann Groer as Archbishop of Vienna. </P>
<P> A controversy over allegations that Groer sexually molested a 17-year-old former pupil 20 years ago had threatened to split the church. </P>
<P> The Vatican and the Austrian government announced simultaneously that Vienna Suffragan Bishop Christoph Schoenborn, 50, scion of an old Austrian aristocratic family, would be Groer's successor. </P>
<P> ``The Apostolic Nunciatura (Vatican embassy) has informed the Foreign Ministry that the Holy Father has appointed Dr. Christoph Schoenborn as co-adjutor with the right to succeed to the Archdiocese of Vienna,'' a government statement said. </P>
<P> Church sources said the arrangement would allow Groer, 75, to delegate all his responsiblities to his co-adjutor and retire within weeks. </P>
<P> Under a concordate between Austria and the Vatican, the Holy See must inform the government of senior church appointments. The government has 14 days to reject the appointment, otherwise it will go through. </P>
<P> Foreign Minister Alois Mock said the agreement was a mere formality and the government had never rejected a Vatican appointment. </P>
<P> The allegations against Groer, who denies them, divided the church, with some bishops openly calling for his resignation. A poll published by the weekly News said 81 percent of Austria's Catholics thought he should quit. </P>
<P> Groer had already submitted his mandatory resignation to Pope John Paul II on reaching the retirement age of 75. The Vatican has not so far formally accepted it. </P>
<P> The controversy surrounding Groer erupted three weeks ago when Josef Hartmann, 37, told the news magazine Profil that Groer, then a teacher at a Roman Catholic school for boys at Hollabrunn near Vienna, had molested him 20 years ago. </P>
<P> Other alleged cases of sexual abuse by Austrian clergy have since surfaced. Last Monday a priest admitted sexually abusing a 10-year-old male pupil when he was a teacher in Salzburg in the 1960s. </P>
