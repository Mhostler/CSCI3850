<P>  British charities stepped up efforts Monday for new laws so that Britons who sexually exploit children overseas can be brought to justice and prosecuted at home. </P>
<P> The U.K. Coalition on Child Prostitution and Tourism, an umbrella organization, is pressing members of the House of Lords (upper house) to pass the Sexual Offenses Amendment Bill during its second reading Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``The U.K. is the only tourist-sending country to reject the need for such legislation, even though an estimated one million children in Asia alone are being exploited daily in this way,'' Anne Badger, the campaign coordinator, said. </P>
<P> The coalition wants Britain to extend its extra-territorial jurisdiction which already exists for crimes of murder, slavery and treason to cover sexual offenses against children. </P>
<P> In the past two decades, the expansion of the child sex industry in some countries has coincided with the rapid growth in tourism, which is expected to become the world biggest industry by the year 2000. </P>
<P> The United States, Australia, Sweden, France, Germany and Norway have already introduced laws to end the exploitation of children. David Ould, a fellow campaigner, said it is time Britain took similar action. </P>
<P> ``It is part of the international obligation for all governments under the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child which the U.K. has signed,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``What we're trying to do is ensure that the government gets the message that people care... There has already been an 80,000 (signature) petition delivered to (Prime Minister) John Major.'' </P>
<P> The coalition is working with ECPAT (End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism), a Bangkok-based international organization fighting to end child sex tourism. </P>
<P> During the last three years ECPAT monitored the activities of sex tourists in Asia. Of the 160 foreign men arrested in Asia during that period 40 were American, 28 came from Britain and 22 from Australia. </P>
<P> Britain was fourth with 19 arrests followed by France 10, and Japan and Canada 7. ECPAT emphasized the arrests were a random sampling and did not cover all cases during that period. </P>
<P> The coalition said the demand for younger children is rapidly increasing due to the misconception that they are a lower risk group for HIV and AIDS. </P>
<P> Although the problem is most acute in Asian countries such as Thailand, the Philippines and Sri Lanka it also occurs in African and Latin American countries. </P>
<P> ``There's a long way to go,'' said Badger ``but we're optimistic.'' </P>
