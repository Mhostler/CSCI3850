<P>  The Security Council again Thursday was hopelessly divided on a Russian-French statement characterizing Iraq's progress to date on an arms-monitoring program. </P>
<P> The United States wanted no statement while other council members, in closed-door consultations, argued about the type of statement the 15-member body should issue, envoys said. </P>
<P> The division is indicative of what will happen in 1995 when the council is expected to seriously consider lifting the oil embargo against Iraq, imposed after Saddam Hussein's force invaded Kuwait in 1990. </P>
<P> For the past 10 days, council members have been arguing about how to react to a six-month report from Rolf Ekeus, head of the U.N. Special Commission in charge of Iraqi disarmament. </P>
<P> Ekeus said that Iraq was cooperating on installing a crucial long-term monitoring program to make sure it did not reacquire nuclear, chemical, biological and ballistic weapons. </P>
<P> But he also chastised Iraq for concealing information on its past weapons program, particularly in the area of biological weapons research and capability. </P>
<P> The Russian-French original draft would have spelled out Ekeus' conclusions. A shorter compromise statement merely said the council endorsed Ekeus conclusions and recommendations but this also was not approved. A statement, compared to a resolution, needs agreement from all 15-members. </P>
<P> ``We said everything entirely based on the Special Commission's findings,'' said Russia's Ambassador Sergei Lavrov. ``I asked questions as to why this statement was not considered appropriate and unfortunately did not receive any answers.'' </P>
<P> U.S. Deputy Ambassador Edward Gnehm said he did not anticipate that the statement on the Ekeus report would be resurrected again. ``There was no agreement on the text'' he said, adding that there were about three different drafts on the table. </P>
<P> U.S. sources said Washington felt no text was needed and that the Iraqis were fully aware about what had to be done. </P>
<P> Russia, France and China, among other nations, are expected to push for a statement again at the next review of sanctions, scheduled for mid-January. But no action to ease the sanctions is anticipated then. </P>
<P> Envoys said that these three countries, all permanent council members, are attempting to build momentum toward lifting or suspending sanctions and isolate the United States. </P>
<P> Iraq has been under sanctions since August 1990 when its troops invaded Kuwait. Under a 1991 Gulf War cease-fire resolution, exports from Iraq, such as oil, are linked to weapons demands which Baghdad is expected to satisfy in 1995. </P>
<P> Imports of goods to Iraq are linked to other demands, such as freeing Kuwaiti prisoners and returning all stolen goods. The United States is insisting on all demands before the oil embargo is lifted while other states say the council should stick to its resolution. </P>
