<P>  Rock star David Bowie is to sell his Caribbean home on the island of Mustique and spend more time in Europe with his wife, the Somali-born model Iman. </P>
<P> Bowie, whose neighbors on the island include Rolling Stone singer Mick Jagger and Britain's Princess Margaret, said Friday: ``We are becoming more focused now on Europe.'' </P>
<P> The luxury hill-top house is up for sale at $5 million, with all its contents. ``It makes sense to sell the property to someone who will appreciate it and use it more regularly,'' Bowie said in a statement. </P>
<P> ``Since my marriage to Iman in June 1992, I spend less and less time there and we now want to have more time in Umbria.'' </P>
<P> They are now planning to build a summer house in Italy. A spokesman for the agent handling the sale said: ``It's a very exotic, very special property. It should appeal to anyone who wants privacy.'' </P>
