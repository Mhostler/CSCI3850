<P>  Polish President Lech Walesa and Prime Minister-elect Jozef Oleksy failed to reach an agreement on key cabinet appointments Thursday but further talks are due next week. </P>
<P> Walesa's spokesman Leszek Spalinski told a news conference the president and Oleksy discussed the issue at a short meeting but no conclusions were reached. </P>
<P> ``The president and Mr. Oleksy held talks about presidential control of foreign policy and consultations will continue on Monday,'' Spalinski said. </P>
<P> Under Poland's constitution, the president has special responsibility for foreign and interior affairs as well as defense, which he says gives him a decisive say on appointments to the three relevant ministries. </P>
<P> Spalinski said Wednesday Walesa might refuse to formally appoint the new government if these prerogatives were not respected. </P>
<P> Oleksy, elected prime minister by parliament to replace Waldemar Pawlak Wednesday, says Walesa has only the right to be consulted on the three nominations. </P>
