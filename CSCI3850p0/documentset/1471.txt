<P>  Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter pulled off a diplomatic triumph here Sunday night, persuading Haiti's ruling military junta to step down and turning back the first wave of a massive U.S. invasion. </P>
<P> Carter flew home late Sunday after getting military leader Raoul Cedras' to agree to a peace pact in Port-au-Prince, President Clinton confirmed in a televised address. </P>
<P> American troops will go into Haiti peacefully Monday to ensure order, Clinton said. Ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide will return to power after the military rulers have departed by October 15, as called for in the agreement. </P>
<P> ``The military leaders of Haiti have agreed to step down from power,'' Clinton said in the five-minute speech. </P>
<P> ``The dictators have recognized it is in their best interests and in the best interests of the Haitian people to relinquish power peacefully,'' Clinton said. </P>
<P> The accord was hammered out in a final six-hour session Sunday between the Carter-led mission and Lieutenant General Cedras at military headquarters in the capital after three previous rounds of inconclusive talks which began Saturday. </P>
<P> It calls for the retirement of ``certain military officers ... when a general amnesty will be voted into law by the Haitian parliament or October 15, 1994, whichever is earlier.'' </P>
<P> After talks with Cedras and his chief of staff, General Philippe Biamby, the U.S. team drove a short distance to the National Palace, where they saw Jonassaint. Carter and his team drove from there to the airport, then headed back to the United States. </P>
<P> The third junta member, Port-au-Prince's shadowy police chief Colonel Michel Francois, did not attend the talks. </P>
<P> The three-man junta led by Cedras has run the impoverished Caribbean country since Aristide was ousted in a coup in 1991. </P>
<P> Shortly before midnight, military-installed President Emile Jonassaint went on televison to explain that he signed the agreement to avoid an invasion-related bloodbath. </P>
<P> Speaking in French and Creole, the 81-former Supreme Court justice said he took the decision after learning that more than 61 warplanes and 20 or so warships were ``ready to come and wipe us out.'' </P>
<P> ``After thinking it over, with the support of the high command of the Haitian armed forces, I thought, no, we couldn't let the annihilation of Haiti happen without any reason; hence we signed the accord,'' he said, as translated by a television interpreter. </P>
<P> Seeking to calm Haitians, he added: ``You may sleep tonight. There will be no invasion. There will be no planes coming in to bombard us.'' </P>
<P> Clinton's White House speech, broadcast on some Haitian radio stations, was met by sporadic bursts of semi-automatic weapons fire, witnesses said. </P>
<P> He said the accord enabled him to recall 61 Air Force troop planes already en route to Haiti for an invasion air drop of paratroops. He said the Haitian junta signed the accord after being told the planes were being loaded. </P>
<P> Although Clinton said the junta would step down by October 15 at the latest, after Haiti's parliament had passed an amnesty law, he did not say they would leave the country as U.S. officials had previously said they must. He said Aristide would return after the junta had yielded power. </P>
<P> Secretary of State Warren Christopher later told a Washington briefing: ``For all practical purposes they (Haiti's military leaders) are certain to leave.'' </P>
<P> Word that an invasion had been averted sent a wave of relief through the United States, where many had feared bloodshed and an open-ended commitment fraught with dangers. </P>
<P> However, some Haitian exiles in Miami expressed disappointment and anger because the agreement will allow their homeland's military leaders to remain in power for up to another month and because it set no date for the return of their democratically elected president. </P>
<P> The Pentagon said it would begin sending in a well-armed force of about 15,000 troops Monday to uphold the accord. </P>
<P> ``Our entry plan is not based on trust. We are going in with a very large and well-armed force,'' Defense Secretary William Perry told reporters at the White House. </P>
<P> He said U.S. officials believed that the risk of sniping and other acts of violence against U.S. forces ``is minimized'' by the agreement between the Haitian military and Carter. </P>
<P> Clinton had been authorized by the United Nations to restore democracy in Haiti. </P>
<P> Sunday's agreement also calls for a quick end to the United Nations economic embargo, which severely crippled the economy of Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. </P>
<P> ``The embargo and the economic sanctions will be lifted without delay and the needs of the Haitian people satisfied as quickly as possible,'' Jonassaint said in Sunday's address. </P>
<P> Carter flew home with the other two members of his peace mission, retired General Colin Powell, former head of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Senator Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. </P>
<P> The former president, who left office in 1981, now looks a strong favorite for the Nobel Peace Prize being announced next month. His presidency had been viewed as disappointing, but he has since flowered as a gifted mediator in world trouble spots. </P>
<P> Throughout the negotiations, several hundred Haitians interspersed with armed civilians had demonstrated noisily against Aristide. Some had been brought in by trucks. </P>
<P> Haitian government television broadcast signs saying ``Democracy yes, Aristide no'' while a song played over images of Clinton said in creole: ``Clinton, Clinton, you are angry, what can a little country like Haiti do to you, why do you want to send Americans soldiers to kill us?'' </P>
