<P>  Three years after flamboyant pop star Freddie Mercury died of AIDS, a bitter dispute has erupted between the man and woman who were both his long-time lovers. </P>
<P> Hairdresser Jim Hutton, who lived for seven years with the outrageous star of the supergroup Queen, has angrily attacked Mary Austin who now lives in Mercury's Georgian mansion. </P>
<P> Hutton's resentment erupted in his autobiography published Thursday. Austin, defending herself, said: ``Jim has a very vivid imagination. This is between him and his conscience.'' </P>
<P> Hutton was left $818,900 in Mercury's will when the star died in 1991. He says he was then evicted from the house by Austin whom he accuses of being cruel and thoughtless. </P>
<P> Hutton was working as a hairdresser in London's Savoy hotel when he met Mercury at a gay club in 1983. Both looked strikingly similar with macho moustaches, cropped hair and hairy chests. </P>
<P> He came to work for Mercury as his gardener and stayed to the end as his lover, nursing the singer through the agonizing last months of AIDS. </P>
<P> Hutton, who discovered before Mercury's death that he too was HIV positive, says of Mercury: ``Freddie was simply the greatest love of my life. I know I'll never love that way again.'' </P>
<P> He quotes Austin, who herself had a seven-year affair with Mercury and then stayed a close friend, as cruelly telling him: ``Freddie is probably waiting for you already.'' </P>
<P> In his autobiography, Hutton paints a picture of a singer who lived up to his name with wild mood swings, an affinity for snorting cocaine and a voracious appetite for sex: ``When he got the urge, there was no stopping him.'' </P>
<P> But he paid the penalty for living a promiscuous lifestyle just as AIDS was cutting a swathe through the gay community. </P>
<P> ``Before we met, he'd done more than his fair share of living the fast-lane life of a successful rock star: all sex, drugs and rock and roll with a string of one-night-stand strangers,'' Hutton writes. </P>
<P> But Hutton, who has no idea when the AIDS ax will fall on him, has just one regret and concludes his book with a heartfelt safe sex message: ``I'd have done it all again -- but this time with a condom.'' </P>
