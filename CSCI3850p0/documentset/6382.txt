<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A Nobel Prize-winning biologist received a letter last month from a mysterious serial bomber most recently linked to a blast that killed a lobbyist in Sacramento, Calif., federal agents said Monday. </P>
<P> San Francisco FBI Special Agent Jim Freeman said the letter, addressed to Richard Roberts at New England Biolabs in Beverly, Mass., was received on April 24, the day a package bomb killed timber industry lobbyist Gilbert Murray. </P>
<P> Roberts, who could not be reached for comment Monday, is a 1993 Nobel Prize-winning biologist. </P>
<P> The letter was one of four sent by the so-called ''Unabomber'' just days before the Sacramento blast. </P>
<P> Freeman said the Roberts letter was identified as ''positively authored by the Unabomb suspect'' based on information contained in another letter sent in April by the suspect to the New York Times. </P>
<P> The Roberts letter was postmarked Oakland, Calif. </P>
<P> The FBI said the contents of the Roberts letter would not be disclosed. The New York Times printed its letter and the FBI last month released a copy of the Unibomber letter to David Gelernter, a Yale computer science professor who was injured by a letter bomb in June 1993. </P>
<P> Attacks by the ``Unabomber'' go back to 1978. Two other people have been killed and 23 injured in the blasts. </P>
