<P>  Newt Gingrich came face to face with Newt Gingrich Tuesday as Saturday Night Live comic Chris Farley wowed delighted House Republicans with an irreverent impersonation of the hyperactive House Speaker. </P>
<P> To chants of ``Newt, Newt, Newt'' the portly Farley, wearing a shocking white wig and congressionally conservative suit, took aim at a surprised Gingrich during what had been billed as a regular meeting of House Republicans. </P>
<P> ``Let me tell you about the new books I'm reading,'' Farley said, hitting on Gingrich's penchant for recommending thick tomes to lawmakers. Farley's alternative list included works by steamy romance writers Danielle Steele and Jackie Collins. </P>
<P> Mimicking the frantic pace of legislative action during the 100-day ``Contract with America,'' Farley quickly gaveled through a series of legislative ``motions'' to prove how much Republicans could move in 10 minutes when not hampered by ''bizarre, weird Democrats.'' </P>
<P> Actions ``approved'' by laughing Republicans included a motion to keep reporters away from Gingrich's mother (she told Connie Chung that Newt thought Hillary Clinton was a bitch), to make Oregon Sen. Mark Hatfield -- the lone Republican to vote against the balanced budget amendment -- an official Democrat, and to change ``Hail to the Chief'' to ``Hail to the Speaker.'' </P>
<P> One Farley motion for a second ``Contract with America'' met with dissent by exhausted Republicans. He crumpled up and tossed away a term limits motion -- the one item in the Contract to be defeated so far. </P>
<P> Former pop singer Sonny Bono, a freshman Republican, did not act on a motion to sing ``I've got you Newt'' to Gingrich. </P>
<P> ``I don't know about you but I'm hungry ... can you give me a school lunch,'' Farley said at one point, referring to Republicans' bad press over reductions in spending for the school lunch program. </P>
<P> After being embraced by the real Gingrich, Farley asked him ``how our wife Marianne was doing,'' then administered a second oath of office to the speaker, who solemnly placed one hand on a Diet Coke can -- Coca Cola's corporate headquarters are in Gingrich's home state of Georgia. </P>
<P> Gingrich, who wants to cut funding for public television, swore not to kill Sesame Street's Big Bird and to make the new book he is writing ``way less boring than (vice president) Al Gore's.'' </P>
