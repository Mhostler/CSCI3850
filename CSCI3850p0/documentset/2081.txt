<DATELINE>SHANGHAI (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Shanghai dissident Li Guotao has been sentenced to three years of ``re-education through labor,'' dissident sources said Tuesday. </P>
<P> They said Li's family had been officially notified of the sentence. No further details were immediately available. </P>
<P> Li is the fourth member of Shanghai's small dissident community to be sentenced to three years in a labor camp in the past several weeks. </P>
<P> The others are Yang Zhou, Bao Ge and Yang Qinheng. </P>
<P> A member of the Shanghai-based Association for Human Rights, Li is a close associate of Yang Zhou, a co-founder of the association, which has been battling city authorities to register as a legal entity. </P>
<P> Three years is the maximum sentence under the ``re-education through labor'' program, which was formerly a way of punishing petty criminals but is now increasingly used to silence political dissidents in China. </P>
<P> Sentences are handed down by a panel of local officials, avoiding the publicity of a formal trial. </P>
<P> Virtually all known political activists in Shanghai are now either in jail or under some form of administrative detention. </P>
