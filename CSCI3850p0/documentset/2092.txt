<DATELINE>LUANDA, Angola (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Angolan radio Tuesday reported new fighting between government forces and UNITA rebels, with residents of the capital, Luanda, responding warily to news that a peace agreement could be signed soon. </P>
<P> ``The military situation is tense,'' state radio said, adding that UNITA attacked a column of vehicles 15 miles from the northern town of Saurimo and four people were killed. </P>
<P> It said the clash occurred Monday and added that the southern town of Hoque ``is still in government hands after an attack yesterday.'' </P>
<P> No more information or independent confirmation was immediately available. </P>
<P> In the Zambian capital Lusaka, teams from the Angolan government and UNITA met Tuesday to thrash out a peace timetable before heading home to get the final go-ahead from their respective leaders. </P>
<P> Diplomatic sources said they expected the agreement to be initialed by the end of this month, followed by two weeks of talks between government and UNITA military chiefs and a formal signing by mid-November. </P>
<P> More than 11 months of negotiations produced an agreement in principle, U.N. mediator Alioune Blondin Beye told a news conference in Lusaka Monday. </P>
<P> But a senior aid source in Luanda said he expected a flurry of fighting before any cease-fire was signed. </P>
<P> ``I think we will see some heavy fighting over the next 10 days. They will be jockeying for position on the ground before the cease-fire stops them,'' he said. </P>
<P> The state daily Jornal de Angola said the agreement would be initialed in the Zambian capital ``at any moment.'' </P>
<P> It said in an editorial: ``It seems the worst has already passed ... there are a lot of people who publicly say that an agreement is possible even in October. </P>
<P> ``But our sad past experience means we must still have patience, we must wait and see.'' </P>
<P> State radio reported that members of parliament were taking a wait-and-see attitude to the news from Lusaka. </P>
<P> ``Lusaka is still an unknown. After so much waiting and so much uncertainty for so many people, I am still skeptical,'' opposition member Laura da Encarnacao said on the radio. </P>
<P> Angola's civil war erupted upon independence from Portugal in 1975. A short peace following 1991 accords ended when UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola) rejected defeat in U.N.-sponsored elections in 1992 and returned to war. </P>
