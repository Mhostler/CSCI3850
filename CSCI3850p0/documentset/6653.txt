<P>  Bangladesh garment manufacturers said Thursday they would dismiss all child laborers by October to avoid a boycott by importers. </P>
<P> ``We have decided to get rid of all child workers by October instead of plans to phase them out over next two years,'' said Redwan Ahmed, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association. </P>
<P> The move followed threats that Bangladesh's booming clothing industry, which accounts for 55 percent of total exports, might face an import ban by the United States unless it ended child labor immediately. </P>
<P> Ahmed told reporters the United States bought about 50 percent, or $700 million worth, of Bangladeshi ready-made garments every year. </P>
<P> On Wednesday, the association refused to sign a memorandum of understanding with the Bangladesh government under which the industry would phase out child labor by 1997. </P>
<P> ``We are facing threats of an immediate ban... so we can't wait until 1997,'' Ahmed said. </P>
<P> The government said it needed the time to deal with the prospect of more than 300,000 child workers losing their jobs. </P>
<P> ``We are not responsible for rehabilitating the destitutes. And we can't do it at the cost of our business,'' Ahmed said. </P>
<P> ``The government's Social Welfare Ministry should have plans for the children who need to earn a living for themselves and their families,'' he told Reuters. </P>
<P> Human rights activists expressed concern over the association's decision to dismiss child workers at ``such short notice and without taking alternative measures for their livelihood.'' </P>
<P> Nazmul Huda, a former information minister and a leading human rights activist, said last week there was ``no justification on imposing a ban on child labor in a country like Bangladesh where millions of child laborers work merely for survival.'' the president of the Bangladesh Garment Workers Federation, Mohammad Khorshid Alam, told reporters that so far 50,000 child workers had been retrenched from clothing factories after the U.S. threatened to cut imports two years ago. </P>
<P> ``The right to a living is the highest human right,'' Alam said. ``The perspective of human rights in the advanced world and backward countries is different.'' </P>
<P> Bangladeshi law bans child labor under the age of 15, but it has never been enforced. </P>
