<P>  U.S. Coast Guard officials said Tuesday they still hope to find three Canadian scuba divers missing for four days after their boat sank in the Gulf of Mexico off the Florida coast. </P>
<P> The search, involving seven helicopters, an airplane and four vessels, had covered 20,000 square miles since last Friday evening, when the 25-foot boat went down about 55 miles west of Fort Myers, on Florida's west coast. </P>
<P> The missing men were wearing diving wetsuits and inflatable life jackets which would help keep them warm and afloat, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Jeff Hall. </P>
<P> ``There's still a chance we can find them,'' said Hall. </P>
<P> The missing men were identified as Omar Schearer, 26, Kent Munro, 25, and Dave Madott, 25, all from Mississauga, Ontario, a suburb of Toronto. </P>
<P> A fourth man, Jeff Wandich, 27, also of Mississauga, was rescued by the Coast Guard Sunday morning, officials said. Wandich told his rescuers the four started swimming when their boat went down Friday evening, but were separated in rough seas. </P>
<P> Wandich swam more than five miles and reached a lighthouse platform, from which he was rescued by helicopter, Hall said. </P>
