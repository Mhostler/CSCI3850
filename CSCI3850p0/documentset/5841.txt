<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Clinton said Tuesday night he was prepared to fight to the end for Senate approval of his nomination of Dr. Henry Foster as surgeon general. </P>
<P> ``Yes, I'm going to the mat for the nomination,'' Clinton said at a White House news conference. </P>
<P> ``Dr. Foster is a good man with a good record, as a family doctor, as someone who has helped thousands of mothers to give birth to their children and as an academic and as someone who has supported policies that are pro-family and pro-child. He is qualified; he should be confirmed; he should not be caught up in any kind of politics, presidential or otherwise.'' </P>
<P> Clinton was responding to a threat by Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole to block a Senate vote on Foster, who is opposed by many conservatives because of conflicting statements he made about the number of abortions he performed. </P>
<P> ``I'm not certain it (the nomination) will get out of the committee. If it does, I'm not certain I'll call it up (for a full Senate vote),'' Dole, the front-runner for the 1996 Republican presidential nomination, said Sunday on NBC-TV's ''Meet the Press.'' </P>
<P> The Senate Labor Committee is scheduled to begin Foster's confirmation hearing May 2. </P>
<P> Dole said Foster's problem was his credibility, not his support of abortion rights. </P>
<P> Dole repeated that position in a statement Tuesday and said a decision to keep the nomination off the Senate floor would not be unprecendented. </P>
<P> ``The majority party sets the agenda in the Senate, and I'm reminded of nominations made by Republican presidents that were not acted on by the Democrats who then controlled the Senate,'' Dole, a Kansas Republican, said. </P>
<P> Groups backing Foster accused Dole of trying to appease his party's right wing by blocking a vote on the nominee. </P>
<P> ``Sen. Dole has chosen to pander to the right wing of his party and stiff the democratic process by denying Dr. Foster a fair hearing,'' Ann Lewis, vice president of Planned Parenthood Federation, said at a news conference. </P>
<P> Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, added: ``This nomination is about the politics of reproductive choice and appeasing the radical right.'' </P>
<P> Leslie Harris, public policy director of People for the American Way Action Fund, said Dole was abusing his power by refusing to allow a Senate debate on Foster. </P>
<P> The three women spoke in front of a banner that said: ''Pro-Choice America supports Dr. Henry Foster.'' </P>
<P> Foster has said one of his chief goals if he is confirmed as the nation's top medical official will be to reduce the high U.S. teen-age pregnancy rate. </P>
<P> Foster, a 61-year-old black doctor from Tennessee, was nominated by Clinton in March to replace Joycelyn Elders, who was forced to resign late last year after controversial remarks about masturbation. </P>
