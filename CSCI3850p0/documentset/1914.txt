<P>  Following are comments from Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, Monday morning on moving troops away from the Kuwaiti border. He answered reporters' questions after he saw the president of the Security Council, Sir David Hannay of Britain: </P>
<P> HAMDOON: I did talk with Sir David Hannay this morning and told him the Iraqi government has decided to move its troops from the Basra area to another area, and therefore to relocate them. Also we reserve the right to move them anytime in the future to wherever we want within the Iraqi territory. But given the concerns we have seen within the Security Council, we have taken that move. </P>
<P> QUESTION: Out of range of the Kuwaiti border? </P>
<P> Q: How many troops? </P>
<P> HAMDOON: I am not aware but all the troops that were maneuvering lately have been relocated. </P>
<P> Q: What was the purpose of the maneuvers?. </P>
<P> HAMDOON: It is the right of any government to maneuver its troops and to conduct demonstrations from time to time within its own territory. </P>
<P> Q: Does this end the crisis? </P>
<P> HAMDOON: We hope it ends the crisis if there was any. But again what we want is to get attention focused on the lifting of the sanctions which have been biting on the Iraqi people for quite some time. </P>
<P> Q. Some say there is less chance now? </P>
<P> HAMDOON: I don't think that that really relieves the council from its commitment towards it own resolution and therefore to look into the implementation of paragraph 22 of its own resolution 687. (EDS: Refers to provision in 1991 Security Council resolution linking the lifting of the oil embargo to compliance on weapons demands). </P>
<P> Q. Is Iraq ready to recognize Kuwait? </P>
<P> HAMDOON: That issue needs to be dealt with according to the whole context of the United Nations resolutions and therefore in the context of 687 which includes the lifting of the sanctions on Iraq. </P>
<P> Q. When are you moving the troops? </P>
<P> HAMDOON: The instructions have already been issued and the troops are already on the move. </P>
<P> Q. Does it mean all the troops? </P>
<P> HAMDOON: We have said that we have decided to move those troops that were maneuvering in that area to another area to the north. </P>
<P> Q. Did the United States overact? </P>
<P> ANSWER: I don't have to involve myself in these matters. </P>
