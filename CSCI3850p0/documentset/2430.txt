<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Barathea, a 10-1 longshot who has been running in England and France, stalked the pace then broke clear in the stretch to win the $1 million Breeders' Cup Mile Saturday at Churchill Downs. </P>
<P> The Irish-bred 4-year-old provided another jewel in the increasingly crowded crown of co-owner Sheikh Mohammed of Dubai, whose horse Carnegie won the Arc de Triomphe in Paris last month and has also won three other Breeders' Cup titles. </P>
<P> Barathea's victory denied the American champion Lure an unprecedented third successive Mile victory. Lure, who went off at 4-5, bid for the lead at the top of the stretch but faded as Barathea pulled away. </P>
<P> Barathea was ridden by top European jockey Frankie Dettori and trained by Luca Cumani. The horse finished fifth in last year's Breeders' Cup Mile and had been training on a specially designed track in Newmarket, England, that duplicated conditions at Churchill Downs. </P>
<P> The race was the first over the turf in the seven-race, $10 million Breeders' Cup series, the richest set of races in the world. It was telecast to 16 countries around the globe. </P>
<P> The opening race, the $1 million Sprint, was won by Cherokee Run, the 5-2 favorite, who made a strong move from the middle of the track to outrun Soviet Problem. The English sprinter, Lochsong, who went off as the 6-1 third choice faded badly to finish last. </P>
<P> Flanders, ridden by Pat Day as the heavy 2-5 favorite, won the $1 million Juvenile Fillies after a thrilling stretch duel with stablemate Serena's Song. Flanders suffered two fractures in her right front leg that will require surgery, but a veterinarian said the horse might run again. </P>
<P> Both horses are trained by D. Wayne Lukas, the all-time leading Cup trainer who broke an 0-for-20 streak for his first Cup win since 1989 and his 11th overall. </P>
<P> The 45-1 longshot One Dreamer, ridden by Gary Stevens, won the $1 million Distaff with a wire-to-wire run that was too much for Hollywood Wildcat, last year's winner, and Sky Beauty, who had not lost a race this year. </P>
<P> In the Mile, Baratha's jockey said the horse got a perfect trip around the course. </P>
<P> ``Everything went like a story,'' Dettori said. ``He broke well, got in fourth on the rail, settled beautifully. I had two dead horses in front of me, so I eased him three wide. When I asked him to quicken he delivered straight away.'' </P>
<P> The time of 1:34 2/5 seconds broke the track record for the mile on turf. </P>
<P> In the Sprint, Soviet Problem, the California champion who had won seven races in a row, had the lead inside the final furlong and nearly held off the hard-charging Cherokee Run. But the New York horse was not to be denied and eased past to win a photo finish by a head. </P>
<P> Cherokee Run, ridden by Mike Smith and trained by Frank Alexander, ran the race in a time of 1:09 2/5 seconds on a fast track. Smith's victory was his 62nd stakes win of the year, a new American record. </P>
<P> Lochsong, the European Horse of the year, was off slowly then rushed up to stalk the lead down the backstretch but lost ground on the turn, fading to sixth and bore out while tiring badly through the stretch to finish last. </P>
