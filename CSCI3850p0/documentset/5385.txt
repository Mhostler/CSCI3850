<P>  Virgil Hill of the United States retained his World Boxing Association light heavyweight championship Saturday night, taking a 12-round unanimous decision over Crawford Ashley of England. </P>
<P> In a second world title fight on the card at a hotel-casino on the Nevada-California border, undefeated Ricardo Lopez of Mexico successfully defended his World Boxing Council strawweight championship for the 14th time by stopping Andy Tabanas of The Philippines at 2:45 of the 12th and final round. </P>
<P> Hill, now 18-1 in light heavyweight title fights since winning his first 175-pound championship in 1987, built up an early lead thanks to a stiff and accurate left jab to the head, winning the initial six rounds on all three judges' scorecards. </P>
<P> Hill finished strong, too, capturing three of the final four rounds on all judges' cards. </P>
<P> But Hill, who won by scores of 118-110, 118-110 and 117-113, had trouble in the eighth round, when Ashley, ranked No. 10 by the WBA, hurt him with four rights and a left to the head. Hill survived the round, and a tiring Ashley could not duplicate that offensive performance during the final four rounds. </P>
<P> Hill almost stopped Ashley in the 12th. Only the bell saved Ashley, who was getting pounded with rights to the head. </P>
<P> ``I started off slow,'' said Ashley. ``I fought my heart out. I felt I fought a pretty good fight and that the outcome would be different.'' </P>
<P> Hill said that he believes he may have fractured his left hand during the bout. ``Every time I jabbed with it, sharp pains were going up my arm,'' he said. </P>
<P> The 31-year-old Hill now has a record of 40-1 with 20 wins ending early. Ashley, 30, is 20-7-1 with 19 inside the distance. </P>
<P> The 27-year-old Lopez, now 40-0 with 30 bouts ending early, finished an outclassed Tabanas with a barrage of blows to the head which prompted referee Mitch Halpern to halt the one-sided fight. </P>
<P> Tabanas, the WBC's No. 2 contender, rushed in during the first round and was jarred with a right to the head. After that Tabanas stayed outside and seldom mounted an attack. </P>
<P> ``I wanted to fight Lopez in tight, but I couldn't get close to him,'' said the 25-year-old Tabanas, who now has a record of 30-3 with 19 bouts ending early. </P>
<P> Lopez was constant and accurate with his left jabs and combination rights to the head and body all 12 rounds. Lopez finally caught up with Tabanas in the 12th rounds, cutting him in the corner of the left eye and then battering him until the bout was stopped. </P>
<P> In his 15 strawweight world title fights Lopez has won 105 of the 111 rounds. </P>
