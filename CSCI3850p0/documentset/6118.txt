<P>  Federal authorities now believe four or five people, including a father and son, were involved in the Oklahoma City blast that killed more than 100 people, the Los Angeles Times reported Friday. </P>
<P> The paper, citing a source familiar with the inquiry, said authorities were investigating a father-son team in the Midwest over explosives that may have been supplied to the bombers. </P>
<P> According to the Times' source, the father operates a military-supply store in the small town of Antigo in north-central Wisconsin and the son is believed to live in Chicago. </P>
<P> The FBI is also investigating whether those responsible for the blast financed their activities with the proceeds from a bank-robbing spree across the Midwest, the Times said. </P>
<P> In 13 unsolved bank robberies in Nebraska, Iowa, Ohio, Missouri and Kansas, the robbers sometimes left pipe bombs at the scene. </P>
<P> Timothy McVeigh, the only person to be charged so far in the Oklahoma City bombing, was ordered held without bail Thursday by a U.S. Magistrate who said there was an ``indelible trail of evidence'' linking him to the deadly blast. </P>
<P> According to the Los Angeles Times, McVeigh was closely associated with a man in Kingman, Ariz., who fits the description of a second suspect known as ``John Doe No. 2.'' </P>
<P> Kingman was the last place McVeigh is known to have lived, and sources told the paper his friend left the Kingman area hurriedly last Friday. </P>
<P> The Times' sources said the man was on the FBI's list of people under consideration as John Doe No. 2, but was not at the top of the list. </P>
