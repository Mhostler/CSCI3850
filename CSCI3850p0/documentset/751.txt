<P>  The Palestinian Authority will send a team to Amman to discuss ties strained by the recent warming of relations between Israel and Jordan, a senior official said Saturday. </P>
<P> A Palestinian source said the visit could be followed by a meeting between PLO leader Yasser Arafat and Jordan's King Hussein. </P>
<P> ``The Palestinian Authority has decided to send a high level delegation to Jordan...to discuss with Jordanian officials bilateral relations and detailed discussions on issues in all spheres including tourism, education, health and communication,'' said general secretary, Tayeb Abdel-Rahim. </P>
<P> Another member of the Palestinian Authority, Nabil Shaath, said the delegation would travel to Amman later this week. </P>
<P> Recent agreements reached between Israel and Jordan have caused tension between Jordan and the Palestinians. Last month, Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat ordered the closure of two pro-Jordanian newspapers published in the territories. </P>
<P> Palestinians were outraged when Israel recognized Jordan's role in guardianship of Islamic holy sites in Jerusalem in the declaration it signed with the kingdom on July 25 ending the 46-year state of war between the two states. </P>
<P> Palestinians see Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state. </P>
<P> Shaath said another delegation would travel to Cairo, headquarters of the Arab League, where it would ask Arab states to honor new Palestinian passports and other officials documents. </P>
