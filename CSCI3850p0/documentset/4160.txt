<P>  Mediator William Usery believes it is unlikely baseball owners and players will reach agreement to settle a six-month-old strike by President Clinton's Monday afternoon deadline, a spokesman said. </P>

Conn said Usery will make his recommendations on ending the strike to Clinton at the White House at about 5 p.m. EST, the president's deadline for an accord, and will make a statement later. </P>
