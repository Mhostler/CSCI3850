<DATELINE>BONN, Germany (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Hundreds of young rioters throwing paving stones and fireworks clashed with police in the north German city of Bremen and the eastern town of Rathenow in the early hours of New Year's Day, police said. </P>
<P> In the eastern town of Wernigerode, rampaging right-wingers injured three policemen, one seriously, by attacking their car with baseball bats and fireworks. </P>
<P> Police held three of the rioters and said some were linked to the extreme right-wing Free German Workers' Party (FAP). </P>
<P> In Rathenow, west of Berlin, some 650 youths hurled fireworks and bottles at police and smashed shop windows and traffic lights. Twelve people were detained. In Finsterwalde, also in eastern Germany, some 200 youths went on the rampage. </P>
<P> In Bremen, anarchists who have rioted during previous New Year celebrations and disrupted Unity Day festivities in October fought police, smashing windows and barricading streets with cars and portable toilet huts. </P>
<P> Six police were slightly injured and eight rioters were detained. </P>
<P> In Berlin, authorities reported an unusually peaceful New Year disrupted only by some 40 youths throwing fireworks at police. </P>
<P> The capital's fire brigade nevertheless had to deal with 1,800 alarm calls in the space of 30 hours, most of them because of fireworks accidents. </P>
<P> There was no trouble at the Brandenburg Gate -- symbol of the city's former east-west division -- where around 20,000 revelers gathered to see in the New Year. </P>
