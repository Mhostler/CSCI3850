<P>  Nigeria said allegations by the leader of an African American group that it was responsible for 80 percent of hard drugs smuggled into the United States were spurious, national newspapers reported on Saturday. </P>
<P> ``How can a nation that has been cut off from all direct air and sea links with the United States and has no common borders with the country, by some miracle, be responsible for 80 percent of hard drugs consumed in the U.S.?'' the Daily Times paper quoted Information Minister Walter Ofonagoro as saying at a news conference in the capital Abuja on Friday. </P>
<P> He was responding to an interview on Cable Network News (CNN) on Thursday by Randall Robinson, the leader of the African American lobby group TransAfrica that President Bill Clinton should impose an embargo on U.S. buying of Nigerian crude oil. </P>
<P> TransAfrica, which groups top black American politicians, actors and writers, last month launched a campaign against military-ruled Nigeria to force a quick return to democracy. </P>
<P> Ofonagoro alleged that the group was being paid to campaign against Nigeria, adding that ``we know who is paying them.'' </P>
<P> He said he would demand equal air time from CNN to reply to Robinson's allegations which Nigeria's press fully reported. </P>
<P> In the interview, Robinson said Washington was reviewing its policy on General Sani Abacha's government having understood that diplomatic discussions had outlived their usefulness. </P>
<P> Western diplomats in Lagos, however, said it was unlikely U.S. government would impose an oil embargo because of its likely effect on American oil firms operating in Nigeria, a leading Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries' member. </P>
<P> ``The U.S. government is aware that such a move could hurt American companies like Chevron and Mobil,'' a diplomat said. </P>
<P> ``If as it is likely Nigeria throws out these firms what's to stop other companies taking over their share,'' he added. </P>
<P> Oil sales is the mainstay of Nigeria's economy, accounting for about 90 percent of its foreign exchange earnings and the U.S. is the biggest buyer of Nigerian oil. </P>
<P> Abacha seized power in November 1993 during the crisis triggered by the annulment of an election widely believed to have been won by Moshood Abiola, a wealthy businessman now in detention for proclaiming himself president. </P>
<P> Ofonagoro said Nigerian democracy would be ``home grown'' and not dictated by outsiders. </P>
<P> The government says it is waiting for the report of the constitutional conference, which wound up this week, to announce a timetable for its promised transition to civilian rule. </P>
