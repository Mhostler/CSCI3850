<DATELINE>BONN, May 16 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, under pressure to withdraw troops from disputed U.N.-run zones, had talks on Tuesday with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the man many believe has the most influence over him. </P>
<P> The two men beamed at the cameras and shook hands before they sat down to talk in Kohl's offices in Bonn. </P>
<P> ``Germany can play a positive role,'' Croatian ambassador Ivan Ilic told German radio when asked about the worsening conflict in former Yugoslavia. </P>
<P> Croatia told the United Nations Security Council in New York on Monday that its army would completely withdraw within 24 hours from U.N.-patrolled buffer zones which divide Croatian forces from rebel Serbs in the republic. </P>
<P> Council sources said the deadline was 1500 gmt -- when Tudjman should be on his way home from his one day of meetings with Kohl and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. </P>
<P> A U.N. spokesman said earlier the Croatian army had only partially fulfilled a withdrawal promised for last Sunday. </P>
<P> Croatian troops encroached on the U.N. buffer zones after launching a successful offensive on May 1 against rebel Serbs in Western Slavonia, east of Zagreb. </P>
<P> The Serbs, however, still control vast chunks of the former Yugoslav republic which they seized in 1991 in a rebellion against Croatian independence. </P>
<P> U.N. peacekeepers have separated the sides since then but Croatia's patience has worn thin as talks on restoring its authority have faltered. </P>
<P> Germany is Croatia's strongest ally in the west, giving Kohl powerful influence over Tudjman in return for Bonn's economic and diplomatic support, political observers say. </P>
<P> Tudjman said before he left Zagreb he expected the visit to improve on already very good relations with Germany. </P>
<P> ``Not only the Germans but also the world public has accepted as normal the news of the liberation of Croatian occupied territories,'' he told Croatian radio. </P>
