<P>  A strike by some 30 NATO warplanes against the rebel Serb Udbina base in occupied Croatia was intended to prevent further use of the military airfield, United Nations special envoy for ex-Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi said Monday. </P>
<P> ``The air action today was a necessary and proportionate response to the continued use of this airfield for hostile air attacks against the Bihac pocket of Bosnia-Herzegovina,'' Akashi said in a statement which made clear he first gave authorization for a strike Sunday. </P>
