<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, Germany (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Six U.S. Air Force planes with humanitarian supplies and at least 40 military personnel leave Germany Saturday to join an international relief operation for Rwandan refugees, a spokesman said. </P>
<P> The soldiers will use Entebbe airport in Uganda as the hub of U.S. aid flights into Goma, Zaire, where more than a million Rwandans have sought shelter from civil war, Sergeant-Major Dale Warman of Rhein-Main air base in Frankfurt said. </P>
<P> He said a C-141 transport with fork-lift trucks, military personnel and humanitarian supplies was leaving for Goma later in the night. </P>
<P> Five other flights were due to leave for Entebbe, including four C-141s already in Frankfurt and one G-5 Galaxy which was en route from the United States and scheduled to refuel in Germany before flying on. </P>
<P> One of the C-141s heading for Uganda had 40 air force personnel on board. </P>
<P> ``They will operate the airport, help unload planes, refuel planes, take care of maintenance and set up satellite communications,'' Warman told Reuters. </P>
<P> The Galaxy, which took off from Maguire Air Force Base in New Jersey, was also carrying an unspecified number of soldiers whose duty was to help run Entebbe airport as a hub for aid flights into Goma. </P>
<P> The U.S. operation is being coordinated by the European Command in Stuttgart. </P>
<P> President Clinton and foreign policy advisers reviewed the Rwandan crisis Friday and a White House official said the U.S. military was ``cranking up in a big way.'' </P>
<P> A 25-strong U.S. army reconnaissance team flew into Goma Saturday charged with identifying how best to deal with the needs of the Rwandan refugees there who had fled the war only to be confronted with cholera. </P>
<P> The aircraft fying from Frankfurt were carrying forklift trucks, rehydration salts, water, basic military equipment and other humanitarian supplies, Warman said. </P>
<P> U.S. officials have said 1,000 troops could be involved in the operation. </P>
