<P>  A live British morning television show came to an abrupt end Friday after a noisy audience protest about racism when a black male model appeared in a designer skirt during a discussion on men's fashion. </P>
<P> John Stapleton, presenter of Anglia Television's ``The Time ... The Place'' for the Independent Television network (ITV), said two black men in the audience complained that it was racist to make a black man wear the skirt. </P>
<P> ``I thanked them for their contribution, but they refused to shut up and effectively ruined the program for three million viewers, because quite properly the powers-that-be decided to pull it off the air,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``It got threatening, very threatening, and they had to be escorted from the premises in the end,'' he added. </P>
<P> The 30-minute program had six minutes to run when it was halted. </P>
