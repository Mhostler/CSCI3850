<DATELINE>DALLAS, (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A Texas truck driver, sticking his tongue out and taunting police, led officers on a slow-speed, two-hour chase early Saturday, police said in a published report. </P>
<P> The 20-year-old Grand Prairie man, whose name was not immediately released, was being held in a Grand Prairie jail on two charges of aggravated assault on a police officer after two squad cars were rammed in the event, The Dallas Morning News said in Sunday editions. </P>
<P> He also faces one misdemeanor count each of fleeing and criminal mischief, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> The bizarre chase began at about 5:40 a.m. local time in Grand Prairie, a suburb of Dallas, when two Arlington police officers spotted a red 1985 Toyota pickup truck driving erratically. The driver refused to stop, took officers on a 100-mile chase through downtown Dallas, Arlington, Irving and Grand Prairie. </P>
<P> ``He was having a good time,'' Grand Prairie officer Steve Courson told the newspaper. ``He was sticking out his tongue and taunting the officers. And it turned out he was not drunk.'' </P>
<P> The driver never exceeded the speed limit during the chase, police said. But he did ram a squad car that tried to corner him in a Grand Prairie gas station parking lot. </P>
<P> It all came to an end when an Irving police police car hit the driver from behind and forced him over a fire hydrant. </P>
