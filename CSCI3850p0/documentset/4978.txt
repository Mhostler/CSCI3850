<P>  The FBI says that ``approximately 91'' fugitives from U.S. justice are known or suspected to be in Cuba and it is trying to get some of them extradited. </P>
<P> In a letter to members of Congress, FBI Director Louis Freeh said the fugitives were wanted for crimes including aircraft hijacking, bank robbery, murder and fraud. </P>
<P> The letter was released by the office of Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., who had earlier written to Freeh asking for information about U.S. fugitives in Cuba and efforts to get them returned. </P>
<P> Diaz-Balart said the fugitives included indicted financier Robert Vesco, arms dealer Frank Terpil, ``Black Liberation Army'' leader Joanne Chesimard and members of the Colombian cocaine cartels. </P>
<P> Freeh, who did not identify any fugitives, said in his letter: ``While I am not in a position to speak for other government agencies, I can tell you that there are approximately 91 substantive and Unlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution fugitives known or suspected to be in Cuba.'' </P>
<P> He said that because of the state of U.S.-Cuban relations attempts to extradite U.S. fugitives had met with little success, the FBI had sought to initiate a dialogue with Cuba through the State Department in 1993 to seek extradition. </P>
<P> ``Efforts are ongoing between the FBI, the Department of Justice and the Department of State to open better communication channels between our governments and to develop a process for the extradition of these fugitives from Cuba to the United States,'' Freeh said. </P>
<P> ``We are currently pursuing efforts with the Cuban desk, Department of State, for the extradition or rendition of several FBI fugitives,'' he said. </P>
<P> A spokeswoman said Diaz-Balart planned to write again to Freeh seeking identification of the fugitives. </P>
