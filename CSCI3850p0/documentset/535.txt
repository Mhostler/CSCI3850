<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Elvis Presley's daughter, Lisa Marie, said in a statement Monday she married pop superstar Michael Jackson in a secret ceremony outside the United States 11 weeks ago. </P>
<P> The statement was issued by Jackson's production company, MJJ Productions. The company's vice president, Bob Jones, faxed the statement to news organizations, including Reuters. </P>
<P> In the statement, Lisa Marie, the only child of the late ''King'' of rock n' roll, said, ``My married name is Mrs Lisa Marie Presley-Jackson. My marriage to Michael Jackson took place in a private ceremony outside the United States 11 weeks ago. </P>
<P> ``It was not formally announced until now for several reasons; foremost being that we are both very private people living in the glare of the public media. We both wanted a private marriage ceremony without the distraction of a media circus. </P>
<P> ``I am very much in love with Michael, I dedicate my life to being his wife. I understand and support him, we both look forward to raising a family and living happy, health (sic) life together. </P>
<P> ``We hope our friends and fans will understand and respect our privacy.'' </P>
<P> Jones said Lisa Marie issued her statement from New York. </P>
<P> Lisa Marie's assets from her father's will is estimated to be $150 million, while her new husband is believed to be worth in excess of $250 million. </P>
<P> Jackson's publicist, Lee Solters, who had earlier, adamantly denied that the couple were married, declined to comment Monday. </P>
<P> The couple had their first date February 2 when they went to Las Vegas together to watch a show by the 60's groups The Temptations and The Fifth Dimension, according to news reports. </P>
<P> At the time Lisa Marie was estranged from her husband, musician Danny Keough, with whom she has two children. The couple reportedly got a ``quickie'' divorce in Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic May 6. </P>
<P> Solters' denial came in mid-July, after a judge in the Dominican Republic said he married the couple on May 25. </P>
<P> Judge Hugo Alvarez Perez said the couple signed affidavits stating that they were single and free to marry. </P>
<P> Alvarez Perez, a Civil Court judge in La Vega, northwest of Santo Domingo, produced a copy of the sworn statement signed by Jackson and Presley. </P>
<P> Dominican immigration officials confirmed July 14 that both were in the country together during the time when Alvarez Perez said he married them. </P>
<P> The Dominican Republic's General Immigration Administration said Jackson arrived by private jet May 24. </P>
<P> The immigration office said Jackson, Presley, their attorney, two witnesses and two bodyguards, as well as one child, stayed at the Casa de Campo hotel complex until May 26, one day after the marriage date provided by the judge. </P>
<P> There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy of the date provided by the judge for the wedding -- May 25, which is nearly 10 weeks ago -- and Lisa Marie's statement saying the marriage took place 11 weeks ago. </P>
<P> Sources at the tourist resort northwest of Santo Domingo confirmed Jackson was a guest in May. </P>
<P> Alvarez Perez offered to travel to the United States to prove that he did in fact officiate at the ceremony. ``It is a horrible lie to say now that there was no wedding,'' the judge said at the time. </P>
<P> Recently, The New York Post reported that the newlyweds had rented an apartment in the Trump Tower in New York located directly above the apartment owned by real estate magnate Donald Trump. </P>
<P> Over the past year, Jackson has been embroiled in legal troubles. A 13-year-old boy alleged in a civil lawsuit that the entertainer had sexually molested him over a period of four months. Jackson denied the charges but settled the lawsuit out of court in January for a sum reported to be between $5 million and $20 million. </P>
<P> Police have launched an investigation to see if Jackson should be tried on criminal sexual molestation charges. Evidence was presented to two grand juries in Santa Barbara and Los Angeles Counties where the singer maintains homes where the boy alleged the sex acts took place. </P>
<P> No announcement has been made on the grand juries' deliberations. </P>
