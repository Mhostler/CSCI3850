<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The leader of Argentina's large Jewish community said Monday that the man held for allegedly selling the car used in July's bomb attack on a Buenos Aires Jewish center was keeping his mouth shut for fear of his life. </P>
<P> ``I knew he felt safer in jail than out, which has huge connotations because it indicates he must know something more -- like an organization that is capable of taking such reprisals,'' Beraja told Argentine radio. </P>
<P> Telleldin was quoted by Clarin newspaper this weekend as saying: ``If I tell who the car was for, I'm a dead man.'' </P>
<P> He is the only suspect Argentine police have arrested so far for involvement in the bombing, although his associates and members of his family have been questioned. </P>
<P> Newspaper reports describe Telleldin as a former policeman of Middle Eastern ancestry who had businesses including second-hand car sales. He was employed at a sauna on the same street as the Jewish community center, which was razed in the July bombing. </P>
<P> Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres will seek a progress report on investigations into the July bombing as well as another attack against the Israeli embassy here in March 1992. </P>
<P> Peres is to visit the country Friday, Israeli Ambassador Yitzhak Aviran said Monday. </P>
<P> ``The responsibility for the investigation belongs to the Argentine government, but I believe the foreign minister wants to know what is happening,'' he told reporters. ``Israel is very worried the culprits still haven't been found.'' </P>
<P> The envoy said he agreed with the judge investigating the bombings, Juan Jose Galeano, that there is a risk of further such attacks. </P>
<P> ``If you take into account that there were two attacks which have not been solved, and they had local support, the analysis is very simple: if there is no progress, why not do it a third time,'' he said. </P>
<P> This weekend police discovered a cache of explosives at a country club near Buenos Aires which Beraja had been due to visit. Beraja said he would await the outcome of investigations before confirming whether he had been the target of an attempted attack. </P>
