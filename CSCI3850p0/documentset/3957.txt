<P>  French biologists reported Wednesday they had discovered a carnivorous sponge that uses long tendrils to trap and digest tiny crustaceans. </P>
<P> The report intrigued marine biologists, who believed sponges were inoffensive creatures that survived on whatever tiny plant particles drifted down to the sea floor. </P>
<P> In a report in the science journal Nature, Jean Vacelet and colleagues at the University of Aix in Marseille said they had discovered the new sponge in shallow caves in the Mediterranean. </P>
<P> The sponge, of the Abestopluma genus, lacked the tubes and tunnels that sponges use to filter water and which have made them prized by people for such tasks as cleaning and painting. </P>
<P> Instead, this sponge used hooked tendrils to drag down prey. </P>
<P> ``Once captive, the crustaceans were unable to free themselves. They remained struggling for several hours, which indicates that there was no paralyzing or toxic secretion,'' Vacelet wrote. </P>
<P> ``New, thin filaments grew over the prey, which was completely enveloped after one day and digested within a few days.'' </P>
<P> They said it was not yet clear how the sponge absorbed its food once it was digested. But the discovery of such an extreme variation in one of the world's oldest and simplest life forms generated immediate comment. </P>
<P> Michelle Kelly-Borges, a zoologist at London's Natural History Museum, wrote in an accompanying article that the sponge had perhaps migrated from the deepest oceans, where life has evolved into bizarre forms due to a lack of sunlight. </P>
<P> ``The paper by Vacelet...reaffirms a basic message for biologists in general -- it seems that whenever sponges need to do something, they are able to do it,'' she wrote. </P>
