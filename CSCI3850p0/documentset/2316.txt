<P>  Cuba's economy, plunged into crisis by the collapse of its old trade and aid ally the former Soviet Union, is not yet recovering but it is showing some positive signs, a senior official said Sunday. </P>
<P> Carlos Lage, vice president and a key figure in Cuba's current reform process, told a news conference in answer to a question that ``we cannot talk of a moment of recovery.'' </P>
<P> But Lage, speaking shortly after the opening of Havana's annual trade fair, added that ``in the course of this year there are some positive signs.'' </P>
<P> He cited continuing poor results in the sugar cane industry, the country's main export, as a key factor in slowing progress toward overall improvement. </P>
<P> But positive signs included growing foreign investment on the island, an improvement in the country's internal finances and the recuperation of some economic sectors, Lage said. </P>
<P> The nickel mining industry was one example of an industry affected badly by the collapse of the Soviet Union and now showing a trend toward recovery, he added. </P>
<P> Lage said current economic reforms, which gathered pace from around mid-1993, were not aimed at creating a capitalist economy, but a planned economy with market elements. </P>
<P> ``We do not have a strategy of a capitalist development,'' Lage said. ``It's a strategy within the socialist system.'' </P>
<P> Reforms that introduced market mechanisms to some areas of the economy ``do not mean abandoning a planned economy'', Lage added and stressed Cuba intended to preserve what it terms gains of the 1959 revolution such as free health care and education. </P>
<P> The country's oil-importing, sugar-exporting economy was hit across the board by the collapse of the Soviet Union. Cuba is making do with annual imports of a quarter of what they were in the late 1980s. </P>
<P> Reform measures over the last 14 months have included pushing for more foreign investment, depenalizing use of hard currency such as the dollar, allowing some self-employment and cooperativizing a large part of the state farm sector. </P>
<P> In recent months Cuba has hiked the prices of some heavily subisidized goods and services, introduced taxes and partially lifted the state monopoly on farm produce sales, opening food markets with deregulated prices. </P>
<P> Last week it announced that similar shops and markets will open soon with deregulated prices for consumer goods. </P>
