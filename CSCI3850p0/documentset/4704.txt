<P>  Thousands of social activists began a 10-day meeting at a former Danish navy base Friday to promote social development as the foundation for global security now that the Cold War threat of nuclear conflict has abated. </P>
<P> The NGO Forum, bringing together 3,000 non-governmental organizations (NGO)s, is billed as an ``alternative summit'' to a United Nations World Summit for Social Development that takes place between March 6-12 in another part of Copenhagen. </P>
<P> Cuban President Fidel Castro and Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) leader Yasser Arafat are widely expected to visit the former navy base. </P>
<P> ``The NGOs are the conscience and the watchdogs of the main summit,'' Chile's U.N. ambassador, Juan Somavia, told Reuters. </P>
<P> The U.N. summit, bringing together 130 heads of state and government, is the brainchild of Somavia, who says the threat of the nuclear bomb has been replaced by a very different security hazard -- a social time bomb bred by poverty and unemployment. </P>
<P> ``It is the biggest gathering of world leaders and civil organizations in world history,'' said Somavia, who believes the summit will put the spotlight on growing poverty, unemployment and social inequities and galvanize governments into action. </P>
<P> As world leaders meet in a modern conference center near Copenhagen airport, NGO representatives will debate, sing and dance in 150,000 square feet of converted warehouses and barracks at 300-year-old Holmen navy base on the Danish capital's waterfront. </P>
<P> Among those gathering in Copenhagen are delegates from foreign aid agencies, trade unions, churches, ecologists and special interest groups such as Brazilian gays and Sudanese Women for Sexual Equality. </P>
