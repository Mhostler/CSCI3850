<P>  Foreign Minister Shimon Peres will meet Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan in Amman Sunday for talks on a joint proposal for German aid for a dam project, an Israeli foreign ministry spokesman said. </P>
<P> The plan to build dams on the Jordan and Yarmuk rivers is part of an effort to increase Jordanian water resources, a key element in Jordan's decision to sign a peace treaty with Israel last October to end a 46-year formal state of war. </P>
<P> ``Mr. Peres is to present the proposal on financing the water project to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn Wednesday,'' the spokesman said. </P>
<P> He declined to comment on a report in the English-language Jerusalem Post that Germany was interested in the proposal, but would require a ``gentlemen's agreement'' from Syria and the PLO not to interfere, since both have direct or indirect claims to Jordan River water. </P>
<P> The Peres visit coincides with a flurry of Arab-Israeli peace moves surrounding U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's Middle East diplomatic shuttle. </P>
<P> Immediately after meeting Christopher Thursday night Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin flew to Jordan's Red Sea resort of Aqaba for a surprise meeting with King Hussein. </P>
