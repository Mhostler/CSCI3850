<P>  German cosmetics group Lancaster said Wednesday that actress Isabella Rossellini had been appointed vice-president of international marketing at its New York headquarters. </P>
<P> In a statement released in Paris, Lancaster said that Rossellini, the daughter of late film star Ingrid Bergman and director Roberto Rossellini, would work on developing new products. </P>
<P> ``The contribution I think I can bring to Lancaster is, of course, everything I know from my experience with cosmetics as well as a touch of glamor and gaiety,'' Rossellini told reporters in Paris. </P>
<P> Lancaster is a subsidiary of the German detergents and cosmetics firm Benckiser whose brands include Davidoff, Jil Sander, Bogner and Monteil Paris. </P>
<P> As a model, Rossellini, 42, has been the public face of the French cosmetics company Lancome across the globe for the past 14 years. </P>
<P> But last week, Lancome ended months of speculation by announcing it would terminate its exclusive modelling contract with Rossellini at the end of 1995. </P>
