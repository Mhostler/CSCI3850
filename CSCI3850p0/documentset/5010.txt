<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The all-women America3 (cubed) team let a man on board, in the key role of tactician, but the desperate move paid no dividends, just one more loss as the America's Cup defender and challenger semifinals opened Saturday. </P>
<P> Bill Koch's America3 syndicate put David Dellenbaugh, who was starting helmsman on Koch's Cup-winning boat in 1992, in place of JJ Isler, but Kevin Mahaney's Young America defeated America3 by 32 seconds anyway. </P>
<P> The use of Dellenbaugh, after all the proud talk that women could do anything that male sailors could, was suggestive of panic and disharmony in the America3 camp. </P>
<P> The women's team has lost 16 of its 21 races in the trials to date and a hoped-for upturn in performance with the arrival of its new, indisputably fast boat in the previous round never materialized. </P>
<P> On the challenger course, One Australia, still reeling from the dramatic sinking of its frontline boat in the previous round, recovered from a mast problem before the start of its race against Nippon to win by two minutes and 39 seconds. </P>
<P> Team New Zealand, which has elected to sail its older boat NZL 32 for the first time in the series, continued its stablemate's winning form from the early rounds to beat Tag Heuer Challenge by two minutes and 15 seconds. </P>
<P> Team New Zealand and One Australia ended the first day of the challenger semifinals with a point apiece at the top of the table. </P>
<P> Young America -- which carried two points forward as top defender at the end of round four -- closed day one of the defender semis with three points. Dennis Conner's idle Stars & Stripes followed with one point while America3 had none. </P>
<P> America3's adopted graphic of the World War II homefront heroine Rosie the Riveter and motto ``We Can Do It'' have been reduced to humility overnight. </P>
<P> The team must now find itself in a no-win situation: it will be difficult to attribute any improvement in performance to anyone but Dellenbaugh, but if there is no improvement the appeal of an all-women effort has been sacrificed without getting anything in return. </P>
<P> Though the team was lacking in tactical experience and the ability to get the boat up to speed and maintain it, the women had proved that they could get the boat around the course, that strength wasn't an issue and that they were on a learning curve. </P>
<P> Considering the relatively slight experience the team and afterguard have had in America's Cup-style racing -- when compared to the depth on both the rival defender and challenger boats -- their performance to date has been reasonable. </P>
<P> In a close start in its race on Saturday Young America narrowly led America3 off the line. Dellenbaugh then did a great job of taking the women to the left where they gained with the favourable wind to lead up the first beat. </P>
<P> America3's move to the right then enabled Young America through to the left, and a couple of tacks later Young America crossed ahead. It then controlled the race from the front, pulling out a lead of over a minute and a half at one point to cross the finish 32 seconds ahead. </P>
<P> Damage and light winds caused a faltered start on the challenger course. The first match between Tag Heuer and Team New Zealand was stopped when neither boat reached the first buoy within the 55 minute time limit. </P>
<P> The One Australia and Nippon match was delayed when One Australia requested a postponement to carry out repairs to a damaged mast, which had incurred sail track problems. </P>
<P> When the races eventually kicked off, One Australia's performance confirmed it was going to be a serious contender for a finalist slot despite sailing its older boat after the sinking of its newest one. </P>
<P> After a slow start it gained momentum, crossing the course several times in search of the good breeze, to lead Nippon around the first buoy by one minute and 18 seconds. </P>
<P> This extended to two minutes and 46 seconds at the second buoy and the race was in the bag for the Australians, who went on to win by two minutes and 39 seconds. </P>
<P> Team New Zealand proved just as competitive in its older boat NZL 32 as it was in its new boat, NZL 38, which went unbeaten in the four rounds up to the semifinal. </P>
<P> Narrower than its successor with the mast placed slightly more aft, NZL 32 incorporates knowledge that the syndicate has acquired since the elimination trials began in January. </P>
<P> Leading off the start, Team New Zealand gained on every leg, proving faster over the course than Tag Heuer Challenge, which was racing with new sails, to win by a comfortable two minutes and 15 seconds. </P>
<P> Racing continues on Sunday. One Australia will race Tag Heuer Challenge, Team New Zealand will race Nippon and Young America will race Stars & Stripes. </P>
