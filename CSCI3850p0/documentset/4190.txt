<P>  Marxist guerrillas tortured and shot dead five young hikers in an Andean mountain park after apparently mistaking them for military intelligence scouts because they had short haircuts, relatives and friends of the victims said Tuesday. </P>
<P> Police said rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) attacked the group as they were returning from a hike in the spectacular snow-covered peaks of the Nevado del Tolima National Park 90 miles west of Bogota. </P>
<P> Soledad Pineda, the sister of one of the victims, said the rebels tortured the hikers before shooting them through the head at point blank range. ``They broke both my brother's shoulders and his legs,'' she said in a radio interview. </P>
<P> Wilson Lopera, a friend of the victims, said he had refused to go on the hiking trip because the area was a known guerrilla stronghold. </P>
<P> ``Brothers, don't make that trip, they'll kill us, it's full of guerrillas there and with those short haircuts of yours they'll confuse you with soldiers,'' he remembered telling his friends. </P>
<P> Jose Maria Russi, priest of the town of Anzoategui where the five men were killed, told El Tiempo newspaper: ``There is no shock (here), people are used to the culture of death, they don't feel fright or fear, this is now normal in the region''. </P>
<P> Colombia is one of the world's most violent countries, with nearly 30,000 homicides recorded last year among its 36 million population. </P>
