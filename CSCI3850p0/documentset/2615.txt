<DATELINE>KATHMANDU, Nepal (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Nepal voted Tuesday in its second general election since protests ended absolute monarchy in 1990, amid anxieties that no clear majority would emerge to guide the picturesque Himalayan kingdom out of poverty. </P>
<P> About 100,000 members of the security forces fanned out across the nation and the 35,000-man army was put on alert. </P>
<P> There were no reports of violence as men and women formed separate queues in sunny Kathmandu, waiting quietly to stamp ballots marked only with symbols that included a tree, the sun, a plow, a drum and a hammer and sickle. </P>
<P> More than 1,250 election observers, including 130 foreigners from 28 countries, were posted in 205 constituencies spread from southern plains to the world's highest peaks, including the tallest, Mount Everest. </P>
<P> The border with India was sealed off to prevent any foreign tampering with the polls, the Election Commission said. </P>
<P> Nepal, squeezed between the world's two most populous nations India and China, is one of the world's 10 poorest countries with an average annual income of $180 a head. Eighty percent of its development spending comes from foreign aid. </P>
<P> The polls were not expected to knock Nepal off the neutral foreign policy course it has long pursued. </P>
<P> In 1991 the centrist Nepali Congress Party won the nation's first free elections in 31 years after King Birendra was forced by pro-democracy protests to relinquish almost all his power. </P>
<P> But factional in-fighting and allegations of corruption plagued the party, forcing Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala to call snap parliamentary polls 18 months ahead of schedule. </P>
<P> At least six people were killed in the run-up to the elections. The Kantipur newspaper reported Tuesday that more than 10 people were injured in weekend clashes. </P>
<P> Authorities banned all vehicles from the streets of the capital except those of diplomats, journalists and election observers. Most shops were shuttered and the sale of alcohol was banned for the day. </P>
<P> As many as 24 parties were in the fray. A total of 12.3 million people were eligible to vote for 1,442 candidates, including independents and 98 women. Indications of the result are not expected to be known before Friday. </P>
<P> In several remote mountain regions, porters will take two to three days to carry ballots to low-lying districts to be counted, an Election Commission spokesman said. </P>
<P> There were no reliable prediction polls to indicate which party might win and choose the next prime minister. </P>
<P> Political observers and diplomats were split over whether the Nepali Congress, which held 114 of 205 seats in the outgoing parliament, would overcome its wrangling to retain a majority. </P>
<P> The communist Unified Marxist-Leninist (UML) front, which had controlled 81 seats, said voters fed up with claims of Congress corruption would give it a majority. </P>
<P> UML's platform closely resembled that of Nepali Congress and UML leader Man Mohan Adhikary vowed to defend multi-party democracy and foreign investment if thrust into power. </P>
