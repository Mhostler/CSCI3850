<P>  Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp. is expected to announce Tuesday it will move its corporate headquarters from Louisville to Nashville, Tenn., sources said. </P>
<P> The sources said a meeting is set for 11 a.m. EST Tuesday between Tennessee government officials and Columbia executives at Nashville City Hall, sources said. </P>
<P> State officials are expected to approve the incentive package, which will affect about 1,000 employees, sources said. </P>
<P> The two health care companies merged in 1993, forming the 12th largest U.S. employer. </P>
<P> Columbia Healthcare Corp., originally based in Nashville, moved its corporate operations to Kentucky after the merger in April 1994. </P>
<P> But Columbia's chief executive officer Richard Scott has been at odds with Kentucky due to a 2 percent tax on hospital providers, which does not exist in Tennessee. </P>
