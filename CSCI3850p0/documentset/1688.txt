<P>  The United States is near a decision on how to process at least 20,000 Cuban immigrants a year, the State Department said Thursday. </P>
<P> Spokeswoman Christine Shelly told reporters that no final decision has been made on how to deal with the influx but that an announcement would be made shortly. </P>
<P> She said a lottery in which Cubans could be allowed in was one of a variety of methods being considered. </P>
<P> The New York Times reported Thursday that the Clinton administration has decided to grant admission by lottery to a quarter of the immigrants, a move that would cut down long lines outside of the U.S. offices in Havana. </P>
<P> The administration has promised President Fidel Castro it would grant entry rights to at least 20,000 Cubans a year, a gesture designed to stem the flood of boatpeople fleeing Cuba. </P>
