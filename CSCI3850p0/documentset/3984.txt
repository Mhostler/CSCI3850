<P>  The second coming of the World League of American Football will be leaner, meaner, and strictly European. </P>
<P> Officials from the National Football League, Fox Sports, and the WLAF unveiled their plans here Thursday for the reincarnation of the league that folded in 1992 after just two seasons. </P>
<P> The reborn WLAF, which kicks off its 10-week schedule April 8, will feature six teams -- all of them European -- and rules changes designed to make the U.S.-based game faster, more continuous, and with more frequent scoring. </P>
<P> ``It will be American Football with a European approach,'' said WLAF President and chief executive officer Marc Lory, a Frenchman who has become an afficionado of the sport. </P>
<P> In its previous life, the WLAF fielded eight teams from the United States, Canada, and Europe. </P>
<P> The three European teams -- Barcelona Dragons, Frankfurt Galaxy, and London Monarchs -- return and will be joined by the Amsterdam Admirals, the Rhein Fire (Dusseldorf), and the Scottish Claymores (Edinburgh). </P>
<P> ``Stage one is a European league with six teams ... geared strictly for the European audience,'' said NFL President Neil Austrian, adding: ``At some point in time, when we step back and evaluate how successful we've been in stage one, then we'll come back and rethink where else we go.'' </P>
<P> To win over the hearts and minds of the European fans, the WLAF will attempt to make American football look more like its main competition -- soccer and rugby. </P>
<P> Former San Francisco 49ers coach Bill Walsh was hired to streamline the game and make it more appealing. Matches will last two-and-a-half hours instead of three and there will be more scoring than in the often defensive-oriented NFL. </P>
<P> ``We need a faster game,'' Walsh said. ``We want to cut down the clock between plays. We want to have a more continuous game with a lot of scoring. </P>
<P> ``It's a challenge to see if we can accomplish this,'' he added. </P>
<P> Even the team uniforms were inspired by European soccer garb and feature brightly colored jerseys and helmets designed by Reebok, a co-sponsor of the WLAF. </P>
<P> The one possible drawback, as before, is that the WLAF will rely mostly on second-rate U.S. and European players to fill the flashy uniforms, although Walsh insisted that the league will be a proving ground for ``future stars.'' </P>
