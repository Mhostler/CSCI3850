<P>  Political candidates affiliated with the religious right will make major gains in next Tuesday's elections, a group monitoring its activities said Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``Even before a single vote is counted, it is clear that the 1994 elections will set a new high water mark for the religious right and its influence in American politics,'' said Arthur Kropp, president of the People for the American Way Action fund. </P>
<P> The organization, which calls itself ``your voice against intolerance'' and monitors extremist organizations, issued a report counting nearly 500 candidates affiliated with the religious right running for national, state and local offices. </P>
<P> Kropp said in the report that the religious right is influencing the Republican Party greatly. </P>
<P> ``Pat Robertson's Christian Coalition and its allies are working to be the nuts and bolts of the Republican Party,'' Kropp said. ``From that position they will shape GOP ideology, strategies and candidate-selection for years to come,'' Kropp said. </P>
