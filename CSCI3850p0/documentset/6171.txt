<P>  The PLO will ask United Nations secretary-general Boutrous Boutrous-Ghali and U.S. officials to take steps to halt Israeli plans to confiscate Arab land in East Jerusalem, a Palestinian official said on Monday. </P>
<P> The Arab League will hold an urgent session on Saturday to discuss Israel's plans to take control of 53 hectares (131 acres) of land for Jewish housing and a police station. </P>
<P> Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said on Sunday he stood by the land confiscation plans. </P>
<P> PLO official Faisal al-Husseini, speaking by telephone during a visit to Los Angeles, said PLO chairman Yasser Arafat had asked him to cut short his visit and fly to New York to complain about the Israeli plans. </P>
<P> Husseini, the PLO official in charge of Arab affairs in Jerusalem, said he would meet Boutrous-Ghali in New York on Tuesday to discuss ``Israeli violations of the PLO-Israel accord on Jerusalem and ways to make Israel reverse its decision on seizing Arab land.'' </P>
<P> He said he would meet officials from the U.S. State Department and the Congress on Wednesday. </P>
<P> The 1993 PLO-Israel agreement stipulates the final status of Jerusalem will be determined in future negotiations. </P>
<P> The Palestine Liberation Organisation views East Jerusalem, captured by Israel in 1967 and annexed, as the capital of a future Palestinian state. Israel regards all of the city as its capital. </P>
