<P>  President Alberto Fujimori holds a commanding lead of more than 30 percentage points over his nearest rival less than a month before Peru's elections, nationwide polls published Monday showed. </P>
<P> Fujimori, standing for a second term in the April 9 contest, would win 50 percent of the vote, enough to give him the majority needed to clinch a first round victory, a survey by Peru's leading polling firm Apoyo SA said. </P>
<P> His nearest contender, former United Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, would obtain 17 percent of the vote and economist Alejandro Toledo ranked third with four percent, according to the poll of 1,516 voters taken from March 4-11.  Voter preference for Fujimori fell four percentage points from February, when the president gained 54 percent in a similar survey, the poll showed. Perez de Cuellar's percentage remained the same. </P>
<P> Apoyo manager Alfredo Torres said Fujimori's popularity had been helped by Peru's February border conflict with Ecuador, noting that the president remained strong despite fading ''euphoria'' over the war. </P>
<P> A nationwide poll in March by the Compania Peruana de Investigacion de Mercados SA (CPI) said Fujimori would win 54.5 percent and Perez de Cuellar would gain 18 percent. </P>
