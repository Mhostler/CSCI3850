<P>  National Hockey League players said Thursday they made major concessions in a revised proposal to owners during seven hours of negotiations aimed at saving the 1994-95 season. </P>
<P> For the first time in the 41-day-old lockout there appeared to be some movement toward a deal following the second meeting between union chief Bob Goodenow and NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman in four days. </P>
<P> The league had no comment on Thursday's meeting and Goodenow, as he left the talks, said, ``unfortunately no significant progress was made.'' </P>
<P> After arriving in Hamilton, Ontario, where some 50 NHL players are taking part in a 4-on-4 charity tournament however, Goodenow and players' representative Marty McSorley of the Los Angeles Kings discussed the latest offer. </P>
<P> ``We made a major concession,'' McSorley said after briefing the NHL players taking part in the charity tournament on the negotiations. ``We showed great desire to compromise. </P>
<P> ``If the proposal does not appeal to the general managers and many of the owners, I will be very disappointed.'' </P>
<P> Unconfirmed reports said a deal could result in a 60-game season beginning in early December. </P>
<P> The league has already announced cancellation of 14 games for each team, reducing the season from 84 to 70 games per team. Since the original Oct. 1 start date for the season, a total of 227 games have been missed. </P>
<P> The first note of optimism that the stalemate might be broken came after Monday's meeting in New York. While no specific progress was reported, NHL Vice President of Operations Brian Burke said there was hope of saving the season where there had been no hope before. </P>
<P> A key issue that has kept the two sides at odds is the owners' demand for a rookie salary cap that they feel is necessary to help slow rapidly escalating player salaries. </P>
<P> McSorley suggested that the players' proposal addressed the issue. </P>
<P> ``We made concessions with absolute numbers as to what people have to accept. Basically it was just short of (a rookie cap.)'' </P>
<P> Goodenow said the puck was now in the league's court. </P>
<P> ``We feel we have gone a long, long way in addressing the concerns of the owners,'' Goodenow said. </P>
<P> ``We feel is it a basis upon which progress can be made. Hopefully this is the case.'' </P>
