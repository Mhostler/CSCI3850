<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Thousands of cheering Egyptians Sunday packed the streets of the crowded slum of Imbaba, Cairo's former Muslim militant stronghold, to give Britain's Prince Charles a raucous welcome. </P>
<P> The prince, visiting a local youth center built under a government program trying to revitalize the teeming, poverty- stricken district, was given the kind of enthusiastic reception usually reserved for his estranged wife, Princess Diana. </P>
<P> Brass bands blared out anthems, musicians played folk music and Nubian dancers performed traditional dances in streets decked out with flags and posters. Banners, draped from balconies packed with onlookers, welcomed the prince. </P>
<P> Children released balloons which floated skywards bearing portraits of Charles and Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak. </P>
<P> But many residents, unaccustomed to prominent visitors, appeared confused as to who exactly they were cheering. </P>
<P> ``Where is Mubarak?'' asked 12-year-old Nadia. She said most people had expected him to tour the area where he sent thousands of troops to crack down on Muslim fundamentalism two years ago. </P>
<P> Charles, visiting Egypt for five days, also toured some of Cairo's Islamic monuments and met Muslim and Christian leaders. </P>
<P> He did not speak to reporters after the meetings but in a newspaper interview published Sunday Charles called for greater understanding between Muslims and Christians. </P>
<P> ``I find it odd that people speak of a clash between Islam and the West, because what binds our two worlds together is much more powerful than what divides us,'' he told the government paper Al-Ahram. </P>
<P> ``In the West our judgement of Islam has been distorted by taking the extreme as the norm. That is a serious mistake. </P>
<P> ``Our two worlds, the Islamic and the Western, are at a crossroads in their relationships. I believe that instead of indulging in mutual recriminations, we must all work to avoid antagonism,'' Charles said in the interview. </P>
<P> Charles' tour of Islamic Cairo started at the citadel, founded by the 12th century warrior Saladdin who repulsed the Crusaders, fighting to establish European control over parts of the Middle East. </P>
<P> The prince also attended midday prayers at one of Cairo's largest mosques. The head of Al-Azhar University, the highest center of Islamic learning, praised his call for reconciliation. </P>
<P> Sheik Gad al-Haq Ali Gad al-Haq handed Charles a letter after their morning meeting, along with a Koran, a silver plate and tray, saying the gifts were in appreciation for his stand. </P>
<P> Charles, who will head the Anglican Church if he becomes king, later met Egypt's Grand Mufti, Mohamed Sayed Tantawi and Pope Shenouda III, head of the Coptic Christian church. </P>
<P> The prince's last visit to Egypt was in 1981 for the funeral of former President Anwar Sadat, assassinated by Muslim militants. He also stopped off in Egypt in the same year on honeymoon with Diana. </P>
