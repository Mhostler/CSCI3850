<P>  President Boris Yeltsin, currently involved in handling a serious crisis in Russia's rebel region of Chechnya, has undergone surgery on his nose but will continue to work while in the hospital, his press office said Saturday. </P>
<P> ``The operation passed without complication. The process of recovery, during which he will be able to work, will take about eight days,'' a statement from the press office said. </P>
<P> The statement did not say when the operation took place, nor whether it had been planned or was undertaken in an emergency. </P>
<P> On Friday Yeltsin ordered his government to use ``all available measures'' to disarm what he called illegal armed formations in Chechnya, increasing the likelihood of military intervention. </P>
<P> Defense Minister Pavel Grachev left later Friday for the southern regions bordering Chechnya, which announced independence from Moscow in 1991. Moscow has amassed troops and tanks along the borders of the oil-rich north Caucasus republic. </P>
<P> Yeltsin's Friday order was made after a meeting of his powerful Security Council, which decided to regain control over Chechnya. </P>
<P> Russian liberals have urged Yeltsin to avoid any military action in the rebel region, which they think will inevitably lead to bloodshed and drag Moscow into a protracted guerrilla war in the north Caucasus. </P>
