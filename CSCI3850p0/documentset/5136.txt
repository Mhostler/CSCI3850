<P>  A humanitarian organization said Thursday that a major crisis loomed in central Africa because food aid was running out for 2.5 million Rwandan refugees. </P>
<P> The Paris-based International Action Against Hunger (AICF) said international food aid for the refugees in Burundi, Tanzania, Zaire and inside Rwanda had dried up despite repeated pleas to donor countries over the past five months. </P>
<P> Food rations for the refugees were being cut drastically and stocks would run out by the end of next month, the group said. Women and children were most affected. </P>
<P> ``AICF is wondering about the reasons for the passivity of donor countries that will lead in the coming weeks to a major food crisis,'' it said in a statement. </P>
<P> A spokeswoman for the group said many refugees saw the shortages as a deliberate ploy to force them to go home, but she said they were afraid of returning. </P>
<P> ``Only massive aid can head off a new major crisis,'' AICF said. ``If aid does not arrive in the coming weeks, violence and insecurity will spread throughout the region and force humanitarian organisations to pull out.'' </P>
<P> Up to 1 million people, mostly members of the minority Tutsi community, were killed in Rwanda in 1994. </P>
<P> Human rights observers say neighbouring Burundi, with a comparable tribal mix, might now be on the brink of massacres on a similar scale. </P>
