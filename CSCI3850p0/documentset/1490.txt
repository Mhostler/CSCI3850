<P>  A leading black human rights activist Monday blasted the agreement that averted a U.S. invasion by letting its military rulers stay in Haiti with amnesty after they step down from power. </P>
<P> Randall Robinson, executive director of TransAfrica, said the deal is unlikely to restore democracy and should be amended to require that the military rulers leave the Caribbean island. </P>
<P> Robinson praised President Clinton, telling a news conference: ``It's taken a great deal of political courage to come this far'' in trying to restore President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power and restore democracy in Haiti. </P>
<P> But Robinson, whose 27-day hunger strike this spring influenced U.S. policy toward Haiti, said he had ``very serious misgivings'' about the deal. He cited especially the agreement permitting military ruler Raoul Cedras and his allies, whom he called ``murderous thugs,'' to keep their financial assets in return for their promise to relinquish power by October 15. </P>
<P> ``This agreement does not serve the cause of democracy in Haiti,'' Robinson said. </P>
<P> He compared the deal to a hypothetical situation if American allies at the end of World War Two had negotiated with Hitler to let him keep his financial assets and stay in Germany with amnesty while democracy was worked out. </P>
<P> ``That is what the proponents of democracy in Haiti have now been charged with doing, by the delegation that struck these terms of the agreement,'' Robinson said. </P>
<P> With Cedras and his allies in Haiti, Robinson said, Aristide will be going back to face personal danger. </P>
<P> ``He faces a threatening and dangerous environment in which he is invited to go home cheek to jowl with the menace that has punished Haitian society over the last three years.'' </P>
<P> ``He faces, in my view, grave personal danger,'' Robinson added. ``And secondly, he faces the diminished prospect for a legitimate restored democracy.'' </P>
<P> Robinson told reporters that the issue of Cedras and other military leaders leaving the island should be a ''non-negotiable'' matter and questioned whether Cedras would keep his promise to step aside. </P>
