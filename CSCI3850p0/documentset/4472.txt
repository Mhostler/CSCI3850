<P>  World number two Andre Agassi played blistering tennis to soundly defeat Swedish qualifier Jan Apell 6-4 6-2 in just 51 minutes at the $714,250 COMCAST U.S. indoor men's tennis tournament Tuesday. </P>
<P> Once the second-seeded Agassi gained the early upperhand by breaking the 93rd-ranked Apell's serve in the third game, he was never in trouble. The second seeded American broke serve twice in the second set -- in the first and seventh games before serving it out. </P>
<P> ``I was hitting the ball strong,'' Agassi said. ``I just felt that I played better than he did. I returned well, I served well and I just felt I had a bit too much game for him.'' </P>
<P> Even though Agassi played well, he indicated he wants to improve all aspects of his game in an effort to displace Pete Sampras and attain the number one ranking in the world. </P>
<P> ``There is not one shot that I have that I don't want to improve,'' Agassi said. ``I want to improve my groundstrokes and my serve and volley game. I feel that I have a lot of room for improvement and that's what keep me going. </P>
<P> ``It's not a question of being number one as a goal, being number one is a by-product of a lot of hard work.'' </P>
<P> Agassi said he would not be available to play Davis Cup for the United States in the quarterfinal tie against Italy set down for Palermo 31st March to 2nd April after Pete Sampras turned down an invitation from U.S. Davis Cup captain Tom Gullikson. </P>
<P> ``I can't afford to go play unless Pete does,'' Agassi said, ''because really I would be falling behind, if I go and he doesn't. </P>
<P> ``Davis Cup can be very taxing. It takes three weeks out of your schedule, your preparation week, the week you are there and then the week to come down from it. It's a big sacrifice to go play. </P>
<P> ``I can understand Pete's desire to not want to go, but I was a bit disappointed because I felt if we were to rally as a team, then let's do it. It's just as much a cost for me and for Jim (Courier).'' </P>
<P> The match between Steven and Santoro was a seesaw struggle. </P>
<P> The Frenchman needed two service breaks to claim the first set, but then the New Zealander dominated the second to even the match. </P>
<P> Santoro raced to a 3-0 lead in the deciding set, but Steven rallied back and forced a tiebreaker which he won 7-4. </P>
