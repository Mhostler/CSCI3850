<P> Gray told reporters that details of the agreements are still being worked out. He said Haitians fleeing by boat will be sent to the ``safe havens'' where they will stay until the military regime in Haiti steps aside and democracy is restored. They then will be returned to Haiti. </P>
<P> Gray made it clear that no one leaving Haiti by boat would be considered for future resettlement in the United States. Only those who apply for political asylum in Haiti will be considered for refugee status in the United States. </P>
<P> ``Those who take to the boats will not have resettlement possibilities in the United States,'' Gray said. </P>
<P> Panama has agreed to take up to 10,000 Haitian refugees. Gray said the United States would be prepared to work with other countries to establish safe havens for refugees as the need arises. </P>
