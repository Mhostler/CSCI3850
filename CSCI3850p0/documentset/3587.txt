<P>  The United Nations (U.N.) pays over four times more compensation for soldiers from wealthy countries killed on peacekeeping missions than for soldiers from developing countries, Jane's Defense Weekly said Thursday. </P>
<P> The news has sparked fierce criticism from developing nations at a time of increasing casualties among U.N. peacekeepers, this week's issue of the magazine said. </P>
<P> Since the end of 1992, the U.N. has paid $85,300 each for soldiers from industrialized countries killed in action, while the average compensation for the death of a Third World soldier was $19,500, Jane's said. </P>
<P> It said the payments differed so greatly because the U.N.'s compensation scheme was based on the national legislation of contributing countries. </P>
<P> ``Since death and disability compensations are relatively low (in dollar terms) in developing nations, the payments made by the U.N. to countries such as France and the U.K. are much higher compared with payments to India, Pakistan or Bangladesh,'' it said. </P>
<P> The magazine said the U.N. General Assembly was expected to set up a working committee to resolve the issue. </P>
<P> From 1948 to 1988 there were 743 soldiers killed on peacekeeping duty. In 1993, 180 died, it said. </P>
