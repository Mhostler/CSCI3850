<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The dollar suffered one of its worst drubbings in years Tuesday as the Federal Reserve and other central banks did not step in to support the currency, which fell to new lows against the German mark and the Japanese yen. </P>
<P> In one of its worst single trading days in years, the dollar lost 2.5 percent of its value against the mark and a stunning 3.3 percent against the yen in just one session. </P>
<P> Analysts and traders said the dollar's troubles reflected a growing desire among international investors to hold marks as a so-called ``safe haven,'' as well as the belief that economic problems in Mexico could hurt the United States. </P>
<P> Despite the sharp drop, the Federal Reserve and other central banks refrained from buying dollars to support the currency, which some traders said was becoming a key factor in the continuing decline. </P>
<P> The central banks had acted in concert on Friday, buying dollars, but the intervention had little effect as the dollar continued to fall. </P>
<P> Officials in Washington and overseas capitals were also conspicuously absent Tuesday, with only Treasury Undersecretary Lawrence Summers reiterating the Clinton administration's desire for a strong dollar. </P>
<P> The dollar tumbled below the psychologically important 90-yen level to finish at 89.65 yen, down from 92.72 yen. </P>
<P> It also slid more than three pfennigs to 1.3675 marks in late New York trading, from 1.4028 marks on Monday. The mark's recent rise has come partly because of turmoil in Europe's monetary system. </P>
<P> The lower dollar should boost American companies' sales overseas, but also could mean the prices of imports will rise. The most immediate impact will be on American tourists overseas, who will get less for their money. </P>
<P> In addition to the mark's strength and the worries over Mexico, traders said there also was a simple lack of underlying demand for dollars. </P>
<P> ``People just don't want to have anything to do with the dollar,'' said Ronald Leven, global currency strategist at J.P. Morgan, who noted that Japanese investors were among the more aggressive sellers of the currency. </P>
<P> Analysts said the dollar was also suffering at the hands of slumpimg currencies in Latin America. </P>
<P> The central banks of Brazil and Mexico both sold dollars Tuesday to support their currencies. Many foreign central banks in the region use dollars in the intervention process. </P>
<P> From a policy standpoint, experts said there was little the Fed, the U.S. central bank, could do to halt the decline, short of raising interest rates sharply. </P>
<P> But such a response seems unlikely since the Fed has been focusing on bringing the economy in for a so-called soft-landing -- slower growth without a burst of inflation. </P>
<P> To do so, the Fed has already raised interest rates seven times in just more than a year, and stock and bond market investors are already worried another increase could seriously damage the economy. Stock and bond prices both fell sharply Tuesday. </P>
<P> Further intervention by the Fed and foreign central banks was not likely to stem the currency's fall, and some said it might actually accelerate the pace of investor selling. </P>
<P> ``The central banks cannot contain the dollar right now, the timing is not feasible. The market would take it (intervention) as an opportunity to sell the dollar even more,'' said Robert Johnson, vice president at ABN/AMRO. </P>
<P> In other trading, the dollar fell to a record low of 1.1385 Swiss francs, from 1.1735 late Monday. The British pound climbed to $1.6380 from $1.6245. </P>
