<P>  Nicaragua's National Assembly on Thursday elected five magistrates to the Supreme Court in defiance of President Violeta Chamorro, adding further confusion to a constitutional crisis. </P>
<P> Legislators said they were acting in line with constitutional reforms they pushed through in February to increase the number of Supreme Court judges from nine to 12. Two positions have been unfilled since last year. </P>
<P> But Chamorro, who refused to recognize the reforms, says the previous constitution is still legitimate and accuses the legislature of usurping executive powers. </P>
<P> Chamorro's chief aide and son-in-law, Antonio Lacayo, said the government does not recognize the new magistrates and will withhold their pay. </P>
<P> Only the Supreme Court can rule on which of the two rival constitutions is valid, but it has remained silent. The election of additional magistrates only creates more uncertainty. </P>
<P> ``There are countless (legal) positions and within them countless assessments and political positions,'' one of the newly elected magistrates, Julio Garcia, told reporters. </P>
<P> The old constitution requires candidates for the Supreme Court be nominated by the president, but the reformed version transfers that right to legislators, lawyers and others. None of the five elected Thursday was nominated by Chamorro. </P>
<P> Lacayo charges that legislators are trying to pack the Supreme Ccourt with magistrates who favor the reforms. He is a central figure in the debate as the constitutional reforms would prevent him from running for president in 1996 under the argument that he is related to Chamorro. </P>
