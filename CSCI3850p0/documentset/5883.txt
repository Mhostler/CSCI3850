<P>  White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta said Thursday the top national priority in the Oklahoma City car bombing is to capture the bombers and ``bring them to swift justice.'' </P>
<P> As the death toll reached 36, Panetta told CNN, ``You cannot allow these kinds of unconscionable acts of terrorism to occur.'' </P>
<P> More than 400 people were treated at area hospitals and another 200 or more were missing, according to Assistant Fire Chief Jon Hansen, also interviewed on television. </P>
<P> ``The purpose (of the bombers) is to rob all of us of our security and our freedom and force us to live in fear,'' Panetta said, adding: ``I think the country has always responded to this kind of situation.'' </P>
<P> Asked in an appearance on CBS This Morning whether the United States would retaliate if a specific country was found to be behind the bombing, Panetta said: ``The first focus of the president is to focus on capturing those that were involved in this unconscionable act. Our first order of business is to capture these killers.'' </P>
<P> In response to CNN questions, Panetta said the FBI was establishing a security network that included U.S. borders and airports to block the exit of the bombers and other federal buildings to prevent more bombings. </P>
<P> Another priority mentioned by the White House chief of staff was financial help to individuals and businesses in the radius of the downtown Oklahoma City blast. He told CNN that businesses as far away as a mile had been damaged. </P>
<P> Panetta said $5 million would be available immediately through executive order by President Clinton under the Stafford Act and he expected more funds to be distributed through the Small Business Association. </P>
