<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Sidney Kingsley, whose stark, realistic plays broke new ground for Broadway and unwittingly gave birth to Hollywood's ``Dead End Kids'' and TV's endless police and medical dramas, has died at age 88, associates said Tuesday. </P>
<P> He died of a stroke Monday at his home in Oakland, N.J., a New York city suburb. </P>
<P> Kingsley was the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning 1933 play ``Men in White'' about doctors and their private lives, a work that made a strong plea for legalizing abortion, and the 1949 play set in a New York police station ``Detective Story.'' </P>
<P> The New York Times said both plays were ``progenitors of virtually every hospital and police station drama produced since he originated them, imitated again and again over the years by scores of television and film writers.'' </P>
<P> Kingsley, who wrote 10 plays from 1933 to 1962, was also well-known for his play ``Dead End'' about rich and poor living cheek-by-jowl in depression Manhattan, a work that inspired New York's New Deal Democratic Senator Robert Wagner to promote public housing and slum clearance projects. </P>
<P> The original cast of the play included Leo Gorcey, Billy Halop, Huntz Hall and Gabriel Dell, playing a band of street toughs, who after making the film version of the play with Humphrey Bogart and Sylvia Sydney went on to fame with a series of comedy films called ``The Dead End Kids.' </P>
<P> Kingsley also adapted Arthur Koestler's novel of disillusionment with Communism, ``Darkness at Noon,'' for the stage. </P>
<P> ``Detective Story'' was made into a widely praised film that became one of the first starring vehicles for Kirk Douglas. The play dealt with a policeman's disintegration in a world peopled by drug addicts and thugs, a theme Kingsley developed by spending 18 months observing a real police precinct house in action. </P>
