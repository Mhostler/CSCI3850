<DATELINE>GROZNY, Russia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Russian forces in the Chechen capital of Grozny rehearsed for military parades to commemorate the end of World War II in Europe as other Kremlin troops fought separatists nearby Monday. </P>
<P> Some veterans watching the rehearsal said it was a strange priority for a city which has yet to recover from five months of fighting between Chechen rebels and Russian troops. </P>
<P> ``We do not need this holiday. We do not need military parades,'' said Stepan, a Ukrainian veteran of World War II. ``Look what war has done to us.'' </P>
<P> Chechnya, in the northern Caucasus, was partially occupied by German troops in World War II, and Soviet dictator Josef Stalin accused the Chechens of collaborating with the enemy. </P>
<P> By the time the fighting ended in 1945, virtually the whole Chechen population had been deported to Soviet Central Asia as punishment for their alleged dealings with the Nazis. They were allowed back to their homeland only in 1957. </P>
<P> Veterans now living in Grozny received a small bag of presents from city authorities to mark the 50th anniversary of the end of the war in Europe -- a pair of pajamas, a bottle of vodka, small packets of tea and coffee and a scarf. </P>
<P> Many residents said they feared fighting could flare up again. On the road west of Grozny some families were loading their cars with their belongings and preparing to leave, although there was no sign of a full-scale exodus. </P>
<P> Grozny was a bustling city of 400,000 before President Boris Yeltsin sent in tanks and troops Dec. 11 to crush a Chechen independence bid. He called a temporary cease-fire to cover the V-E-Day period but the fighting has not stopped. </P>
<P> Estimates of Grozny's population are now around 100,000. </P>
<P> Russian soldiers have dug into defensive positions on the outskirts of the city to combat a Chechen threat. </P>
<P> Military helicopters swooped down on rural roads and armored carriers charged through the undergrowth, picking up huge trails of dust. </P>
<P> The tension at Russian positions at a military base outside Khankala airport some 30 minutes' drive from the center of Grozny made clear that Yeltsin's statements that the war had been won were premature. </P>
<P> ``They fire on us from over there,'' said a Russian lieutenant, gesturing toward the fields that spread east of Grozny as far as the eye can see. </P>
<P> ``They fire from over there as well,'' he said. ``They are farmers by day and snipers by night.'' </P>
<P> There has been fighting outside Grozny in recent days as well, and local residents said arsonists set fire to two oil depots in western Chechnya Monday. </P>
<P> ``We woke up after midnight with a big explosion,'' said one resident. He did not know who was behind the incident, which sent a thick black pall of smoke rising into the air. </P>
