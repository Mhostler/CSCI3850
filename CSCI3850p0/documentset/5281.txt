<P>  Beijing's municipal Communist Party chief has called for order on campuses, warning that upheaval among students could affect China's political stability, officials and newspapers said on Wednesday. </P>
<P> The caution appeared to mark the start of Beijing's annual bout of nervousness and tightened security in the run-up to June 4 anniversary of the 1989 army crackdown on student-led pro-democracy demonstrations centred in Tiananmen Square. </P>
<P> ``Campus order is the most important of all our important tasks,'' the Beijing Daily quoted municipal party chief and Politburo member Chen Xitong as telling a Tuesday meeting at elite Qinghua University. </P>
<P> ``If we do not get campus order right then it will affect political stability, social security and the normal work of education,'' Chen said. </P>
<P> Chen called the meeting to check up on campus security and to continue a series of speeches at universities in the capital, including prestigious Beijing University, an official of Qinghua's security department said by telephone. </P>
<P> Each year since 1989, the security apparatus has shifted into top gear from April to June, bracing for a series of emotive anniversaries of student or popular unrest and guarding against renewed outbursts. </P>
<P> The first is April 5, the traditional annual festival called Tomb-Sweeping. </P>
<P> On that date in 1976, tens of thousands of mourners gathered in Tiananmen Square to mark the death a few weeks earlier of Premier Zhou Enlai. </P>
<P> Since 1989, some families have chosen that day to mark the deaths of several hundred people who died when army troops and tanks crushed the student-led Tiananmen demonstrations. </P>
<P> Each year, police boost security around the university district in northwestern Beijing. Already they are operating checkpoints outside the many campuses to check the identities of motorists and cyclists. </P>
<P> Diplomats say the heightened vigilance is intended as a preventive measure to deter students from commemorating the June 4 annniversary. </P>
<P> The Beijing party chief told Qinghua he expected the university to deploy more than just its security committees to quash any simmering dissent. </P>
<P> ``I hope Qinghua will further perfect its security work and check any potential evils,'' Chen was quoted as saying. </P>
<P> ``If the masses are mobiliised then their hundreds of thousands of eyes and ears can see and hear any evil action and maintain social security,'' he said. </P>
<P> Since 1987, Qinghua has been patrolled by university and student security committees who have helped police arrest 86 people and recover 400 stolen bicycles, Beijing Daily said. </P>
<P> ``Campus order is of significance to safeguard the security of the capital,'' the newspaper quoted Beijing deputy party secretary Li Zhijian as saying. </P>
