<DATELINE>ISTANBUL, Turkey (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Editor and satirist Aziz Nesin, who put his life on the line by publishing extracts from ``The Satanic Verses'' in Turkey, will be honored next week by the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists. </P>
<P> Muslim fundamentists enraged by Nesin's presence in the central Turkist town of Sivas set fire to a hotel during a cultural festival last year, killing 37 secular-oriented intellectuals. </P>
<P> Nesin, 79, has always spoken out in favor of religious tolerance and as editor of a left-leaning paper he published translated excerpts from ``The Satanic Verses'' despite a government ban on the novel and fundamentalist threats against its author, Salman Rushdie. </P>
<P> Rushdie lives in hiding due to a death order from Iran's Muslim government. </P>
<P> The Turkish government later opened a case against the newspaper for ``insulting Islam,'' while Nesin received death threats from Islamic groups inside and outside Turkey. </P>
<P> The Committee to Protect Journalists said in a fax to Reuters it will give him its annual International Press Freedom Award on Nov. 9.  ``Aziz Nesin writes what he believes despite attempts on his life by religious extremists, a price on his head and continuous government harassment,'' the committee said. </P>
<P> The trip to the United States will be Nesin's first. He was refused a visa 40 years ago because he had visited communist countries and was denied a passport by the Turkish government in the 1980s. </P>
<P> ``Finally I will get to see America, and America will see me. Let us see if we will both be pleased by this meeting,'' he said in a story written after hearing about the award. </P>
