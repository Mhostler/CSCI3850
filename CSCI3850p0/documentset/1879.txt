<P>  Mexican Indian rebels in the southern state of Chiapas have called for a second ``National Democratic Convention'' to be held in their territory next week. </P>
<P> The self-styled Zapatista National Liberation Army, in communiques published Saturday, said the meeting would be held October 12-15 in rebel-controlled territory in the Chiapas jungle. </P>
<P> The first such ``convention,'' held in August shortly before Mexico's presidential elections, attempted to set up a peaceful nationwide movement for democratic change that would oppose the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). </P>
<P> Since its foundation, however, the movement has been virtually absent from the public eye and has been riven by internal conflict. </P>
<P> The rebels, mostly of Mayan descent, rose up in arms January 1 to demand fairer treatment for indigenous people, land and legal reform and nationwide democratic change, have observed a cease-fire since mid-January after at least 145 people died in 10 days of fighting. </P>
<P> In a communique signed by Zapatista leader Subcommander Marcos, the rebels called on the members of the movement to stop bickering and unite around a six-point program to push for ''work, land, shelter, food, education and health'' for the millions of Mexicans who live below the poverty line. </P>
<P> The Mexican army allowed free passage to some 6,000 people who attended the August convention, which named a national leadership for the movement but was cut short by torrential rain and organizational problems. </P>
<P> The government-appointed peace envoy to Chiapas, Jorge Madrazo, said Friday that he would announce next week new measures agreed with the Zapatistas to further cement the cease-fire now in place but gave no indication of when a formal peace agreement with the guerrillas could be expected. </P>
