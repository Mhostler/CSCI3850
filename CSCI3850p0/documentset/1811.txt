<P>  The United States will lift trade sanctions imposed on China because of alleged missile technology transfers to Pakistan, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Tuesday. </P>
<P> In exchange, Christopher said, China has agreed not to export ground-to-ground missiles capable of sending a 1,000-pound payload 186 miles. They will be permitted sales of missiles that go a shorter distance and carry less payload. </P>
<P> The sanctions on China were imposed in August 1993 when the United States determined that China had sent Pakistan components and technology sufficient to assemble M11 missiles, in violation of the global Missile Technology Control Regime. </P>
<P> The regime is a multi-national agreement regulating export of missile components. </P>
<P> China has consistently denied violating MTCR regulations and has never confirmed sending the missile parts to Pakistan. </P>
<P> Christopher, speaking to reporters at a signing ceremony for a non-proliferation agreement with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, said trade sanctions imposed on Pakistan will remain in effect. </P>
<P> The sanctions block the export of millions of dollars worth of various U.S. products including missile systems, missile components and certain satellites. </P>
<P> In 1990 the United States halted the sale of all weapons to Pakistan after discovering Pakistan was continuing a program to develop nuclear weapons. </P>
<P> ``This is a global and verifiable ban on Chinese exports of all missiles within the 300-km (186 mile) range capable of (carrying) at least 500 kg.(1,100 pounds),'' Christopher said. ''... It's a very important step forward.'' </P>
<P> He did not specify how compliance with the agreement might be verified but added that the ``Chinese commitment in this regard is one that's not ambigious.'' </P>
<P> Even as he praised the non-proliferation agreement, Christopher said that sanctions would be imposed again if China resumed exporting missile technology. </P>
<P> Asked when the United States might lift all economic sanctions against China, Christopher replied, ``That's a completely different subject. As the relationships mature, as we watch over time and various aspects of the development of our relationships, I think those issues will arise and be clarified.'' </P>
<P> At a news conference later, Qian called the year-old sanctions unfair and noted that Tuesday's agreement promises only the first step toward lifting them. </P>
<P> ``After lifting of sanctions, China will make the commitment not to sell the missiles,'' Qian said through a translator. ''... If the sanctions are not lifted we cannot make such a commitment.'' </P>
<P> Christopher and Qian did not mention the knotty question of human rights, but John Shattuck, assistant secretary of State for human rights, had lengthy discussions with Chinese officials earlier in the day. </P>
<P> State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said they agreed to continue the human rights dialogue between the two countries, to strengthen legal contacts and to reopen discussions on international broadcasting. </P>
<P> McCurry noted that Voice of America radio has been impeded in broadcasting from China. </P>
