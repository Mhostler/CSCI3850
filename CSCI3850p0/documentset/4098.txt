<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The International Monetary Fund said Wednesday that it approved a $17.8 billion loan for Mexico to help the country weather a cash crisis that has engulfed its economy. </P>
<P> The IMF's stand-by loan -- its biggest ever by far -- is a key component of the nearly $50 billion assistance program for Mexico unveiled by President Clinton Tuesday. </P>
<P> The IMF said that $7.8 billion of the money approved by its board will be available to Mexico immediately. The balance will be handed out in tranches over the coming 18 months, so long as Mexico meets economic performance targets set down in an agreement with the IMF. </P>
<P> ``The exceptional action was taken with a view to providing an adequate international response to Mexico's financial crisis and giving confidence to the international financial system,'' the IMF said. </P>
<P> The IMF loan, coupled with help from the United States and other industrial nations, is designed to give Mexico breathing room to cope with a cash squeeze brought on by overspending on imports and excessive reliance on short-term debt. </P>
<P> The liquidity crisis brought Mexico to the brink of default on its loans and shook the underpinnings of the world financial system, sending stock prices in developing countries from Latin America to Asia skidding lower in sympathy. </P>
<P> To win the loan, Mexico has agreed with the IMF on a tight budget and interest rate policy. The Fund said Mexico is prepared to go even further if need be. </P>
<P> The Mexican peso has collapsed by some 35 percent since the crisis began about a month. The IMF said its loan and the rest of the international assistance package should help reverse what it called the ``overshooting'' of the peso. </P>
<P> But, it added, ``The Bank of Mexico stands ready to tighten credit conditions further to counter unforseen pressures in the exchange market.'' </P>
<P> The government likewise stands ready to tighten its fiscal stance beyond the sharp squeeze already planned if that should prove necessary, the IMF said. </P>
