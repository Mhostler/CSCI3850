<P>  A group of leading German Catholics, headed by premiers from two federal states, criticized the Vatican Tuesday for what they called its ``pitiless severity'' toward divorced believers. </P>
<P> The group said in an open letter that a recent Vatican ruling upholding a ban on communion for Catholics who divorced and remarried was harmful to the Church. </P>
<P> The Vatican's doctrinal watchdog, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, issued the statement Oct. 14 in response to a letter by German bishops suggesting leniency toward those who divorced and remarried. </P>
<P> ``We emphatically support the bishops' letter, which showed a sensitive and theologically convincing approach to people in broken marriages, the divorced and the remarried divorced,'' said the open letter issued in Bonn. </P>
<P> ``What amazes us is the impression of pitiless severity with which the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith approaches this carefully prepared pastoral work,'' the Bonn letter said. </P>
<P> ``The statement does no justice to the consciences of the people involved and therefore does no service to the Christian message of faith,'' it said. </P>
<P> State premiers Bernhard Vogel of Thuringia and Erwin Teufel of Baden-Wuerttemberg, both members of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, signed the open letter. </P>
<P> Also present among the 11 signatories were Alois Glueck, parliamentary leader of the ruling Christian Social Union in the Bavarian state assembly, and Friedrich Kronenberg, general secretary of the Central Committee of German Catholics. </P>
<P> The Vatican statement strongly reaffirmed its stand that worshippers who divorce and remarry cannot receive communion unless they abstain from sex. </P>
<P> Catholics who are banned from communion cannot participate in the most central event of their religion. </P>
<P> The Vatican letter was approved by the 74-year-old Pope John Paul II, who has shown himself to be an unbending stickler on Church rules regarding marriage and divorce. </P>
<P> The German bishops had suggested that the Church respect the good faith of divorced and remarried Catholics who said their consciences saw no conflict between their private lives and their faith. </P>
