<DATELINE>MOSCOW, May 9 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Soviet war veterans and young troops in World War Two uniform staged a triumphant march across Moscow's Red Square on Tuesday at victory celebrations watched by U.S. President Bill Clinton and other Western leaders. </P>
<P> President Boris Yeltsin launched the glittering, emotion-charged ceremony from atop the mausoleum of Soviet State founder Vladimir Lenin, declaring: ``We are united in our aim to rid the forthcoming generations from the calamity of war.'' </P>
<P> But Russia's bloody campaign in the north Caucasus territory of Chechnya hung heavily over proceedings. </P>
<P> Russian troops fought gun and artillery battles with separatists throughout the night, a Reuter correspondent in the Chechen capital Grozny reported. </P>
<P> About 4,500 Red Army old soldiers, medals winking in the spring sunshine, marched in a sea of red standards recalling the Soviet epic battle fronts. </P>
<P> The Moscow commemorations of the Allied victory over Nazi Germany 50 years ago followed two days of ceremonies in London, Paris and Berlin. </P>
<P> Many old campaigners, some greybearded and slightly unsteady on their feet, were taking their final bow before history in a new Russia where Soviet-style military parades are becoming a relic of the past. </P>
<P> Underscoring the spirit of the new age, Yeltsin emphasised reconciliation with former adversary Germany and Russia's friendship now with the United States, Britain and France, wartime allies who then became Cold War foes. </P>
<P> A huge poster depicting a Soviet soldier with his arm round the shoulder of an American GI dominated the square at one end. </P>
<P> Marines and a unit of elite ``Spetsnaz'' forces also marched, adding a potentially controversial touch, given U.S. condemnation of Russian military action in Chechnya. </P>
<P> Clinton, who flew in from Washington only three hours earlier, stood to one side of the mausoleum with First Lady Hillary Clinton, British Prime Minister John Major and Aleksiy II, head of the Russian Orthodox Church. </P>
<P> In a protocol touch intended to spare Yeltsin and Western leaders embarrassment, authorities rigged up foliage across the front of the mausoleum to obscure Lenin's name. </P>
<P> The gesture further secularised the red marble mausoleum, which houses the embalmed body of Lenin and was, in the Soviet era, communism's holiest shrine. </P>
<P> Potential disruption of the official festivities came from 2,000 die-hard communist supporters who rallied at Byelorussky Station for an alternative parade. </P>
<P> ``I am ashamed to see Judas on the mausoleum,'' declared one veteran to the crowd in reference to Yeltsin. </P>
<P> Clinton, who will hold a one-day summit meeting with Yeltsin on Wednesday, laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier which commemorates the 26.6 million Soviet war dead. </P>
<P> But he and other Western leaders were avoiding a later military parade on the Hill of Tributes because of Chechnya. </P>
<P> French President Francois Mitterrand and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl also stayed away from the Red Square marchpast, apparently in protest at the Chechnya conflict. </P>
<P> Chechnya, proposed NATO expansion and Russia's plans to sell nuclear reactors to Iran are among the issues facing Clinton and Yeltsin at Wednesday's summit. </P>
