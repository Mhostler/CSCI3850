<P>  A Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant was back on-line Monday after a two-day shutdown caused by an unexpected water leak, a plant spokeswoman said. </P>
<P> A small amount of water, which was not radioactive and posed no public health or safety danger, leaked from the plant's cooling system, said Mary Schneider, spokesperson for Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. </P>
<P> According to a Nuclear Regulatory Commission classification for nuclear plant emergencies, the leak was given the lowest designation -- ``an unusual event.'' </P>
<P> The leak was traced to a crack in the weld of a four-inch steel pipe, but Schneider said the cause of the crack has not been determined. </P>
