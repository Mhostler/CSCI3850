<P>  A new Beatles double album featuring cover versions of rock 'n' roll classics is being released for Christmas, record label EMI said Friday. </P>
<P> ``Live At The BBC,'' with songs recorded for British Broadcasting Corporation shows, was compiled by Beatles producer George Martin and is being released on Nov. 30. </P>
<P> It includes a rare John Lennon/Paul McCartney song ``I'll Be On My Way,'' given to Billy J. Kramer who featured it on the B-side of his debut single ``Do You Want To Know A Secret.'' </P>
<P> With a running time of more than 130 minutes, the 56 songs were recorded in the early 60s and have been digitally improved. The rock 'n' roll hits were a feature of the band's pre-1963 stage appearances in Liverpool and Hamburg. </P>
