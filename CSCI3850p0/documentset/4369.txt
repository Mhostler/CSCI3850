<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  O.J. Simpson's best friend, Al Cowlings, launched a pay-to-listen 900-number phone service Wednesday to talk about his life with Simpson and his feelings about the murder charges now facing the football legend. </P>
<P> Cowlings, speaking at a news conference a few blocks from the Los Angeles courthouse where Simpson is on trial on double murder charges, said he wanted to lend ``truth and sanity'' to the case. </P>
<P> ``As you know, I've been very reluctant to speak to the media. I feel that the media has consistently sensationalized the facts and deliberately exploited so many aspects of this tragedy,'' Simpson's childhood pal and former National Football League teammate said. </P>
<P> ``So in a personal effort to lend truth and sanity, I've chosen to speak to the public directly through a 900 ... program. This way the words and the emotions are truly mine without taking them out of context.'' </P>
<P> Simpson has pleaded not guilty to the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman, who were stabbed to death outside Nicole's Brentwood townhouse on June 12 last year. </P>
<P> Cowlings is the man who drove Simpson in his white Ford Bronco in an apparent flight from police June 17, the day he was to be arrested. The slow-speed freeway chase that followed was seen on television around the world. </P>
<P> While criticizing the media, Cowlings also used the press to launch a venture his lawyer, Donald Re, said would probably make him money. </P>
<P> Saying ``I totally believe in my friend's innocence,'' Cowlings said the number to call was 1-900-CALL-4AC, which costs customers $2.99 a minute. Re said Cowlings would receive $1 for each call made. </P>
<P> Cowlings said that through a pre-recorded text he would share with callers ``my life experiences with O.J. from my childhood through my NFL days, my close relationship with Nicole and my views on the media.'' </P>
<P> Re said Cowlings, who played with Simpson on the Buffalo Bills and the San Francisco 49ers, would spend an hour a day live on the number to talk to people on a ``first come, first served'' basis. </P>
