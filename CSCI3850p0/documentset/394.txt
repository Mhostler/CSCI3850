<P>  A teen-age liver transplant patient who won the right to stop taking painful anti-rejection drugs was doing fairly well Monday, six weeks after winning the right to stop treatment, his doctor said. </P>
<P> ``He's at his home and he's alive,'' said Dr Andreas Tzakis, transplant surgeon for 15-year-old Benny Argelo. </P>
<P> Argelo, of Fort Lauderdale, decided without consulting his doctors this spring that he would stop taking anti-rejection drugs considered necessary to save his life. </P>
<P> The teen-ager said he would rather die if necessary than continue to endure their severe and painful side effects. </P>
<P> His parents approved his decision. But state officials took Argelo to the hospital against his will early in June when they found out he had stopped treatment. </P>
<P> Argelo sought legal permission to stop his treatment, which was granted on June 11. Broward County Judge Arthur Birken said in granting the petition that he hoped the boy would decide to resume on his own. </P>
<P> Benny was born with an enlarged liver that forced him to undergo a transplant. But his body rejected his first new liver, necessitating a second. He was able to return home and resume a normal life, but grew weary of the effects of the drugs. </P>
<P> Tzakis said Argelo had begun to retain fluids, a side effect of organ rejection. He said the boy still was likely to die without drug treatment, though he hoped he would survive. </P>
<P> ``I can't imagine that he would do well, though we hope for pleasant surprises,'' he said. </P>
