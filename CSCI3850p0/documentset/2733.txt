<P>  The Bosnian prime minister said Sunday that Serb tanks had advanced to the edge of the U.N. protected ``safe haven'' around the northwestern Bosnian town of Bihac and demanded NATO action to bring them to a halt. </P>
<P> ``They are rolling with tanks through the villages near Bihac,'' said Haris Silajdzic. ``The concrete action would be to take out these tanks -- serious air strikes.'' </P>
<P> ``If UNPROFOR (U.N. Protection Force) and the U.N. cannot carry out their mandate here, cannot protect the safe zones, cannot see that convoys pass through, we wonder why they are here,'' said Silajdzic. </P>
<P> Bosnian radio said that Serb forces in Croatia had advanced across the border together with rebel Muslims loyal to deposed warlord Fikret Abdic and entered the village of Zavalje, five miles southwest of Bihac town. </P>
<P> A U.N. spokesmen said he could not confirm the report but added that, given the intensity of the fighting on three fronts around the Bihac enclave, advances were ``not an unlikely scenario.'' </P>
<P> The U.N.'s Col. Jan-Dirk Merveldt said earlier that despite strong resistance by the Bosnian army's Fifth Corps defending the town, the U.N. believed attacking Serb and rebel Muslims could force a breakthrough within 24 hours. </P>
<P> Despite the threat that the Bihac enclave could be overrun, the U.N. has made it clear it has pledged itself to protect only the tightly defined ``safe haven'' it has declared around Bihac town, to the south of the beleaguered pocket. </P>
<P> Zavalje is on the edge of the ``safe haven,'' which U.N. commanders can demand NATO airstrikes to defend. </P>
<P> Serb aircraft bombed within the haven's confines Friday but missed their target and caused no casualties. In a second raid on Cazin, outside the ``safe haven,'' Saturday, the pilot of one of the planes was killed and nine local people injured. </P>
<P> The U.N. has not so far responded with force to the raids, pointing out that attacking the Serb air base in Croatia was outside its powers. </P>
<P> The U.N. Security Council has since voted to allow NATO jets to strike targets within Croatia. However, it is unclear whether there will be retaliation for Serb raids carried out before the U.N. resolution was passed. </P>
<P> Silajdzic and the Bosnian government have in the past condemned what they call a lack of will in the U.N. to confront aggression by Serb forces and use the powers granted them to deploy force. </P>
<P> The premier criticized the U.N. for deploying under-armed Bangladeshi peacekeepers in Bihac. The U.N. reported that the Bangladeshis, low on food and fuel, were under threat from local people, angered by the U.N.'s inaction over the air raids. </P>
