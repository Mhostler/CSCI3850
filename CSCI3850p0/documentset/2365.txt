<P>  A Republican group asked the Justice Department Wednesday to assign federal marshals to Rep. Dan Rostenkowski's district to assure a fair election next week. </P>
<P> The United Republican Fund, in a letter to Attorney General Janet Reno, said the marshals should be assigned to polling places Tuesday where there are no Republican judges. </P>
<P> A spokesman for the group said there was a danger of voter fraud and claimed that unpublished polls show the indicted former chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee is in trouble seeking a 19th term. </P>
<P> Many political observers doubt Rostenkowski will have any trouble with his little-known Republican opponent, Michael Flanagan. </P>
<P> Rosteknowski faces 17 criminal counts of embezzlement, fraud and witness-tampering. Under House rules he was forced to resign the powerful chairmanship after he was indicted. </P>
