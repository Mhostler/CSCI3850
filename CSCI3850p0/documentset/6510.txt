<P>  A federal magistrate denied bail Friday to a former Mexican prosecutor who is wanted in Mexico for questioning in an investigation into the assassination of his brother, a leading politician. </P>
<P> Mario Ruiz Massieu, 44, was arrested at New Jersey's Newark International Airport for currency irregularities March 3 when he was caught carrying thousands of undeclared dollars into the United States. </P>
<P> The Mexican government is seeking to extradite Ruiz Massieu, claiming he obstructed an investigation he was heading into the assassination of his brother, Jose Francisco, then chief of staff in the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has governed Mexico for nearly 70 years. </P>
<P> At an extradition hearing set for June 13, Mexico is expected to contend that Ruiz Massieu was covering up the involvement of the brother of former president Carlos Salinas de Gortari in the Sept. 28, 1994 assassination -- one of several involving Mexican political leaders in recent years. </P>
<P> In court papers, the Mexican government charges that Raul Salinas paid $170,000 to Mexican congressman Manuel Munoz Rocha to arrange the assassination. </P>
<P> ``There is no way the United States could guarantee the safety of Mr. Massieu if he were freed on bail,'' said U.S. magistrate Ronald Hedges of Newark, N.J., turning down a request by his lawyers that he be put under house arrest with private security guards on duty 24 hours a day. </P>
<P> Ruiz Massieu was not in court Friday, but several family members, including his wife and baby daughter, attended the bail hearing. </P>
<P> Attorney Cathy Fleming called her client's imprisonment ''cruel and heartless'' and said he was held in solitary confinement 23 hours a day with only one hour of recreation. Hedges promised defense attorneys he would look into ways for giving the former prosecutor more recreation time. </P>
