<P>  Nine tankers leased by the Navy to carry jet fuel and other supplies for U.S. forces around the world were so badly maintained they could not do their jobs properly, a congressional report said Wednesday. </P>
<P> The General Accounting Office said inspection reports by the Navy's Military Sealift Command documented unsafe operating conditions including leaking oil, inoperable lifesaving equipment, missing railings and improperly stored chemicals and lubricating oil. </P>
<P> During the Gulf War, the GAO told a Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee, two of the tankers were unable to refuel other ships because their refueling equipment did not work. </P>
<P> The GAO said a Navy's $170 million five-year contract to International Marine Carriers to operate the tankers rose to $256 million by April 1, with a year of the contract to go. </P>
<P> Subcommittee Chairman Carl Levin, D-Mich., said the sealift program ``depicts an agency seemingly inept at ensuring contractor performance, spending millions of taxpayer dollars on repairs that contractors were obliged to make, and then failing to hold the contractors accountable for the cost.'' </P>
<P> Military Sealift Commander Vice Adm. Philip Quast, said Sealift tankers had delivered cargo on time and safely for nearly 20 years. He said steps had been taken to improve oversight of the tanker contracts. </P>
<P> Robert Wellner, president of International Marine Carriers, the contractors, disagreed with the GAO's finding that the company did not adequately maintain the ships. </P>
<P> He said the problems found by the GAO were virtually all related to the ``catastrophic'' condition of the ships when the firm took them over. Three of the vessels had been unable to leave the dock under their own power, he said. </P>
<P> He said IMC later discovered that the Sealift Command knew of the ships' condition but hid the information from the firm. </P>
