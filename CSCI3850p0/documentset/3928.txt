<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Actor Charlton Heston broke with other conservatives Tuesday by supporting continued federal funding for the arts and humanities. </P>
<P> ``I join with many other conservatives in urging their continuation,'' he said about proposals to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. </P>
<P> He disagreed with two former chairmen of the humanities endowment, Lynn Cheney and William Bennett -- who also served as education secretary and drug czar under Republican administrations. Bennett and Cheney spoke before the veteran Hollywood actor and called for the end of the two endowment agencies created 30 years ago. </P>
<P> The future of the agencies is very much in doubt since many of the conservatives in the new Republican-led Congress are bent on eliminating the agencies. </P>
<P> Heston said he realized ``serious budget cuts'' would have to be made in the two agencies as Congress prepared to cut spending but he urged lawmakers against killing them completely. </P>
<P> ``I beg you, though, not to sweep away'' funding, he told the subcommittee, which applauded his remarks after he ended his appeal with a dramatic reading from Shakespeare. </P>
<P> Heston said that when he first started as an actor, the American theater consisted of 40 blocks of New York City. The rest of the country only saw plays when Broadway shows were tried out or went on the road. Now, he said, it is possible to see good plays nationwide through a network of regional theaters -- which he credits to partial funding from the arts agency. </P>
<P> But Bennett disagreed. </P>
<P> The federal government should not be in the business of subsidizing the humanities and the arts, he said. </P>
<P> ``The two endowments have done at least as much harm as they have done good in terms of the cultural life of our nation,'' he said. Cheney opposed further funding in a similar vein. </P>
<P> Bennett said the endowments were fostering intellectual and moral corruption in arts and humanities. ``The corruption is too endemic'' he said, to be fixed through a good chairman. </P>
<P> But former subcommittee Chairman Sidney Yates, D-Ill., threw Bennett's and Cheney's words back to them by reading excerpts from their testimony before Congress when they chaired the agencies and praised the works of their agencies and appealed for funding. </P>
