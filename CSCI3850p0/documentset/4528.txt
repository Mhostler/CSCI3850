<P>  In what is said to be the first death penalty case filed in the United States under the Clinton administration's Crime Bill, a Dallas federal prosecutor is seeking to put to death two men accused of kidnapping and murdering a teen-ager last year. </P>
<P> An act under the Crime Bill, signed into law Sept. 13, 1994, states that defendants convicted of kidnapping resulting in the death of the victim could face the death penalty. </P>
<P> U.S. Attorney Paul Coggins said in a statement Thursday this is the first death penalty case filed nationally since the Crime Bill was enacted. </P>
<P> The defendants, Orlando Cordia Hall, 23, and Bruce Carneil Webster, 21, are accused of kidnapping Lisa Rene, 16, from her apartment in Arlington, Texas, on Sept. 24, 1994. The men are accused of hitting Rene on the head with a shovel and suffocating her. </P>
<P> The men are also accused of sexually assaulting her. Rene's body was found Oct. 2 in a shallow grave in Pine Bluff, Ark. </P>
<P> The defendants are currently awaiting trial in federal court in Fort Worth. ``This offense was conducted in a particularly heinous, cruel and depraved manner against a highly vulnerable victim,'' Coggins said in a statement Thursday. </P>
<P> ``The circumstances surrounding the kidnapping and death of Lisa Rene are such that, if convicted, a sentence of death is justified,'' Coggins said. </P>
