<P>  Conflicts in Africa, a lack of political cooperation and a failure to keep up with changes in the market are hindering the development of tourism on the continent, travel executives said Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``Rising animosity in the region makes intra-regional tourism a dream. Kenya and Uganda are at loggerheads, Uganda and Sudan do not agree, Eritrea and Sudan have severed diplomatic links. How can anyone talk of regional tourism?'' a Kenyan tourism official said. He declined to be identified. </P>
<P> At a meeting of the New York-based Africa Travel Association (ATA), the Kenyan official said that African and international tourists alike avoided areas where their lives might be in danger. </P>
<P> He also told Reuters that many African leaders paid only lip service to easing visa, immigration and currency restrictions to make free movement of people and services possible. </P>
<P> ATA mainly promotes Africa as a tourist destination for Americans and Canadians. Formed in 1975, ATA draws its membership from many African governments, international airlines, hoteliers, cruise lines, tour operators and travel agents. </P>
<P> Delegates to the weeklong congress discussed impediments to tourism Tuesday and were later to visit some Kenyan game parks. </P>
<P> Zambian Tourism Minister Lt. Gen. Christone Tembo said problems of access, seasonality, standards, strife, a lack of data on many countries and the tourist's search for value for money had led to a drop in Africa's tourism receipts. </P>
<P> ``In 1993, Africa received 16.79 million arrivals which gave rise to $6.364 billion in receipts. In 1994 arrivals rose to 18.6 million but receipts fell to $5.675 billion,'' he said. </P>
<P> Tembo, ATA's international board president, said there were questions as to whether Africa was proving true quality for international tourist money, with variety, product range and high standards, as well as a quick response to changing tourist tastes. </P>
<P> ``Are we concerning ourselves about authentic tourism? Or are we too busy churning out archaic products and services, in our complacency, which the market is no longer interested in?'' he asked. </P>
