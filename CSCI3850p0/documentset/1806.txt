<P>  Retired British soldier Tom Leppard, the world's most tattoed person with 99.2 percent of his body covered in a leopard-skin motif, Tuesday helped launch the 1995 edition of the Guinness Book of Records. </P>
<P> He shared his place in the new book with Indian Mata Jagdama who has the longest hair in the world and Californian Susan Williams who holds the record for the biggest bubblegum blown. </P>
<P> Leppard, who now lives alone on Scotland's Isle of Skye, has left the insides of his ears and the skin between his toes as the only area of his body that is tattoo-free. </P>
<P> Other entrants include Australian David Huxley for hauling a Boeing 767 for 203 feet, 10 inches across a Sydney jet base and Christchurch, New Zealand, for staging the world's largest teddy bears' picnic with 16,837 bears and their owners. </P>
