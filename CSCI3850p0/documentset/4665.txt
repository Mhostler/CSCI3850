<P>  The U.NN special representative to Angola Wednesday announced the creation of a special task force to monitor troop disengagement under a peace deal signed in November to end the country's 19-year civil war. </P>
<P> ``The joint commission has nominated a permanent board of military observers who will analyze the execution of the troop disengagement and will report in one week's time,'' U.N. special representative to Angola Alioun Blondin Beye told reporters. </P>
<P> Beye spoke at the closing session of a meeting of a joint commission set up to monitor the peace agreement signed in the Zambian capital Lusaka by the Angolan government and Jonas Savimbi's UNITA rebel movement. </P>
<P> The Luanda government has accused UNITA of failing to withdraw the stipulated distance agreed to in the peace accord, but UNITA said Tuesday it would stick to the terms of the deal. </P>
<P> The joint commission is composed of representatives of Portugal, the United States, Russia, the United Nations, the UNITA rebel movement and the Angolan government. </P>
<P> Beye said the new board of observers will be headed by U.N. chief military observer Gen. Chris Garuba and will include military experts from the government, UNITA and military observers from the three observer countries. </P>
<P> Troop disengagement is essential to the peace deal reached between the government and UNITA. </P>
<P> Angola's civil war, which started at the time of independence from Portugal in 1975, was interrupted once in 1991 through a Portuguese-sponsored peace agreement. </P>
<P> The country returned to war after UNITA leader Savimbi lost 1992 elections to President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. </P>
