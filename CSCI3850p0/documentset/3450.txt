<P>  France has assured the Philippines a shipment of highly radioactive plutonium bound for Japan will not pass through Philippine territorial waters, Foreign Secretary Roberto Romulo said Tuesday. </P>
<P> He said in a statement that France had also pledged it was taking all possible measures to make sure the shipment arrived at its destination without incident. </P>
<P> Romulo said Japan had also assured the Philippines it would use the best and latest technology in handling the shipment to make sure it causes no harm. </P>
<P> ``While we welcome the official assurances of both these countries, we will continue to be vigilant and exert all efforts and take all measures to ensure that the shipment does not pass through Philippine territory,'' Romulo said. </P>
<P> The government last week vowed to block any vessel carrying nuclear waste through its territorial waters and instructed all Philippine foreign service posts to monitor the shipment. </P>
<P> The environmental group Greenpeace earlier this month said the nuclear cargo was unsafe, but the French nuclear firm Cogema, which is planning the shipment, denied this. </P>
<P> The date for the shipment has not been disclosed. </P>
<P> Last year, the Japanese vessel Akatsuki Maru carried to Japan 1.7 tons of plutonium refined in France from nuclear waste from Japanese power plants. </P>
<P> Many countries along that shipment's route, including the Philippines, barred it from their territorial waters. Indonesia gave permission. </P>
