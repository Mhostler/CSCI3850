<P>  Security forces in Algeria Monday shot and killed the leader of the country's feared Armed Islamic Group, which has kidnapped and killed foreigners in its fight to set up a fundamentalist Muslim state. </P>
<P> The official Algerian news agency APS, monitored in Tunis, said guerrilla leader Cherif Gousmi, 26, alias Abou Abdallah, was slain in a gunbattle in Algiers. He had led the group of battle-hardened Afghan war veterans since February. </P>
<P> The GIA, believed to operate in largely autonomous cells, has been blamed by diplomats and officials for killing dozens of foreigners and running a campaign of murder, arson and bombings across the north African country. </P>
<P> Earlier this month it vowed ``no truce, no dialogue'' with the army-backed authorities, as Algerian President Liamine Zeroual freed some leaders of the outlawed Islamic Salvation Front in a bid to end political violence in which more than 10,000 people have died since early 1992. </P>
<P> Its statement underscored diplomats' fears that the FIS, which had been poised to win a general election scrapped in January 1992, may have been pushed into the background by armed militants who believe power will only come from the gun. </P>
<P> The release of the FIS men and Zeroual's attempts to woo the fundamentalists into dialogue he is holding with opposition parties have failed to halt the spiral of killings. </P>
<P> Just hours after he announced his gesture to the FIS, 13 people were kidnapped and beheaded. </P>
<P> On Sunday, the Algerian newspaper Le Matin reported that a veteran of the independence war against France had been decapitated and his head stuck on a roadsign. </P>
<P> The GIA, seen as the most radical of the Muslim militants who took to the gun after the scrapped elections, sparked an exodus of thousands of foreigners late last year. </P>
