<P>  Film star turned animal rights activist Brigitte Bardot called Monday for a worldwide boycott of Canada and Norway to protest their decisions to allow seal hunting this year. </P>
<P> ``It's shameful, it's simply unacceptable, it's barbaaric, it's backward,'' Bardot told a news conference. </P>
<P> She asked for a boycott of Canadian and Norwegian products as well as a halt to tourism to both countries. </P>
<P> Bardot also went to the Norwegian and Canadian embassies to express her views to diplomats. As she met officials inside the embassies, several dozen supporters surrounded their entrances, chanting ``Assassins.'' </P>
<P> Norway has announced it will allow resumption of the hunting of baby seals, stopped in 1989 after film of hunters wielding clubs sparked worldwide condemnation. It said the killing of pups would be for scientific purposes. </P>
<P> Oslo said up to 2,600 seals would be killed to study nutrition and growth of pups and to determine whether rifles were as efficient a killing method as the traditional icepick. </P>
<P> Canada said it was expanding its east coast seal hunt this year by allowing killing with a game licence and putting a bounty on the animals. </P>
