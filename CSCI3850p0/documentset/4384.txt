<P>  A defense lawyer on Thursday accused Air Force officials of stalling an inquiry into whether top commanders illegally influenced the prosecution of a radar officer involved in the downing of two U.S. Army helicopters over Iraq.  Defense attorneys for accused Captain Jim Wang said the legal staff of Gen. John Michael Loh, commander of the U.S. Air Force's Air Combat Command, has refused to pass on questions to Loh that could clear up whether the prosecution was influenced. </P>
<P> Wang is facing court-martial for his involvement in the April 14, 1994, ``friendly fire'' downing of the two Black Hawk helicopters over northern Iraq in which 26 people died. He is accused of failing to prevent the tragedy. </P>
<P> Pre-trial motions on the court martial began Monday at the base. </P>
<P> Defense attorney Don Holtz said he wants Loh to answer three questions about a possible conversation Loh had with Air Force Secretary Sheila Widnall. </P>
<P> ``What are they afraid of? It's three simple questions,'' Holtz told military judge Howard Altschwager. The defense is considering a motion to dismiss the charges against Wang based on unlawful command influence. </P>
<P> Altschwager said he would direct Loh's legal staff to forward the undisclosed questions to Loh. ``Whether he chooses to answer them or not is outside the power of this court, unless he is introduced as a witness,'' Altschwager said. </P>
<P> Loh's answers will clear up whether commanders unduly influenced the investigation into the downing, Holtz said. He did not detail how the investigation may have been illegally skewed, or who was involved. </P>
<P> Holtz said an undisclosed third-party told him that Loh should be interviewed about command influence. Prosecutor Bob Coacher asked the judge to force disclosure of the third-party ''mystery witness.'' </P>
<P> Wang, an Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) E-3 Sentry radar plane officer, is accused of failing to warn two Air Force F-15s before they visually misidentified two Army helicopters and shot them down. </P>
<P> The helicopters were flying in the northern no-fly zone in Iraq and the fighter pilots mistook them for Iraqi Hind helicopters. </P>
