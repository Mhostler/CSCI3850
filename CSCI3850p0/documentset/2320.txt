<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Supreme Court, in an important church-state dispute, agreed Monday to decide whether a public university can refuse to subsidize a student-run religious publication. </P>
<P> The case stemmed from the University of Virginia's refusal to give money from its student activities fund for a Christian publication put out by a student. </P>
<P> The student, Ronald Rosenberger, sued, claiming the school's action violated his constitutional free-speech rights under the First Amendment. </P>
<P> Rosenberger had requested $5,800 to cover the publishing costs of ``Wide Awake: A Christian Perspective at the University of Virginia.'' He put out three issues of the publication in 1990, with 5,000 copies of each issue distributed free of charge on campus. </P>
<P> The university argued that giving him the money would subsidize a publication advocating a particular religious belief, in violation of the constitutional requirement on the separation of church and state. </P>
<P> But Rosenberger said a total of 118 groups received money, including Jewish and Muslim student-group publications, and asked the Supreme Court to hear the case. The case could allow the conservative high court to permit greater accommodation of religion in government activities. </P>
<P> The justices will hear arguments in the case early next year, with a decision due before June. </P>
<P> In other action, the Supreme Court denied an appeal by a devout Christian who refused to rent his residential property to unmarried couples because of his religious conviction that cohabitation is sinful. </P>
<P> The justices let stand an Alaskan Supreme Court ruling that the landlord discriminated against potential tenants based on their marital status. </P>
<P> The state court held that enforcing the fair housing laws of Alaska and Anchorage -- which bar discrimination based on marital status -- did not deprive the landlord of his constitutional right to free exercise of his religion. </P>
