<DATELINE>ABUJA, Nigeria (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Nigeria's military government Wednesday charged opposition leader Moshood Abiola with treason two weeks after they arrested the wealthy businessman considered winner of last year's annulled presidential vote. </P>
<P> Abiola, detained after he declared himself Nigeria's president in defiance of the military rulers, pleaded not guilty to a three-count charge that carries a life sentence on conviction. </P>
<P> His arrest has prompted protests by pro-democracy groups and strike action in the west African nation's all-important oil industry. </P>
<P> Nigeria's major oil workers' union threatened Wednesday to start indefinite industrial action if the government did not meet its demands, which include restoring the scrapped election of June 1993 that Abiola is believed to have won. </P>
<P> A strike by that union could cripple the oil industry that earns Nigeria more than 90 percent of its foreign exchange. </P>
<P> The less powerful oil union NUPENG began a strike Monday, causing an acute shortage of fuel and long lines for fuel. </P>
<P> Abiola, who was brought to court in the inland capital Abuja in a police van, complained to the judge of mistreatment. </P>
<P> ``For 14 days I was humiliated by security agents who kept me in jail without providing me with any standard comfort,'' said the 57-year-old politician, holding back tears. </P>
<P> His lawyer asked for bail but Judge Mohammed Mustapha said he would rule on the request on July 14. </P>
<P> The court was packed with security men and only lawyers, journalists and Abiola's wife were admitted. </P>
<P> Abiola said he was brought to Abuja from the northern city of Kano on Tuesday night. His place of detention has been kept secret by the state, which has twice flouted a judge's order to produce him in court in Lagos. </P>
<P> ``You can see when I came to court I was dizzy. This is because of my health,'' Abiola told the judge. </P>
<P> ``A person of my status should be accorded some level of respect and I demand that,'' he added. </P>
<P> His lawyer, Alao Aka-Bashorun, said Abiola had been denied access to his family, solicitors and doctors. Judge Mustapha ordered that Abiola be allowed to see them. </P>
<P> As Abiola was driven off in a car from the court, about 200 supporters chanted ``Our President, we love you.'' </P>
<P> Abiola's arraignment is bound to further anger his supporters, who have mounted sporadic protests since his arrest. </P>
<P> Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, has been in crisis since last year when then president General Ibrahim Babangida annulled the election Abiola was poised to win. </P>
<P> Military ruler General Sani Abacha, who seized power last November during the anarchy unleashed by the annulment, has been under pressure from the opposition, pro-democracy groups and trade unions to surrender power to Abiola and restore democracy. </P>
