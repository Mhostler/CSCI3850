<P>  Foreign Minister Yohei Kono admitted Wednesday that Japan had considered its nuclear options in 1969, as a secret ministry report recently revealed, but he said it now strictly abides by a non-nuclear treaty. </P>
<P> ``It is a fact that before the signing of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), consideration was given at internal meetings to all possibilities and to their advantages and disadvantages,'' Kono said in a statement. </P>
<P> ``However, as is clear from the process that ensued, Japan ... acceded to the NPT as a non-nuclear weapon state, thereby clarifying anew its position of not possessing nuclear weapons in treaty terms.'' </P>
<P> The daily Mainichi Shimbun reported Monday that a secret ministry report indicated Japan had decided in 1969 to ensure it had the financial and technical potential to produce nuclear weapons without actually making them. </P>
<P> Japan signed the NPT in 1970, a year after the secret document was drafted as an internal ministry paper. Kono refused to comment on the content of the paper, but did not deny its existence. </P>
<P> ``In any event Japan, as the only nation to have experienced atomic devastation, will strictly uphold the three non-nuclear principles and observe its obligations under the NPT.'' </P>
<P> Japan has repeatedly denied it had any ambitions to become a nuclear military power, saying it adheres to the principles of not introducing, possessing or producing nuclear weapons. </P>
<P> The Mainichi Shimbun report triggered a hail of criticism from North Korea. </P>
<P> ``This secret document is clear proof that Japan had long planned to secretly arm itself with nuclear weapons,'' state-run Radio Pyongyang said in a broadcast Wednesday, monitored in Tokyo by the Radiopress news agency. </P>
<P> ``It showed for all to see the black nature of Japan as a nuclear criminal,'' the radio said. </P>
<P> North Korea has persistently accused Japan of secretly harboring nuclear ambitions. For its part, Japan has demanded that North Korea clear up suspicions that it was secretly building a nuclear arsenal. </P>
