<P>  Timothy Dalton, the former James Bond actor, won substantial damages for libel Thursday from a London newspaper that alleged he had cast a slur on the television sequel to ``Gone With The Wind.'' </P>
<P> The Daily Express alleged that Dalton, who played the starring role of Rhett Butler in the $45 million television show ``Scarlett,'' had spoken disparagingly of the series. </P>
<P> It had quoted him as saying: ``Frankly, I don't give a damn for Scarlett,'' echoing Butler's famous words in the blockbuster film. </P>
<P> Dalton accepted undisclosed libel damages, described as substantial by lawyers. </P>
<P> ``I am absolutely delighted at the outcome, particularly as charities are going to benefit from this,'' Dalton said outside the court. </P>
<P> ``As far as 'Scarlett' was concerned, I loved doing it and loved working with the people who were in it. I was also proud and happy it was such an enormous success.'' </P>
<P> Dalton's lawyer, Oscar Beuselinck, told the High Court in London that his client, succeeded as James Bond by Pierce Brosnan, had never made the remarks at the news conference on which the newspaper article was based. </P>
<P> The Express now accepted the article that appeared on July 23, 1994, was inaccurate and had apologized, he said. </P>
