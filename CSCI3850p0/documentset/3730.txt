<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Croatian President Franjo Tudjman on Thursday formally told the United Nations in a letter that he decided to end the mandate of more than 12,000 U.N. troops in his country on March 31. </P>
<P> In response, Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said he was ``gravely concerned about the risk of renewed hostilities should the U.N. peacekeepers be withdrawn from Croatia.'' </P>
<P> In his letter to Boutros-Ghali, Tudjman said: ``As President of the Republic of Croatia, I have the honour to inform you that the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) mandate is hereby terminated effective March 31, 1995...''. </P>
<P> The United Nations has more than 12,000 troops stationed in Croatia since 1992 and has its headquarters for the entire Balkan operation, which includes 23,000 troops in Bosnia, in the Croatian capital of Zagreb. </P>
<P> Tudjman said that the UNPROFOR only hindered Croatia's efforts to regain a third of its territory occupied by Serbs who fought Zagreb when it declared independence from Yugoslavia. </P>
<P> He said U.N. forces should leave the country by the end of June, three months after the mandate is terminated and that the United Nations could keep its headquarters in Zagreb, although U.N. officials said they were not certain if this would be the case. </P>
<P> ``Croatia finds the present situation in the occupied territories wholly unacceptable,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``Morever, given the present inefficient UNPROFOR mission, Croatia finds the continues presence of UNPROFOR in the occupied territories to be significantly counterproductive to the peace process,'' he added. </P>
<P> Tudjman's decision opens up the possiblity of a renewed war between Serbs and Croats. </P>
<P> Some diplomats fear that if this should happen then Bosnian Serbs would join the conflict and Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, who has cut off military aid to his fellow Serbs, would be under pressure to resupply them. </P>
<P> Boutros-Ghali reminded Tudjman that the U.N. played a ''decisive role in bringing a halt to the brutal war on Croatian soil three years ago'' and preventing a resumption of the fighting since then. </P>
<P> The U.N. mandate is Croatia has been renewed every six months and each time Croatia has made similar threats but backed down. This time, however, it appears his decision is final. </P>
<P> U.N. officials said that Tudjman's envoys, who were fanning out to various capitals in Europe and in the United States on Thursday, were not there to negotiate but to inform key allies of the decision. </P>
<P> Tudjman in his letter said that if negotiations with local Serbs were successful Croatia was willing to discuss appropriate international monitoring of ``confidence building mechanisms.'' </P>
<P> A senior U.N. official told reporters that the Croatia decision did not mean a pullout from Bosnia or an immediate ''domino effect'' but clearly the conflicts were interlinked. ''It is bad rather than catastrophic,'' he said. </P>
