<P>  Following are key quotes from a ceremony Monday dedicating the first border crossing linking Israel and Jordan. </P>
<P> -- ``We are sitting on an old minefield, which was cleared only three days ago. This is what divided Israel and Jordan for decades. This is the field in which death and destruction were sown. We are sitting at this time and at this place, all of us, Israelis and Jordanians, before the future.'' </P>
<P> -- ``Three days ago this was a wilderness, only sand and more sand. Today this place teems with new life. Three weeks ago the dream of peace was far away... Soon it will seem as though this is the way it has always been.'' </P>
<P> -- ``Friends say to us, 'The pace of events is too fast. We cannot keep up. Wait a moment.' Your Royal Highness, our friends in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, we have waited 46 years. We have gone through war, pain and suffering. To prevent further loss and so on, we cannot wait even one day more.'' </P>
<P> -- ``It looks that the walls of hostility are tumbling down before our eyes.'' </P>
<P></P>
<P> -- ``Now the war is over. Now peace will prevail. Today Israel and Jordan are lifting the spirits of a wounded region by reminding it of the courage and honor, the compassion and sacrifice that two peoples can demonstrate in the search for peace.'' </P>
<P> -- ``Here in the land of miracles, the rhetoric of peacemaking is giving way and being translated into reality. With the eyes of the world once more upon them, Israel and Jordan have acted with boldness and courage. A crossing point is open, a wall has come down.'' </P>
<P> -- ``We know that there is much work yet to be done. We know that the forces of hatred are using terror and violence to undermine our efforts. They must not and will not succeed. We must continue to push ahead until the goal of peace is achieved.'' </P>
<P> -- ``Without prejudice to the outcome of the negotiations on the delineation and demarcation of our common boundaries, the opening of this border gate demonstrates our joint commitment to make a concrete contribution to peacemaking.'' </P>
<P> -- ``Our region is the birthplace of civilization. It is the crossroads of different cultures where their interaction has produced a sophistication that has enthralled mankind throughout the ages. Henceforth, third-country citizens will be able to marvel at this precious heritage. It is only the first step in the long search to realize our vision of normal and harmonious good neighborliness. Let this gateway be a token of our resolve that soon our peoples will be able to share, exchange and marvel at their common legacy.'' </P>
<P> -- ``Let the opening of this border gate in this particular location mark the foundation stone on which we intend to build our common future.'' </P>
<P> He ended with a quote in Hebrew from the Bible, saying Israel and Jordan were ``turning the valley of troubles into a gate of hope.'' </P>
