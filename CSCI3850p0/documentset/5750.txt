<DATELINE>SLEPTSOVSK, Russia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Russian troops closed in on the last rebel stronghold in Chechnya's lowland Friday, surrounding the village of Bamut after pounding it with shells throughout the night. </P>
<P> The roar of explosions echoed through Sleptsovsk, on the border between Chechnya and Ingushetia, rattling windows and shaking buildings. Sleptsovsk is 15 miles from Bamut. </P>
<P> The capture of Bamut would effectively give Russian forces control over all the fertile and industrially-developed areas in northern and central Chechnya, although the rebels have set up bases in southern mountains ready to wage a guerrilla war. </P>
<P> In Moscow, the interior ministry said the commander of Russia's defense and interior ministry troops in the breakaway region had been removed. A ministry spokesman said outgoing commander Anatoly Kulikov was ``tired'' and needed to be replaced. </P>
<P> Tass said a new commanding officer, Mikhail Yegorov, had been appointed temporarily to cover for Kulikov's absence. Yegorov was previously in charge of the interior ministry's department dealing with organized crime. </P>
<P> The change in military command lines coincided with a fresh bout of criticism at home and abroad of the way Russia has conducted its four-month campaign to crush Chechnya's independence bid. </P>
<P> France condemned Russia Friday for what it called ``particularly violent attacks'' on Chechen civilians and repeated its demand for a truce and negotiations to end the conflict in the breakaway republic. </P>
<P> ``We condemn the serious violations of human rights and reiterate our call for a cease-fire and a negotiating process to reach a political solution,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Richard Duque told reporters. </P>
<P> Duque accused Moscow of breaking its promise to halt bombing raids on civilian areas and respect human rights. </P>
<P> ``Testimony that has reached us shows the pledges Russian authorities made to the European Union have not been kept, especially those concerning the cease-fire and the particularly violent attacks on the civilian population,'' he added. </P>
<P> Chechens say Russian soldiers massacred civilians in the western Chechen town of Samashki last week. </P>
<P> Officials from the International Committee of the Red Cross have said Russian troops killed at least 250 people, using ``disproportionate'' force to capture the town. Russia's interior ministry has denied the charge. </P>
<P> Moscow's troops have already seized most rebel strongholds in Chechnya, which declared itself independent of Moscow in 1991. Many towns in the breakaway region have been reduced to rubble in shelling and fighting and thousands of people have died. </P>
<P> Correspondents who visited Bamut before the latest assaults said it had been virtually abandoned by residents, although Chechen fighters were holed up in a concrete bunker in a disused missile site. </P>
<P> Itar-Tass news agency quoted officials at the Russian military headquarters near the border with Chechnya as saying Russian forces had surrounded Bamut Friday, but had not yet entered the village. </P>
<P> Interfax news agency quoted Chechen military sources as saying a Russian Su-25 fighter jet and two helicopters had been shot down Friday. The Russian military denied the charge. </P>
