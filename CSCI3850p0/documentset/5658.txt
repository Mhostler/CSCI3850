<P>  Authorities on the Cape Verde islands off West Africa authorized the release of a Bulgarian transport plane carrying 100 tons of arms for Ecuador, the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported Tuesday. </P>
<P> It quoted Defense Minister Ulpio Fernandes as telling a news conference in Cape Verde that the Antonov jet transport plane and its crew of 23, held on Sal island since Sunday, may leave later Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``Considering official confirmation of the destination of the material...the Cape Verde government decided to free the plane,'' Lusa quoted Fernandes as saying. </P>
<P> He said Cape Verde had received confirmation from Ecuador that the arms were destined for the South American country. </P>
<P> The arms were discovered when the plane made a stopover for fuel on Cape Verde, a former Portuguese colony 400 miles off the coast of Senegal. </P>
<P> Last month Portugal detained a Ukrainian transport plane carrying a clandestine arms shipment to South America when it landed to refuel at Lajes airbase on the Azores islands. </P>
<P> The Ukrainian plane's flight plan showed Quito, Ecuador as its final destination, but a Portuguese defense ministry official declined to say whether the arms were due to be delivered to the Ecuadorean government. </P>
<P> Peru and Ecuador fought a war earlier this year over a 48-mile stretch of jungle border. </P>
