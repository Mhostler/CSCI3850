<DATELINE>PHNOM PENH, May 3 (Reuters) </DATELINE>
<P>  Khmer Rouge guerrillas, backed by five tanks, pushed government army units back to a new frontline position in northwest Battambang province 36 km (22 miles) south of Cambodia's second biggest city, an army spokesman said on Wednesday. </P>
<P> The fighting is in Treng district on National Route 10, a dirt road linking Battambang in the north with Khmer Rouge-held Pailin, about 80 kms (49 miles) to the Southwest. </P>
<P> ``It's true we have retreated from Treng,'' said Ministry of Defence spokesman, Colonel Chum Sambath. </P>
<P> ``According to the latest report from the battlefield the Khmer Rouge used five tanks in the fighting,'' he said. </P>
<P> Sambath said the fighting had caused some displacement of local villagers but he was unable to give a precise figure. </P>
<P> A senior humanitarian official in Phnom Penh told Reuters on Wednesday he was sceptical about news reports that 10,000 villagers had been displaced by the fighting because Treng was such a sparsely populated area. </P>
<P> The war-ravaged district is littered with land mines and serves as the government's main frontline position facing the insurgent's main base in western Pailin. </P>
<P> Cambodian armed forces chief Lieutenant-General Ke Kim Yan told Reuters on Tuesday that reinforcements were being sent to Treng from Phnom Penh. </P>
<P> General Kim Yan said he was confident the government would soon regain control in the district and that the Khmer Rouge were incapable of holding any new territory. </P>
<P> The Khmer Rouge continue to fight a guerrilla war with the government in Phnom Penh despite U.N.-sponsored elections in May 1993 that were aimed at bringing decades of fighting and internal strife to an end. </P>
