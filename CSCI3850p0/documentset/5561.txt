<P>  Syria said Friday it had no intention of shutting down the Damascus offices of Palestinian guerrilla factions opposing Arab-Israeli peace. </P>
<P> ``There have been rumors in newspapers that Vice-President Abdel-Halim Khaddam told leaders of the Palestinian groups in Damascus they have to get ready to leave,'' Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara said in a television interview. </P>
<P> ``This report is baseless and devoid of truth,'' Shara told Beirut's private Future Television. The text of the interview was issued before the broadcast later Friday. </P>
<P> Shara said Damascus did not consider the 10 members of the alliance of radical Palestinian factions it hosts ``terrorist'' groups -- as they are branded by the United States and some European countries which have urged Damascus to close down their offices. </P>
<P> The alliance has vowed to wreck the 1993 PLO-Israeli peace pact and member groups, like Hamas, Islamic Jihad and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, have staged attacks which killed several Israelis since. </P>
<P> ``We cannot enter into an agreement leading to reconciliation with Israel and war with others,'' Shara said, adding Syria could not accept that ``someone dictate how it acts on its own soil.'' </P>
<P> Shara dodged a question on how Syria would deal with Lebanese Muslim guerrillas fighting Israeli troops in south Lebanon, once advance is achieved in peace talks with Israel. </P>
<P> He said no progress had been made on the Syrian-Israeli peace track, stalled over the extent of an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, security arrangements and future ties. </P>
