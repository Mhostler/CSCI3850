<P>  The Israeli justice ministry said on Wednesday it was probing the death of a Palestinian prisoner in hospital days after he was arrested on suspicion of belonging to the Islamic Hamas group. </P>
<P> Human rights groups said Abd a-Samed Harizat, 30, a handicapped computer expert from the West Bank town of Hebron, suffered brain damage during interrogation at a Jerusalem prison and was taken to Hadassah hospital where he died on Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``There is an investigation by the departmnent in charge of investigating complaints against police and Shin Bet,'' a justice ministry spokeswoman said, referring to Israel's secret police. </P>
<P> She said that the ministry had asked the Jerusalem District Court to order an autopsy on Harizat's body to determine the cause of death. The family refuses to have an autopsy, saying it is against Islamic teachings. </P>
<P> The Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas said in a statement issued on Tuesday that Harizat was killed by Israeli secret service interrogators operating under relaxed regulations to question suspects. It said it held Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin responsible for his death. </P>
<P> ``Hamas holds the terrorist Rabin and the Shin Bet gang of killers...responsible for the martyrdom of holy struggler Abd a-Samed Harizat and asserts that the torture of Palestinian inmates is an assassination and murder,'' it said. </P>
