<P>  South Africa's ambassador-designate to the United Nations denied Wednesday he misused Scandinavian aid money given his foundation to help poverty-stricken blacks. </P>
<P> ``I emphatically deny any personal involvement in the alleged misappropriation of funds,'' Allan Boesak, a veteran anti-apartheid campaigner, said in a statement released from Cape Town. </P>
<P> ``Whatever monies received over the years by way of either donations or a salary package were given on grounds of merit and agreement. I never asked for nor received any loans.'' </P>
<P> Scandinavian aid agencies have said they are looking into allegations of misuse of anti-apartheid funds donated to Boesak's Foundation for Peace and Justice (FPJ). </P>
<P> The foundation received $1.16 million over the past two years from the Lutheran state church aid bodies of Denmark, Sweden and Norway. </P>
<P> Boesak has been under pressure to withdraw from the U.N. post and a senior official of the Mandela's ruling ANC told Reuters that an announcment would be made soon. </P>
<P> Local press reports say Scandinavian aid agencies have alleged that Boesak's foundation lent one staff member about $200,000 for a house and that Boesak borrowed $28,575 toward the cost of his own luxury home. </P>
<P> Boesak said he was not aware of loans made by staff members to the extent claimed. </P>
