<DATELINE>TOKYO, April 8 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Japanese politicians made their final campaign pitches on Saturday, a day ahead of nationwide polls to elect prefectural governors and assemblies. </P>
<P> A low voter turnout has been projected for Sunday's contests, which are seen as a litmus test for the coalition government of Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama. </P>
<P> At stake are the governorships of Tokyo, Osaka and 11 other prefectures, 43 of the nation's 47 prefectural assemblies and 10 of the nation's 12 largest municipal assemblies. </P>
<P> In many of Sunday's races, Murayama's Socialist Party and their coalition partner the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) are backing candidates that are also supported by the New Frontier Party (NFP), the main parliamentary opposition group. </P>
<P> In only three of 13 gubernatorial contests, all in rural areas, will there be direct confrontation between Murayama's coalition and the NFP. </P>
<P> Murayama's administration has seen its approval ratings slump after its sluggish handling of the Kobe earthquake in January and its inability to implement meaningful policies to cut red tape and streamline powerful state bureaucracies. </P>
<P> On Friday, a senior NFP leader suggested the party would try to bring down Murayama's government for its failure to swiftly enact policies to halt the yen's rapid appreciation. </P>
<P> Top officials in the LDP, ostensibly Murayama's allies, have dropped hints that disastrous results in Sunday's polls and in city assembly elections on April 23, could make it necessary to dissolve parliament and call general elections. </P>
