<P>  A self-proclaimed Zambian witch confessed Thursday to killing seven of her children with the aid of a demon and eating their flesh in black magic rituals inherited from her mother, police said. </P>
<P> ``Filita Malishipa appeared in court today,'' North-Western province police chief Nungu Sasassali told Reuters. </P>
<P> ``She confessed she killed seven of her children through ...witchcraft and showed the court some of the charms she used, including a lot of herbs and other items,'' he said. </P>
<P> Malishipa, who is in her late 60s and comes from the remote town of Solwezi in the east African nation, handed herself in to police saying she was remorseful and wanted to turn away from evil, Sasassali said. </P>
<P> She is being tried under outdated witchcraft laws which carry a maximum punishment of a few cents fine. She has still to be sentenced. </P>
<P> Sasassali said police could not charge her with murder because it is ``very difficult to prove this under the circumstances'' and police believed the killings had taken place many years ago. </P>
<P> Malishipa told the court she killed seven of her children with the aid of her husband using a demon called ``tuyobela'' -- an invisible creature that was unleased on the victims. </P>
<P> The couple ate some of their children's flesh as part of the rites, she testified. </P>
