<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Georgia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Chip Beck, who finished a disappointing second two years ago, took advantage of a rain-softened Augusta National golf course Thursday to lead the first round of the Masters by one stroke. </P>
<P> Beck, who was runner-up to Bernhard Langer in 1993, shot a four-under-par 68 to lead five other players by one shot with about one-quarter of the 86-man field in the clubhouse. </P>
<P> The 38-year-old Beck had it as low as six under par after a birdie on the 15th hole, but he gave back shots on the 16th and 18th holes. </P>
<P> ``The two bogeys were unfortunate, but you can't expect not to make mistakes on this golf course,'' Beck said. </P>
<P> ``Still, seven birdies is really something to draw from,'' he added. </P>
<P> Beck's longest birdie putt was from 20 feet and he chipped in for birdie on the par-three fourth. </P>
<P> He also saved par with a ``real nice'' 15-footer at the 485- yard 13th, where he drove into woods on the left and had to take a drop from a stream. </P>
<P> Beck, who was roundly criticized for not going for the green on the 500-yard 15th in the 1993 final round laid up there again. But he hit a sand wedge to six feet and sank the putt for birdie. </P>
<P> The rain softened up a frightfully hard course, answering the prayers of many players who feared they would not be able to stop their approach shots on the greens, which were like billiard tables earlier in the week. </P>
<P> Former champion Ian Woosnam of Britain, Americans Hale Irwin, Scott Hoch and David Edwards and Australian Wayne Grady all took advantage of the favorable conditions to shoot three- under 69s. </P>
<P> ``The rain slowed things down a little bit,'' Hoch said after posting the first 69 of the day. ``If you hit it in the right spot on the green, you can make birdie.'' </P>
<P> Hoch made four birdies. His only blemish was a three-putt at number 10 -- the same hole where he missed a two-footer in 1989 that would have won a playoff with Nick Faldo. </P>
<P> ``They had my 1989 pin placement there,'' Hoch said, only half joking. </P>
<P> ``They knew it was going to rain so they used some placements they don't normally use,'' Hoch said. ``Some were impossible to get to. They had some helacious pins out there.'' </P>
<P> Irwin, a three-time winner of the U.S. Open, had the lead all alone at four under par until he bogeyed the final hole. </P>
<P> ``I tried not to get too aggressive,'' said Irwin, who turns 50 in June. ``I just tried to play within myself and it paid off until the last hole -- my only bogey.'' </P>
<P> After a poor drive at the 405-yard closing hole, Irwin hit a ``fat'' two iron approach into a front bunker -- ``from jail to prison,'' he said. </P>
<P> Edwards, in only his fifth visit to Augusta in 11 years, also could have held the lead alone, but he bogeyed the last two holes. Both times he failed to get up and down from greenside bunkers. </P>
<P> Woosnam, who won here in 1991, also had it four under par after birdies on the 11th and 13th holes, but he bogeyed the famous 15th and then parred in. </P>
<P> All the players agreed that the rain, which started falling during the night and got heavier during the day, made the 6,925-yard, par-72 course play far easier than earlier in the week. </P>
<P> ``The golf course is much different than in practice rounds,'' Irwin said. ``The greens were soft, very receptive. Approaches were coming to a stop, even coming back.'' </P>
