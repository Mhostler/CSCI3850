<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Despite a media blitz, most residents of Los Angeles County -- the pool from which O.J. Simpson's jury will be chosen -- remain unsure of his guilt or innocence and believe he will get a fair trial, according to a poll published Monday. </P>
<P> In a survey taken by the Los Angeles Times on the eve of Simpson's closely watched trial, half of those polled said they had not formed an opinion on whether the former football great murdered his ex-wife and a friend. </P>
<P> But 34 percent said they are inclined to believe he is guilty and 16 percent believe he is innocent. </P>
<P> Even so, only 18 percent of respondents say they are certain of Simpson's guilt and just 9 percent are sure of his innocence. The Hall of Fame running back has declared himself ``absolutely 100 percent not guilty'' of charges that he murdered Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, who were found stabbed to death on June 13. </P>
<P> Nearly three-fifths of respondents said they are closely following news of the case, and even 46 percent of the people who say they are ``sick to death'' of the story also indicate that they are keeping a close eye on developments. </P>
<P> In a case that has taken on strong racial overtones -- Simpson is black and his two alleged victims were white -- blacks are more supportive of Simpson, with more than two-thirds saying they are very or somewhat sympathetic. Only 34 percent of whites said they were sympathetic. </P>
<P> The poll also showed blacks viewing the entire spectacle much more skeptically than whites or other ethnic groups. </P>
<P> Substantially more blacks than whites say they are certain Simpson is not guilty -- 28 percent for blacks versus ony five percent for whites. </P>
<P> And 46 percent of black respondents say they believe the court proceedings thus far have been biased against Simpson.  ``If he had killed a black, I don't think they would have gone through all this,'' one black respondent, Beulah Fields, a 56-year-old school employee, told pollsters. </P>
<P> In a case that has focused heavily on how the football legend beat and abused Nicole Brown Simpson, exposure to domestic violence did not appear to be a powerful influence in shaping people's opinions. </P>
<P> Women were more sympathetic toward Simpson than men, and even those who have had a close experiences with domestic abuse through family or friends are no more likely to view Simpson's case more negatively than others, the poll found. </P>
