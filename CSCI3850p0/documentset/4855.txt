<P>  Qatar, which fought against Baghdad in the 1991 Gulf War, said Saturday Iraq had made positive steps towards meeting U.N. demands, warranting the lifting of sanctions imposed on it. </P>
<P> ``Iraq has taken positive steps to abide by U.N. resolutions,'' Qatar's Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani said at a joint news conference at Doha airport with his Iraqi counterpart Mohammad Saeed al-Sahaf. </P>
<P> ``We in Qatar respect U.N. resolutions but we can't understand what is delaying the lifting of sanctions which are hurting the people of Iraq,'' Sheikh Hamad said before Sahaf left Qatar for neighbouring Muscat. </P>
<P> Western diplomats in the Gulf say Sahaf's visits to Qatar and Oman are expected to anger their regional allies Saudi Arabia and Kuwait which strongly oppose any easing of sanctions imposed on Iraq since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. </P>
<P> Sahaf's visits are the first to a Gulf Arab state by a high- ranking Iraqi official in nearly five years. </P>
<P> The need to maintain the Iraq sanctions will figure high on the agenda of a meeting in Saudi Arabia Sunday between Gulf Arab foreign ministers and Secretary of State Warren Christopher. </P>
<P> Sahaf told reporters in Doha that Iraq believes that the majority of the 15-member Security Council was in favor of lifting the sanctions but refused to say when he expected the world body to ease or lift the embargo. </P>
<P> ``When and how long it will take? I would prefer not to predict but to tell you that it is a process and this process has already reached the final stage,'' he said in English. </P>
<P> The U.N. is set to review the sanctions in April and the United States has said it was prepared to use its veto right if the Security Council moved to ease or lift the sanctions. </P>
<P> Last month U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Madeleine Albright toured several Security Council member states, including Oman, to rally support for continued sanctions against Iraq. </P>
