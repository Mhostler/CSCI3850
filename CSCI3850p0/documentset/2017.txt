<P>  Defense Secretary William Perry Friday threatened Iraq with military action if Baghdad did not withdraw more than a division of elite Republican Guard troops from Iraq's southern border with Kuwait. </P>
<P> ``We are talking about military action. But I won't go beyond that and describe what form of military action,'' he said in the most direct U.S. threat in a crisis involving Washington's demand for Iraq to end a buildup of forces near the emirate it invaded in 1990. </P>
<P> The United States has already moved hundreds of warplanes, warships with Tomahawk cruise missiles and thousands of troops to the Gulf since tensions rose over the Iraqi troop buildup. </P>
<P> Perry told reporters flying with him to Kuwait from Dhahran in Saudi Arabia that U.S. intelligence indicated on Friday that the Republican Guard troops had stopped some 45 miles south of the 32nd parallel instead of following other Iraqi troops northwards out of the area. </P>
<P> ``It looks like they might be digging in there. A more optimistic possibility is that they are just stopping there overnight,'' the Secretary said. </P>
<P> ``If they are digging in, we still have some problems ahead of us because we are not satisfied with that as complying with what they have promised to do.'' </P>
<P> In a statement on arrival in Kuwait on the second day of a three-day Gulf visit, Perry said the United States would not slow down its own military deployment or begin removing troops if the Republican Guards remained in place. </P>
<P> ``If the Iraqis remain in the south, we will expand our current deployment, and we will consult our allies about the additional application of force as an appropriate response to the threat posed by Iraq,'' he said. </P>
<P> The secretary said Thursday that a U.S. buildup in the region would be halted at 30,000 troops within a week and those troops could begin moving out of the Gulf shortly -- but only after Iraq completed its withdrawal from the border. </P>
<P> Perry said it would be clear in a day or so whether Iraq intended to move the troops northward or not. </P>
<P> ``This is very recent information. I think perhaps after a time of a day or so, it will not be ambiguous. Tomorrow at this time we ought to know.'' </P>
<P> Perry met in Dhahran with Marine Lt.-Gen. Richard Neal, deputy commander of the U.S. Central Command and chief of American forces in the Gulf. </P>
<P> In Kuwait, he visited U.S. troops at a base neaer the city. </P>
<P> In Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, earlier Friday the secretary also told reporters the United States was authorized under current U.N. resolutions to bar certain Iraqi troops and armor from southern Iraq in the future to prevent any further threat from Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein to moderate Gulf states. </P>
<P> ``The United Nations already has a resolution demanding that Iraq not take provocative or hostile action and we consider the actions they have taken in the last week have been provocative and hostile,'' he said. </P>
<P> A senior U.S. defense official, who asked not to be identified, told reporters traveling with Perry earlier Friday that Washington planned to declare a ``no-drive'' zone to keep Iraqi heavy armor and Republican Guard troops out of southern Iraq and will police these zones with the threat of air strikes. </P>
<P> ``I don't know whether you want to call it a decree on our part, or a directive, or an ultimatum ... I think you have to assume we are not going to negotiate with Saddam Hussein over the terms of a no-drive zone,'' said the official, who added that U.N. approval would not be necessary for such a step. </P>
<P> The official spoke after Perry met late Thursday with Saudi King Fahd, who was reported to have expressed support for the idea of a buffer zone to protect Kuwait from another attack like the one that started the 1991 Gulf War. </P>
