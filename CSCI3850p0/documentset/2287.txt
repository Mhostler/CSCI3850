<P>  The University of Maryland will go the U.S. Supreme Court to appeal a court ruling that would effectively eliminate a scholarship program for black students at the university, a spokesman said Friday. </P>
<P> ``Our intent is to appeal to the Supreme Court, which is our only recourse,'' said Roland King, director of the office of public information at the university. </P>
<P> ``It's something the university feels very strongly about because the scholarhsip has been very effective in addressing underepresentation of African-Americans at the University of Maryland,'' he said. </P>
<P> The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit Thursday denied the university's motion for rejudgement against Daniel Podberesky, who is seeking $35,000 in scholarship money be believes he was denied because of his race. </P>
<P> Podberesky, who filed his suit four years ago, graduated in May and is now a medical student at the university. He is part-Hispanic, local newspapers reported. </P>
<P> Podberesky could not be reached for comment. </P>
<P> The original ruling was in favor of the university but Podberesky appealed and received a favorable ruling. </P>
<P> ``This has major implications for race-based scholarhips across the country,'' King said. ``If this ruling were allowed to stand, it would effectively remove those designated scholarhips from all colleges and universities,'' King said. </P>
<P> The program, known as the Benjamin Banneker Scholarship program, currently has about 140 recipients. </P>
<P> It was created in 1972 in response to federal desegregation mandates and provides full tuition, room, board and books to about 30 to 40 new students a year. </P>
