<P>  Looting broke out in abandoned parts of Burundi's capital Bujumbura where up to 30 people were killed in ethnic clashes between Hutus and Tutsis this week, but authorities said Friday calm was being restored. </P>
<P> ``Now is not the time to count the dead,'' said Appolinaire Sahabo, administrative chief of the troubled Bwiza suburb where most of the violence has been concentrated. </P>
<P> ``My priority is to make the Hutus and foreigners who abandoned their houses and goods which risk being destroyed by criminals to return,'' he added. </P>
<P></P>
<P> ``For those who may still be afraid, I would like to say that administrative and security officials from Bwiza will pick them up and accompany them to their homes.'' </P>
<P> Dozens of government troops patrolled Bwiza, allowing traffic to enter the northwest district but not permitting people trying to flee in cars piled with their possessions, witnesses said. </P>
<P> Outside Bwiza, markets opened and taxis were back on the street after a dusk-to-dawn curfew imposed from Wednesday night appeared to have helped in restoring calm. </P>
<P> Thursday, the U.N. Security Council called for a halt to violence in Burundi, fearing a repeat of the mass killings that gripped neighboring Rwanda earlier this year. </P>
<P> Burundi spiralled into chaos in October 1993 when renegade Tutsi soldiers murdered popularly-elected Hutu president Melchior Ndadaye. The coup failed but tens of thousands of Hutus and Tutsis died in tit-for-tat killings. </P>
