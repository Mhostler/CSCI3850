<DATELINE>SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Bosnian government army ended a blockade of a U.N. barracks in central Sarajevo Monday after the United Nations said it would investigate the death of a government soldier, officials said. </P>
<P> Anti-tank mines were removed from the entrance to the Marshal Tito barracks, housing about 800 French and 500 Ukrainian troops, and Bosnian army soldiers armed with portable anti-tank weapons dispersed. </P>
<P> ``The U.N.'s freedom of movement has been restored,'' said U.N. spokesman Maj. Guy Vinet. ``I don't know if the problem was solved but a joint commission was set up to investigate the matter this afternoon,'' he added. </P>
<P> The Muslim-led army has accused an unknown U.N. soldier of killing one of its men by throwing a hand grenade out of a window while drunk. </P>
<P> The Tito barracks, former Sarajevo headquarters for the old Yugoslav national army and badly damaged by shellfire, is shared by units of the Bosnian army and U.N. detachments. </P>
<P> Earlier U.N. spokesman Alexander Ivanko denied U.N. personnel were responsible for the Bosnian soldier's death. </P>
<P> The six-hour standoff began as a four-month truce expired at noon. The city was initially calm with only the sound of occasional small-arms rounds echoing around the hills but snipers later killed two women in government-held sectors. </P>
