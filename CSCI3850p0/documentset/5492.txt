<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Judge Lance Ito probably thought he had seen it all at the O.J. Simpson double murder trial, but Wednesday he learned otherwise. </P>
<P> That was when a male spectator, dressed in bright orange and yellow women's clothing, had to be removed from the courtroom after causing a loud disturbance in the back row of the gallery. </P>
<P> The cross-dresser, who calls himself the Rev. Will B. King, had been seen at the trial before, notably one day several weeks ago when those sitting near him realized -- by sense of smell -- that he had urinated in his seat. </P>
<P> But never before had the man, a fixture in courts and council chambers in Los Angeles and Orange counties, turned up in drag. </P>
<P> It was perhaps a measure of just how far things had gone that King's appearance at the trial Wednesday caused barely a ripple from regulars, despite his unusual attire: A bright orange and yellow blouse, orange skirt, white fishnet stockings and heavy makeup. On his feet were one white and one black boot. </P>
<P> Courtroom deputies also took little notice of King, simply telling him to remove his sunglasses before taking a seat. </P>
<P> But halfway through the morning session, King was heard loudly asking his neighbor to move off his skirt. No response was heard from the man, and deputies took little notice. </P>
<P> Then Ito and the attorneys assembled at a sidebar conference and King became even louder, demanding to know why his neighbor had threatened to ``sock me in the face.'' </P>
<P></P>
<P> ``I'm not doing nothing,'' he said as the bailiffs worked their way toward him. ``He's telling me he's going to sock me in the face.'' </P>
<P> Ito then interrupted the sidebar, exhorting deputies to ''get him out'' as King continued to argue. </P>
<P></P>
<P> ``Ladies and gentlemen, obviously the jury is to disregard any disruption in the audience,'' Ito said with a smile, adding ''I think that particular incident spoke for itself.'' </P>
