<DATELINE>LAGOS, Nigeria (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Nigerian police have arrested the fired leader of a striking oil workers' union, a colleague said Sunday, the latest detention in a crackdown on opponents of the military government. </P>
<P> Former NUPENG general secretary Frank Kokori has been a powerful force behind the six-week-old strike aimed at forcing the military to hand over power to presidential claimant Moshood Abiola, who is now on trial for treason. </P>
<P> ``They arrested Kokori around 1 a.m. Saturday,'' said Wariebi Agamene, former president of the union. </P>
<P> Kokori and Agamene were dismissed by military ruler General Sani Abacha Wednesday along with leaders of another oil union and the umbrella labor federation. </P>
<P> The strike has put pressure on Abacha, who seized power in November amid the confusion caused when the previous military regime annulled a June 1993 presidential election which business tycoon Abiola was believed to have won. </P>
<P> Abiola was arrested after declaring himself president in June. His detention provoked street protests as well as the strikes and in a broadcast on Wednesday Abacha threatened tough action against his opponents. </P>
<P> Nearly a dozen people were arrested nationwide in a swoop Friday but many others were later released. </P>
<P> Among those still detained are Anthony Enahoro, vice chairman of the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO), a 71-year-old politician who was in the forefront of the push for independence from Britain in the 1950s. </P>
<P> Two days after NUPENG began the strike Kokori's family and associates claimed he was arrested. But he reappeared after three weeks to say he had gone underground to evade police. </P>
<P> ``This time it is real,'' Agamene told Reuters on Sunday. </P>
<P> In his broadcast, Abacha ordered the striking oil workers back to work. Offering no concessions, he made clear his government would not stop Abiola's treason trial. </P>
<P> Human rights groups estimate nearly 100 people have been killed in earlier riots demanding Abiola's release. </P>
<P> Abacha said he was taking stern action because the government could not allow the economy to be ruined. </P>
<P> Oil exports contribute more than 90 percent of the Nigeria's foreign exchange earnings. The strike has reduced crude oil output by about 20 percent and disrupted fuel supplies, with devastating consequences for other businesses and transportation. </P>
