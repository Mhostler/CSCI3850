<P>  For the second consecutive year, Turkey and Greece appeared to be the biggest importers of tanks in 1993, according to the latest U.N. arms register published Thursday. </P>
<P> The register, appearing for the second year, lists replies from more than 80 countries concerning their import and/or export of seven different categories of weapons. About half of them reported neither imports nor exports. </P>
<P> The United States registered the export of 932 battle tanks to Turkey and 671 to Greece, while Germany said it sent 85 tanks to Turkey and 54 to Greece, including 22 which arrived only this year. This would give a total of 1,017 imported tanks for Turkey and 725 for Greece. </P>
<P> However, Turkey, in its list of arms imports, said it received only 454 tanks from the United States and 85 from Germany, for a total of 539. Greece said it obtained 324 from the United States, 54 from Germany and 72 from the Netherlands, for a total of 450. </P>
<P> In last year's U.N. arms register, Turkey and Greece said they each imported more than 400 battle tanks during 1992, while arms manufacturing countries reported exporting a total of nearly 600 tanks to each. </P>
<P> The discrepancies are likely to stem mainly from differences in the perceived dates of transfer and in the definition of what constitutes a reportable transfer. </P>
<P> The register is published annually in accordance with a 1991 General Assembly resolution calling on U.N. members to provide details of weapons transfers in hopes that greater openness would enhance confidence, promote stability and help ease tensions. </P>
<P> The British American Security Information Council (BASIC), an independent research organisation with offices in Washington and London, said the U.N. register showed the United States remained the world's dominant arms exporter. </P>
<P> Its exports during 1993 included 2,393 tanks, 832 armored combat vehicles, 296 large caliber artillery systems, 96 combat aircraft, 75 attack helicopters and 2,899 missiles or missile launchers. </P>
<P> BASIC's deputy director, Natalie Goldring, commented: ``The United States is driving the international arms market, and in some regions is engaged in an arms race with itself.'' </P>
<P> Germany was said to be the next largest supplier of major conventional weapons, exporting 242 tanks, 383 armored combat vehicles, 10 large calibre artillery systems, 93 combat aircraft, 24 ships and 1,020 missiles or missile launchers. </P>
<P> Russia said its exports included 100 tanks to Iran and 20 to Angola; 357 armoured fighting vehicles (35 to Angola, 115 to Turkey, 80 to Iran, 95 to the United Arab Emirates, 12 to Bangladesh, and 20 to Uzbekistan); 14 large caliber artillery systems, to Angola; 33 combat aircraft (28 to Hungary and five to Slovakia); and one ship (to Iran). </P>
<P> China's exports included 35 tanks to Pakistan; and 77 combat aircraft (25 to Iran, 40 to Pakistan and 12 to Myanmar). </P>
<P> Britain said it exported 21 tanks, to Nigeria; 72 armored combat vehicles (seven to the Philippines and 65 to Saudia Arabia); 29 combat aircraft (two to Finland, one to Oman, 10 to South Korea and 16 to the United Arab Emirates); three ships (two to Pakistan and one to Portugal); and 526 missiles or missile launchers (198 to Saudi Arabia and 328 to the United Arab Emirates). </P>
