<DATELINE>LAGOS, Nigeria (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Six workers were killed and four were missing following a blaze on a Nigerian offshore oil platform operated by the U.S. firm Mobil, company spokesmen said Thursday. </P>
<P> The Ubit production platform in the Atlantic Ocean, about 22 miles from the Qua Iboe terminal, caught fire at about 3 p.m. (9 a.m. EST) Wednesday, Mobil spokesman Tom Iyamu said in Lagos. </P>
<P> ``Six people were confirmed dead, four are missing and 19 injured,'' he said. </P>
<P> Lloyds Shipping Intelligence reported from London that the six dead included Nigerians and foreigners. </P>
<P> The News Agency of Nigeria, quoting unnamed sources, said the fire may have been caused by a gas leak during a welding job. It said most of the dead were technicians on the platform. </P>
<P> Nine of the injured had been brought to Lagos while the other 10 were being treated in hospitals in the nearby Eket town, southeastern Nigeria, the agency said. </P>
<P> Iyamu said 85,000 barrels of daily crude oil production had been shut off to put out the fire and that Mobil was stopping the flow pending the findings of an investigation into the cause of the blaze which was extinguished. </P>
<P> He said the 85,000 barrels represented about one fifth of Mobil's daily output in Nigeria, a member of OPEC, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. </P>
<P> A spokesman for French engineering firm Bouygues, whose Bouygues Offshore unit was working on the platform, said in Paris that the casualties almost certainly included some of its employees. Lloyds said five of the confirmed dead were Mobil employees. </P>
<P> A Lagos shipping source described the fire as ``a major, major catastrophe.'' </P>
<P> The Qua Iboe oil platform was the largest in the offshore field operated by Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited, a joint venture between Mobil Corporation of the United States and state-owned Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). </P>
