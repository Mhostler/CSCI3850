<P>  Western scientists have warned that a second catastrophic explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in the Ukraine could happen at any time, The Observer newspaper said Sunday. </P>
<P> The British weekly said it obtained a report, suppressed by European Commission officials, which contained the warning about Chernobyl, site of the world's worst nuclear accident in 1986. </P>
<P> ``In a secret report...they say pillars supporting the damaged reactor building are in imminent danger of bursting,'' The Observer said. </P>
<P> ``Their collapse could send debris crashing through the concrete sarcophagus built round the irradiated, burnt-out remains of Chernobyl's Reactor No. 4; or rubble could plunge into Reactor 3 immediately next to it, which is still fully operational, triggering another core meltdown.'' </P>
<P> The newspaper said the report was being suppressed by European Commission officials battling with Ukrainian politicians over the site's future and price tag of a cleanup. </P>
<P> Western governments and the scientists say the whole plant should be shut down immediately. But Ukrainian officials are refusing until Western cash and expertise are available to help build replacements. </P>
<P> ``It's a scandal that this is being shrouded in secrecy when the safety of Europe's public is at risk,'' a source near the investigation told The Observer. </P>
<P> An explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in 1986 contaminated much of the continent. Medical experts say the disaster has caused an increase in the number of cases of cancer in children and physical deformities. </P>
<P> Fire and the blast in Chernobyl's fourth reactor spewed radiation over most of Europe and Ukrainian officials say 8,000 people have since died as a result. </P>
<P> The plant's second reactor was closed after a fire in 1991. </P>
<P> President Leonid Kuchma said earlier this month the world community had to work out how to close down Chernobyl but had to take account of Ukraine's economic troubles. </P>
<P> In Paris last week the World Bank said rich nations should offer enough cash to plug a hole in Ukraine's funding needs for this year, but the European Union was holding out for a deal on closing down Chernobyl. </P>
