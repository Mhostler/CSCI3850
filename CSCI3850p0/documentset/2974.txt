<P>  Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien said Friday that Quebec's popular separatist leader, Lucien Bouchard, should be able to return to work in four or five months' after having a leg amputated. </P>
<P> ``I am happy to learn that he is in a better condition than he was a few hours ago,'' Chretien told reporters after meeting French President Francois Mitterrand on a visit to Paris. </P>
<P> ``I think he will be able to return to work in four or five months' time and I am happy for him,'' he added. </P>
<P> Bouchard has been stricken by a rare flesh-eating disease, but doctors said earlier Friday that they had stopped the spread of the deadly infection after amputating his left leg Thursday. </P>
<P> One of his doctors told a news conference that Bouchard's condition improved overnight and the spread of the disease was halted after further surgery on his abdomen and thorax. </P>
