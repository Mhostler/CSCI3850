<P>  Three key opposition factions announced Friday they would boycott the work of the lower house of the Russian parliament until an incident involving ultra-nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky had been resolved. </P>
<P> Zhirinovsky told the State Duma that he had not been allowed to make a stopover in the city of Kemerovo on his way to North Korea earlier this week and he announced his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) party would boycott the session. The Communists and Agrarians then announced they would join his protest. </P>
<P> Kemerovo airport authorities have said that the landing strip was damaged and they rerouted Zhirinovsky's plane to another Siberian city of Tomsk. Zhirinovsky insists that the runway was in fit condition and claims the ban was politically motivated. </P>
<P> An enraged Zhirinovsky said the incident was the last straw in a government-orchestrated campaign against his party whose unexpected success in parliamentary elections last December dramatically transformed Russia's political scene. </P>
<P> He said that the LDP was also pulling out of President Boris Yeltsin's pact on civil accord which the Kremlin leader brought in last April and which was intended to end outright confrontation between rival policial forces. </P>
<P> Zhirinovsky's Duma faction walked out of the chamber. The Communist and Agrarian factions stayed in but said they would not take part in any voting until the incident was investigated and those responsible punished. The three factions control over 180 seats in the 450-seat chamber and their absence will effectively block passage of any legislation. </P>
