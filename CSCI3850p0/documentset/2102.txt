<P>  Raul Julia, the acclaimed stage and screen actor known for his brooding looks and resonant voice, was in a New York hospital in critical condition after suffering a stroke, his agent said Wednesday. </P>
<P> The 54-year-old Puerto Rican-born actor suffered a stroke Sunday morning, said his agent Jeff Hunter. </P>
<P> ``It was absolutely unexpected,'' Hunter told Reuters. </P>
<P> Julia starred as the father in the hit comedy ``The Addams Family'' and its sequel ``Addams Family Values'', as well as in the film version of the South American novel ``Kiss of the Spider Woman'' as the political prisoner Valentin. </P>
<P> He began his career as a prolific Shakespearean stage actor, starring in the New York Shakespeare Festival's ``Macbeth'' (1966) and ``Othello'' (1979) and opposite Meryl Streep in ``The Taming of the Shrew'' (1978). </P>
<P> He also appeared alongside Harrison Ford in the film thriller ``Presumed Innocent'' as attorney Sandy Stern, and with Clint Eastwood in ``The Rookie''. </P>
<P> In one of his latest appearances, Julia played the martyred Brazilian rainforest activist Chico Mendes in a recent HBO film. </P>
<P> Julia, who arrived in New York from Puerto Rico in 1964 and won acclaim as a versatile stage performer, became known to American filmgoers as an urbane character actor. </P>
