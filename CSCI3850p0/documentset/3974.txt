<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Republican National Committee Chairman Haley Barbour Thursday brushed off President Clinton's call on members of Congress to stop taking gifts from lobbyists. </P>
<P> ``I don't think it makes a hill of beans to the American people, if we keep our word and do what we said we're going to do,'' he said in an interview on Fox Morning News. </P>
<P> Republicans, who won control of both houses of Congress in November for the first time in 40 years, are trying to write into law their ``Contract with America,'' a blueprint of conservative reforms involving welfare reform, balancing the budget and shrinking the government, among other things. </P>
<P> In his State of the Union address Tuesday night, Clinton had urged lawmakers to voluntarily give up lobbyists' gifts even in the absence of legislation on the matter. In its last session, Congress stopped short of passing comprehensive curbs on lobbying. </P>
<P> The president's suggestion triggered charges of hypocrisy from Senate Republican leader Bob Dole, who pointed out Wednesday that Clinton himself had been accepting lobbyists' gifts for his own legal defense fund. Dole branded Clinton's remarks ``a cheap shot.'' </P>
<P> Hours later, Clinton, apparently bowing to Dole's argument, ordered his fund to stop accepting lobbyists' contributions. </P>
<P> The fund was set up last June to help the president and his wife Hillary pay personal lawyers in the Whitewater investigation and in a lawsuit alleging Clinton sexually harassed a former Arkansas state worker when he was governor. </P>
<P> But Barbour said he was still not entirely satisfied with the very idea of Clinton's defense fund, though it has always refused contributions from corporations, political action committees, labor unions and limited individuals to contributions of $1,000. </P>
<P> ``It's a real thing here about the president's defense fund and the general propriety of that at all,'' he said. </P>
<P> The Presidential Legal Expense Trust is scheduled to release a report on its first six months of contributions next week. </P>
<P> Although then-White House counsel Lloyd Cutler had estimated the Clintons' legal bills could run as high as $2 million when the fund was established, the fund has so far raised less than $1 million, according to published and broadcast reports. </P>
