<DATELINE>WASHINGTON, Feb 21 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  U.S. officials Tuesday rejected the idea of lifting sanctions on Belgrade before it recognized Bosnia and Croatia, but said they were still pursuing a deal with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. </P>
<P> The officials told reporters they did not believe Milosevic had dismissed out of hand a new big-power offer to suspend U.N. sanctions temporarily on Yugoslavia if it recognized existing Bosnian and Croatian borders. </P>
<P> State Department spokeswoman Christine Shelly said officials of the five-nation ``Contact Group'' dealing with the Bosnia crisis would visit Belgrade later this week to pursue discussions with the Serbian leader. </P>
<P> Serbia said Monday the international community must relax the crippling sanctions before Belgrade could consider latest peace proposals. Official media said Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic delivered that message to Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev over the weekend. </P>
<P> ``(Milosevic) would like complete, unconditional removal of sanctions after which then, he says, he's prepared to address other issues. Well that's not a sequencing which is acceptable to us,'' a U.S. official said. </P>
<P> But the official, who asked not to be identified, added: ''It's not my impression that what happened so far is an absolute, categoric 'no.''' </P>
<P> ``We're continuing to work on it and consider a number of ways that we can still try to get the same thing, which is to get recognition,'' the official said. </P>
<P> ``I don't think we consider that the exchange on this is over yet. We will continue to discuss this and see whether or not we might be able to get a more positive response.'' </P>
<P> Shelly did not say which Contact Group officials would go to Belgrade or on which day. The group, consisting of the United States, Russia, Britain, France and Germany, leads diplomatic efforts to try to end the three-year Bosnian war. </P>
<P> Shelly told a briefing the group was encouraged by Serbian efforts to close its border with Bosnia to choke off supplies to Bosnian Serbs fighting the Muslim-led Bosnian government, although U.S. officials say the flow has not stopped. </P>
<P> She said public and private statements suggested that Milosevic ``is certainly looking at formulas whereby he might be able to get some relief from the economic sanctions which are in place. </P>
<P> ``There may be a greater willingness now than there was some time in the past to try to find a peaceful solution to the crisis,'' Shelly added. </P>
<P> The Contact Group proposal, framed last week, offered Serbia a two-month suspension of sanctions if it recognized Bosnia, Croatia and other ex-Yugoslav republics and further tightened its border closure with Bosnia. </P>
<P> The suspension could be extended if Serbia complied. </P>
<P> Recognition would effectively isolate the Serb minorities fighting the Bosnian and Croatian governments and be tantamount to giving up ideas of a ``Greater Serbia''. </P>
<P> Critics say the desire of the Serbs in Bosnia and Croatia to be linked to Serbia and not to the governments in Sarajevo and Zagreb is at the heart of the Yugoslav crisis and that it would be politically difficult for Milosevic to abandon them. </P>
