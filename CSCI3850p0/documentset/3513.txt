<P>  Pope John Paul celebrated a year-end mass of thanksgiving Saturday and said Roman Catholics should ask God to pardon them for their offenses during the year. </P>
<P> ``We have come here in a spirit of reparation for the offenses against God by our religious and civilian communities during the year that is about to end,'' the 74-year-old Pontiff said in the homily of the mass. </P>
<P> ``We seek reparation for the negative examples that sometimes have been offered,'' he said. </P>
<P> The Pope said all Catholics must find the inspiration for their lives in God's word. </P>
<P> ``Have we always been faithful to this inspiration? Or do we have to criticize ourselves for infidelity and negligence?'' he said. </P>
<P> Repentance has been one of the themes the Pope has stressed this year. </P>
<P> In a letter to the world's some 950 million Roman Catholics two months ago on preparations for celebrations of the year 2000, the Pope said the Church should admit its past historical sins and mistakes. </P>
<P> The Pope, who is still recoving from surgery to repair a broken leg and sometimes walks with a cane, celebrated the traditional year-end mass in his capacity as bishop of Rome in the Jesuit church of St. Ignatius of Loyola. </P>
<P> Referring to his health, the Pope said he regretted that his weekly visits to Rome parishes had to be curtailed after the operation. He said he hoped to resume the visits soon. </P>
<P> The Pope is due to make a 11-day trip to four countries in Asia and the Pacific in mid January. </P>
