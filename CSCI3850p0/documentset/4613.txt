<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Mock Rambos toting toy machine-guns, transvestites in evening gowns and women wearing G-strings pranced through Rio de Janeiro Monday as glittering floats in a sea of dancers surged through the city. </P>
<P> Wearing a kaleidoscope of costumes, Brazilians caroused in non-stop parties, splashed with rivers of beer and fueled by almost anything goes lack of inhibition. </P>
<P> Rio's carnival means ``an increase in contagious joy, galloping drunkenness, quick adultery, explicit exhibitionism, spouse swapping, gender swapping, lost and founds, hunger and gluttony,'' Jornal do Brasil cartoonist Miguel Paiva wrote. </P>
<P> Downtown, parades of thousands of dancers and glittering floats bounced though the Sambadrome. </P>
<P> At the second night of competiton among samba groups, one of the first schools to appear, Estacio de Sa, exploded down the Sambadrome in a tribute to the Flamengo soccer club. </P>
<P> Some team members, absent temperamental star Romario, appeared in the cupola of a three-story gold pagoda as thousands of dancers sang, ``I am Flamengo until I die.'' </P>
<P> Brazil's carnival season has been largely trouble-free, although 150 people were slightly injured late Sunday when a grandstand collapsed at Sao Paulo's parade festival, Globo television reported. </P>
<P> ``This is the 20th time we've played since last week,'' said Mestre Dede, a saxophonist with the Banda do Leblon band, during a break at a late-afternoon street party in the middle-class beachfront Leblon neighbourhood. </P>
<P> ``The spirit of the carioca (Rio resident) is really joyful. This is everyone's party, not just the kind of spectacle you see in the samba parade.'' </P>
<P> The Leblon crowd of about 200 people, including children in glittering costumes, danced and pelted each other with confetti. </P>
<P> The band and the crowd paraded up residential streets, headed by a pickup truck with two dancing women in back, one at least 50, in the back. </P>
<P> Both were dressed in little more than G-strings, fishnet stockings and glitter. </P>
<P> They were joined by a gray-haired woman who danced the shuffling steps of the samba to the chants of the crowd, and by a little girl wearing bunny ears. </P>
