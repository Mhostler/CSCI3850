<DATELINE>WASHINGTON, Feb 9 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Senate voted Friday to develop proposals to shield Social Security from spending cuts under a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, as Republicans struggled to round up support for the budget bill. </P>
<P> By a vote of 87-10 lawmakers approved an amendment by Majority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas to send the balanced budget amendment back to the Senate Budget Committee so lawmakers can develop a nonbinding plan to eliminate the deficit without cutting Social Security payments or increasing taxes. </P>
