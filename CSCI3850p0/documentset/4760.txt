<P>  On March 10, 1945, Kazuyo Funato was looking forward to leaving junior high school. The graduation ceremony was two weeks later and she was excited about moving on to the next stage in her 12-year-old life. </P>
<P> Then, shortly after midnight, the world as she knew it ended when thousands of fire bombs rained down on Tokyo from U.S. B-29 bombers. </P>
<P> It was the start of what became known as the Great Tokyo Air Raid, an event that outside Japan has long been overshadowed by the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. </P>
<P> But for many residents of the Japanese capital who went through the inferno, the raid, in which an estimated 100,000 people died, is spoken of with the same bitterness as the nuclear attacks. </P>
<P> ``The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are well known throughout the world, but little is known about the Tokyo air raid,'' said Hidee Shiiya, director of a special exhibition on the air raid at the Edo-Tokyo Museum. </P>
<P> The exhibition is part of ceremonies planned to commemorate the tragedy Friday. </P>
<P> Other events include a mass rally, film shows, a memorial service and concerts dedicated to the dead. </P>
<P> A rally had been held each year on the same day, but on a much smaller scale. </P>
<P> ``This year's events bear no comparison with previous ones as we observe the 50th anniversary of the air raid,'' said a Tokyo metropolitan government official. </P>
<P> Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama was invited to attend the rally, but has chosen instead to send a representative who will read Murayama's prepared speech. </P>
<P> Shiiya says the point of the commemoration ceremonies is to remind the world how innocent people can suffer in wars. </P>
<P> ``We don't mean to say who was right or who was wrong. We just want to emphasize the damaging effect on ordinary people of the air raid,'' he said. </P>
<P> Five of Funato's family of 10 died in the 2 3/8-hour raid. </P>
<P> ``Incendiaries were falling all over the place like rain.'' Funato, 62, told Reuters in an interview. ``We were trapped in our house in something like a melting pot of fire. </P>
<P> The March 10 raid was the biggest in a series of massive strikes by the U.S. Air Force from November 1944 that devastated Japanese cities. </P>
<P> Tokyo at the time was a city of mainly wooden buildings which made the devastation from the fire bombs so much worse. </P>
<P> Funato fled with her sister and two brothers to a cave used as an air-raid shelter. </P>
<P> ``As we ran around to get away from the bombs, we saw hundreds of homes burning,'' she said. </P>
<P> Her 20-year-old brother Minoru was the first among the five in her family who died. </P>
<P> ``My brother Minoru caught fire and ran out of the cave. Then he was engulfed by the flames,'' she said. ``He was burned alive.'' </P>
<P> Funato described life in the cave as ``an unbearable battle against violent heat and fire with no water.'' </P>
<P> ``My six-year-old sister Hiroko had bad burns all over her head, face and hands. She was crying for water,'' she said. </P>
<P> Funato dug up mud from the floor of the cave and spread it on her sister's burns to help relieve her pain. </P>
<P> ``But 10 days later my sister died after developing tetanus. Probably germs from the mud infected the burns,'' she said. </P>
<P> Fifty years after the massive U.S. blitz, Funato and many other survivors can still not accept why the raid was carried out. </P>
<P> ``We were not armed and we were not soldiers,'' Funato said. ``I hated America.'' </P>
