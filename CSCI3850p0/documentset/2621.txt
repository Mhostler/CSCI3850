<P>  President Joaquim Chissano took a virtually unassailable lead Tuesday in Mozambique elections and officials said only tallying errors could rob him of victory. </P>
<P> Independent Electoral Commission figures showed that with more than 90 percent of votes counted from 7,411 polling stations, Chissano had nearly 54 percent and his nearest rival, the Renamo former rebel leader Afonso Dhlakama, almost 34 percent from the vote conducted almost three weeks ago. </P>
<P> The contest for the 250-seat assembly between Chissano's ruling Frelimo party and Renamo was much closer, with Frelimo polling nearly 45 percent to almost 38 percent for the former rebels. </P>
<P> ``It looks pretty clear that Chissano has won, barring any last-minute tallying problems,'' an electoral official told Reuters as the laborious counting process continued in the mostly rural and impoverished east African country. </P>
<P> Officials said they hoped to have the final tally from the Oct. 27-29 elections ready by Wednesday night, but the public announcement might be delayed for another day or two. </P>
<P> Dhlakama, who boycotted the first day of elections because of alleged fraud, has told U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros Ghali in a phone call he would accept the poll results, whatever the outcome. </P>
<P> ``Mr Dhlakama told the secretary-general he was in favor of peace and national reconciliation,'' said a statement issued by the U.N. mission in Mozambique. </P>
<P> ``Although Mr Dhlakama thought that there had been irregularities in the conduct of the election in Mozambique, he had accepted the result and was prepared to cooperate with the government of Mozambique in the post-electoral era.'' </P>
<P> The final results have been delayed by double-checking of figures and deliberations among representatives of the CNE and main parties over a large number of spoiled ballots -- five percent of votes for the presidential race and six percent for the parliamentary. </P>
