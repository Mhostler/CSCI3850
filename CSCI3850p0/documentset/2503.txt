<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore.(Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A proposal that would allow terminally ill adults to obtain a physician's prescription for lethal drugs to end their lives was ahead by a small margin Tuesday, but was too close to call. </P>
<P> With 46 percent of the precincts counted, the measure led 52 percent to 48 percent and the outcome of the vote may not be known until Wednesday. </P>
<P> The measure, if approved, would be the first of its kind in the United States. </P>
<P> Supporters, led by the Hemlock Society, a group that favors euthanasia, said the proposed law would give patients a chance to determine their destiny and die with some dignity. </P>
<P> Opponents, including the Catholic Church, contend that the measure has inadequate safeguards and are also against it because it gives state approval for suicide. </P>
<P> Under the proposed law, an adult living in Oregon would be able to request a lethal dose of drugs after two physicians say he or she has six months or less to live. After three separate requests, each witnessed by two people, and a 15-day waiting period, the attending physician would then be allowed to write the prescription and would be immune from prosecution. </P>
