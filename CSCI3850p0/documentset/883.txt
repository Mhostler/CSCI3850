<P>  Singapore unveiled its high-tech ``court of the future'' Friday and a judge said the use of computers and video conferencing could halve the time it takes to hear a case. </P>
<P> The program could also save taxpayers money and child witnesses the trauma of appearing in open court. </P>
<P> The Subordinate Courts unveiled the project, known as Court Vision 21. </P>
<P> A district judge presided over a mock trial which used dial-up video-conferencing, voice-recognition transcription systems, pen-based computing and other multimedia applications. </P>
<P> ``The legal aspects will have to be looked into,'' district judge Adrian Soon said. For instance, delivery of testimony via video is not now admissable. But he believed courts of the future could hear twice as many cases a day if fully automated. </P>
<P> The demonstration aimed to satisfy the three main objectives of the court of the future: paperless systems, instant transcription of evidence and the giving of testimony by video transmission, said Wee Teck Hin, head of information systems at the Singapore National Computer Board. </P>
<P> The trial used ``litigation support software,'' allowing evidence and exhibits produced in court to be called up almost instaneously on the judge's personal computer in his chambers. </P>
<P> Another piece of software, ``SING'' (Sentencing Information Guide System), allows instant storage and retrieval of documents in text, video, image and voice. </P>
<P> The project is being conducted by the Subordinate Courts, the computer board and several suppliers. </P>
