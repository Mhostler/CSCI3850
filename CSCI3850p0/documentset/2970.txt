<P>  Iraqi opposition sources Friday said a senior adviser to Saddam Hussein had defected and added that this would encourage army desertions and bring closer the fall of the Iraqi President. </P>
<P> ``Last week Maj. Gen. Wafiq al-Samra'i was working in Saddam's office. Yesterday he came to Salahuddin in northern Iraq,'' said Hamid al-Bayati, executive member of the Iraqi National Congress (INC), Iraq's umbrella opposition group. </P>
<P> The congress has its headquarters in Salahuddin in the Kurdish north. </P>
<P> There was no confirmation of the Iraqi opposition's report. </P>
<P> ``He is about the highest ranked military defection we have had so far. I think this will open the door for more defections as people decide that the best way is to get out as he has done,'' al-Bayati told Reuters by telephone from London, where he represents the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI). </P>
<P> ``Of course it will bring closer Saddam's fall for this reason. A lot of people working close to Saddam are no more loyal to him, but it is hard to defect as, if families get left behind, they get persecuted and even executed,'' he said. </P>
<P> The opposition Iraqi Broadcasting Corporation (IBC) said in a statement that al-Samra'i, the head of Iraqi military intelligence until 1991, and then a ``director general'' adviser in Saddam's office, had decided to work to overthrow the Iraqi government. </P>
<P> The IBC said the defection was a heavy blow to Saddam, because of al-Samra's senior position in the Iraqi military and its sensitive nature. </P>
<P> Bayati declined to say how al-Samra'i got to Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq because it could endanger the safety of the route for others who may want to flee. </P>
<P> Iraqi opposition sources say a considerable number of officers within Saddam's army are prepared to work against him and have good links with the congress. </P>
<P> But these people fear for themselves and their families as defectors face the amputation of limbs; their families face persecution and dissenters face arrest, they say. </P>
<P> In November, Baghdad launched a wide campaign of arrests and executions within the army and Islamic clergy to stamp out opposition to Saddam's rule, the congress said. </P>
