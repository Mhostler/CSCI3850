<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Investment banker James Wolfensohn is President Clinton's choice to become president of the World Bank, it was reported Saturday. </P>
<P> The Washington Post said the White House sent cables to other World Bank member-nations Friday notifying them of the decision and a formal announcement was expected Saturday. </P>
<P> A World Bank spokesman was not immediately available for comment. The newspaper based its report on unnamed administration officials. </P>
<P> Wolfensohn, who runs his own investment bank in New York, would succeed Lewis Preston, 68, who wants to retire. </P>
<P> The Washington Post said Wolfensohn's experience as a Wall Street banker and his work as chairman of the Kennedy Center gave him the edge in winning the selection. </P>
<P> Last month, the New York Times reported that Wolfensohn, among a number of contenders for the World Bank post, had said he could cut costs at the bank. </P>
<P> An Australian native, Wolfensohn is a naturalized U.S. citizen. He competed in the 1956 Olympics in fencing. </P>
<P> The World Bank was created after World War II and is a leading source of funding for developing nations. By custom, the United States nominates its president, who is confirmed by consensus. </P>
<P> A coalition of groups critical of World Bank policies was dissatisfied by word Wolfensohn was the choice, contending he had little knowledge of the needs of poor people in the developing world. </P>
<P> ``Once again, a Wall Street insider has landed the job of World Bank president,'' said Juliette Majot, a member of the coalition 50 Years is Enough. </P>
