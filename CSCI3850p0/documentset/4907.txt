<P>  Polish President Lech Walesa began a state visit to Norway Tuesday, 12 years after winning the Nobel Peace Prize he was unable to collect himself in Oslo. </P>
<P> Walesa and his wife Danuta were greeted at Oslo airport by Princess Martha Louise and were later received at the Royal Palace by King Harald and Queen Sonja. </P>
<P> Walesa, on his first visit to Norway, planned talks with Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland and other Norwegian leaders during the day as part of an effort to boost trade. </P>
<P> On Wednesday, he will visit the Nobel Committee, which awarded him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983 for founding Poland's Solidarity trade union three years earlier. </P>
<P> Walesa sent his wife and son Bogdan to receive the prize in Oslo on his behalf because he feared that the communist regime would not allow him back into the country if he traveled abroad. </P>
<P> In 1981, the government outlawed Solidarity, the first free trade union in the then Soviet bloc, but the movement brought down the communist system in 1989. </P>
<P> In Warsaw, Walesa's top foreign policy adviser Andrzej Ananicz said Monday the three-day visit would center on regional cooperation, better trade and increasing investment of Norwegian companies in Poland. </P>
<P> Thursday, Walesa will fly to Narvik in northern Norway for a wreath-laying ceremony at a memorial for Poles who died in World War II fighting in the Arctic. </P>
