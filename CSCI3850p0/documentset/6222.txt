<DATELINE>PARIS (Reuter</DATELINE>
<P>  The much-touted key debate between French presidential contenders Jacques Chirac and Lionel Jospin was a lackluster affair but some analysts said that may have been Chirac's intention. </P>
<P> The two men politely traded arguments on the economy, unemployment and institutional reform in a live television duel late Tuesday, five days before the decisive May 7 run-off vote. </P>
<P> A panel of four top media analysts, commenting on the debate on television as soon as it ended, concluded that Jospin, underdog in opinion polls, performed better in the debate. ``He was the one on the offensive,'' said psychiatrist Gerard Miller. </P>
<P> Yet the four also agreed that the exchange was unexciting, ``even rather boring,'' with two analysts saying Chirac may have intended it to be forgettable in order not to affect his lead. </P>
<P> ``Yes, it was a dull debate and will leave no trace. That may be the result of a stroke of genius by Chirac. He didn't want anything to happen that could jeopardize his position,'' said law professor and political analyst Olivier Duhamel. </P>
<P> Socialist Jospin pledged that, if elected, he would reduce the presidential term from seven years to five, starting with his own. </P>
<P> Chirac, 62-year-old mayor of Paris, concentrated his fire on the Socialists' record on unemployment and economic regulation in the 14-year term of outgoing President Francois Mitterrand. </P>
<P> Jospin replied Chirac had offered nothing but ``generalities and no precise measures'' to combat France's economic woes, including near-record 12.3 percent unemployment. </P>
<P> ``Those viewers who wanted blood and a good fight were certainly disappointed and may even have gone to sleep,'' said media analyst Claude Fitoussi. ``However, there was far more tolerance and less demagoguery in the debate than in past ones.'' </P>
<P> He was referring to fiery past debates between Francois Mitterrand, now stepping down after 14 years as president, and his predecessor Valery Giscard d'Estaing, which many French people still recall. </P>
<P> ``Those debates were lyrical and romantic,'' said media consultant Jacques Seguela. ``But perhaps the French people no longer want to see their leaders fiercely attacking each other.'' </P>
<P> Chirac, summing up at the end of the 130-minute debate, said the key question was: ``Do you want a third seven-year Socialist term or not, do you want real change? I know that they (the French) want a real change,'' he said. </P>
<P> He said the Socialists' instinct was to ``share out penury,'' charging that the tax hikes Jospin proposed would stifle growth and his planned cut in the work week from 39 to 37 hours in 1997 would create almost no jobs except at public expense. </P>
<P> ``I've said what I'd do, and I'll do what I said,'' Jospin said in his conclusion, adding he aimed to modernize France. </P>
<P> The debate began with both men condemning the drowning of a Moroccan immigrant by skinheads on the fringe of an extreme-right National Front march Monday. </P>
<P> The debate had been expected to draw 30 million viewers but some specialists said many probably switched channels early on, especially since the first half-hour was devoted to dry theoretical debate about constitutional change. </P>
