<P>  The number of people in the world will nearly double by the year 2030, climbing to a whopping 8.5 billion, the World Bank said Wednesday. </P>
<P> Most of the population increase will be in developing countries and about 70 percent in the world's very poorest nations, where the average individual earns less than $2 a day. </P>
<P> According to the report by the international agency that fosters development in the third world, the bulk of the increase will happen over the next two decades, with a billion people added roughly every 12 years. </P>
<P> Regionally, Africa will experiance the biggest population boom over the next 35 years, followed by Central and South American, Asia, Oceania, North America and Europe. </P>
<P> The bank estimated the five fastest growing countries in the world will be Oman, Niger, Yemen, Ethiopia and Angola. </P>
<P> Meanwhile, the populations of Germany, Italy, Hungary, Spain, Belgium, Japan, Croatia, Portugal and Greece will decline, the bank predicted. </P>
<P> The Gaza Strip, already one of the most most densely populated regions on Earth, will grow by 208 percent. </P>
<P> China will remain the population giant, with 1.5 billion people in 2030, compared with 1.2 billion currently. </P>
<P> India, the second most populous country in the world with 934 million people, will grow to 1.4 billion over the next 35 years. </P>
<P> The United States will hang on to its spot as the third most populous country in the world. The number of people living in that nation will grow to 328 million in 2030 from 263 million in 1995, the bank said.  Indonesia will be the fourth largest country in the world in 2030, with a population of 274.7 million, up from 192.5 million in 1995. And Brazil will grab the fifth place slot, growing to 231.5 million people in 2030. </P>
