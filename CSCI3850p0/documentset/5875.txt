<P>  The folks who told you just how much fat there really was in your fettucini alfredo have some bad news about strained peaches and creamed peas. </P>
<P> Baby foods contain more water, thickeners and sugar than many parents may suspect, the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) said Thursday. </P>
<P> The nutrition group, known for analyzing the fat and cholesterol content of movie theater popcorn, lunchtime sandwiches and popular ethnic foods, said that parents have to read baby food labels extremely carefully. </P>
<P> Better yet, the group said, parents should take advantage of modern appliances like blenders and food processors, or even an old fashioned fork, to prepare baby food themselves. </P>
<P> The group also urged the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to require clearer labels on baby foods, so that consumers know how much ``real food'' and how many fillers the jar contains. </P>
<P> In the report ``Cheating Babies: Nutritional Quality and Cost of Commercial Baby Food,'' the nutritionists say that some of the foods for children over six months old contain more than two-thirds of water and starchy fillers. </P>
<P> What's worse, they cost more than similar products without the fillers, CSPI said. Baby foods and juices generally cost more than the adult equivalents, even when the foods are basically the same, like fruit juices or apple sauce. </P>
<P> ``Parents may feel that there may be something especially good about baby foods that justifies high prices. There is nothing magical about baby foods,'' the report said. </P>
<P> ``When you want convenience, prepared adult foods that are similar in consistency to baby foods ar just as good, but cost much less.'' </P>
<P> The report was particularly critical of Gerber and Heinz brands. It found Beech-Nut, Growing Healthy and Earth's Best preferable, and urged supermarkets to sell their own house brands without many fillers. </P>
