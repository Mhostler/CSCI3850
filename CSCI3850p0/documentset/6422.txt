<P>  Arab states, on the eve of a likely decision to make a crucial nuclear treaty permanent, presented a new resolution containing an explicit reference to Israel's nuclear weapons program. </P>
<P> The resolution, bound to be strongly opposed by the United States, could complicate or delay Wednesday's expected decision on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and has already resulted in overnight negotiations. </P>
<P> The document, sponsored by about 14 Arab nations who are signatories to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, calls on Israel to join the treaty and ``place all its nuclear activities under International Atomic Energy Agency full-scope safeguards.'' Both Kuwait and Iraq support this resolution. </P>
<P> A draft text on the subject accepted by most countries is less direct and does not mention Israel by name. It contains a call for all nations to join the treaty, ``particularly those states which operate unsafeguarded nuclear facilities.'' </P>
<P> Israel as well as India and Pakistan, all of whom have nuclear weapons capabilities, have not signed the NPT. </P>
<P> Egyptian Ambassador Nabil Elaraby said the Arab states wanted consensus on the resolution, which would have a political impact but not be legally binding. Otherwise, he said he would push for a vote, which would command a majority. </P>
<P> Elaraby and Algeria's ambassador, Ramtane Lamamra, were meeting Conference President Jayantha Dhanapala of Sri Lanka to see if any compromise could be forged. </P>
<P> In an effort to reach a consensus to extend the treaty indefinitely, Dhanapala has offered a package of measures, which go some way to meeting criticisms from many states. </P>
<P> Two declarations are to be attached to a third document -- the decision making permanent the 1970 treaty, considered the cornerstone of arms control pacts. </P>
<P> ``For us it will be a four-legged animal,'' said Lamamra, in reference to the Arab resolution. </P>
<P> Elaraby contended Arab states were not linking acceptance of the resolution to a decision on extending the treaty. </P>
<P> But he acknowledged proceedings would be complicated by insistence the Arab resolution be adopted before the conference extended the life of the treaty. </P>
