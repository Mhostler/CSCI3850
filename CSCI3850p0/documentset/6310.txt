<DATELINE>WOLFSBURG, Germany (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Former slave laborers who toiled in appalling conditions to power the Nazi war machine in World War II returned Friday to the Volkswagen factory where they worked more than 50 years ago. </P>
<P> About 50 former prisoners from Poland, Israel, France, Belgium and the Netherlands came to commemorate their liberation in 1945 and to honor comrades who did not live to see the end of the Third Reich's tyranny. </P>
<P> Volkswagen, now Europe's largest car maker, used around 12,000 slave laborers at its Wolfsburg plant to make weapons, including V1 rockets fired at London and other cities. </P>
<P> ``The work was very hard and we were hungry all the time,'' ex-prisoner Julian Banas told Reuters. ``They hated us because we were Polish. If anyone tried to escape they were shot.'' </P>
<P> ``We feared we would never see our homes again and we hated the fact that we were building weapons for our enemies.'' </P>
<P> Although VW has done more than many German firms to try to atone for its wartime sins, some former prisoners said the $8 million it had so far paid to survivors' organizations was totally inadequate. </P>
<P> Moshe Shen, a Hungarian Jew who now lives in Israel, said the least the company should do was to pay for a memorial to his group of 300 former Auschwitz inmates who worked at Wolfsburg. Only 50 of them survived the war. </P>
<P> ``They say they don't know exactly who was here, but we have the list,'' he said. </P>
<P> Horst Weiss, head of Wolfsburg's German-Polish Society and one of the organizers of Friday's visit, said ex-prisoners should be paid for their forced labor. </P>
<P> ``When one thinks of how much money VW makes and how they got their hands dirty, they should really pay much more,'' he said. </P>
<P> The ex-prisoners met the mayor of Wolfsburg before touring the VW plant, which was restored after the war and is still in use. They also revisited their underground accommodation bunkers, now grey and dank with age. </P>
<P> VW spokesman Guenther Scherelis said the company gave tours of the bunkers to its apprentices to inform them of its dark past. ``We have a history of forced labor and we don't want it to happen again,'' he said. </P>
<P> Volkswagen was set up in the 1930s to build Hitler's ``People's Car,'' designed by engineer Ferdinand Porsche. During the war, it switched to production of military equipment. </P>
<P> Slave laborers accounted for around three-quarters of the Wolfsburg factory's 16,000-strong wartime workforce. </P>
<P> It is not known exactly how many people died in the grim conditions at Wolfsburg, but recent historical studies revealed that 300 to 400 children perished in a children's barracks at the plant through malnutrition and disease. </P>
<P> In one of the many cruel ironies of the war, 73 slave laborers were killed and 160 injured by Allied bombing raids in 1944, which destroyed about two-thirds of the plant but did not halt production. </P>
