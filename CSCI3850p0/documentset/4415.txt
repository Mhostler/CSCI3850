<P>  After more than a year of study, federal authorities have denied a petition from environmentalists to list a population of 650 to 1,000 wolves in southeast Alaska's rain forest as threatened. </P>
<P> The ruling, issued Thursday, renewed debate over habitat-conservation areas -- new wildlife zones that were established last year over the objections of industry in the 17 million-acre Tongass National Forest. </P>
<P> Development advocates said the decision not to list the the Alexander Archipelago wolf as threatened is proof the U.S. Forest Service erred in establishing areas that put some 600,000 acres of the Tongass off-limits to logging. </P>
<P> ``We have always felt that the facts never supported listing that critter as threatened or endangered,'' said Chris Gates, executive director of the Alaska Forest Association. </P>
<P> Instead, what has been threatened in the Tongass, a series of islands and coastlines that make up the largest U.S. national forest, are logging-dependent towns and families unable to capitalize on good timber markets, he said. </P>
<P> Even before the new areas were set up, 90 percent of the Tongass was off-limits to logging, he said. </P>
<P> ``So we really object to these Draconian measures that really hurt people,'' he said. ``Nobody's caring about the people who are dependent on timber.'' </P>
<P> But the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said its decision against listing the wolf as threatened was based, in part, on the establishment of the new habitat-conservation areas. </P>
<P> ``At this point it looks like they're going in the right direction with that plan to help protect the viability of that species, the wolf, and other old-growth dependent species,'' Bruce Batten of the Fish and Wildlife Service told the Alaska Public Radio Network. </P>
<P> The habitat-conservation areas have also been endorsed by Alaska Gov. Tony Knowles, a Democrat elected in November who has reversed some pro-development policies of his Republican predecessor, Walter Hickel. </P>
<P> The governor was pleased with the decision against listing the wolf as threatened, said his press secretary, Bob King. </P>
