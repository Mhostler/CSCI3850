<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Mogadishu warlord General Mohamed Farah Aideed's Somali National Alliance (SNA) says its gunmen control the area around the capital's U.N.-guarded port. </P>
<P> The announcement by SNA-run radio Saturday followed clashes between the SNA and supporters of rival warlord Ali Mahdi Mohamed, which killed at least two people and wounded six. </P>
<P> The radio said the SNA had taken control of the port area to ensure its smooth working, and no arms would be allowed to be brought in there. SNA units had cordoned off the area, it said. </P>
<P> Egyptian U.N. peacekeepers guard the seaport but have repeatedly come under fire in the past week from what U.N. officers said were disgruntled dock workers loyal to the SNA. </P>
<P> Radio Mogadishu, which supports Ali Mahdi Mohamed, reacted to the SNA announcement by condemning the move as sabotage of an agreement between the two factions to keep the seaport open. </P>
<P> The radio said the SNA was ``closing the port whenever it wants and obstructing the flow of general traffic and the emergency relief services.'' </P>
<P> The statement accused the SNA of illegally levying taxes on traffic using the port, and called on U.N. peacekeepers to ensure the port and airport were available to everyone. </P>
<P> ``We are waiting for a satisfactory explanation on this matter,'' it added, warning that ``immediate and grave consequences'' would follow if the situation continued. </P>
<P> The U.N. Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM), which has been avoiding direct confrontation with the rival factions since the March withdrawal of U.S. forces who became embroiled in clashes with Aideed's militia, made no immediate comment on the SNA move. </P>
<P> The clan-based feud between Aideed and Ali Mahdi supporters killed about 30,000 people after the ousting of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991. Famine caused by the war killed 10 times that number of Somalis. </P>
<P> During Saturday's clashes, stray shells crashed into U.N. compounds in Mogadishu. </P>
<P> U.N. military spokesman Major Zubair Chatta said rival militiamen fought with anti-tank rockets, cannon and small arms and three stray shells caused minor damage to U.N. vehicles. </P>
<P> A stray bullet wounded a Pakistani warrant officer, he said. </P>
<P> Although the fighting eased in the afternoon, roadblocks were in operation and large numbers of militiamen and technicals -- vehicles mounted with medium to heavy calibre weapons -- were seen on the streets of the capital. </P>
<P> U.S. military officials said the rival Mogadishu warlords appeared to be arming for wider clan warfare and there was no sign of a peace settlement between them. </P>
<P> The U.N. Security Council, bruised by its failure to bring peace to Somalia despite brokering peace talks, is to decide at the end of September whether to extend its mandate there or pull out. </P>
