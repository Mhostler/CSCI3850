<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A fire that destroyed part of a corruption-plagued New York City fish market was declared a case of arson Thursday by fire officials. </P>
<P> A trained arson dog detected a flammable liquid on the third floor of the Fulton Fish Market, which erupted in flames at midday Wednesday, Fire Department officials said. </P>
<P> Fire marshals then found burn patterns that showed a flammable liquid had been poured down a 40-foot hallway, said Fire Commissioner Howard Safir and Chief Fire Marshal Michael Vecci. </P>
<P> Officials said there was also evidence that the building's sprinkler system, which failed during the blaze, had been tampered with. </P>
<P> There are no suspects at this time, but there are a number of leads, officials said. </P>
<P> The fish market, the largest of its kind in the country, reopened for business Thursday morning following the fire. </P>
<P> Earlier this week, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced he was cracking down on corruption at the market, which he said has been controled by organized crime for decades. </P>
<P> Giuliani, in Washington Thursday, said the fire could have been an attempt to disrupt business at the market. </P>
<P> ``We made certain the operations of the fish market were not affected or at least as little affected as possible,'' he said. </P>
<P> Randy Mastro, the mayor's chief of staff, said, ``If anyone thought that by setting such a fire they were going to slow down business operations in the Fulton Fish Market or derail the administration's initiative to reform the market, they failed.'' </P>
<P> Monday, Giuliani said he was seeking broad powers to control who does business with and who works at the market. Those powers would include licensing and regulating wholesalers, loaders and unloaders. </P>
<P> The City Council has begun hearings on his request. </P>
<P> Part of the roof of the turn-of-the-century building was damaged in Wednesday's fire, in which one firefighter suffered minor injuries. </P>
<P> The fire forced the evacuation of the South Street Seaport, a popular tourist destination across the street, and shrouded the nearby Brooklyn Bridge in dark smoke. </P>
<P> Along with city agencies, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms are involved in the fire investigation, officials said. </P>
