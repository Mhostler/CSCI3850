<P>  A Danish U.N. military observer was killed in a mine blast in Croatia Monday, a U.N. spokesman in Zagreb said. </P>
<P> ``A Danish military observer, driving with a Polish colleague, was killed when his truck hit an anti-tank mine,'' U.N. spokesman Paul Risley told Reuters. </P>
<P> In Copenhagen, the Danish army command identified the observer as Major Per Hjort Skibelund, 54. </P>
<P> The incident occurred in a U.N.-monitored area held by rebel Serb forces south of Karlovac, some 25 miles from the country's capital. </P>
<P> The Polish observer riding in the same truck suffered severe shrapnel wounds but managed to walk for two miles to the nearest U.N. checkpoint, Risley said. </P>
<P> He was transported to a hospital in Zagreb and his injuries were not life-threatening. </P>
<P> U.N. peacekeeping troops were deployed in Croatia in 1992 to monitor a shaky cease-fire signed between Zagreb and the breakaway Serbs who gained control over a third of the country's territory after a bloody six-month war with government troops. </P>
<P> Several U.N. soldiers have since been killed by unmarked mines left behind by both warring parties. </P>
