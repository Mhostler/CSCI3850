<P>  The widow of China's last emperor, Henry Pu Yi, has won a decade-old copyright lawsuit involving his famous autobiography ``From Emperor to Citizen,'' a court spokesman said Monday. </P>
<P> The Beijing Intermediate People's Court ruled that survivors of Li Wenda, who helped Pu Yi revise the autobiography, were not entitled to a share in the book's copyright or royalties, the spokesman said by telephone. </P>
<P> ``Royalties from sales of Pu Yi's autobiography belong to his widow,'' the spokesman said. He declined to give further details of the case. </P>
<P> The official China Daily said the court rejected a demand by Pu Yi's widow Li Shuxian for a public apology from the defendant, now dead and represented by his widow and sons. The civil suit was filed in 1985. </P>
<P> ``Only Pu Yi, the last emperor, enjoys the copyright as the sole writer of the autobiography,'' the newspaper said. </P>
<P> The belated settlement came amid a feud between China and the United States, which has ordered punitive import tariffs against Chinese goods to prod Beijing to improve protection of copyrights and other widely pirated intellectual property. </P>
<P> Pu Yi published the first Chinese edition of his book in 1964, chronicling his years in prison, lengthy re-education and eventual rehabilitation as a worker in a botanical garden. The first English edition was published a year later. </P>
<P> The state-owned Qunzhong Publishing House said it has published 18 editions totalling 1.8 million copies, but an official declined to comment on the amount and distribution of royalties. </P>
<P> The Qing dynasty monarch-turned-commoner died in 1967 at age 61 and was the subject of the award-winning film ``The Last Emperor'' by Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci. </P>
<P> The five-year-old ``Son of Heaven'' was deposed by the 1911 Nationalist revolution and later served briefly as emperor of the puppet state of Manchukuo, which invading Japanese forces set up in China's northeastern provinces. </P>
<P> Pu Yi was later tried as a war criminal in Tokyo, sent back to China and imprisoned in 1950. He was released under a 1959 amnesty. He married Li Shuxian, a nurse, in 1962. </P>
