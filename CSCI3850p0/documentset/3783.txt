<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The United States is setting ''strong'' conditions for a $40 billion loan guarantee package to bail Mexico out of its currency crisis, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said Sunday. </P>
<P> Rubin, on the ABC-TV program ``This Week with David Brinkley,'' did not elaborate on conditions for the package, now being negotiated to restore investor confidence in the battered peso and shore up the Mexican economy. </P>
<P> In Mexico City, Finance Ministry officials said Friday that Mexico would use future oil export revenues as collateral for the proposed loan guarantees. </P>
<P> The plan would help Mexico reschedule short-term debt by assuring investors that they would eventually be repaid. Confidence in Mexico was shattered on Dec. 20, when the government devalued the peso by more than 30 percent against the dollar despite repeated past assurances that it would not devalue. </P>
<P> Rubin said Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan and all others involved in the rescue plan agreed that Mexico was fundamentally healthy and would not default on any U.S.-guaranteed currency-supporting borrowings. </P>
<P> ``It is our judgment ... that the probability of the debts being paid is exceedingly high, because of the fundamentals of Mexico. </P>
<P> ``We are going to increase those exceedingly high probabilities by insisting -- insisting on very strong conditions to protect the United States' interests,'' he added. </P>
<P> Rubin, who replaced the retiring Lloyd Bentsen as treasury secretary this month, said the rescue package ``is solely and totally being done to protect U.S. interests.'' </P>
<P> Without a bailout, Mexico's problems could affect the United States in a ``very substantial and adverse fashion,'' he said. ''And what we're doing is getting ahead of a crisis, instead of waiting to clean up after one.'' </P>
<P> On Thursday, President Clinton and the bipartisan leaders of Congress agreed to do what was neccesary to rebuild confidence in Mexico ``without affecting the current budget at home.'' </P>
<P> Rubin said Mexico would pay a fee ``calculated on a hard-nosed basis, to fully reflect all relevant economic considerations.'' As a result, he said, there would be no effect on the U.S. budget provided Mexico does not default. </P>
<P> ``What you have in Mexico are very large short-term liabilities and a loss of confidence. What is needed is a rescheduling of that short-term debt,'' he said. Rubin added that Mexico had made a ``major policy mistake'' by letting its current account deficit soar relative to the country's income. </P>
<P> He said he was sure the imbalance would be fixed under the proposed loan-guarantee program because of U.S. conditions for going ahead with it. </P>
<P> Secretary of State Warren Christopher, on the NBC-TV program ``Meet the Press,'' voiced confidence in Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo. </P>
<P> In reply to a question, he seemed to indicate that the United States would stop short of demanding any democratic reforms as the price for the bailout. </P>
<P> ``We don't want to use this moment to be so overbearing that we don't act as a good friend to Mexico,'' Christopher said. </P>
