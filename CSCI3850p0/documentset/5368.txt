<P>  PBS is putting a new twist on the traditional nature documentary -- studying the behavior of animals who aren't living in wild settings. </P>
<P> PBS' new 13-part series, ``Eyewitness,'' which premieres in New York Sunday and nationwide Monday, will have a new subject each week, starting with the cat. </P>
<P> But unlike most animal shows, ``Eyewitness'' spends little time on animals in the wild. In fact, many of its subjects are domesticated species that have been neglected on other shows. </P>
<P> ``Eyewitness'' takes other animals out of their natural habitats and looks at them with the help of computer animation and commentary. </P>
<P> ``To see animals as they actually are we need to strip away their natural surroundings,'' explains narrator Martin Sheen. </P>
<P> A collaboration of BBC Lionheart Television, PBS, Oregon Public Broadcasting and Doris Kindersley Vision, ``Eyewitness'' is based on Kindersley's science and children's guide books. </P>
<P> Footage of wild animals is juxtaposed with shots of domestic ones in similar activities. </P>
<P> Elaborate miniatures of wild settings have been built. For an episode on the jungle, a tiny rainforest was convincingly constructed, using vines affixed with rope and moss attached with staples. Squirrel monkeys who live in a sanctuary for abandoned pets played the roles of their wild counterparts. </P>
<P> Other animals are shown in whimsical and completely contrived environments, such as a mock fashion show runway for cats to demonstrate the fickleness of breeders. </P>
<P> While ``Eyewitness'' is visually fascinating, the show's strongest point is its fact-filled narrative that traces the history, mythology and cultural of animals. </P>
<P> For example, cat mythology is traced from Egyptians who used them as good luck charms to Japanese fisherman who use them as protection from ghosts. </P>
