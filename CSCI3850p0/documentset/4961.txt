<P> Tarnoff was speaking at a Senate Banking Committee hearing on legislation proposed by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, a New York Republican, to ban all U.S. business with Iran. </P>
<P> The hearing was being held on the heels of President Clinton's announcement Wednesday that he would ban all U.S. investments in Iranian petroleum development. </P>
<P> While the Clinton administration said it wanted its allies to join in restricting trade with Iran, Tarnoff said he doubted they would. </P>
<P> ``Based on my experience with the G7, I believe we will not be able to convince our allies to adopt prohibitions on trade in non-sensitive goods,'' Tarnoff told the panel. </P>
