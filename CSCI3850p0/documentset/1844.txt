<P>  Irish Republican leader Gerry Adams said Thursday that never before has peace in Ireland been so near and that Americans should redouble their efforts to help find a permanent solution. </P>
<P> The Sinn Fein leader also said the British government should stop stalling and start peace talks immediately. </P>
<P> ``I've come here to give an assessment -- and my assessment is that there is an opportunity for peace that is unprecedented,'' he told an audience at the University of California at Berkeley, a town known for radical politics. </P>
<P> ``I've come here to repeat to you all, redouble your efforts and do something in the period ahead ... and you can say, I helped in California, I helped, wherever I live,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``My single sentence message is to start the peace talks now ... the British government is making excuses for not talking,'' he said as applause erupted. </P>
<P> Sinn Fein is the political wing of the outlawed IRA guerrilla group, which has waged a 25-year battle against British rule in Northern Ireland. </P>
<P> While on stage, he was flanked by state senator Tom Hayden, an Irish-American politician who often supports such causes. He noted that it was Adams' 46th birthday. </P>
<P> Adams is ending a nine-city tour of the United States -- his first since the IRA declared a cease-fire on August 31. After Berkeley, he planned to go to Los Angeles to talk to movie stars and address the business community. </P>
<P> The Sinn Fein leader noted, as he has throughout his tour, that he has rarely been allowed into the United States -- only once before for two days last February after being kept out for twenty years. </P>
<P> ``For the first time, the voice of Sinn Fein, the voice of Gerry Adams can be heard in America, in Berkeley,'' he said as applause broke out. The Berkeley campus, he recalled, was where the Free Speech Movement started in the early 1960s. </P>
