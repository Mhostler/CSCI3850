<DATELINE>TAEGU, South Korea (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Three employees of a small engineering firm were arrested Saturday on suspicion of rupturing a gas main shortly before a blast devastated a swathe of the South Korean city Taegu, police said. </P>
<P> Weeping relatives demanded compensation for the loss of 100 of their loved ones, most of them children. Their grief turned to anger when around 60 of them besieged a local council office, accusing ashen-faced officials of neglect and of leaving corpses from the blast to rot in city morgues. </P>
<P> ``Dozens of bodies are rotting at the hospitals because they don't know what to do with them,'' a weeping parent said. </P>
<P> The relatives smashed desks and chairs at an office hastily converted into an emergency center after the explosion ripped through a central district of South Korea's third largest city, 150 miles south of Seoul. </P>
<P> Taegu Mayor Lee Jong-ju spoke to the families later and said loved ones of each victim would get a preliminary compensation payment of $5,250 to help with funeral expenses. </P>
<P> A police investigator said three employees of Standard Engineering and Construction Inc. were suspected of accidentally damaging the gas pipe about 10 minutes before the blast while drilling during construction of a shopping center. </P>
<P> ``Apart from the three arrested, we are going to question several more officials of firms involved in the subway and shopping center construction,'' the investigator said. He gave no further details. </P>
<P> A grim-faced President Kim Young-sam, reeling from yet another man-made disaster in his term of office, visited the scene of the blast and ordered a swift probe. </P>
<P> ``I don't know what to say now. In particular I want to express my deep condolences on the death of these young students,'' Kim said after touring the scene. </P>
<P> Of the 98 official death toll so far, 48 of the victims were children heading for schools in the area when the explosion hurled cars, trucks and buses through the air like toys. Thirty-five were from nearby Yongnam Middle School. </P>
<P> ``How could this happen to my children? I am simply at a loss for words,'' school principal Lee Kil-woo said. </P>
<P> The blast turned massive steel plates laid as a temporary road surface over the subway works into a deadly hail that crushed everything in their path, including pedestrians. </P>
<P> Vehicles tumbled into the yawning construction pit, including some buses carrying children to school. </P>
<P> At the scene of the disaster, rescuers ended a painstaking sift through debris, saying they no longer expected to find any more bodies. </P>
<P> A spokesman for the subway construction company said its preliminary investigation showed the accident happened when a digger working at the shopping center project opened up a five-inch fracture in a gas main. </P>
<P> The gas then seeped into the cavernous hole where subway work was under way. A welding torch or a cigarette may have sparked the devastation, he said. </P>
<P> ``According to our own checks, there was no destruction or damage of a gas pipeline in our construction sector,'' he told reporters. He said a worker reported the smell of gas 10 minutes before the blast. </P>
<P> Less than five months ago a similar blast killed 12 in Seoul and three months before that 32 died when a bridge in the South Korean capital collapsed. </P>
