<DATELINE>KIEV, Ukraine (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A senior parliament deputy said Thursday that erasing the aftermath of the 1986 Chernobyl catastrophe would cost up to $600 billion -- about 45 times more than estimated Ukrainian government spending for 1995. </P>
<P> ``We need between $200 billion and $600 billion to get rid of all the consequences of the Chernobyl catastrophe. We need about 30 years to do so,'' Volodymyr Yatsenko, head of a parliament commission on the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster, told a news conference. </P>
<P> Yatsenko did not specify where he thought the money -- which compares with government expenditure of $12.9 billion for this year -- would come from or how it would be spent. </P>
<P> But he appeared to have in mind health care for victims of Chernobyl-related illnesses, elimination of damage to the environment and resettlement of an estimated 2.5 million people still living on contaminated territory. </P>
<P> Yatsenko made his comments at a joint news conference with officials from the Health and Chernobyl ministries called ahead of the ninth anniversary of the catastrophe at the nuclear power station. </P>
<P> Ukraine, under pressure from the West, has pledged to close the station by the year 2000 and asked for help to build a power plant to replace the electricity Chernobyl's two working reactors still produce. </P>
<P> But in France, a senior Ukraine official told reporters that technical difficulties expected in dismantling Chernobyl may prevent Ukraine from meeting its pledge. </P>
<P> ``We want to stress that this is not like turning out a light in a room. This is a technical problem that is very, very difficult,'' Ukraine Foreign Affairs Minister Hennady Udovenko said. </P>
<P> ``We are not going to say tomorrow that we will not close it. We do not want to change our policy. We are very firm on this subject, but under each reactor at Chernobyl, there are 100,000 tons of nuclear waste. What will we do with it?'' he told reporters in Strasbourg when asked if Ukraine still intended to meet its promise. </P>
<P> Ukrainian nuclear officials have said Ukraine needs about $4.5 billion to build a new plant, perhaps gas-fired, and replace the crumbling ``tomb'' which covers the station's stricken fourth reactor. </P>
<P> Yatsenko criticized the West for failing to understand the range of problems created by the fire and explosion at the station's fourth reactor on April 26 1986, which spewed a cloud of radiation across much of Europe. </P>
<P> ``All talk has come down to one narrow issue -- closing the station -- when the problem is much broader,'' he said. </P>
<P> Ukraine says the accident caused 8,000 deaths. </P>
