<P>  Outgoing President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said Wednesday Mexico began but did not finish a process of dramatic political change during his six-year term. </P>
<P> In his final interview with journalists before leaving office Thursday, Salinas said he believes profound political reform is inevitable for the country ruled 65 years by his Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), but that it will be left to his successor President-elect Ernesto Zedillo to complete. </P>
<P> ``During my term, the PRI looked to change and introduced important changes, but did not finish its process of transformation,'' he said. </P>
<P> Zedillo, the PRI's victorious candidate in Mexico's Aug. 21 national election, has said he wants to separate the government from the PRI and bring democratic reforms to the party that has ruled without interruption since 1929. </P>
<P> The PRI's long reign has caused deep resentment among Mexicans who say the party is corrupt and uses electoral fraud to maintain its power. </P>
<P> Salinas, who spoke to journalists aboard the presidential jet while returning from a visit to the northern city of Monterrey, said he believes the PRI's transformation is important because the party is an ``indispensable political force for modernization.'' </P>
<P> Salinas launched sweeping economic reforms during his administration and secured the North American Free Trade Agreement with the United States and Canada creating the world's largest trade bloc. </P>
<P> But he was often criticized for not following through with political changes to improve Mexico's sagging democracy. His own election victory in 1988 was tainted by charges of vote-rigging. </P>
<P> Following the outbreak of a Mayan Indian rebellion in the southern state of Chiapas in January, Salinas instituted a number of reforms to clean up elections, but the PRI is deeply split over proposals for further reforms that could loosen its grip on power. </P>
<P> Salinas said the greatest accomplishment of his government was bringing about a ``change in mentality'' for the country. </P>
<P> ``Mexicans not only demanded changes, but also accepted changes. This signifies the new mentality ... the people today, without doubt, have fears, but (also) hope,'' he said. </P>
<P> Salinas, 46, is a candidate to head the new World Trade Organization, which will replace the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, but faces strong opposition from former Italian Trade Minister Renato Ruggiero and South Korea Trade Minister Kim Chul-su. </P>
<P> He shed little light on what is happening in the race for the new post, but left no doubt about his stance on trade issues. </P>
<P> ``At the end of the century, the hope is free trade ... the only way to generate a dynamic worldwide economic engine is in free trade,'' Salinas said. </P>
