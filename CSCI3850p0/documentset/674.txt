<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Pop star Michael Jackson and his bride, Lisa Marie Presley, shared a flower-bedecked suite with separate bedrooms in a luxury hotel in Hungary over the weekend, a staff member said Tuesday. </P>
<P> The staffer employed on the hotel cleaning crew, who refused to be identified, said Jackson had only a couple of suitcases but brought his own cooks. </P>
<P> Michael Shyder, executive assistant manager of the Grand Hotel Corvinus Kempinsky, said he had not heard of reports abroad that Jackson had ordered a special four-poster double bed for the couple's first foreign trip. </P>
<P> He declined further comment on their stay, which ended Tuesday after Jackson made a video featuring him as liberator of communist-ruled Eastern Europe. The couple, who were married in May, left Hungary aboard his private jet. </P>
<P> The employee, who spent more than an hour in the Jackson suite while the couple was there, said ``They did not say a word to each other, at least when I was in there.'' </P>
<P> Another hotel employee, who said he visited the Jackson suite for only a few minutes, said the Jacksons brought into their suite dozens of balloons and bouquets of roses. </P>
<P> Shooting of the video at the most scenic spots in Budapest and the couple's visits to hospitals attracted hundreds of near-hysterical fans and intense media interest. The trip to Hungary was their first joint public appearance since Lisa Marie, daughter of rock legend Elvis Presley, announced last week that they had wed in secret. </P>
<P> The marriage came a year after Jackson was embroiled in legal troubles. A 13-year-old boy alleged in a civil lawsuit that the entertainer had sexually molested him. Jackson denied the charges but settled a lawsuit out of court in January for a sum reported between $5 million and $20 million. </P>
<P> Police have launched an investigation of whether Jackson should be tried on criminal sexual molestation charges. </P>
