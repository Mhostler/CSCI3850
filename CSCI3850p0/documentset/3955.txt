<P>  Top women's doubles seed Natalia Zvereva Wednesday faced possible disciplinary action for a bizarre victory gesture at the Australian Open. </P>

<P> A spokeswoman for the Women's Tennis Federation (WTA) said Zvereva would face a charge of unprofessional conduct after a courtside official lodged a complaint. </P>
<P> ``The matter will be referred to a disciplinary committee which will meet within the next 60 to 90 days,'' a WTA spokeswoman said. </P>
<P> Zvereva, a WTA Tour Players committee member, partnered American Gigi Fernandez to victory over 10th seeds Eugenia Maniokova of Russia and Leila Meshki of Georgia to reach the semifinals at Flinders Park. </P>
