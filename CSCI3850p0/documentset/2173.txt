<P>  The Russian armed forces are more than twice as large as the 2.3 million officially under arms, according to a German institute. </P>
<P> Sunday's Bild am Sonntag newspaper said the Frankfurt-based Institute for Soviet Studies, which researched the strength of individual Russian units, had found Moscow was building up its forces under the cover of fighting crime. </P>
<P> The Russian forces now had 4.8 million men under arms, the institute's director Nikolaij Nor-Mesek told the newspaper. </P>
<P> ``A militarization and buildup is taking place under the cover of crime-fighting and catastrophe response,'' he was quoted as saying. </P>
<P> The report contradicts the annual report of a leading authority on military affairs, the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), released earlier this month. The IISS report said the strength of Moscow's armed forces was below the official figure. </P>
<P> The IISS said in its report, ``The Military Balance 1994-95,'' that the Russian forces, struggling with major defense cuts, now numbered 1.7 million and that most units were operating at less than half strength. </P>
<P> Russian President Boris Yeltsin has ordered cuts below two million despite a plea from Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, who said earlier this year Russia's security could be compromised if the armed forces were cut back too much. </P>
<P> The Soviet Union had 4.25 million men under arms before it started making cuts in 1988. </P>
<P> The Frankfurt institute said among the larger units were those under the control of the defense ministry, with 2.57 million under arms, the interior ministry with 370,000, and the president's special mobile unit with 102,000. </P>
<P> It estimated border guards numbered 210,000, the counterespionage service had 186,000 soldiers and troops designated for catastrophe response totaled some 310,000. </P>
