<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, England (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A man wielding two knives terrorized Christmas shoppers Thursday, slashing throats and wounding 14 people as they fled. </P>
<P> Hundreds of people ran screaming into the street from a department store as the man wandered calmly around, attacking shoppers and staff members at random. </P>
<P> Bleeding victims clutching their necks with bloody hands, fled into the center of this central English city. </P>
<P> ``It was pandemonium because everyone in the store was screaming and panicking,'' said Husna Chilwan, 36, who was shopping with her mother. </P>
<P> ``I saw him grab at a woman and she screamed out and then he cut her. The man stayed totally calm and stood there playing with his knife,'' she said. </P>
<P> Police eventually wrestled the man to the ground and arrested him. Detectives, probing what appeared to be a motiveless attack, said they were questioning a 30-year-old man from Birmingham. </P>
<P> Police said two of the victims were seriously injured but their wounds were not life-threatening. Thirty more people were treated for shock. </P>
<P> ``It was awful,'' said Clare Dallaway, who was selling lottery tickets in the store. ``This man was just wildly slashing at the women's throats with a knife. A lot of people were running and screaming, trying to get out of the way of this madman.'' </P>
