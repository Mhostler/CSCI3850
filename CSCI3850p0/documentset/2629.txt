<P>  David Smith, whose estranged wife has confessed to killing their two little boys, said in a television interview Tuesday that he had never doubted her false story that the children had been kidnapped by a black man. </P>
<P> ``I believed her, 100 percent,'' Smith told interviewer Katie Couric on ``Dateline NBC.'' </P>
<P> Even after his wife failed a lie detector test and told him local authorities were questioning her story, ``I never did,'' he said, ``not for a fleeting instant.'' </P>
<P> His wife, Susan Smith, 23, of Union, S.C., was charged Nov. 4 with murdering her sons, Michael, 3, and Alexander, 14 months. The boys drowned after she allegedly pushed her car into a lake, with them strapped into the back seat, on Oct. 25. </P>
<P> Susan Smith, who is white, had told police a black man carjacked her car and driven off with the boys. A nationwide search for the boys was conducted for nine days until police said she confessed to killing them. </P>
<P> ``I always believed that, during the nine days, I believed that they were ok,'' said Smith, 24, who had been separated from his wife. </P>
<P> When he learned of his wife's confession, Smith said, ``I was heartbroken. It was, it was a, a sickening feeling that I've never felt, experienced in my life before. I felt empty. I felt hollow. I felt betrayed.'' </P>
<P> She had been ``a very dedicated, devoted mother,'' he said. </P>
<P> Smith said he would not talk about his feelings toward his wife now, but he did say he would like to see her. </P>
<P> ``I've got certain questions that, you know, need some answers before I can have my own self-peace of mind,'' he said. </P>
<P> He said the last time he saw his children, they played with wooden blocks in his apartment. </P>
<P> ``Me and Michael would build them up, and Alex loved to just knock them down,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``I miss those, those little smiles that they can give, that could turn this whole earth and turn it upside down, that could take your worst day of your life and change it and turn it around and make it, make the best of it better,'' he said. </P>
