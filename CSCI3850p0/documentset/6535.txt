<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A delegation of Tajik government officials has arrived in the Afghan capital Kabul for talks with rival rebel leaders, Afghan government sources said Sunday. </P>
<P> The Afghan foreign ministry sources said the delegation met the deputy leader of the Tajik Islamic opposition, Akbar Turanjonzoda and Afghan officials at Kabul's Hotel Intercontinental Sunday morning. </P>
<P> They were preparing for a meeting expected later Sunday with the leader of the Tajik Islamic opposition in exile, Sayid Abdullo Nuri, the sources said. </P>
<P> Nuri commands guerrillas opposed to the Tajik government and its Russian military allies. </P>
<P> If the preliminary talks go as expected, Nuri will meet Tajik President Imomali Rakhmonov Wednesday in a bid to resolve the three-year-old civil war, the sources said. </P>
<P> If that meeting goes ahead, it would be the first between a Tajik head of state and the leader of the armed opposition in an apparent softening of the Tajik government stance toward the rebels. </P>
<P> It follows increasing pressure on the Tajik government from powerful neighbor Uzbekistan to take a more conciliatory line toward its opponents. </P>
<P> The Tajik conflict erupted in May 1992 and ended with the opposition alliance of democratic and Islamic groups fleeing into Afghanistan and mountains in eastern Tajikistan from where they have been running a guerrilla campaign. </P>
<P> Russia sent about 25,000 troops to help contain the fight and stop it spreading to other Central Asian states. Those forces have launched attacks on what Tajikistan says are rebel camps hidden inside Afghanistan. Kabul denies the existence of such camps. </P>
