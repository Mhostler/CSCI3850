<DATELINE>TORONTO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The prospects of the National Hockey League season opening on time dimmed further Tuesday after a fruitless eight hours of negotiations between the league and players' representatives. </P>
<P> The NHL put forward a new proposal towards the end of the marathon session but Players' Association executive director Bob Goodenow described it as nothing more than a salary cap -- something the players are vehemently opposed to. </P>
<P> After two days of talks in Toronto both sides were even less optimistic that a new collective bargaining agreement could be reached before the scheduled season opening on Saturday. Commissioner Gary Bettman has said no games will be played until a full agreement is reached. </P>
<P> No further meetings have been scheduled. </P>
<P> ``I wish I could report we made a lot of progress, but there hasn't been,'' Bettman told reporters before heading back to New York on Tuesday night. </P>
<P> ``I'm getting concerned that time is getting short.'' </P>
<P> Bettman declined to elaborate on the new proposal, which relates to the crucial issue of revenue sharing, but said it was not the NHL's final offer. </P>
<P> ``We have some wide rivers to cross. It (agreement) is not impossible but I do not hold out too much optimism.'' </P>
<P> Goodenow said he had yet to fully analyse the latest NHL offer but described it as ``unacceptable ... it is a system that is intended to retard players' salaries. </P>
<P> ``We are not per se at a dead end but we have got problems,'' he told reporters. </P>
<P> Goodenow said the biggest hurdle was the division between the two sides on revenue sharing, with both sides proposing their own ways of raising funds through ``taxing'' payrolls. Players say they oppose any plan that would directly or indirectly limit their salaries. </P>
<P> Players' representative Marty McSorley of the Los Angeles Kings said the team members were ready to exhaust all avenues in getting a deal, but added, ``If need be, this will be a long and drawn out fight.'' </P>
<P> Team owners and players have been without a contract since September 1993. The threat of a lockout -- although Bettman rejects that word -- has overhung the season since last week's talks in New York failed to break the impasse. </P>
<P> Bettman has repeatedly said the season would not start without a full collective bargaining accord because the league does not want to face the same crisis as baseball. </P>
<P> A strike by Major League Baseball players opposed to a salary cap led to the cancellation last month of the remainder of the season, the playoffs and World Series. </P>
<P> Kelly Miller of the Washington Capitals said he was very disappointed with the progress of the negotiations. </P>
<P> ``It was very clear today that a salary cap is what Gary Bettman wants.'' </P>
