<P>  Italy's company Alenia said Saturday it won in international bidding to provide badly needed air-traffic control systems for 15 airports in China. </P>
<P> The $63 million contract was the second for the unit of Finmeccanica under the so-called ``Marco Polo project.'' </P>
<P> Alenia has spent five years installing air-traffic control systems at 15 other Chinese airports under a 1989 contract. Those systems become fully operational at the end of this year, providing radar coverage for most of coastal China. </P>
<P> The new contract involves deployment of primary and secondary radars, control systems, computers, communications networks and training centers that will complete the air traffic control system for all of eastern China. </P>
<P> ``Once the four-year project has been completed, the eastern part of the country will have complete radar coverage, allowing China to overcome air traffic coordination problems with some of the neighboring countries,'' Alenia said in a statement. </P>
<P> Saphire, Alenia's joint venture with two local industrial groups, will provide technical support to the contract work, Alenia said. </P>
