<P>  Splintering her shins on at least half a dozen occasions could not deter Melisa Moses from taking part in gymnastics. </P>
<P> When she needed knee surgery, she considered it a minor inconvenience. </P>
<P> And she would still not give up after suffering a neck injury that came perilously close to paralyzing her. </P>
<P> But when her doctor removed a plaster cast from her hand after yet another accident and saw the state of her wrist joints, he decided she had to stop. </P>
<P> At that point, Moses' career in top level sport appeared to be over. But, just over six years later, she is competing at the Pan-American Games on the U.S. diving team and could be on the verge of a place at the Olympics. </P>
<P> With a history of injuries worthy of a motorcycling champion, the five-foot one-inch tall Moses, from Orange Park, Fla., is a candidate for the most durable competitor at the Pan-Am Games. </P>
<P> She took up gymnastics at the age of six and her talent for the sport quickly became apparent. But by the age of 12, she was spending almost as much time in the doctor's office as in the gymnasium. </P>
<P> First, a chipped bone in her elbow kept her inactive for around two months. ``Then I started suffering shin splints. I was put in plaster seven times, and each time lasted a couple of months,'' she said. </P>
<P> Worse was to come. At the age of 15, she fell off the parallel bars during training. ``When I landed, I couldn't move. After about 20 minutes my senses began to come back. They took me to the hospital and the doctor said I was lucky not to have broken my neck and that I could have been paralyzed.'' </P>
<P> Asked if that was when she gave up gymnastics, Moses replied casually: ``Oh no. I went straight back as soon as I could, it took about four months.'' </P>
<P> ``But then I had to have knee surgery,'' she smiled. ``I landed badly off the beam and it just popped out of the joint.'' </P>
<P> ``A lot of people told me I could suffer long-term injury if I continued but I didn't really care. When you're young, you don't tend to worry about those things, you think it can't happen to you.'' </P>
<P> Her doctor finally decided enough was enough after she broke her hand shortly before her 17th birthday, ironically in a domestic accident. ``He said 'you're not going back to the gym.' I thought he was kidding at first but then I realized he wasn't. It was the worst day of my life,'' she said. </P>
<P> But it was also her doctor who suggested she take up diving. Within two years she was competing at the national level. Last year she won the one-metre and three-metre events at the U.S. outdoor national championships. </P>
<P> Now 23, she is confident she can make the Olympics, something she admits she could not have done in gymnastics, a sport in which she nevertheless competed at national level. </P>
<P> ``I don't enjoy diving as much as I did gymnastics. I feel more fear, I'm afraid of hitting the board or smacking into the water.'' </P>
<P> In fact, the accidents continue to haunt her. She has already missed half a year after injuring her back during a dive. ``I don't think I'm clumsy. I've just had bad luck. All the accidents have happened when I've been doing well,'' she said. </P>
<P> Moses is not even free from the risk when she is away from the pool. Her favorite pastimes are skiing and horse-riding. </P>
