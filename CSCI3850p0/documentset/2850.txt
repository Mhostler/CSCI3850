<P>  The failure of NATO and the United Nations to halt the war in Bosnia has raised serious questions about each institution and could jeopardize U.S. funding for the United Nations, Senate Republicans said Sunday. </P>
<P> Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole of Kansas and Texas Sen. Phil Gramm said they planned to re-examine U.S. funding for the U.N. when they become the majority party in Congress next year. </P>
<P> Dole, speaking on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' termed the situation in Bosnia ``a classic failure, where NATO has been tied in knots -- they've almost become irrelevant,'' but said U.N. officials in Bosnia ought to leave as well. </P>
<P> ``Now I think we have a complete breakdown of NATO ... The U.N. ... probably ought to leave, too ... because in my view what they have done from the start is to help the Serb aggressors,'' said Dole, who is due to visit NATO headquarters in Brussels Tuesday. </P>
<P> Dole said the situation was ``going to have the Republican Congress taking a hard look at what we spend in the United Nations,'' adding they would be studying ways to cut funding. </P>
<P> Gramm, speaking on Cable News Network's ``Late Edition,'' echoed Dole's remarks, warning U.N. funding would be re-examined as part of a comprehensive overhaul of spending. </P>
<P> ``The U.N. is not going to be above being considered for funding reductions. I think we want to look at how much we're paying of the overall cost,'' Gramm said, adding, ``But I'm not ready to walk away from the U.N.'' </P>
