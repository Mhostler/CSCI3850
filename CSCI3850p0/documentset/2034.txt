<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Peace talks in the Netherlands between the Philippine government and communist rebels have collapsed, negotiators from both sides said Saturday, and Manila accused the insurgents of acting in bad faith. </P>
<P> The five-man government panel, in a statement issued in Amsterdam and released in Manila, said the rebels used a demand for safety guarantees for their men to seek ``full equality'' in negotiations. </P>
<P> ``We gave them every guarantee for safety and immunity that they required, without compromising the sovereignty of the republic, but this was rejected,'' the statement said. </P>
<P> The panel accused the communists of acting ``in manifest bad faith'' and added: ``The attempt by the (rebels) to sabotage the peace negotiations and cause a collapse of the talks is clear for everyone to see.'' </P>
<P> The communists in turn accused the government of reneging on issues of safety guarantees and immunity from prosecution. </P>
<P> They said the government tabled a ``patronizing'' proposal violating the spirit of equality in a joint declaration drawn up when talks began in 1992. </P>
<P> ``As far as we are concerned it is not possible to continue talks under the current circumstances,'' the rebels' chief negotiator Luis Jalandoni told Reuters in a telephone interview from their base in the central Dutch town of Utrecht. </P>
<P> Negotiations between the two sides, repeatedly held up by disputes, had aimed to forge a common agenda for formal negotiations to end the 24-year-old insurgency. </P>
<P> The collapse of the talks, the third round of preliminary discussions, is not expected to lead to renewed major fighting in the Philippines. The number of rebels has declined sharply to less than 7,000 from a peak of over 25,000 in 1987. </P>
<P> The communist movement has split in the last year, with most rebel leaders in the Philippines forming their own group. This larger group has told the government it would be willing to open preliminary talks. </P>
<P> Jose Maria Sison, leader of the rebel group in the Netherlands, heads a shrinking faction still loyal to him. </P>
<P> Sison has denounced the breakaway faction led by former guerrilla commanders Romulo Kintanar and Ricardo Reyes, calling them agents of the Philippine government. </P>
<P> At least one rebel commander has been killed by gunmen loyal to Sison. Independent analysts in the Philippines say his faction is increasingly isolated and only a small group remain loyal to him. </P>
