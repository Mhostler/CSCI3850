<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A Greek patrol boat opened fire at Turkish fishermen in the Aegean, in what the Turkish foreign ministry said Monday could lead to serious consequences between the two uneasy neighbors. </P>
<P> The incident Sunday renewed suspicions in Ankara that Greece was moving to expand its claim on the island-dotted sea. </P>
<P> ``We have strongly protested to the Greek embassy about the harassment of five Turkish fishing boats ... by a Greek patrol boat in international waters,'' foreign ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman said of the shooting, in which no one was hurt. </P>
<P> ``We demanded that such illegal procedures, which can have serious consequences, are not repeated,'' he said in a statement. </P>
<P> Foreign Minister Mumtaz Soysal told Turkish television earlier the shooting confirmed Turkey's fears that Greece planned to extend its claimed territorial waters to 12 nautical miles from its coasts instead of six. </P>
<P> ``If the waters were extended to 12 miles it would mean that Greece had made international waters uncrossable,'' Soysal said. ``We would never tolerate this. It would be a cause of war.'' </P>
<P> The fisherman said there was no warning before the first shots. </P>
<P> ``The Greeks came in a speed boat, dressed as civilians, and fired without saying a word first,'' one of the fisherman told Turkish television. </P>
<P> ``They said 'you are in Greek waters, go away to 12 miles,''' another fisherman said. </P>
<P> The two countries have argued for years over boundaries and rights of passage in the area, where Greek islands lie close to the Turkish coast. </P>
