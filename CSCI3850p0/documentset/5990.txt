<P>  Children without fathers at home have quadrupled in four decades so that now nearly one in every four American children does not live with dad, according to a foundation study released Monday. </P>
<P> The Annie E. Casey Foundation, which publishes an annual survey of children's problems, said 24 percent of children -- or some 19 million -- lived in mother-only families last year, compared to six percent in 1950. </P>
<P> The study, based on an analysis of government census and other statistics, said children without fathers at home are five times more likely to be poor and are more likely to drop out of school. </P>
<P> Girls in mother-only families are three times more likely to have children as unwed teen-agers, and boys without fathers present are more likely to have difficulty getting jobs as adults, land in jail or sire illegitimate children, according to the study. </P>
<P> The problem of children without fathers at home is among the core issues in the congressional debate over welfare reform. Reasons for absent fathers vary, ranging from divorce to poorly-educated young men unable to get jobs to help support familes. </P>
<P> The foundation criticized the federal government for ``an indifference'' to young males who are fathers or might become one.. </P>
<P> ``In our widely-shared desire to move poor families from welfare to work, we have focused on every conceivable strategy to equip, enable, train, cajole, compel, penalize and/or reward welfare mothers toward self-sufficient employment,'' the study said. </P>
<P> ``By contrast, almost no attention has been given to assessing, promoting or maximizing the employment and earning potential of the young men who are now or are likely some day to be fathers of dependent children.'' </P>
<P> It said ``new strategies'' must be developed if there is to be genuine welfare reform. </P>
<P> The Baltimore-based foundation is named for the mother of one of the founders of the United Parcel Service delivery firm and is devoted to helping poor and vulnerable children. </P>
