<P>  Feminist Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin is seen as a security risk not just by her own country but also by countries in the West, Bangladesh's Foreign Minister said Thursday. </P>
<P> ``Taslima Nasrin is seen as a security risk even in France. She asked for permission to stay in France for seven days but she was given as much as only 24 hours,'' Mustafizur Rahman told reporters during a visit to Kuala Lumpur. </P>
<P> ``That is an (indication) in itself that even the western world thinks that she has become a risk,'' Rahman said. </P>
<P> He is accompanying Bangladeshi Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia on a four-day official visit to Malaysia. </P>
<P> Mustafizur declined to comment on remarks made by Nasrin to a Swedish newspaper in which she was quoted as saying Islamic fundamentalist forces are gaining ground in her country and could one day take power. </P>
<P> ``She has been subjected to the law and she still remains under the purview of law and at this stage it is very difficult for us to make any comments,'' he said. </P>
<P> Nasrin, who fled to Sweden to escape death threats from Islamic militants in Bangladesh, told the Swedish daily, Svenska Dagbladet, that if progressive forces in Bangladesh did not organize, the fundamentalists could one day come to power. </P>
<P> Nasrin sparked major protests among Islamic militants in Bangladesh, who want her to be tried and hanged, for reportedly saying that Islam's holy book, the Koran, should be ``revised thoroughly.'' </P>
<P> She flew to Sweden on August 10, a week after Bangladesh's High Court granted her bail on the charge of insulting Muslim religious feelings. </P>
