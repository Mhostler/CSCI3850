<DATELINE>BETHLEHEM, West Bank (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A young Palestinian, ignoring Israeli soldiers in riot gear in Manger Square, has been driving around Bethlehem promising that Palestinians in the birthplace of Jesus Christ will have a merry Christmas. </P>
<P> ``This year, we have more joy and people are optimistic that we will finally have peace,'' said 21-year-old Raed Haddad. ``People want to be happy and have a good time.'' </P>
<P> Haddad handed out invitations Friday to a night of dancing and drinking at his new ``Earthquake Club,'' while a friend dressed in a Santa Claus uniform rang a Christmas bell. </P>
<P> After the violence of seven years of an uprising against Israeli occupation, Palestinians now appear to be in the mood to celebrate. </P>
<P> Restaurants advertise exquisite Christmas Eve dinners, including entertainment by local singers at $25 a person. Store windows are lit up with Christmas trees and colorful lights. Ornaments hang from lampposts in Manger Square. </P>
<P> ``This is the first Christmas in years where people really feel ready to celebrate,'' said businessman Nicola Canawati, who said he spent $55,000 of his own money on town Christmas decorations. </P>
<P> Israel handed over the self-rule enclaves of Gaza and Jericho in the West Bank to the Palestine Liberation Organization this year, along with responsibility over five spheres of life in the rest of the West Bank. </P>
<P> But many Palestinians in the West Bank said the festivities were still marred by Israeli occupation and economic hardships. </P>
<P> As in previous years in Bethlehem, Israeli soldiers clutching M-16 automatic rifles peered down from rooftops over Manger Square while others stood on main street corners. </P>
<P> Young Palestinian men looked over their shoulders while pasting posters on walls reminding people of the nearly 6,000 Palestinian prisoners still held in Israeli jails despite the 15-month-old peace deal with the PLO. </P>
<P> In his annual pre-Christmas message, the Roman Catholic leader of the Holy Land, Michel Sabbah, warned Israeli and Palestinian leaders that opposition to their peace moves would grow unless they sped up the peace process. </P>
<P> Many Palestinian businessmen complained of economic hardships, the result of an inexplicable decline in tourism revenues even though nearly 1 million pilgrims visited Bethlehem in 1994. </P>
<P> Christmas celebrations in Bethlehem came to a halt seven years ago when Palestinians in the occupied territories rose in revolt against Israeli military rule. </P>
<P> The holiday, which used to attract thousands of Christians from around the West Bank, was limited to religious ceremonies as Israeli soldiers threw a tight ring of security around Manger Square on Christmas Eve. </P>
<P> Last year, there was controversy over the raising of a Palestinian flag over the town hall. This year, dozens of Palestinian flags flew from the three-story building and from flagpoles around a fountain in front of the building. </P>
<P> But George Sammour, director of the tourism office in Bethlehem, said: ``Our joy is still incomplete. True joy would come once we celebrate Christmas under our own Palestinian sovereignty.'' </P>
