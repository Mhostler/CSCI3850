<NOTES>    SAN DIEGO (Reuter) - They saved the best for last.</NOTES>
<DATELINE></DATELINE>
<P> In the final and only exciting NFL divisional playoff game of the weekend, Stan Humphries threw an eight-yard touchdown pass to Mark Seay with 35 seconds left and the San Diego Chargers barely held on to their first lead of the game to edge the Miami Dolphins 22-21 Sunday. </P>
<P> The Chargers reached the AFC Championship game for the first time in 13 years and are one win away from their first Super Bowl appearance. They will play the Pittsburgh Steelers, who routed the Cleveland Browns 29-9 on Saturday. </P>
<P> In Sunday's other game, the two-time defending champion Dallas Cowboys romped past the Green Bay Packers 35-9 to set up a showdown in San Francisco against the 49ers for the NFC's Super Bowl berth. San Francisco blew out the Chicago Bears 44-15 on Saturday. </P>
<P> But Dallas star running back Emmitt Smith aggravated his hamstring injury and his status is uncertain for next week. </P>
<P> The San Diego-Miami game had a little bit of everything -- brilliant passing, pounding running, stout defense, a safety, controversial calls and a last-second field goal attempt. </P>
<P> Miami's Pete Stoyanovich missed a potential game-winning 47-yard field goal with one second left after the Dolphins had used an interference call to move into San Diego territory. </P>
<P> The Chargers used a powerful ground game and short passes to overcome a 15-point halftime deficit. </P>
<P> Humphries completed 28-of-43 passes for 276 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions. Natrone Means rushed for 139 yards and a score -- although replays indicated he was actually out of bounds just before scoring. </P>
<P> ``It's unbelieveable right now. It really is,'' said Humphries. ``Our defense came our the second half and held them to no points. </P>
<P> ``We never gave up,'' said Means. ``They said we couldn't run the ball against Miami, but we did.'' </P>
<P> Midway through the fourth quarter, it appeared San Diego had taken the lead on a 37-yard touchdown pass to Shawn Jefferson. But Jefferson was ruled out of bounds, even though replays showed he had two feet in bounds. </P>
<P> Earlier in the fourth quarter, Dolphins tight end Keith Jackson gave up the ball after a catch. The ball was recovered by the Chargers but officials ruled Jackson had thrown an illegal forward pass and Miami kept possession. </P>
<P> Trailing 21-6 at halftime, the Chargers kept the ball out of Miami quarterback Dan Marino's hands for most of the second half with more than 20 minutes of ball possession. </P>
<P> Marino completed 24-of-38 passes for 262 yards and three scores, all in the first half. Keith Jackson caught eight passes for 109 yards and two touchdowns for the Dolphins, who were outgained 202-26 on the ground. </P>
<P> Marino extended his record streak of playoff games with a touchdown pass to 12. </P>
<P> San Diego took the second-half kickoff and marched 71 yards in 15 plays to the Dolphins 1. But Means was knocked out of bounds a half-yard shy of the end zone, giving Miami possession. </P>
<P> On the next play, Bernie Parmalee was tackled in the end zone, giving the Chargers a safety. </P>
<P> In Dallas, Troy Aikman passed for a club playoff-record 337 yards and two touchdowns and running back Blair Thomas replaced the injured Smith and scored two touchdowns. </P>
<P> ``I think it boils down to Dallas making the big plays,'' Green Bay coach Mike Holmgren said. ``They hit big plays and that was what the game was about. They have a lot of weapons andf they used them today.'' </P>
<P> The Cowboys, who were playing their first playoff game under rookie head coach Barry Switzer and are seeking an unprecedented third straight Super Bowl title, have beaten the 49ers in the last two NFC title games. </P>
<P> Aikman enjoyed the best post-season game by any quarterback in Cowboy history, completing 23-of-30 passes for a club playoff-record 76.7 completion percentage. </P>
<P> ``We'll enjoy this one, but we know we've got a big game next week,'' said Cowboys receiver Michael Irvin, who earlier this week ``promised'' that the Cowboys would win a third straight Super Bowl. ``We'll go into that game like any other and that's with the attitude that we're going to win.'' </P>
<P> Aikman hit Alvin Harper with an NFL playoff record 94-yard touchdown pass in the first quarter and connected with tight end Scott Galbraith on a one-yard scoring play in the second quarter. </P>
<P> Dallas tight end Jay Novacek set a club playoff record with 11 catches for 104 yards. </P>
<P> ``Troy did a good job,'' said Novacek. ``His main objective is going to the guy who's open. Today it was me.'' </P>
<P> Irvin caught six passes for 111 yards and Harper had two receptions for 108 yards for the Cowboys. </P>
<P> The last time three players on the same team had 100 yards in a playoff game was in 1982 when Kellen Winslow, Wes Chandler and Charlie Joiner did it for San Diego against Miami. </P>
<P> Aikman's scoring pass to Harper eclipsed the playoff record set in 1963 when Daryle Lamonica hit Elbert Dubenion with a 93-yard touchdown for Buffalo against the Boston Patriots. </P>
<P> But not all the news was good for Dallas. Smith aggravated his left hamstring injury in the first quarter, after running for 44 yards and a touchdown, and left the game. Thomas replaced Smith and finished with 70 yards on 23 carries. </P>
<P> Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre completed 18-of-35 passes for 211 yards with one interception. </P>
<P> ``It was a good season,'' said Favre. ``Some could look at it that we're in the same position as last year but I feel we've improved.'' </P>
<P> The Cowboys beat Green Bay 27-17 last year in the first round of the NFC divisional playoffs. </P>
