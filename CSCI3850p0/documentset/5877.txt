<P>  Asia's growing economic power will see China, India and Japan boost their military strength substantially by 2010, and China's nuclear strike capabilities will span Asia and reach the U.S. East Coast, a top Australian defence expert says. </P>
<P> The United States will remain the Asia-Pacific's top military power, but its regional presence will shrink considerably, said Paul Dibbs, former deputy secretary of Australia's defence department and architect of its defence strategy. </P>
<P> ``By 2010 China will have a much more capable strategic nuclear force... ,'' Dibb wrote in the current May edition of Jane's Intelligence Review magazine. </P>
<P> ``They will be capable of targeting all of Asia, western Russia and the East Coast of the United States,'' said Dibb, head of strategic and defence studies at the Australian National University. </P>
<P> China can be expected to have 50 to 70 intercontinental ballistic missiles in mobile launchers with a range of up to 12,000 km (7,460 miles), Dibb said, basing his assessments on Asia's military trends of the past 15 years and each nation's stated intentions and economic strength. </P>
<P> China will modernise its 48-strong submarine force, buying 24 or more Russian Kilo-class submarines and building six ballistic missile submarines, enabling it to target all of Asia from submerged positions close to China, he said. </P>
<P> It will also probably have an aircraft carrier by 2010, two or three carriers in service by 2015, and a large number of surface-to-surface missiles with ranges up to 900 km (560 miles), equipped with nuclear and chemical warheads. </P>
<P> ``Given sustained economic growth the military capabilities of the great powers in Asia (China, India and Japan) will be substantially greater by 2010... ,'' Dibb said. </P>
<P> ``Armies will reduce in size but they will have greater and more accurate firepower, while mobility will be greatly improved. There will also be a greater emphasis on rapid deployment forces and special forces.'' </P>
<P> Better technology will enable Asian countries, especially East Asian nations like South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, to develop local defence industries and boost their capability. </P>
<P> ``The real danger is not the export of finished weapons to East Asia but the transfer of technology that enhances the ability of the region's states to build the next generation of weapons themselves,'' Dibb said. </P>
<P> Japan's military will focus on quality rather than quantity to increase its potency, he said. </P>
<P> ``Japan's highly advanced technological base by 2010 will mean that it could expand its military capabilities very rapidly indeed and with little warning... ,'' Dibb said. </P>
<P> India's military should remain the same size, but it would press ahead with its nuclear capabilities, targeting China and Pakistan, Dibb said. India's military development depends on whether it finds itself at war with Pakistan, he added. </P>
<P> The United States was likely to reduce its nuclear force in the Pacific and focus on home-based forces, pulling troops back to Hawaii, Guam, the U.S. West Coast and Alaska. </P>
<P> Despite Washington's recent comments that U.S. forces in the Pacific will stabilise at the current level of 100,000, Dibb believes the level could drop to around 50,000 by 2010. </P>
