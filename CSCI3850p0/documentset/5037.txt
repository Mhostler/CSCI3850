<P>  Clashes broke out in Burundi's capital Monday after Hutu gunmen killed two government soldiers and three Belgian civilians, including a four-year-old. </P>
<P> Prime Minister Antoine Nduwayo said he would give no casualty toll for Sunday's attack to avoid scaring people. </P>
<P> Witnesses said four people were killed in fighting Monday between stone-throwing youths of the Tutsi minority and Hutu majority at the capital's main market. Troops intervened to rescue Hutus cornered by Tutsi youths. </P>
<P> Other troops spread out to hunt Hutu fighters, even over the border in neighboring Tanazania. Kagera Regional Commissioner Phillip Mangula said soldiers from Burundi's Tutsi-dominated army were seen at Mgoma and Kasange in his region and Rusoro and Kagunga in nearby Kigoma region. </P>
<P> ``People in the bordering areas are terrified of Burundi soldiers who are saying that they are looking for members of the Hutu militia, Palipehutu,'' he told Reuters. </P>
<P> About 95 percent of Burundi's 17,000 soldiers and paramilitary gendarmes are Tutsis. </P>
<P> A police officer who refused to be named said 17 people, including the three Belgians, were killed Sunday on a main road seven miles southeast of Bujumbura. Six people were wounded. </P>
<P> Western diplomats and state-run Burundi radio put the toll at three Belgians and two Burundians killed. A Belgian doctor who treated the wounded said he knew of only five dead. </P>
<P> He said eight Belgians in a convoy of three cars were returning late to Bujumbura from a sporting event when they came under fire at Nyamutenderi. </P>
<P> The Belgian driver of the lead vehicle was shot in the hand and lost control of his car. He stopped and stepped out to show the gunmen he was white, not Tutsi, but was killed by a bullet in the head. </P>
<P> The doctor said a Belgian woman and her four-year-old daughter in the car were then also killed. Three other Belgians were wounded, including a nine-year-old. </P>
<P> Diplomats said they believed 10 off-duty soldiers stuck in traffic near the convoy of Belgians were the main target of the ambush. Two of the soldiers were killed. </P>
<P> At the scene, the body of one of the attackers still lay in bushes near the road as troops secured the area Monday. </P>
<P> The European Union, concerned about the worsening security situation in Burundi, pledged more help with human rights observance to the embattled central African country. </P>
<P> U.N. special envoy Ahmedou Ould Abdallah told Reuters, meanwhile, that an armed Hutu group led by ``General'' Donatien Nisigaro was responsible. ``We condemn violence from wherever it comes but especially this kind of blind attack by this Nisigaro,'' he said. </P>
<P> Some 50,000 people were butchered after Tutsi soldiers killed Melchior Ndadaye, its first freely-elected president, in October 1993. </P>
