<DATELINE>BEIRUT (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A Beirut court sentenced a Lebanese Muslim to four years' hard labor Thursday for covering up the 1976 murder of U.S. ambassador Francis E. Meloy, an embassy counsellor and their Lebanese driver. </P>
<P> The court convicted Nameq Kamel, 36, of hiding Meloy's car after guerrillas of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) snatched the victims at a checkpoint in mainly Muslim west Beirut during Lebanon's civil war. </P>
<P> The bodies of Meloy, economic counsellor Robert O. Waring and their driver Mohammed Moghrabi were found hours later in another district of west Beirut. </P>
<P> The court found a second accused Lebanese Muslim, Bassem al-Farkh, guilty on abduction charges but ordered his release under a 1991 civil war amnesty that excluded murdering foreign diplomats. </P>
<P> Kamel, a Sunni Muslim who was about 18 years old at the time of the ambassador's murder, surrendered to authorities on May 23 denying involvement in the killings. </P>
<P> Farkh has been serving a three-year sentence for drugs dealing. </P>
<P> Both men and a third suspect, all Lebanese and former PFLP guerrillas, were convicted in absentia by a Beirut court earlier in May and given life sentences. </P>
<P> But Lebanese law states that a suspect convicted in his absence must be re-tried if captured. </P>
<P> Prosecutor Nadim Abdul Malak said he would appeal the decision to free Farkh. Kamel's lawyer Mariana Faris said she would appeal his jail sentence. </P>
<P> The trial was the third involving the murder of a foreign diplomat this year as Lebanon's judicial system recovers from the 1975-90 civil war and authorities bring the killers of foreign envoys to justice. </P>
<P> Many foreigners and diplomats were kidnapped or killed during the war, making Beirut the world's kidnap centre during the 1980s. </P>
