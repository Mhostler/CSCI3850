<DATELINE>BEIRUT (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Lebanon's former Christian warlord, Samir Geagea, went on trial for two murder cases Saturday, becoming the first civil war leader to be arraigned. </P>
<P> Security was tight for the trial of the 42-year-old former leader of the once-powerful Lebanese Forces (LF) militia who is accused of a church bombing in February and the killing of a political rival in 1990. </P>
<P> Two thousand supporters, lawyers, journalists and spectators packed Beirut's Palace of Justice on the former Green Line frontline for Lebanon's most sensational trial since the 1975-90 civil war. </P>
<P> Geagea and his four co-defendants, including Lebanese Forces F second-in-command Fuad Malek, face possible death sentences. About 30 soldiers guarded them in the courtroom as the trial opened before a five-judge tribunal. </P>
<P> Ten other LF members are on trial in absentia in both cases. </P>
<P> Defense lawyers demanded immediate postponement of both cases, saying they had been allowed up to 30 minutes alone with the defendants to prepare. They also demanded transfer of the prisoners to a civil jail. </P>
<P> Before adjourning Saturday, the tribunal reserved ruling on the defense demands until the next sitting on Nov. 25-26 for the bombing case and Dec. 2-3 for the 1990 murder. </P>
<P> During Saturday's proceedings, Geagea looked pale and thin after seven months detention at the defense ministry but blew kisses and gave weary smiles to his wife and supporters who clapped loudly and chanted his nom de guerre ``Hakim'' (Doctor) as he entered the courtroom. </P>
<P> After a second outburst of applause, the chief judge on the tribunal, Lebanon's highest court, asked soldiers to throw out anyone who applauded again. ``This is not a play,'' he added. </P>
<P> Hundreds of Geagea supporters chanting prayers in the street were kept back hundreds of yards from the court as a phalanx of 120 black-robed lawyers marched in to defend him. </P>
<P> Geagea is accused of planning and ordering the Feb. 27 bombing of a church north of Beirut in which 11 people died and 60 were injured, and of the 1990 assassination of Christian leader Dani Chamoun and his family. </P>
<P> Geagea has denied the charges, alleging a plot to destroy the Lebanese Forces which became a political party in 1991 and was the toughest opponent of the Syrian-dominated political order in post-war Lebanon. </P>
