<P>  Law enforcement officials said Tuesday they were not hunting for a paramilitary recruiter who sent a Congressman a note giving details of last week's Oklahoma City bombing about an hour after it happened. </P>
<P> ``We don't want him and the FBI doesn't want him, and there's no search,'' Lt. R.J. Smith of the Washtenaw County sheriff's office said of Mark Koernke. </P>
<P> Koernke, a 37-year-old janitor at the University of Michigan and a top recruiter for a faction of the Michigan Militia, was reported to have packed up his family and fled. </P>
<P> Timothy McVeigh, the chief suspect in the case, and two of his associates, Michigan farmers Terry and James Nichols, are reported to have had connections to the Michigan Militia. </P>
<P> ``They can raid all they want -- he's gone,'' the Detroit News Monday quoted his brother William as saying. ``He's trying to avoid all the nonsense. He told our sister he wasn't appreciative of all the publicity going on out on his front lawn.'' </P>
<P></P>
<P> ``First update: Bdlg 7 to 10 floors only. Military People on Scene -- BATF/FBI. Bomb threat received last lweek. Perpetrator unknown at this time. Oklahoma.'' </P>
<P> Stockman, a strong opponent of gun control, said he told his staff to turn the paper over to the FBI. But TV networks said he had given it to the National Rifle Association. </P>
<P> On Monday both Justice Department spokesman Carl Stern and the NRA supported Stockman's account. Stern said a Stockman aide sent the fax to the FBI's office of public and congressional affairs less than two hours after the bombing. </P>
<P> Stern said the aide also called the FBI to make sure the fax had been received and give further information about the sender. </P>
<P> The NRA said in a statement it had been contacted on Wednesday evening by a member of Stockman's staff, who asked for help in explaining the word ``Wolverine'' which appeared at the top of the fax. </P>
<P> Koernke is a well-known figure in the Michigan Militia, a paramilitary group opposed to gun control and government interference. The group's members don camouflage and hold gun training exercises in remote areas. </P>
<P> The militia movement -- which traces its roots to the home-grown military units that helped beat the British in the American Revolution more than 200 years ago -- has grown rapidly in recent years in a number of states. </P>
<P> The fiery end of the Branch Davidian cult in a standoff with government two years to the day of the Oklahoma City bombing has swollen militia membership with people who saw the Texas calamity as an example of outlaw activity by government agents. </P>
<P> John Nutter, an assistant professor at Michigan State University who is an expert on the militia movement, said Koernke ``travels around talking and recruiting. He recruits as 'Mark from Michigan.''' </P>
<P> Koernke's supervisors at the University of Michigan said he had been employed there since January, 1982, had been promoted twice and is considered an employee in good standing. </P>
<P> They said he did not report for work Monday and told supervisors he was taking a personal leave day. </P>
