<P>  An American who smokes up to 12 marijuana cigarettes a day for medicinal purposes was forced to return home after Britain refused to allow him to bring the illegal drug into the country, a London newspaper said Friday. </P>
<P> Bob Randall, 46, receives the drug free on prescription from a druggist in Washington D.C. who is licensed to supply him. He claims he will go blind within days unless he smokes the drug. </P>
<P> ``He has been forced to return to America because the Home Office (Interior Ministry) refused his lawyer's application for the right to bring the reefers with him,'' The Times said. </P>
<P> Randall, who is one of eight people in the U.S. allowed by law to receive the drug on prescription, had been invited to meet politicians and academics in London as part of a campaign to legalize marijuana for medical use in Europe and the United States. </P>
