<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Yasar Kemal, Turkey's best known living author, said Friday he had been summoned to appear before an Istanbul prosecutor to explain comments critical of the state's handling of the Kurdish issue. </P>
<P> The summons followed publication in Turkey of excerpts from an article Kemal wrote for the German magazine Der Spiegel. </P>
<P> ``I have an appointment with the prosecutor of the state security court at 11 a.m. Monday,'' he said. ``An investigation has been started. But I don't know what the charge is. Most likely separatism,'' he said. </P>
<P> Kemal is the author of ``Ince Memed'' (''Memed, My Hawk''), the best known Turkish literary work abroad. </P>
<P> The author has been under steady attack from politicians, critics and newspaper columnists since Jan. 10, when Hurriyet daily published what it said were translated excerpts from Der Spiegel. </P>
<P> Hurriyet quoted Kemal as saying a 10-year-old separatist Kurdish insurgency in the southeast was born of ``mistreatment of Kurds under an opressive and brutal regime.'' </P>
<P> According to Hurriyet, Kemal accused Turkey of leading what he termed a ``campaign of lies'' to convince people that Kurds sought only to divide the state. </P>
<P> The author dismissed Hurriyet's translations as incomplete and full of ``very big mistakes.'' </P>
<P> ``For years, in all my writings, I have said that Turkey must not be divided,'' Kemal said. ``Would I encourage separatism?'' </P>
<P> More than 14,000 people have died in Turkey in the insurgency led by the Kurdistan Workers Party. </P>
