<P>  Indonesia is planning to set up a body that will include environmentalists to resolve disputes arising from timber firms' takeovers of logging areas occupied by farmers, an environment group said Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``This was disclosed to us by Forestry Minister Djamaluddin Soeryohadikusumo at a meeting yesterday,'' said Emy Hafild, coordinator of the private Indonesian Forum for Environment. </P>
<P> ``This is the first time environmental groups have been given the opportunity to sit alongside government officials to help resolve land disputes,'' she said. </P>
<P> She said the details were being worked out and she was optimistic the body would be launched soon. </P>
<P> The move comes as thousands of Indonesian farmers were preparing to oppose the takeover of their land by timber companies in heavily-forested Kalimantan and Sumatra islands. </P>
<P> Hafild had said Tuesday the situation in Kalimantan's Sandai district was particularly volatile as 1,600 Dayaks had begun burning base camps and bridges. </P>
<P> Indonesia, home to the world's largest tropical forests after Brazil, has been accused by the World Bank of felling trees at faster than sustainable levels. </P>
<P> The sprawling archipelago produced 1,109 million cubic feet of timber a year between 1989 and 1993. It earned $4.5 billion from forest-based exports in 1993, of which 75 percent was from plywood. </P>
<P> Stung by international criticism, Indonesia has begun taking measures to preserve its vast forests. </P>
<P> Hafild said setting up the body was a step in the right direction ``because of the so many land disputes'' in the sprawling archipelago, home to an estimated 188 million people. </P>
<P> She said the forestry minister also assured her that the government would investigate the land disputes in Sumatra and Kalimantan, Indonesia's half of Borneo island. </P>
