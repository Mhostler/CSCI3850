<DATELINE>KIGALI, Rwanda (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The siege of Rwanda's Kibeho camp went into its 13th day Friday, with about 1,400 Hutus still refusing government orders to quit the filthy and infected site. </P>
<P> U.N. officials, quoting reports from Kibeho, said only a few score of the exhausted and hungry refugees left the compound where they have been holed up since April 22. </P>
<P> ``We estimate that 105 left today by U.N. truck,'' Barney Mayhew, a U.N. operations officer, said. </P>
<P> ``The situation is calm and the army is on its best behavior but the movement out of the compound is very slight today,'' another U.N. official in the southern town of Butare, near Kibeho, said. </P>
<P> He said a total of 277 agreed to leave Thursday, returning to their home districts by U.N. truck or on foot. According to U.N. Rwanda Emergency Office (UNREO) figures, that meant 1,506 men, women and children were still in Kibeho before Friday's departures. </P>
<P> Their leaders, some armed, are demanding safe passage to Zaire, home to 1.2 million Hutu refugees after last year's genocide and civil war. </P>
<P> The Kigali government has refused to let the Hutus leave the country and has cut off their food and water, accusing many of crimes of genocide. But it has promised not to use any more violence to force them out of the compound. </P>
<P> The Rwanda Patriotic Army (RPA), whose troops are overwhelmingly from the Tutsi minority, was internationally condemned for the bloodbath at Kibeho April 22. </P>
<P> The United Nations says at least 2,000 Hutus were killed by army fire or in panic stampedes that day after troops tried to forcibly clear 100,000 internally displaced people in Kibeho. </P>
<P> The government says the death toll was little more than 300 but has agreed to allow an international commission investigate. Foreign forensic and other experts are arriving in Kigali and the commission will start work May 8. </P>
<P> Two lieutenant-colonels who commanded the troops at Kibeho were suspended this week while the army launches its own probe, Defense Minister and Vice-President Paul Kagame said Thursday. </P>
<P> The Kibeho incident has gravely damaged the new government's image and led to a suspension of some foreign aid. </P>
<P> It has ended the trickle of Hutu refugees in Zaire and Tanzania willing to return home -- only 730 of the two million total in the two neighbouring countries came back in April, according to the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR. </P>
<P> The refugees are under pressure from their Hutu government-in-exile not to go back until Kigali accepts a power-sharing deal. </P>
<P> The detention of at least 30,000 Hutu returnees, accused of acts of genocide and other crimes last year, is a powerful disincentive for those contemplating going home. </P>
<P> The courts martial of a few RPA soldiers, accused of murder, theft and other crimes, were adjourned until May 15, military guards at the courtroom in Kigali told reporters Friday. </P>
