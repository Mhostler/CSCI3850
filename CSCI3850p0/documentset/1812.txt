<P> Joyner, accompanied by his wife and fellow Olympic champion Florence Grifftith Joyner, spoke at a press conference outside the U.S. District Courthouse where jury selection got under way in his $2 million civil rights lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles. </P>
<P> ``I'm not used to having guns pointed in my face...and I don't want nobody else to go through that,'' said Joyner, who believes police stopped his 1984 Nissan 300 ZX with the license plate ``TRACK'' solely because he is black. </P>
<P> Joyner says the May 8 stops on Hollywood Boulevard eventually caused him to drop out of the 1992 Olympic trials and a chance to represent the United States at the 1992 games in Barcelona. </P>
<P> ``Fear completely took over,'' Joyner said. </P>
<P> One of Joyner's lawyers, John Burton, said other prominent blacks such as actor Blair Underwood, trial lawyer Johnnie Cochran and football star Marcus Allen have also been subject to police stops simply because they are black. </P>
<P> Donald Norris, another of Joyner's attorneys, said U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter has previously ruled that police violated Joyner's civil rights during the stops. </P>
<P> Norris said jurors must now decide the liability of former Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates and the amount of compensatory and punitive damages that could be awarded. </P>
<P> Gates was forced to resign early in the wake of the April 1992 riots that wracked Los Angeles following the state court acquittals of four white police officers accused in the 1991 videotaped beating of black motorist Rodney King. </P>
<P> Two of the officers were later convicted of violating King's civil rights and are serving 30-month terms that could be increased following an appeals court decision that the sentences were too lenient. </P>
<P> King sued the city and earlier this year won $3.8 million dollars in compensatory damages for injuries suffered in the beating, but the jury refused to order any of the officers involved to pay punitive damages. </P>
<P> In Joyner's case, police have said the first traffic stop was made because Joyner was driving erratically and the second because his car matched a Mazda that was involved in a hit-and-run. They have denied that race played a role in either instance. </P>
