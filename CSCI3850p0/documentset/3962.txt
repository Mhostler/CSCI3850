<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  American companies expect health insurance costs to rise less than 2 percent this year, the slowest rate of growth in nearly 15 years, a survey said Wednesday. </P>
<P> The survey by Towers Perrin, a New York-based management consultant, said the average expected cost increase reported by employers surveyed was less than 2 percent for nearly every type of health care plan, down from about 6 percent last year. </P>
<P> The low rate of cost growth is ``remarkably good news for employers'' and reflects the ongoing effects of managed care and increased competition in the health care industry, Towers Perrin said in a statement. </P>
<P> ``I've been working with health care plans since the early 1980s and I don't think I've seen anything this low,'' William Falk, a health benefits specialist at Towers Perrin, said. </P>
<P> The slowdown in cost increases reflects a trend reaching back several years, Falk said. ``But the drop in the last three years has been precipitous,'' he said in a telephone interview. </P>
<P> Excluding health maintenance organizations (HMOs), the survey group said it expected monthly costs of $187 for employee-only coverage in 1995, and $517 a month for family coverage, defined as the employee plus at least two dependents, the survey said. </P>
<P> That was up just 1.6 percent from 1994 reported levels, and compared with overall inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index of 2.6 percent in 1994, Towers Perrin said. </P>
<P> The figures reflect the reported costs of health care premiums and expected costs for 1995 from 145 employers, mostly companies from Fortune magazine's list of America's 1,000 largest companies, Towers Perrin said. </P>
