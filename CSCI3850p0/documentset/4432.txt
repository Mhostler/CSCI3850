<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.(Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Coast Guard helicopters searched unsuccessfully Saturday for a 14-year-old cruise ship passenger who jumped overboard after a fight with his parents and leaving a suicide note, a Coast Guard spokesman said. </P>
<P> The youth, identified as Grant Medeiros of Saanich, British Columbia, disappeared late Friday evening as the Regal Princess cruise ship was steaming toward Port Everglades in the Fort Lauderdale area. </P>
<P> The boy's sneakers and eyeglasses were found on deck, Coast Guard petty officer Steve Aitkins said. </P>
<P> ``The family was having some stress and there had been an argument that night. The boy was upset and said he didn't want to be on the cruise,'' Aitkins said. </P>
<P> After searching the ship Friday night, his parents and brother returned to their cabin and found a suicide note written by the boy, Aitkins said. </P>
<P> Several Coast Guard helicopters and patrol boats methodically searched a 170-square mile area off Miami on Saturday, but found no signs of the missing boy. </P>
<P> A life preserver bearing the name of the cruise ship washed ashore Saturday near Boca Raton, Coast Guard officials said. It was not immediately clear whether the life preserver had any connection to the boy's disappearance. </P>
<P> The ship, owned by Princess Cruises, was about 10 miles southeast of Miami at the time the boy is believed to have jumped off the ship, the Coast Guard said. </P>
<P> Coast Guard officials said they had not yet decided whether to resume their search on Sunday. </P>
<P> ``There's very little hope that the boy would have survived through the night, even if he had that life ring that we found near Boca Raton,'' Aitkins said. </P>
<P> ``For one thing, if he jumped off near the ship's stern, as we believe he did, he would have been immediately sucked underneath the water by the power of the ship's huge propellers,'' he said. </P>
<P> The ship was returning to Florida from Cozumel, a popular resort in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. </P>
