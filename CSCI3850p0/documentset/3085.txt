<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark 8 (Reuter) -</DATELINE>
<P>  The federal judge who accepted the guilty plea of former Associate Attorney General Webster Hubbell withdrew from the case Thursday, meaning that another judge will impose sentence on Hubbell. </P>
<P> U.S. District Judge William R. Wilson said it was ``well known'' that both he and Hubbell were appointed by President Clinton and that he knew the Clintons socially. </P>
<P> Hubbell pleaded guilty Tuesday to charges brought by Whitewater special prosecutor Kenneth Starr of defrauding the Rose Law Firm of Little Rock and some of its clients of nearly $400,000 by submitting false expense reports and over-billing. </P>
<P> Wilson, speaking from his car via cellular telephone, told attorneys assembled in his court chambers that he was recusing himself from the case. </P>
<P> Reporters were present during the teleconference. </P>
<P> Hillary Rodman Clinton was a partner with Hubbell in the Rose Firm. President Clinton appointed Hubbell to the Justice Department in 1993, and Hubbell resigned last March when allegations of financial irregularities in the Rose Firm surfaced. </P>
<P> ``Mr. Hubbell has the right to enter a guilty plea. I have no problem with the plea portion of the case,'' Wilson said. </P>
<P> Wilson said his past relationship with the President and First Lady and the fact that both he and Hubbell ``were active in legal affairs in Arkansas'' meant that he could not continue in the case and meet ``the appearance of justice.'' </P>
<P> Wilson said during the teleconference that Hubbell was an acquaintance with whom he had spent perhaps eight hours over the years. </P>
<P> ``It's not fair to Mr. Hubbell or to the Office of the Independent Counsel,'' Wilson said. </P>
<P> The judge noted that he drew Hubbell's case by random computer assignment in the U.S. District Clerk's office. The computer will now select another federal judge to impose sentence on Hubbell. </P>
<P> Wilson said his past relationship with the Clintons was made known to both sides in the case prior to the guilty plea. </P>
<P> ``I appreciate the confidence expressed in me by both Mr. Hubbell and the Independent Counsel,'' Wilson said. </P>
<P> Hickman Ewing, senior counsel to Whitewater special prosecutor Kenneth W. Starr, said Starr had ``no basis'' for Wilson to disqualify himself. </P>
<P> Hubbell was the third person associated with the Clintons to plead guilty to crimes and the closest to President and Mrs. Clinton. He could be sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined $500,000 plus making restitution. </P>
