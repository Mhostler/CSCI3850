<DATELINE>DAMASCUS, Syria (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Hafez al-Assad has told Secretary of State Warren Christopher that Syria wants Arab-Israeli peace talks to succeed, his spokesman said Wednesday. </P>
<P> Joubran Kourieh told Reuters the Syrian leader also presented views that Syria believes would achieve real progress in Syria's negotiations with Israel. </P>
<P> He gave no details but said: ``President Assad affirmed that Syria was looking forward to making the peace process, especially on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks, a success.'' </P>
<P> Christopher, touring the region to further the 33-month-old Middle East peace process, left Damascus Wednesday for Jordan and will return to Syria Friday after a visit to Israel to brief Israeli leaders on the Syrian ideas. </P>
<P> Syria's talks with Israel are stalled over the issues of future ties between the two countries and Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which it captured in 1967. </P>
<P> Israel has offered to withdraw from the plateau over eight years provided Syria commits itself to full normal relations, including exchange of embassies and trade. Syria says the withdrawal must come first. </P>
<P> Christopher told reporters Tuesday after more than five hours of talks with Assad that he presented latest U.S. thinking on the problem to the Syrian leader. </P>
<P> He described the talks as useful but held out little hope of a quick solution. </P>
<P> ``We are still in the process of a very difficult negotiation. The issues are complicated and inter-twined,'' Christopher said. </P>
