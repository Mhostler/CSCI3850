<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Jimmy Carter, whose achievements as president fell short of his own expectations, has earned more plaudits since as a globe-trotting mediator and peacemaker intent on defusing international crises. </P>
<P> In 1994 alone -- 13 years since leaving the White House -- the Georgian with the toothy grin and honeysuckle accent jumped into center stage in two major world hot spots. </P>
<P> He led a U.S. delegation dispatched to Haiti by President Clinton to persuade that country's military junta to step aside and avert a U.S. invasion of their country. </P>
<P> Last June, the Democratic elder statesman mounted a self-assigned peace mission to North Korea, helping to temper a nuclear dispute that many feared could have led to a new war on the divided Korean peninsula. </P>
<P> Carter has been nominated for this year's Nobel Peace Prize, at least the fifth time he has been nominated, because of his many peacemaking efforts. Some analysts speculated his efforts in Port-au-Prince could clinch him the prize, which will be announced October 14 in Oslo, Norway. </P>
<P> Carter, who was president from 1977 to 1981, met in June with North Korea's now-dead Stalinist leader Kim Il-sung over Kim's refusal to allow international inspectors to verify that plutonium from a nuclear power plant was not being diverted to make nuclear weapons. </P>
<P> The United States, a close ally of South Korea, put on hold a planned military buildup after Carter phoned the White House and notified Clinton that Kim had softened his hard-line stance against inspections. </P>
<P> In 1976, when America was still reeling from the Watergate scandals, Carter campaigned as a champion of the people who would restore integrity and competence to government. He formally took office in January 1977. </P>
<P> The former Georgia governor breezed out of nowhere to win the Democratic Party nomination, defeat incumbent Republican President Gerald Ford and take office as a kind of modern populist hero. </P>
<P> In 1980, with the economy crumbling and the Iran hostage crisis inflaming passions, he was swept from office by Ronald Reagan in a defeat of humbling proportions. Reagan took office in January 1981. </P>
<P> The conservative Republican, pledging to restore America to world respect and leadership, won 44 of the 50 states, including all of Carter's native South except Georgia. </P>
<P> Carter returned home to Plains, Georgia, and for some years led a life of relative obscurity, treated like a pariah by the leaders of his own party and shunned by its candidates. </P>
<P> But he eventually replaced the forgotten-man image with that of busy elder statesman and diplomatic mediator, using skills honed at the White House in promoting historic Israeli-Egyptian peace talks -- and winning far more public affection than he ever enjoyed as president. </P>
<P> ``People who thought he was a disaster in the White House regard him as a model elder statesman,'' columnist Mary McGrory wrote of his rebound. ``He goes everywhere, doing good.'' </P>
<P> Indulging a passion for ``crisis resolution'' and operating as a private citizen from his Carter Center in Atlanta, he promoted peace talks between Ethiopia and Eritrean rebels and headed an observer team at 1990 Nicaraguan elections that shifted power from the Sandinistas to the opposition. </P>
<P> He led a similar observer delegation at elections in Panama in 1989 and lent authoritative voice to charges the ballot had been sabotaged by strongman Manuel Noriega. </P>
<P> By 1993, he was an honored visitor at fellow Democrat Bill Clinton's White House, backing Clinton up in his efforts to win passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement and helping celebrate the Israeli-Palestinian peace breakthrough. </P>
<P> Carter also regularly donated his services as a skilled carpenter to build housing for the poor. With wife Rosalynn he wrote a 1987 best-seller, ``Everything to Gain: Making the Most of the Rest of Your Life.'' </P>
<P> Looking back from the vantage point of these retirement projects, the driven and stiff-necked leader of old seemed mellow and happy in a 1991 television film, ``Citizen Carter.'' </P>
<P> Asked to assess his own presidency, he said: ``He tried hard, attempted the right things, was not always successful. Maybe he was naive in many ways.'' </P>
<P> He added: ``The biggest failure we had was a political failure. I never was able to convince the American people that I was a forceful and strong leader.'' </P>
<P> He left office with one epic foreign policy achievement -- the 1979 Camp David accord between Egypt and Israel -- plus a modest list of domestic reforms. </P>
<P> He brought Egypt's President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to Camp David for grueling negotiations September 6-17, 1978. Later, when the accords seemed to be unraveling, Carter saved the day by flying to Cairo and Jerusalem for personal shuttle diplomacy. </P>
<P> The treaties ended a state of war between Israel and Egypt, provided for Israeli withdrawal from Egypt's Sinai Peninsula and established diplomatic relations. They were signed at the White House on March 26, 1979. </P>
