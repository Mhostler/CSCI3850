<P> The English language daily said it was unclear whether there had been any change in the 90-year-old patriarch's health. </P>
<P> It quoted unidentified sources as saying the Communist Party politburo has advised the Deng children to do so in order to avoid questions about their father's health. </P>
<P> Deng was the subject of intense speculation late last year and the recent death of elderly leader Chen Yun was expected to sparked renewed concerns over his health. </P>
<P> The Eastern Express said Deng Rong, Deng's youngest daughter and author of a book about him, had cancelled a visit to Tokyo next month. </P>
<P> A spokesman for the Japan-China Friendship Association said at the weekend that Deng Rong had cancelled her planned attendance of its foundation meeting, the paper said. </P>
