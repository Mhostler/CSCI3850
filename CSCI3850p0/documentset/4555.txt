<P>  A pall of oily black smoke rising over Grozny darkened the skies over Chechnya Saturday, stretching dozens of miles west toward neighboring Ingushetia, witnesses said. </P>
<P> It was unclear what had caused the smoke in the city, a major oil refining center. Reporters were unable to reach Grozny from the rebel side. Officials in Moscow and the Ingushi capital of Nazran said they had not heard of any major fire. </P>
<P> The fires followed a night of heavy Russian shelling of Chechen positions south and west of the city. Local residents gave contradictory explanations of what was happening. </P>
<P> Some said Chechen fighters in Grozny had dumped oil into the canal that runs through the city and set it on fire to screen their movements from the Russian soldiers. Others said Grozny's oil refinery was on fire. </P>
<P> Last month, when the Russians and rebels were fighting for control of Grozny, oil tanks on the western outskirts of the city caught fire and burned for almost two weeks. </P>
<P> Moscow officials said after Russian troops had seized Grozny two weeks ago that the oil refinery and oil tanks in Grozny had been taken under special protection and were secure. </P>
