<P>  The international publishers of an edition of the Bible which Jewish groups say is anti-Semitic have said they will not stop its distribution. </P>
<P> The Rome-based International Catholic Biblical Society said in a statement that the ``Bible of Christian Communities'' was not anti-Semitic and did not include anything that was intended to hurt the Jewish people. </P>
<P> The society, which was set up with Vatican approval some 30 years ago to promote reading of the Bible, said controversy over the new edition risked fanning anti-Semitism. </P>
<P> A copy of the statement, dated March 21, was received by Reuters Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``The society refuses to get into an argument with people and groups who inspire these attacks. Their excesses could even rekindle the fires of anti-Semitism,'' the statement said. </P>
<P> ``The intentions of the Bible of Christian Communities are not anti-Jewish and nor are its authors. Nor is its tenor and nor are its texts and all its readers know that. Nothing was included in order to hurt the Jewish people,'' it said. </P>
<P> Jewish groups have blasted the Bible, which contains footnotes reflecting old-fashioned Catholic attitudes. </P>
<P> Jewish circumcision, for instance, is described as a ``a folkloric obligation.'' </P>
<P> It also says that ``for centuries people have spoken of the Jewish people as those who killed God. It was true in a sense, because this people was unable to overcome its fanaticism.'' </P>
