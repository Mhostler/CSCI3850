<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The crew of a fishing boat caught more than they bargained for Wednesday when they hauled in their nets and found a live World War II mine. </P>
<P> The five crew members on the boat, Irene's Way, landed a seven-ft long mine with four fins while fishing near the Farallon Islands, about 25 miles west of San Francisco, the Coast Guard said. </P>
<P> The catch turned out to be a World War II-vintage MK-13 mine of the type put down by the U.S. Navy outside the Golden Gate Bridge to protect the California coast during the war, it said. </P>
<P> Coast Guard spokesman Petty Officer Jeff Murphy said the mine contained 750 lbs of explosives and was still live after 50 years. The crew sailed back to its home port of Monterey, Calif., before notifying the Coast Guard. </P>
<P> The Coast Guard recommended that the vessel anchor one mile off Monterey Harbor and set up a half-mile safety zone around the vessel to ensure it posed no danger. </P>
<P> All five crew members were safely evacuated by a Coast Guard boat and an army explosives team was called in to disarm the mine, the Coast Guard said. </P>
<P> The army explosives experts successfully removed the fuse in the mine's nose cone, ending any immediate threat, although the mine remained dangerous, Murphy said. He said a Navy explosives team was on its way to the boat to help render the mine completely safe. </P>
<P> Murphy said the fishermen were surprised by their catch, but not afraid. He said they seemed ``more concerned about getting their fish back.'' </P>
