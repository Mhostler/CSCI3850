<DATELINE>PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  U.S. servicemen returned to Cambodia Thursday on a regular, non-U.N. mission for the first time since the end of the Indochina war in 1975. </P>
<P> The 14 servicemen would spend the next few months training Cambodian troops to clear mines, U.S. Embassy spokesman David Miller told Reuters. </P>
<P> Cambodia, one of the world's most heavily mined countries after decades of war, has an estimated 10 million uncleared land mines which continue to injure unsuspecting villagers. </P>
<P> The 14 servicemen would soon be joined by other mine-clearers and 45 army engineers, who are specialists in road building. </P>
<P> The mine-clearers would not be deployed to the frontline provinces in Cambodia's northwest, Miller said. The Khmer Rouge guerrillas continue to wage war against government forces there. </P>
<P> A British mine-clearing charity, Halo Trust, has warned that failure by other nations to financially support mine-clearing teams will mean Cambodians doing the job ``one leg at a time.'' </P>
<P> U.SS army personnel were deployed to Cambodia as ``blue beret'' military observers during the U.N. peacekeeping operation which formally ended late last year. </P>
