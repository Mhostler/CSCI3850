<P>  Saudi Arabia's King Fahd said Iraq should not be rewarded for igniting a new Gulf crisis and sanctions against it should only be lifted once it implements fully all resolutions over its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. </P>
<P> Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal said the king made his comments at a meeting on Saturday night with Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, who has toured the Gulf to explain his country's efforts to defuse the crisis. </P>
<P> The official Saudi Press Agency said on Sunday Prince Saud was speaking at a joint news conference with Kozyrev, before the Russian minister left for New York for talks with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. </P>
<P> Kozyrev said he was confident that he and Christopher would ``explain all matters in the spirit of cooperation... We have a few questions about the American position.'' </P>
<P> Prince Saud said the king expressed hope that Iraq should not ``receive any benefits'' from massing troops near Kuwait. </P>
<P> ``The king also expressed hope that the Security Council will take a decisive action and not just call for the withdrawal of Iraqi troops to where they came from but to assert that such action will not be repeated in the future,'' the prince said. </P>
<P> The U.N. Security Council late on Saturday demanded that Iraq pull its troops back from the Kuwaiti border and told Baghdad not to threaten its neighbours again. </P>
<P> A U.S.-drafted resolution was passed unanimously by the Council after a week-long confrontation between Iraq and Kuwait's U.S.-led allies, triggered by Iraqi troop movements. </P>
<P> The resolution condemns the Iraqi deployments, orders Baghdad to send the elite Revolutionary Guard back to base and demands that it not use its forces in a hostile or provocative manner towards either its neighbours or U.NN operations in Iraq. </P>
<P> Kozyrev has also visited the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait to explain details of a Russian plan under which Baghdad would recognise Kuwait and its borders and Russia would push to ease U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq. </P>
