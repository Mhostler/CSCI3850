<P>  Food stamp enrollment reached its lowest level in two years with 26.76 million Americans registered, the Agriculture Department said Friday. </P>
<P> Food stamps are the major U.S. anti-hunger program, helping poor people buy groceries. Maximum benefit for a family of four is $386 per month. </P>
<P> Participation in February, the latest month for which figures were available, was the lowest since January 1993, a department spokesman said. The number of Americans enrolled was 26.76 million. </P>
<P> ``It's certainly encouraging,'' said the spokesman. ``It could signal an improvement in the economy.'' </P>
<P> Enrollment usually is highest during winter and periods of economic stress. The record enrollment was 27.97 million in March 1994. Participation last January was 27.08 million. </P>
<P> California led the nation with 3.18 million participants, followed by Texas with 2.58 million and New York with 2.2 million. </P>
<P> States with more than one million enrolled were Florida with 1.37 million, Ohio and Pennsylvania with 1.17 million, and Illinois with 1.14 million. </P>
