<P>  Maya peasant rebels in Mexico's southern state of Chiapas warned of an ''imminent'' return to war with the army and troop movements by both Tuesday indicated they might not be bluffing. </P>
<P> Guerrilla chief Subcomandante Marcos said in a statement released late Monday that the Zapatista National Liberation Army was ``preparing the advance of our units. ... The restart of the war is imminent.'' </P>
<P> Marcos has threatened to renew attacks several times over the last six months without acting, but tensions in the state are running at their highest since a cease-fire was agreed in mid-January, and Zapatista troops have been put on full alert. </P>
<P> In response, army patrols on the state's main highways have increased and its helicopters and planes are flying regularly over guerrilla positions. </P>
<P> Despite the mounting tensions, President Ernesto Zedillo reaffirmed Tuesday that the army would maintain a unilateral cease-fire. </P>
<P> ``Let it be clear, in Chiapas there will not be war, that is the will of the Mexican people,'' Zedillo said in a speech to Mexico City legislators. </P>
<P> Notwithstanding Zedillo's promises, government troops moved into the center of this colonial city Tuesday for the first time since January. A spokeswoman for the National Defense ministry in Mexico City would not comment on whether troops were preparing for battle. </P>
<P> Rebel roadblocks in the mountainous Lacandon jungle are now being manned by armed, uniformed guerrillas instead of unarmed militias, and some Zapatista supporters have moved their belongings deeper into the jungle as part of preparations to protect civilians in any confrontation with the army. </P>
<P> Guerrilla chiefs, looking unusually nervous and agitated, turned reporters away from the village of San Jose in the heart of rebel-held territory Monday. </P>
<P> One indicated there might be an attack on the military base at Rancho Nuevo just outside this colonial city, and at least two Red Cross ambulances were stationed on the main highway which runs by the base early Tuesday morning. </P>
<P> The Zapatistas last week said they were no longer tied to the cease-fire, which was reached after at least 145 people were killed in the uprising's first 10 days of intense fighting. </P>
<P> Marcos rejected Zedillo's offer of peace talks, saying that negotiations can only resume if the ruling party governor in Chiapas, Eduardo Robledo, resigns. </P>
<P> The Zapatistas, who launched their rebellion for indigenous rights and democracy last New Year's Day, insist Robledo stole August gubernatorial elections through fraud. </P>
<P> In the 11 months since the cease-fire was reached, peace negotiations at first flourished but then died, and the army boosted its presence to surround rebel strongholds. </P>
<P> Marcos says his rebels cannot break through the army but insists they are prepared to go up against superior military force and die as martyrs if necessary. </P>
<P> ``Do we know what we are heading towards? Yes. Do we know what awaits us? Yes. Is it worthwhile? Yes,'' Marcos said in his latest letter. </P>
