<P>  A Japanese archeologist claimed Monday that stone tools unearthed from a northern Japan town show that primitive man may have lived in Japan up to 100,000 years earlier than previously thought. </P>
<P> ``Judging by the volcanic deposit of the strata where the tools were found, they could be about 600,000 years old or probably older,'' said Toshiaki Kamata, head of the Tohoku Institute of Paleolithic Culture. </P>
<P> ``Maybe he's a contemporary of Java Man,'' Kamata told Reuters. Java Man is said to have lived in what is now Indonesia about 700,000 years ago. </P>
<P> Kamata's institute has spearheaded Japan's paleolithic archaeology. </P>
<P> Before Kamata's group found traces of Old Stone Age man in northern Japan in the mid-1980s, Japanese archeologists had refused to believed that primitive man lived in what is now Japan before 30,000 years ago. </P>
<P> The latest tools which are one to four inches long, include scrapers, hand axes, choppers and cleavers. They were unearthed at the Kamitakamori site, which is about 200 miles north of Tokyo. </P>
<P> The tools were found late last year, but it has taken until now to examine them, Kamata said. </P>
