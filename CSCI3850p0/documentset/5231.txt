<P>  Campaigners led by British playwright Harold Pinter Monday pledged to keep up pressure on Israel to free nuclear technician Mordechai Vanunu, jailed for 18 years for revealing the Jewish state's nuclear secrets. </P>
<P> Pinter led a delegation which included actress Susannah York to deliver a petition of 25,000 signatures -- the biggest yet collected for Vanunu -- to the Israeli embassy. Officials said it would be handed to the relevant authorities. </P>
<P> There was also an orderly demonstration of people with placards showing the famous palm Vanunu showed from a bus window giving details of his abduction by Israeli agents back to Israel to stand trial for treason. </P>
<P> Vanunu is in the ninth year of a sentence for handing details of Israel's nuclear program to The Sunday Times newsapaper. He is being kept in solitary confinement and there are fears for his mental health. </P>
<P> ``We are protesting against the extremely vindictive and harsh treatment given to a man of conscience,'' Pinter, who wrote the landmark play ``The Caretaker,'' told Reuters. ``We are not going to stop. We will keep thumping the table.'' </P>
<P> Vanunu, lured by Israeli agents from London to Rome and forcibly taken by ship to Israel in 1986, was secretly convicted of treason for passing The Sunday Times newspaper pictures of a nuclear complex near the southern town of Dimona. A former technician at Dimona, Vanunu told The Sunday Times that Israel had an arsenal of nuclear warheads. </P>
<P> Israel, which is widely believed to be a nuclear power, neither confirms nor denies possessing atomic weapons. It says only that it will not be the first country to introduce nuclear weapons to the Middle East. </P>
