<P>  The U.S. government has not provided any information to help Guatemala investigate alleged abuses by the army against U.S. citizens despite an official request for evidence, an official said Wednesday. </P>
<P> Chief Public Prosecutor Ramses Cuestas Gomez said the Guatemalan government officially asked Washington more than a month ago for information on the alleged role of a Guatemalan army officer in the killings of a U.S. hotel owner and a guerrilla commander married to an American lawyer. But so far no information has been received, he told reporters. </P>
<P> Guatemala's government opened an investigation into the killings of hotelier Michael DeVine and rebel leader Efrain Bamaca Velasquez after U.S. Congressman Robert Torricelli accused army Colonel Julio Roberto Alpirez of ordering the killings while on the CIA payroll. </P>
<P> The United States has confirmed that Alpirez was involved in the cover-up of the June 1990 murder of DeVine and had information on the circumstances surrounding the March 1992 disappearence of Bamaca. Bamaca was married to lawyer Jennifer Harbury, who spent nearly three years pressuring the Guatemalan and U.S. governments to unravel the mysterious disappearance of her husband. </P>
<P> The U.S. government says Bamaca was seized and later killed by the Guatemalan army. But the Guatemalan government still denies that the rebel leader was captured by the army. </P>
