<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The music industry's highest awards took on a ``something old, something new'' aspect Wednesday as pop newcomer Sheryl Crow won the Grammy for Record of the Year and veteran crooner Tony Bennett walked off with the Album of the Year Award. </P>
<P> Bennett, 67, who started his career as a singing waiter 50 years ago when television was in its infancy won for an album he taped for the television pop music outlet aimed at young people, the MTV cable network. </P>
<P> ``This is the greatest moment in my whole musical career. The greatest moment in my life,'' he said as he accepted his Grammy for ``MTV Unplugged.'' </P>
<P> ``There are no words; it's such a victorious feeling to sing good American music and have this happen,'' he added. </P>
<P> Crow, who burst on the music scene last year with a string of hits, was also voted Best New Artist and won a third Grammy for Best Female Pop Vocal performance, all for the song ``All I Wanna Do.'' </P>
<P> She could only say, ``Oh my God, oh my God,'' as her awards were announced. </P>
<P> Backstage, she said she came up with the music to the song when she was ``jamming'' with friends but could not think of any words to go with it until she picked up a book by little known poet Wyn Cooper and subsequently wrote the words with help from one of his works. </P>
<P> Bennett, who beat out ``The 3 Tenors in Concert 1994,'' with Jose Carreras, Placido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti, Eric Clapton's ``From the Cradle,'' Bonnie Raitt's ``Longing in the Hearts'' Seal's self-titled album, said he hoped his award would inspire young Americans to rediscover great American music from earlier this century. </P>
<P> The white-haired crooner also won a Grammy for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Performance for ``MTV Unplugged.'' </P>
<P> Bennett is no stranger to the Grammys, having won his first in 1962 for ``I Left My Heart in San Francisco.'' </P>
<P> Veteran rocker Bruce Springsteen won the most Grammys, taking four honors for ``Streets of Philadelphia'' as the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences presented its 37th Annual Awards, but was denied Record of the Year by Crow. </P>
<P> Asked if he was upset at being beaten by Crow, he said, ``Oh no, no. I love Sheryl's record. It's a great record.'' </P>
<P> Other contenders for Record of the Year were Boyz II Men with ``I'll Make Love To You,'' Mary Chapin Carpenter with ``He Thinks He'll Keep Her,'' and Bonnie Raitt's ``Love Sneaking' Up On You.'' </P>
<P> Springsteen took the Grammys for Song of the Year, Best Rock Performance by a Male, Best Rock Song and Best Song Written for a Motion Picture or Television for ``Streets of Philadelphia,'' the theme song to the Oscar-winning AIDS movie, ''Philadelphia,'' which brought Tom Hanks an Academy Award for Best Actor last year. </P>
<P> The awards show was broadcast on CBS and the organizers estimated the event would be seen by 1.4 billion people in 104 countries around the world. </P>
<P> Crow, who grew up in Missouri, beat out Ace of Base, Counting Crows, Crash Test Dummies and Green Day for Best New Artist. </P>
<P> But her record, ``All I Wanna Do,'' from her debut album ''Tuesday Night Music Club,'' was not successful in the Song of the Year Category, losing to Springsteen's ``Philadelphia.'' </P>
<P> Others nominated in that category were ``Can You Feel the Love Tonight'' and ``Circle of Life,'' both from the movie, ''The Lion King,'' and written by Elton John and Tim Rice and sung by Elton John, and ``I Swear'' from All 4 One. </P>
<P> The female trio Salt-n-Pepa took the Grammy for for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group with their song, ``None of Your Business''/''Whatta Man.'' </P>
<P> Mary Chapin Carpenter won the Grammy for Best Country Album for ``Stones in the Road.'' Carpenter also won Best Country Female Vocal Performance for ``Shut Up and Kiss Me.'' </P>
<P> The Best Country Male Vocal Performance went to Vince Gill for ``When Love Finds You.'' Soundgarden won for Best Metal Performance with ``Spoonman,'' and for Best Hard Rock Performance with ``Black Hole Sun.'' </P>
<P> The Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group went to Boyz II Men for ``I'll Make Love to You.'' The group also took the Best R&B Album award for ``II.'' </P>
<P> Al Green and Lyle Lovett took the award for Best Pop Vocal Collaboration for ``Funny How Time Slips Away,'' winning out over Bennett and k.d. lang's ``Moonglow,'' among others. </P>
<P> The Best Female Rock Performance Grammy went to Melissa Etheridge for ``Come to My Window,'' while the Rolling Sones were double winners, for Best Short Video with ``Love is Strong,'' and Best Rock Album for ``Voodoo Lounge.'' </P>
<P> Bonnie Raitt won the Best Pop Album Category with ``Longing in Their Hearts;'' Best Rock Instrumental went to Pink Floyd for ``Marooned;'' Aerosmith took the Best Rock Performance by a duo of Group with Vocal with ``Crazy'' and Elton John won the Best Male Pop Vocal Performance Grammy for ``Can You Feel the Love Tonight.'' </P>
