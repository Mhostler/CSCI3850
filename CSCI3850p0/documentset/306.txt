<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Bangladeshi Islamic groups that want feminist writer Taslima Nasrin dead warned the government Wednesday against letting her flee to asylum abroad. </P>
<P> ``The government will be held responsible if the murtad (renegade) gets asylum in a foreign country,'' Nurul Islam, a leader of the newly formed United Action Council, which represents 13 radical groups, told a rally. </P>
<P> His and other angry reactions came after the local press published reports that an offer of a safe haven for the writer had been extended by the European Union. </P>
<P> Nasrin, a physician-turned-writer in her early 30s who vehemently opposes marriage as ``indirect prostitution,'' became the target of Muslim fury when she was quoted by India's Statesman newspaper as saying Islam's holy book, the Koran, should be ``revised throughly.'' </P>
<P> Nasrin, who denies making the statement, is in hiding to avoid arrest ordered by the government and the death threatened by the Islamic militants. </P>
<P> German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said in Bonn Tuesday that EU foreign ministers had agreed at a meeting in Brussels Monday to call on Dhaka to take all necessary measures to protect the writer and allow her to leave the country if she wished. </P>
<P> ``Ms Nasrin is welcome, in Germany, naturally, but also in any other country of the European Union which she wishes to visit,'' Kinkel said in a statement. </P>
<P> Nurul Islam told the rally the government had failed to protect ``our religion'' and that it sould resign immediately. </P>
<P> The fugitive writer last Friday appealed to the human-rights group Amnesty International for help following the death threats from Islamic militants. </P>
<P> A Bangladesh government minister said Nasrin must come out of hiding and surrender to a court if she wanted legal protection against fundamentalists calling for her death. </P>
<P> The government has banned Nasrin's book ``Lajja'' (Shame), saying it offends Muslim sentiments and tells lies about the sufferings of Bangladesh's minority Hindus. </P>
