<P>  The Mexican government said Sunday it has not bankrolled former president Carlos Salinas de Gortari's bid to become president of the World Trade Organization (WTO), though it has given him a helping hand. </P>
<P> ``In no case, and in no either direct or indirect way, have economic resources been given for the tours that the Mexican candidate is taking to help his candidacy,'' the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. </P>
<P> Salinas, whose six-year term ended Dec. 1, is on a world tour seeking support for the WTO post. </P>
<P> The ministry issued the release amid a backlash against the former president -- against whom a formal complaint was given to the attorney general's office by the center-left Democratic Revolution Party (PRD). The party blames the Salinas administration for the country's economic crisis, which began with a Dec. 20 peso devaluation. </P>
<P> The Foreign Ministry said Salinas is receiving financial support from non-governmental organizations and from host governments during his globe-trotting tour to drum up WTO support, but not cash from the Mexican government. </P>
<P> It said Mexican ambassadors and embassy staff have helped arrange meetings between Salinas and the governments he is visiting. </P>
<P> The immediate trigger for the crisis was the devaluation of the currency, but many Mexicans also blame Salinas, saying he concealed the extent of the structural flaws in the economy to help his image as an economic reformer and boost his WTO chances. </P>
<P> Late last week, Salinas hired Mexican lawyer Juan Velazquez to defend him against the lawsit filed by the PRD. </P>
<P> Salinas has already received full backing from the Clinton administration in his drive to head the WTO, the giant trading organization launched at the start of this year to replace the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. </P>
<P> But Mexican newspapers have reported that Salinas' chances in the three-way race have diminished since the economic crisis erupted back home. </P>
