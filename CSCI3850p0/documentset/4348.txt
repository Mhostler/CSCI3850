<P>  Richard Ben-Veniste, a prosecutor in the Watergate scandal, Tuesday was named by Democrats as a special counsel for the Senate investigation of President Clinton's involvement in the Whitewater case. </P>
<P> Ben-Veniste, 52, is a member of a Washington law firm. </P>
<P> ``I am delighted that we will have someone of Richard Ben-Veniste's experience, ability and integrity for this assignment,'' said Paul Sarbanes of Maryland, the senior Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee. </P>
<P> The committee is expected to resume hearings on Whitewater later this year which it started in 1994, when the panel was controlled by Democrats. </P>
<P> It now has a Republican majority and is expected to dig even harder into Clinton's actions in the Whitewater real estate deal in Arkansas before he became president. </P>
