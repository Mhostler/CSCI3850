<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A Senate panel voted Wednesday to abolish special tax breaks for businesses selling their broadcast properties to minorities, a move likely to scuttle Viacom Inc.'s planned $2.3 billion sale of its cable systems. </P>
<P> The measure was tacked on to a bill to extend a popular 25 percent tax deduction for health insurance for the self-employed. The House passed similar legislation in February. </P>
<P> The bill still faces a vote on the Senate floor, where some Democrats have vowed to fight the provisions that aim to wipe out deals that were already in the works before now. </P>
<P> The controversy over the Federal Communications Commission's 17-year-old minority preference program has also sparked a heated debate about affirmative action policies. </P>
<P> ``This cements the glass ceiling,'' Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun told reporters after the Senate Finance Committee voted on the legislation. ``I think the program ought to be saved.'' </P>
<P> The Illinois Democrat, the first black woman elected to the Senate, vowed to introduce an amendment once the bill reaches the Senate floor. </P>
<P> Senate Finance Committee Chairman Bob Packwood, an Oregon Republican, expressed disappointment that a tax bill had fueled an argument about affirmative action. </P>
<P> Lawmakers have estimated that Viacom could avoid some $500 million in taxes if the deal went through under the FCC program. Instead, Congress wants to use that money to fund at least part of the health insurance deduction for the self-employed. </P>
<P> Viacom signed a deal in late January to sell its cable properties to a firm headed by Frank Washington, a black media executive based in California. </P>
<P> Viacom said: ``We have said all along that without this tax deferment we would not move ahead with this transaction as currently structured and we won't. The transaction doesn't make financial sense without a tax deferment.'' </P>
<P> Democrats on the panel tried unsuccessfully at Wednesday's session to remove the retroactive component of the bill in an effort to save the 20 or so pending deals that would qualify for the FCC minority tax certificates. </P>
<P> Proponents of the program noted that blacks, Hispanics and women have traditionally had difficulty gaining access to the capital they need to buy broadcasting properties. But the tax breaks give sellers the incentive to cut deals with them. </P>
