<P>  Two doctors said Monday they offered to help ease the pain of a woman who committed suicide in the presence of Dr. Jack Kevorkian Saturday, only to be rebuffed by his attorneys. </P>
<P> The physicians, both pain specialists, said they contacted Kevorkian's lawyers after Margaret Garrish appeared on a videotape with Kevorkian in March and said she wanted to end her life because of her unbearable pain. </P>
<P> Garrish, 72, died Saturday by inhaling deadly carbon monoxide gas supplied by Kevorkian at her home in Royal Oak, Mich. She suffered from severe rheumatoid arthritis, colonic diverticulitis and advanced osteoporosis, and had lost both legs and one eye. </P>
<P> Dr Pavan Grover, who runs a pain clinic in Houston, said he had contacted Kevorkian's chief attorney, Geoffrey Fieger, in April to offer his services and information on new pain relief technology. </P>
<P> ``They said they didn't want my help,'' said Grover, who debated Fieger on CNN's Larry King Live show April 18. </P>
<P> Dr John Nelson of Traverse City, Mich., also said his offers to help went unanswered, adding that Kevorkian likely did not explore all avenues available to Garrish. </P>
<P> Nelson also criticized Kevorkian's approach to counseling his patients, saying it is not geared toward healing and finding solutions. ``He is a pathologist. The only thing he ever prescribed was formaldehyde.'' Nelson said. ``I believe that something could have controlled her pain.'' </P>
<P> Following her video plea, Garrish agreed to try a morphine patch prescribed by a Detroit-area doctor after her family physician refused to give her the addictive drug. </P>
<P> Michael Schwartz, another attorney for Kevorkian, said the pain still proved too great and she decided to end her suffering. Her death, which came just hours after the apparent expiration of Michigan's law against assisted suicide, was the 21st suicide Kevorkian had attended since 1990 and his first in more than a year. </P>
<P> Schwartz said Garrish did not need Grover's and Nelson's help because she had a local physician trying to help her. He also accused them of being interested in Garrish so they could gain publicity for themselves. </P>
<P> ``Should we bring in every doctor? Should we bring them in from China?'' he said. ``There just comes a point where you say, 'I'm done.''' </P>
<P> Oakland County Prosecutors office said Monday it was waiting for a full report from the Royal Oak Police Department before it decided whether to file charges against Kevorkian. The county's coroner had ruled the death a homicide and questioned whether Garrish had the motor control necessary to activate the flow of carbon monoxide to her lungs. </P>
<P> Meanwhile, state lawmakers said they planned to introduce bills Tuesday to extend the assisted suicide law in an effort to stop Kevorkian. The law's current status is subject to legal interpretation, some legislators have said. </P>
<P> The law is under review by the Michigan Supreme Court and was scheduled to expire Friday because the legislature had failed to act upon the report of a special commission set up to study whether to make the ban permanent or legalize assisted suicide with strict controls. </P>
