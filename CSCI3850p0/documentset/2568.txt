<DATELINE>DORADO BEACH, Puerto Rico (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The U.S. team of Fred Couples and Davis Love stayed on track for a record third successive title after the third round at the Heineken World Cup here Saturday. </P>
<P> The Americans were not at their very best, but they got the job done to stay well ahead of the field as Couples shot four-under-par 68 and Love 69 on the Dorado Beach course. </P>
<P> They were at 34-under 398 with one round to play, nine strokes ahead of Zimbabwe. </P>
<P> The Zimbabwean team of Tony Johnstone (66) and Mark McNulty (67) kept the Americans honest, but it wasn't nearly enough to inject any suspense into the event. Malaysia and Japan were equal third, a distant 14 strokes behind the Americans. </P>
<P> ``We lost some ground today but another round's gone and if we play two more good rounds tomorrow we should win,'' said Couples, who had the lowest individual score of 20-under 196, three shots better than Malaysian Marimuthu Ramayah. </P>
<P> No two players have won the World Cup three times in a row, although the United States did win five in successive years between 1960 and 1964, albeit with different teams. </P>
<P> ``We didn't do much wrong. The way we play we're bound to make some mistakes, but we're bound to make up for them as well,'' Couples continued. </P>
<P> Love admitted he and Couples had suffered from mental and physical fatigue on the back nine, which may have accounted for the unusually poor drive by Couples at the 12th hole, where he topped his tee shot barely 100 yards. </P>
<P> ``Every year we've had a place where we've got tired and lose our energy,'' Love said. ``I hooked a few and Freddie hit a couple he hardly ever hits.'' </P>
<P> Couples and Love said their familiarity with the grainy bermuda greens gave them an advantage over players used to bent grass, which is found in cooler climates. </P>
<P> ``These greens are difficult but we putt on them a lot,'' said Couples, who won last week's Kapalua International on the same type of grass. </P>
<P> ``Those used to playing on grainy bermuda greens should do well here, which may be why the Malaysians are doing so well.'' </P>
<P> Lack of familiarity with bermuda greens helps explain the poor showing of the 14 European teams in the 32-team field. Sweden was the low European, in sixth place, 16 strokes from the lead. </P>
<P> Despite trailing by nine shots, Zimbabwean McNulty refused to concede defeat: ``It is still possible for us to win,'' said McNulty, who teamed with Nick Price to finish second to Couples and Love last year. </P>
<P> ``Even if the Americans are 10 shots in front, it is only like five shots because we are playing doubles. We are playing well and still fighting.'' </P>
<P> Said Johnstone: ``We want to make the Americans earn their money -- hopefully for second place.'' </P>
