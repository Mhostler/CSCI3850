<P>  Sen. Arlen Specter, the Pennsylvania Republican who came out of the blue in a likely bid for the presidency, returned Thursday for the second time this week to New Hampshire -- traditional site of the first presidential primary. </P>
<P> ``I've been on the cutting edge of major problems of the country for 14 years in the Senate,'' the three-term senator said after meeting law enforcement officials in Manchester. ``I do not like what is happening to my country or my party.'' </P>
<P> ``I'm in for the long haul,'' declared Specter, 64, a relative newcomer to the presidential primary race. </P>
<P> With mid-term elections over, the field of about a dozen possible candidates for the Republican presidential nomination is expected soon to swarm over New Hampshire in full force. </P>
<P> Many probable candidates, including Senate Republican leader Robert Dole and former vice-president Dan Quayle, have already visited the New England state over the past year. </P>
<P> ``Princess Running Water hasn't been here and the guy with the boot on his head hasn't been here yet, but I imagine they will be,'' observed Manchester's Mayor Raymond Wieczorek, who met with Specter Thursday. </P>
<P> Specter, a relative unknown compared to veteran Republican politicians like Dole, Quayle and Texas Senator Phil Gramm, announced Monday in Philadelphia that he was starting ''exploratory travels'' to consider a presidential bid and then immediately travelled to New Hampshire and Iowa. </P>
<P> He behaved Thursday like a declared candidate, wooing local police chiefs with promises of funds and meeting public relations consultants and state party leaders in an attempt to set up a field organization in New Hampshire. </P>
<P> To be a contender Specter said he needs to raise $30 million by January 1996. ``I think I can,'' he said, noting that his 1992 Senate campaign raised $11 million. </P>
<P> Specter, a former Philadelphia district attorney and sponsor of tough anti-crime legislation in Congress, said crime will be a focus of his campaign. </P>
<P> Specter caused a stir earlier this week when he spoke out against the religious right wing of the Republican Party. </P>
<P> ``I very much believe we need the Big Tent to include all factions,'' Specter said Thursday. ``This fringe, I think, we need to confront early on. I'm talking about (conservative commentator) Patrick Buchanan and Pat Robertson,'' leader of the Christian Coalition. </P>
