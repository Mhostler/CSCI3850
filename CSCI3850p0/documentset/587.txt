<P>  A New Mexico county has passed a resolution that says every household should keep a firearm, in what county officials said Wednesday was a symbolic protest against the federal government's intrusion into their lives. </P>
<P> The three-member Catron County Commission in southwestern New Mexico passed the resolution Tuesday night. </P>
<P> ``This was more about government than it was about guns,'' Jim Blancq, Catron County assistant manager, said. ``We've been economically devastated by government regulations.'' </P>
<P> County citizens resent federal government interference in their lives, from environmental issues to gun control. </P>
<P> Residents of Catron county, population 2,800, once lived off ranching and logging, Blancq said, but federal environmental protection laws and proposed grazing fees threaten their livelihood. </P>
<P> ``The Brady Bill and gun control laws were seen as another step toward destroying what we're used to to get along all these years,'' Blancq said. </P>
<P> A loosely organized group calling themselves ``the concerned citizens'' asked the commission to pass an ordinance requiring all households to have a gun. </P>
<P> But county attorney Jim Catron, after whose family the county is named, advised the commission to pass a non-binding resolution instead, because an ordinance would require penalties. A resolution does not carry the weight of a law. </P>
<P> The resolution contains some exceptions to the firearm requirement. </P>
<P> Convicted felons and anyone suffering from a mental illness would not be required to have a gun, Blancq said, ``or if you just stated that you don't want one.'' </P>
<P> The 6,800-sq mile county on the edge of national forest land in the mountains near the Arizona border includes a large percentage of public land, Blancq said. </P>
<P> ``There's no polluted air or water up here,'' he said. ''We're in the mountains, and the air is so clear. Occasionally there's an automobile passing by. The regulations are so farfetched. They're the same as in New York City .'' </P>
<P> Ranchers say they need a gun for protection from wild animals and hunting is popular in the county, Blancq said. Tourists come to hunt elk, bear, mountain lion and deer. </P>
<P> There are only 400 people in the county's biggest village. ''Big city solutions used on us. It's not fair. We have very little crime,'' Blancq said. </P>
<P> Still, he added, many residents feel they want guns to protect them from burglars. ``You're less apt to break in if you know someone has a gun,'' Blancq said. </P>
