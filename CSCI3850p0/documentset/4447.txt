<DATELINE>MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Israeli planes twice raided Hizbollah guerrilla targets in southeastern Lebanon Monday in a second day of air attacks, security sources said. </P>
<P> The planes fired nine rockets in two raids 30 minutes apart into the Maydoun hills, on the southern edge of the eastern Bekaa Valley, used by the pro-Iranian Hizbollah (Party of God) to attack Israel's occupation zone in south Lebanon. </P>
<P> A senior Hizbollah official, who declined to be named, said the Muslim militants would step up special operations against Israeli forces in the coming few days. </P>
<P> ``You should expect an increase in special military operations against the Israeli enemy in the coming few days,'' the member of Hizbollah's politburo told reporters in Sohmor village, five miles north of Maydoun. </P>
<P> Security sources said there were no casualties in the raid, which targeted a rugged wooded area full of caves where guerrillas hide weapons to attack Israel's 1,000 troops and their 2,500-strong South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia allies. </P>
<P> Israel has carried out nine air strikes in Lebanon this year. </P>
<P> An Israeli army statement said: ``Air force planes this afternoon attacked terrorist targets in the Jabel Izkan area in south Lebanon. All our planes returned safely to their bases.'' </P>
<P> Pro-Israeli militia sources said that hours before the air assault guerrillas fired mortar bombs at two posts manned by SLA militiamen at Sojoud and Beir Kallab no one was hurt. </P>
<P> Israeli and SLA gunners responded with artillery fire on guerrilla-held areas north of the zone. </P>
<P> Sunday, Israeli artillery pounded Hizbollah-held areas in south Lebanon killing two civilians and a guerrilla after Hizbollah fighters killed an SLA militiaman. Israeli planes also raided Hizbollah posts five times, wounding one guerrilla. </P>
