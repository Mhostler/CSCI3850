<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Clinton sent senior officials to California Tuesday to assess damage from severe floods as thousands of storm victims picked up the pieces of their shattered lives. </P>
<P> California, a leading agricultural state, said crop damage from the relentless storms would be at least $303 million and said supplies of almonds, artichokes, lettuce, broccoli, cauliflower and strawberries could be affected. </P>
<P> Clinton declared a large part of California a major disaster area Sunday after a series of storms which have killed 13 people, caused widespread flooding and mudslides, and forced at least 10,000 people to evacuate their homes. </P>
<P> White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta, a former congressman from Monterey, one of the areas worst affected by the storms, led a delegation on a whirlwind tour of several towns where residents were cleaning up after the floods. </P>
<P> ``I'm Leon Panetta. I'm from Washington. I work with the president,'' he said, introducing himself to Martha Moreno, who was cleaning out her flooded home in San Jose. </P>
<P> Moreno said her family had lost everything when the Guadalupe River overflowed last week. ``We lost ... shoes for the kids, clothes, everything,'' she said. </P>
<P> Panetta told her that the federal government was making housing assistance available for the homeless and could provide individual grants to help other flood victims. </P>
<P> ``If there's anything we can do, let us know. We've got teams here that are trying to provide some help,'' he said. </P>
<P> Panetta, who was accompanied by Federal Emergency Management Agency Director James Lee Witt, said Clinton had asked him to assess the flood damage and report back. </P>
<P> Panetta said his family's house in Carmel, 100 miles south of San Francisco, had survived the floods unscathed. </P>
<P> While there is no firm estimate yet for flood damage, state officials say it will be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. </P>
<P> In Washington, the Transportation Department said it has allocated $20 million in emergency funds to California to help rebuild highways and bridges damaged by the storms. </P>
<P> Federal Highway Administrator Rodney Slater said: ``We are granting the money now, when it is desparately needed. These roads and bridges are economic lifelines, and we will do everything we can to get them open quickly.'' </P>
<P> The California Department of Food and Agriculture said its preliminary crop damage estimate of $303 million was likely to increase as officials continued to survey the damage. </P>
<P> Lettuce, cauliflower and broccoli crops each suffered about $65 million in damage, the department said. </P>
<P> Department Secretary Henry Voss said that, because California produces at least 80 percent of the country's supply of lettuce, broccoli, cauliflower and strawberries and almost all its almonds and artichokes, ``supplies may be impacted.'' </P>
<P> Thousands of acres in the fertile Salinas Valley, known as the nation's ``salad bowl,'' have been covered by water, almond trees have been battered and strawberries submerged by the storms. </P>
<P> Produce wholesalers say the storms could cause supply gaps and higher prices for some crops in 60 to 90 days because farmers will be forced to replant crops that had already been planted. </P>
<P> More rain fell over northern California Tuesday, causing problems in some areas. </P>
<P> At least 250 people have been evacuated from Lakeport and other communities around Clear Lake, 100 miles north of San Francisco, which has risen above flood stage. </P>
<P> The swollen Russian River in the northern California wine country rose to just below flood level. </P>
<P> Forecasters were predicting a break in the northern California rains from Wednesday through the weekend, giving flood victims a welcome chance to dry out. </P>
<P> In flood-hit towns such as Castroville, 90 miles south of San Francisco, residents were cleaning out a thick layer of mud from their homes and businesses and throwing out debris and destroyed furniture. </P>
<P> Local health officials were warning residents to wash walls, floors and furniture with bleach before moving back in because the floodwaters were contaminated with raw sewage in some areas. </P>
<P> The disaster-prone state, hit by earthquakes and wildfires in recent years, was just recovering from earlier floods in January which caused $1.3 billion in damage. </P>
