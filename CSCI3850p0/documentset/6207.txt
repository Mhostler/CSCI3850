<P>  Masked Israeli security men raided a main hospital in Arab East Jerusalem Tuesday to search for wanted Palestinian activists, hospital officials said. </P>
<P> Makassed hospital director Dr Amin Thalji said border policemen wearing knitted masks blocked hospital entrances with jeeps. They barred ambulances from bringing in patients while officers went through hospital files. </P>
<P> ``They interrupted our work and prevented the movement of ambulances for about one hour,'' Thalji said. </P>
<P> He said no one was arrested but the raid caused a scare. </P>
<P> An Israeli police spokesman said he was checking the report. </P>
<P> Israel often uses undercover soldiers posing as Arabs to search for activists sought by the army for attacks against Israelis. But police raids on hospitals have been rare. </P>
