<DATELINE>ERFURT, Germany (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Four German skinheads were given suspended jail sentences ranging from four to seven months Friday for taking part in a rampage at the former Nazi death camp at Buchenwald. </P>
<P> The young men, in the third group of skinheads to go on trial over the July riot, were charged with breaching the peace, using banned Nazi symbols and causing material damage. </P>
<P> A young woman in the group was put on probation for two years and another male defendant was released for lack of evidence, the Erfurt court said. </P>
<P> Judge Philipp Bitz said the sentences were milder than those demanded by the prosecutor because the youths ``had been trying to see how far they could go.'' </P>
<P> He said: ``Police observed the youths all day but failed to show authority.'' </P>
<P> Thirteen out of a gang of 22 skinheads have been appeared in court so far over the rampage, in which gang-members chanted ``Heil Hitler,'' damaged buildings and threatened to burn a woman assistant. One of the defendants was sentenced to 20 months in jail, three were sent to youth detention centers and others received suspended sentences or were acquitted. </P>
<P> About 50,000 Jews and other people were murdered in World War II at Buchenwald, just outside Weimar in the east German state of Thuringia. </P>
<P> Police Friday detained a right-wing extremist in the east German town of Burg, near Magdeburg, and said he had confessed to daubing swastikas and other Nazi symbols on walls. They said he had named two accomplices. </P>
