<P>  Saudi Arabia has denied claims by Yemen's president that the kingdom is massing troops on the countries' disputed border and urged the Sanaa government to check with Riyadh first before making such accusations. </P>
<P> ``What has been said by His Excellency President Ali Abdullah Saleh ... on the presence of massed Saudi Arabian troops on the Yemen-Saudi border is not true,'' an official Saudi source said in a statement. </P>
<P> The Yemenis should contact relevant authorities in Saudi Arabia to verify information to safeguard the ``atmosphere of harmony and understanding between the two states,'' it added. </P>
<P> Yemeni officials conducting talks in Riyadh on the 60-year-old dispute told Reuters both sides had agreed to stop trading public accusations and denials and to tackle any new problems through direct contact. </P>
<P> Saudi television interrupted programs to broadcast the statement, which was also carried by radio stations and the official Saudi Press Agency. </P>
<P> Saleh, in an interview with the BBC, had accused Saudi Arabia of massing troops and armor within sight of the disputed border area, which is potentially oil-rich. ``Massed troops could be seen with naked eyes,'' he said. </P>
<P> The Saudi statement stressed that Riyadh was abiding by a Syrian-brokered accord between Yemen and Saudi Arabia Jan. 15 after a rise in tension along the border. </P>
<P> ``Saudi Arabia hopes that Yemen shares its keenness to abide by what was contained in it (the accord),'' it said. </P>
<P> Both sides then pledged to pull troops back from the border area, the scene of several clashes in recent weeks, revive border talks and normalize ties after more than four years of tense relations. </P>
<P> But Saleh said the build-up of Saudi troops Wednesday included an armored and a mechanized brigade. </P>
<P> He suggested the Saudis were massing troops to impose the ``policy of status quo in demarcating the borders.'' </P>
<P> ``It seems there is (somebody) who wants to impose the status quo. Such policy will not eventually succeed,'' Saleh said. </P>
<P> He also denied Yemen had sent any new troops to the area. Saleh said earlier this month Yemen would not be dragged into a war even if attacked by its northern neighbor. </P>
<P> Diplomats said there had been fresh Saudi troop movements on Tuesday and Wednesday involving more than 60 tanks near al-Buqa. </P>
<P> At least 20 Saudi Apache attack helicopters were moved to a southern airbase at Khamis Mushyt and three boats arrived off Jizan on the Red Sea about 45 miles north of Yemen, the diplomats added. </P>
<P> Saudi troops were between al-Buqa and Najran, Saleh said. Western maps show al-Buqa, which has an airport, inside northern Yemen and Najran inside southern Saudi Arabia. </P>
<P> Saleh said talks in Riyadh on the disputed area had led Saudi Arabia to withdraw its troops to between six to nine miles from Yemeni positions. </P>
<P> He did not make clear when the pullback took place. </P>
<P> Saleh said the talks, which started Sunday, were inconclusive but he hoped ``they will reach positive results.'' </P>
<P> Yemeni officials in Riyadh refused to comment on the latest exchanges between Yemen and Saudi Arabia but said both sides were still set to hold a new round of talks Saturday. </P>
<P> Later, an official Yemeni source in Sanaa said Yemen proposed forming a joint Yemeni-Saudi committee to investigate whether or not Saudi Arabia had massed troops near their disputed border. </P>
<P> The source said the committee's task would be ``to verify the situation on the spot and establish if there is no Saudi military buildup in Yemeni territories.'' </P>
