<P>  President Clinton Thursday welcomed the Ukrainian parliament's vote to approve the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, and said the move would lead to expanded cooperation between Washington and Kiev. </P>
<P> A White House statement issued as Clinton vacationed in Hawaii praised Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma's leadership on the issue and said the emerging partnership between the United States and Ukraine would be a key focus of Kuchma's visit to the United States next week. </P>
<P> ``The United States warmly welcomes the vote by the Supreme Rada of Ukraine on Nov. 16 to acceed to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT),'' the statement said. </P>
<P> It said that at a European security summit in Budapest next month, the U.S., Great Britain and the Ukraine would sign a memorandum on security assurances for Ukraine, and that Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, Ukraine and the U.S. would bring the Start 1 arms treaty into effect. </P>
<P> ``This achievement will cap U.S. efforts ... to prevent new nuclear states from emerging following the breakup of the Soviet Union,'' it said. ``With Ukraine's accession to the NPT, the United States and Ukraine are moving into a new era of expanded cooperation.'' </P>
