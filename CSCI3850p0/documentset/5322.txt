<DATELINE>TOKYO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Representatives of the ruling parties of Japan and North Korea signed an agreement on Thursday urging their governments to resume normalization talks soon. </P>
<P> The agreement was signed in Pyongyang between the three parties in Japan's ruling coalition and the Workers' Party of Korea, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said. </P>
<P> Japan, which ruled the Korean Peninsula as a colony from 1910 to 1945, normalized relations with South Korea in 1965 but still has no ties with the communist North. </P>
<P> ``Under this agreement, the four parties have decided to recommend the governments of the DPRK (North Korea) and Japan hold the ninth round of talks for diplomatic relations as soon as possible,'' KCNA said in a dispatch seen in Tokyo. </P>
<P> ``The four parties, motivated by their responsibility as the ruling parties, shall make such efforts that their respective governments can actively promote talks for establishing diplomatic relations ... at an early date,'' KCNA added. </P>
<P> The joint declaration also urged Tokyo and Pyongyang to reopen direct talks unconditionally, it said. </P>
<P> An 11-member Japanese delegation headed by former foreign minister MIchio Watanabe had arrived in Pyongyang Tuesday on a three-day visit to try to revive bilateral negotiations stalled since 1992. </P>
<P> The group included lawmakers from the Liberal Democratic Party and its partners in Japan's ruling coalition, the Socialists and the small Sakigake Party. </P>
<P> Tokyo and Pyongyang began the Beijing talks on normalising ties in early 1991. The dialog broke down in late 1992 when North Korea rejected Tokyo's demand for information about a Japanese woman it alleged was abducted by North Korean agents. </P>
<P> ``The Japanese government has been serious about resuming normalisation talks with North Korea,'' Japan's top government spokesman Kozo Igarashi told reporters Thursday. ``Therefore, we welcome this path-blazing effort.'' </P>
<P> But a Japanese foreign ministry official said it was too early to be optimistic. It was unclear when or how the two countries would restart bilateral talks, he said. </P>
<P> ``We welcome North Korea's decision not to attach any preconditions for resuming talks,'' the official said. </P>
<P> ``But even if we do resume talks, it is not easy to normalise ties because there are many obstacles,'' he said without elaboration. </P>
<P> The LDP and the Socialists signed an earlier agreement in 1990 with the North Korean party which called on Japan to compensate North Korea for its 1910-1945 colonial rule and for ``losses'' Japan ``inflicted'' on North Korea after World War Two. </P>
<P> Japan's Foreign Ministry bitterly criticized the pact. </P>
<P> Thursday's declaration stopped short of clearing up the issue of post-war compensation. </P>
