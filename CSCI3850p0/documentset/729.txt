<P>  Moscow police arrested shareholders in Russia's troubled MMM investment fund Friday as they tried to picket the headquarters of the country's tax inspectorate. </P>
<P> Armed police in bulletproof jackets detained several of the ringleaders as they started the picket to protest the arrest of MMM chief Sergei Mavrodi on charges of tax evasion at another of his companies. </P>
<P> MMM, which lured millions of Russians into buying its shares with promises of high returns, shut all its branches after tax authorities detained Mavrodi. </P>
<P> Interfax news agency Friday published the results of an opinion poll which showed 45 percent of those questioned blamed MMM for the disaster while only 16 percent said the government was at fault. </P>
<P> The poll of 1,594 people across Russia was carried out by the official public opinion research institute. </P>
<P> President Boris Yeltsin said Thursday that the collapse was ``a good lesson for our people'' and insisted the government would not compensate those who had lost money. </P>
<P> Officials say MMM is a pyramid scheme using revenue from share purchases to buy back shares at rising prices. </P>
<P> Mavrodi has declined to give evidence to investigators probing allegations of tax evasion at his Invest-Consulting company, one firm in his big corporate empire. </P>
