<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A crew member of a U.S. warship stationed off Bosnia learned from the highest authority Monday that he had became the father of a baby girl. </P>
<P> It happened when President Clinton, as part of the kickoff of the 1995 American Red Cross community campaign, used the charitable organization's military notification system to deliver the stork announcement to Seaman Ryan Crawford. </P>
<P> ``Are you standing up or sitting down?'' Clinton asked the Navy enlisted man from Spring Hill, Fla., when he reached him by telephone aboard the aircraft carrier Eisenhower somewhere in the Adriatic. </P>
<P> When Crawford said he was sitting down, Clinton said: ``I want to congratulate you on the birth of your daughter, Taylor Renee.'' He said mother and baby were ``doing fine, and I know you're anxious to get home and see them.'' </P>
<P> The president added that as commander in chief, he would see what could be done about getting Crawford some home leave. </P>
<P> During his visit to Red Cross headquarters, Clinton also visited with Army Warrant Officer Michael Durant, the helicopter pilot who was shot down and briefly held prisoner in Somalia in October 1993. </P>
<P> Durant, badly beaten while in captivity and the subject of a widely recognized photo, told Clinton that the visit of an International Committee of the Red Cross representative had helped him cope with being a prisoner of war. </P>
<P> ``My morale soared, and although still in captivity, I didn't feel that I was alone,'' he said. </P>
<P> Clinton responded that the Red Cross visit to Durant and the serviceman's subsequent release caused spirits to soar in Washington. </P>
<P> ``I'll never forget that day as long as I live,'' Clinton said. ``I remember how elated we all were when we knew you were all right.'' </P>
<P> The presidential visit was intended to help the Red Cross raise money, attract volunteers and get people to give blood. </P>
