<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The House Democratic leadership seeks to expand the federal Medicare program as well as requiring businesses to help insure workers, according to its draft outline of its health reform bill. </P>
<P> The bill, made available Tuesday, closely resembles a proposal already approved by the House Ways and Means Committee, which like the original Clinton plan, strives to cover all Americans. </P>
<P> House leaders have been working hard on the bill in an effort to complete it by the end of the week. Congressional sources stressed that the document dated Monday may still be modified.  The House Democratic leadership's draft bill requires most employers to pay a large share of their workers' insurance. </P>
<P> House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt's office described the seven-page draft as a ``summary'' of committee work. He added that several decisions, including how fast reforms would be phased in, have yet to be made. </P>
<P> Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, has said it could take ``four to five'' years to enact some of the health care reforms.  Earlier Tuesday, House Speaker Thomas Foley of Washington told reporters that although he personally backs requiring employers to pay 80 percent of their employee's insurance, he would consider variants, including a 50-50 split.  ``The percentage is one of the things that can be discussed,'' he said.  Several congressional sources said the draft outline of the bill indicates Gephardt will take to the full Congress a bill that strongly resembles the Ways and Means bill that was approved last month.  Although it requires most employers to pay a large share of their workers insurance, the draft outline relies more heavily on government-run programs. It creates a new branch of Medicare to cover the poor on Medicaid, the uninsured, and some employees of small business. </P>
<P> The draft outline differs most from the Ways and Means version notably by giving businesses with fewer than 100 employees the option of enrolling in the same federal benefits program that covers members of Congress and other federal workers.  The House Democratic leadership's draft outline also would give states greater flexibility in meeting federal health goals. It would also set up a commission to make recommendations on integrating workers compensation into overall health reform. </P>
<P> The Democratic leadership, however, continues to look for a formula that will make its employer mandate more palatable. Moderates and conservatives have objected to the mandate, which requires businesses to pay most of their workers' insurance. </P>
<P> Changing the mandate structure would affect how much the government would have to spend to help subsidize the working poor who cannot afford to pay for insurance.  Florida Democrat Sam Gibbons, acting chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, told reporters Tuesday that each one percent change in the mandate could mean an extra $1 billion needed for subsidies each year. </P>
