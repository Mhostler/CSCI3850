<P>  Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said Monday he will seek a fourth six-year term to ``continue to fight for the middle class.'' </P>
<P> Levin ended speculation about his future with speeches in four Michigan cities, where he outlined plans to improve middle- and working-class incomes through economic and trade policies. </P>
<P> Incomes ``have been stagnant now for about 15 years,'' he said. ``Upper-income families have done well, but working-class families have not.'' </P>
<P> He warned Republicans to stay away from the early-school Head Start program and college loan programs. </P>
<P> He also told the GOP to ``keep your hands off Big Bird and 'Barney,''' the popular characters from public broadcasting programs. The Republican-controlled Congress has held hearings on cutting public broadcasting funding. </P>
<P> ``We're at a critical place in our history, and I want to continue to fight for things which I believe are important for Michigan and for America,'' the former Detroiit city councilman said. </P>
<P> Levin, a liberal with a reputation as an effective legislator, is expected to face heavy opposition from Michigan Republicans. </P>
<P> ``I think it's going to be a very lively primary,'' said Michigan GOP Chairwoman Susan Heintz. </P>
<P> Potential GOP challengers include talk-radio host Ronna Romney, and Republican Reps. Fred Upton, Joe Knollenberg and Nick Smith. </P>
<P> State voters elected Republican Spencer Abraham last November to replace Democrat Sen. Donald Riegle, who did not seek re-election. </P>
<P> Michigan political analyst Bill Ballenger said Levin will have to raise more than $10 million for the campaign. </P>
