<DATELINE>SANTA ANA, Calif.(Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  In an effort to stave off repercussions from affluent Orange County, Calif.'s financial crisis, Gov. Pete Wilson called Sunday for a team of state auditors to help sort out its finances. </P>
<P> Wilson had been asked to have the auditors participate in a financial review during a meeting Saturday with Tom Hayes, who will direct the county's financial restructuring, and with Russell Gould, director of the state's Departement of Finance, said finance department assistant director H.D. Palmer. </P>
<P> In a letter to State Auditor Kurt Sjoberg, Wilson said ''Your review should include all activities in the (investment) funds since June 30, 1994, as well as a review of all previous audit reports over the last three years.'' </P>
<P> On Tuesday, Orange County became the largst municipality in U.S. history to declare bankruptcy when it filed for protection under Chapter 9 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. </P>
<P> Several of the county's investment bankers declined to roll over $1.2 billion in short-term loans, which resulted in a default and led to the filing. </P>
<P> At that time, county officials said the filing was made to prevent any of the investors in the county's investment fund from making withdrawals. </P>
<P> But an Orange County Supervisor said Sunday that the bankruptcy route was taken after the Securities and Exchange Commission decided not to place the county in receivership. </P>
<P> ``We were told they (the SEC) were going to put the fund in receivership. But then they just stopped so we had no choice'' but bankruptcy, Supervisor Harriett Wieder said. </P>
<P> Wilson also said he wanted the auditors in on the county's financial review because the bankruptcy could have ``immediate implications'' for the state's credit rating. </P>
<P> ``We don't know what the implications are on the state's ratings and in fact we want to ensure that there is no impact,'' Palmer said. </P>
<P> Bond industry sources said any threat to the state's credit rating would be a concern to Wilson because it would make it more expensive for the state to borrow money. </P>
<P> The once-golden state of California has seen its resources drained by a lengthy economic recession that is barely over and by its own fiscal problems. </P>
<P> As a result, California's bond ratings already have been cut from a once-prized triple-A by both major rating agencies, Standard & Poor's Corp. and Moody's Investors Service Inc. </P>
<P> For years Orange County has been considered the epitome of the ``American Dream'', playing home to everything from Anaheim's Disneyland to the billion dollar yacht's in Newport Beach's harbor. </P>
<P> Daily headlines about how officials were aware the county's investments were risky; about possible cutbacks in services; and about delays in new projects have angered and amazed otherwise conservative residents. </P>
<P> ``I'd start getting signatures and ... get rid of the people who made this happen and make sure the money gets back to the people,'' said Todd Maginelli, a checkout clerk supervisor at La Hagra's Super Kmart. </P>
<P> Indeed, as pressures mounted on beleaguered Orange County officials, rumors spread that some members of the Board of Supervisors may step down. </P>
<P> Board member Wieder said ``dissidents'' have expressed anger at the board, although she said she did not know of any planned resignations. She is due to retire at the end of the year and said she will remain until then. </P>
<P> But an anonymous fax received by Board Chairman Thomas Riley called for his immediate resignation, his office said. </P>
<P> ``Dear Supervisor Riley, Resign Now!'', the hand-written fax read. ``You can set the example of what the other supervisors should do who may think they can stay on.'' </P>
<P> Officials met briefly over the weekend as they prepared for Tuesday's scheduled open meeting. </P>
<P> One county official, who asked not to be named, said he expects an angry turnout at Tuesday's meeting, with a larger-than-usual number of residents in attendance. </P>
<P> In other developments, the city of Montebello, Calif. said it hired Los Angeles-based law firm of Clark and Trevithick to protect the tiny city's investments in Orange County. </P>
<P> Montebello, located less than 10 miles southeast of Los Angeles, has about $47 million invested in Orange County's pool, which represents about 60 percent of its funds. </P>
<P> Montebello Administrator Richard Torres said the city was not at this time contemplating suing Orange County however. </P>
