<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The World Boxing Association Executive Committee on March 4 will hear heavyweight champion George Foreman's appeal of its decision to deny sanctioning of his fight with German Axel Schultz, the WBA announced Thursday. </P>
<P> Foreman, who holds both the WBA and International Boxing Federation versions of the heavyweight crown, and promoter Bob Arum were granted the opportunity to make their appeal to the Executive Committee on March 4 in Atlantic City. </P>
<P> The WBA has threatened to strip Foreman of their title for his decision to defend against Schultz on April 22, rather than fight one of their top contenders. </P>
<P> The WBA voted last month not to sanction the Schultz fight during meetings in New York at which Foreman was not present. The IBF has already given its blessing to the title bout against the lightly-regarded German contender. </P>
<P> Promoter Don King, who controls the WBA's top two contenders, will be present at the hearing. Top-ranked heavyweight Tony Tucker and second-ranked Bruce Seldon, both of whom Foreman passed up in favor of Schultz, will also attend the appear hearing. </P>
<P> Should the WBA reject Foreman's appeal, they could decide to strip him of the title, the organization said in a news release. </P>
<P> If he is stripped of the WBA crown, Tucker and Seldon would meet for the vacant title, the WBA said. </P>
