<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  German President Roman Herzog ended an official visit to Israel's national memorial to the Nazi Holocaust Tuesday vowing to fight genocide everywhere. </P>
<P> ``As long as I live, I will take care that something like this will never happen again, either in Germany or elsewhere,'' Herzog told reporters after the wreath-laying ceremony at Yad Vashem memorial's remembrance hall. </P>
<P> During World War Two, Nazi Germany slaughtered six million Jews. </P>
<P> The German president was accompanied at Yad Vashem by his wife Christiane. In his speech at Israeli President Ezer Weizman's residence earlier, Herzog said: </P>
<P> ``The most important item for my wife and myself is our visit to Yad Vashem which I will make as president representing all Germans and as a private citizen and not for the first time.'' </P>
<P> Herzog, the second German head of state to visit Israel, said last week he would not shirk from addressing either Nazi evils or neo-Nazi violence in modern Germany. </P>
<P> The visit, which began Tuesday, was Herzog's first to a country outside Europe since taking office in July. He said it was a sign of the special character of German-Israeli relations. </P>
<P> ``The fact that I have come here so soon after assuming the office of president underlines the importance which the German people and I personally attach to Israel and the Jewish people,'' Herzog said in his speech at Weizman's residence. </P>
<P> ``I also see my visit as a signal for the future, a signal that we should strengthen the present solid basis of German- Israeli relations,'' he said. </P>
<P> Herzog's predecessor, Richard Weizsaecker, became the first German president to visit Israel in October 1985. </P>
<P> The president's agenda will include talks with Weizman, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres. </P>
<P> German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel will accompany him part of the time. </P>
