<DATELINE>ROME (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, facing a revolt by his ally the Northern League, told President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro Thursday that elections would have to be held if his government fell. </P>
<P> He confirmed that he intended to seek a de facto confidence vote in his five-party alliance next Wednesday. If he loses the vote, the billionaire businessman would be duty bound to resign. </P>
<P> Berlusconi had 90 minutes of talks at the presidential Quirinale Palace with Scalfaro, the ultimate arbiter in Italian politics with the power to dissolve parliament. </P>
<P> ``You can't play little games in the closed rooms of political party headquarters to overturn what the people have decided. And what the people have decided is clear for all to see,'' Berlusconi said after the talks. </P>
<P> Italian television said Scalfaro told Berlusconi that parliament sanctioned the government with a vote of confidence and parliament had the right to remove it. </P>
<P> Berlusconi, who powered to victory at the head of a conservative alliance in general elections last March, set the stage for a parliamentary showdown on Dec. 21 after the League voted against the government in parliament Wednesday. </P>
<P> Outspoken League leader Umberto Bossi further enraged Berlusconi and the hard right National Alliance coalition party by holding exploratory talks with two leftist and centrist opposition parties on a possible new ruling alliance. </P>
<P> Media mogul Berlusconi, quizzed by magistrates Tuesday in a corruption probe that has undermined his authority, plans to address the Chamber of Deputies (lower house) next Wednesday after its expected approval of the 1995 budget. </P>
<P> Berlusconi's five-party coalition controls 352 seats in the 630-member chamber. </P>
<P> But the coalition is close to breaking point because of continual internal clashes between Berlusconi and Bossi and because of an institutional war with magistrates over their investigations into the prime minister's Fininvest media empire. </P>
<P> Berlusconi has described the investigation into suspicions that he knew of alleged bribes to tax police by Fininvest companies as part of a plot to bring him down. </P>
