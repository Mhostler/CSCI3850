<P>  Experts have blown up a rusting bomb left undisturbed for more than 20 years in a farming commune in Cambodia, part of the legacy of the massive B-52 bombing raids conducted by the United States during the late 1960s and early 1970s. </P>
<P> Two bomb disposal experts from the British mine-clearing charity Halo Trust successfully detonated the 500 lb bomb, which had been lying in an open paddy field dangerously close to several homes, on Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``There've been 16 people killed in recent years. The village chief said that 13 people from his village and three others have died as a result of live munitions exploding in and around the village,'' said Stephen Howall, project director for Southeast Asian Outreach. </P>
<P> The British humanitarian organisation, in the district to assist in aquacultural development, alerted Halo Trust to the peril posed to farmers by the unexploded munitions. Howall's usual work includes helping to raise shrimps in bomb craters. </P>
<P> Prek Treng, a vilage in Kandal province 25 miles southeast of Phnom Penh, witnessed some of the most fierce fighting in the 1970s between the U.S.-backed Lon Nol army and Khmer Rouge guerrillas supported by communist North Vietnamese soldiers. </P>
<P> ``Ordnance discovered has also included 40mm grenades, 82mm mortars, 2.75 inch air-to-ground rockets, one still imbedded in a roadside tree and air-dropped anti-personnel bomblets,'' said Howall, in addition to two 500-lb air-dropped bombs. </P>
<P> He said he believed the two bombs were dropped between 1973 and 1975. </P>
<P> He said they were located 10 miles from Neak Leung, a village the American admitted was bombed by mistake. </P>
<P> The bombing of Neak Leung, in 1973, was one of the tragedies of the Indochina War. An American B-52 bomber dropped its massive payload accidentally on the Mekong River port killing 137 people and wounding 286. </P>
<P> ``We've detonated quite a lot of ordnance around here over the past week,'' said Halo Field Officer Mike Marmol, a former member of the French Foreign Legion, as he sat astride one of the rusting bombs putting the final touches to a nine-pound demolition charge of plastic explosive. </P>
<P> ``The villagers are worried -- she's worried,'' he said, pointing to the owner of a house 200 yards away. ``She doesn't know whether she'll have a house left standing.'' </P>
<P> Scores of sandbags were piled on top of and around the bomb. In a command bunker, Marmol fixed the detonator fuse to a Russian hand-cranked exploder. Wires attached, the exploder was given several vigorous cranks and the button was pressed. </P>
<P> ``Open your mouths or your ear drums might blow,'' he warned. </P>
<P> The earth trembled, dirt and fragments fell all around as the bomb exploded. </P>
<P> The woman's house was still standing, but the red terracotta roof tiles had been pushed a little out of shape by the force of the blast. </P>
<P> ``My husband ploughed round this thing every year,'' the home owner said as she surveyed the damage left by the bomb. </P>
