<P>  Gulf Arab states called on Iraq on Monday to abide by all U.N. Security Council resolutions over its invasion of Kuwait and blamed the Baghdad government for the suffering of the Iraqi people. </P>
<P> The foreign ministers of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) -- also stated their support for the UAE in its dispute with Iran over three Gulf islands. </P>
<P> The foreign ministers, in a statement issued at the end of two days of talks in the Saudi capital Riyadh, did not refer to visits by Iraq's Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf to GCC members Oman and Qatar last week which diplomats say had angered their partners in the regional alliance. </P>
<P> Both countries had also failed to show up in Jeddah for GCC talks with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher last week. </P>
<P> Instead, they held separate talks at home with Sahaf, the first senior Iraqi official to visit any GCC state since the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. </P>
<P> The GCC statement said the ministers ``assert the need for Iraq to complete implementing all resolutions...over its aggression...especially those relating to releasing Kuwaiti prisoners and detainees...and returning Kuwaiti property.'' </P>
<P> It said the Gulf states were keen that Iraq's unity be preserved and expressed their ``sympathy with the suffering of the brotherly Iraqi people which the Iraqi government is to blame for'' by refusing to implement all U.N. resolutions. </P>
<P> Oman currently sits on the 15-member Security Council and diplomats say it appears to favour an easing of U.N. sanctions, which were imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait, mainly to alleviate the suffering of ordinary Iraqis. </P>
<P> But Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, like the United States, are opposed to easing the sanctions or direct contacts with Iraq. </P>
<P> The statement also supported the UAE in its dispute with Iran, saying the GCC was concerned about steps taken by the Iranian government aimed at consolidating its occupation of the three islands.'' </P>
