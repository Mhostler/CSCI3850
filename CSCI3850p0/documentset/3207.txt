<P>  Tests on over 700 patients brought into a Canadian emergency room with various injuries have concluded that 58 percent of the victims experienced potentially serious blood clots in their legs. </P>
<P> The findings, to be published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine, showed that better treatment for such clots, which can also form in the lungs and brain, are necessary for accident victims. </P>
<P> Because the risk of a clot is so high, ``we therefore consider all patients with major trauma to be at high risk for thromboembolic (clot-related) complications,'' said the research team, led by Dr. William Geerts of the Sunnybrook Health Science Center in Toronto, where the study was done. </P>
<P> Using a special test designed to uncover clots in the legs, the researchers found that the likelihood of developing a problem varied depending on the location of the original wound. </P>
<P> Clots interrupted the flow of blood through the leg in 50 percent of the people with face, chest or abdominal injuries, 54 percent with major head injuries, 62 percent of the spinal injury cases and 80 percent of patients who had broken their shin bones, the study found. </P>
