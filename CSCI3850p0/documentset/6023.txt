<DATELINE>TEHRAN, Iran (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Thousands demonstrated in Tehran and other Iranian cities Tuesday to mark the 15th anniversary of a bungled U.S. attempt to rescue American hostages which Tehran Radio said heralded the decline of ``The Great Satan.'' </P>
<P> The operation to rescue 52 American diplomats and servicemen held hostage in the U.S. Embassy by Iranian students was aborted after a helicopter collided with a transport aircraft, killing eight U.S. servicemen, during a sandstorm in a desert location in central Iran. </P>
<P> Tehran Radio said Tuesday's demonstrators were led by people on motorcycles carrying Iranian flags. They marched past the building which had housed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and then held a rally outside parliament. </P>
<P> Similar marches took place in other cities, the radio said. </P>
<P> ``The Tabas incident was like a miracle in this era -- a miracle in which America's satanic idol was broken with the hands and efforts of the Great Satan itself,'' the radio said. </P>
<P> Tabas is the name of the town nearest to the location where the U.S. commandos landed in Iran and ``The Great Satan'' is the phrase reserved by Iran to refer to the United States. </P>
<P> ``The decline of the Great Satan since the peak of its mischief in the first years of the 1980s clearly shows the disintegration of American civilization,'' said the radio in a commentary monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. </P>
<P> ``In the early hours of a day like today, aggressive American forces suffered a disgraceful defeat at a time when they faced no defensive force. They had to leave their equipment and the burnt bodies of their soldiers and flee.'' </P>
<P> The hostages were eventually released in January 1981 after spending 444 days in captivity, but relations between Tehran and Washington, at a low ebb since Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution, remain hostile. </P>
