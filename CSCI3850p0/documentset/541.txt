<P>  King Hussein of Jordan has said he hopes to visit Jerusalem soon and may hold a referendum before signing a peace treaty with Israel. </P>
<P> The Jordanian leader, on his way home after signing a historic declaration in Washington with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, said Monday he had the right to visit Jerusalem any time he wanted to. </P>
<P> King Hussein, who had lunch in London Monday with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, told reporters that he might hold a referendum to measure domestic opposition to a peace treaty with Israel. </P>
<P> ``One thing that is possible, and I have been thinking about it, is maybe a national referendum. </P>
<P> ``I am confident in what they will say. I will stake my whole future on it.'' </P>
<P> Rabin and King Hussein agreed at their Washington summit, which ended a 46-year state of war, that they would meet as often as required to help conclude a peace treaty. </P>
<P> On the sensitive issue of Jerusalem, King Hussein said: ``I have received several invitations to visit Jerusalem. I feel it is my right as a Muslim, a Hashemite and as an Arab to visit Jerusalem and Hebron and when I do so I will do so without anybody's permission.'' </P>
<P> On timing, the king told reporters: ``As to when, I don't know but it will happen sometime soon, God willing.'' </P>
<P> The Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) has protested that the Washington accord recognised a special role for the Jordanian monarch in preserving Moslem holy sites in Arab East Jerusalem. </P>
<P> Jordan said last Friday it supported the PLO's campaign to gain political sovereignty over East Jerusalem, adding that this did not clash with its religious custody of Muslim sites there. </P>
