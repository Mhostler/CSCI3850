<P>  British television went Wednesday where it had never gone before -- inside a woman's body to film the act of lovemaking. </P>
<P> Little was left to the imagination during the BBC documentary series ``The Human Animal: The Biology of Love'' which studied and recorded sexual behavior. </P>
<P> ``Love is just a biological mechanism with a specific function,'' said British ethologist Desmond Morris, the presenter of the six-part series. </P>
<P> Morris, author of ``The Naked Ape,'' described humans as the ``sexiest primates alive'' and demonstrated his theory with a scientific analysis of human sexual habits from courtship to coitus. </P>
<P> The footage of the female orgasm was taken by a ballpoint pen-sized camera fitted to an endoscope -- a flexible device made of light-transmitting fibers -- inserted inside the woman's vagina and by a tiny camera on her partner's penis. </P>
<P> After the moment of orgasm, contractions helped to dip the mouth of the woman's uterus repeatedly into a sperm pool deposited by the male. </P>
<P> ``In this way (it) increases the chances of fertilization,'' Morris explained. </P>
<P> ``It is now thought that by varying the timing of her orgasms the human female can increase or decrease her chance of fertilization by the sperm of any particular male,'' he added. </P>
<P> The program also showed the chemical warfare between the sperm of two lovers. Sperm from different men competed in sperm wars and even killed each other in what Morris described as a biological ``chastity belt.'' </P>
<P> But viewers looking for a thrill were disappointed. ``These sequences of basic biology are to romance what the bagpipes are to the lullaby,'' said one television reviewer. </P>
<P> Even the married couple who made love three times a day for three weeks for the documentary caused some controversy when they told a newspaper that some of the scenes were not real. </P>
<P> ``The only thing that wasn't faked was the orgasm,'' Wendy Duffield, 31, told the mass-market Sun newspaper. </P>
<P> The BBC defended the series. ``The scenes of the couple making love are entirely genuine and the orgasm filmed from inside was genuine,'' a spokeswoman said. </P>
<P> ``Cutaways after the scene are a normal part of most filmmaking, including documentary. In this particular case, it was impossible to film some of the physical changes as the sexual act was taking place.'' </P>
