<DATELINE>YOKOHAMA, Japan, April 19 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A mystery smell, possibly emitted by newly operating train air conditioners, sent more than 100 passengers to hospitals in Yokohama on Wednesday and triggered a new security scare in Japan. </P>
<P> No positive cause was immediately established for the smell, which made people's eyes water and gave them sore throats and nausea, a police spokesman reported. None of the injured people lost consciousness. </P>
<P> ``The cause remains unclear,'' the spokesman told Reuters. </P>
<P> Asked if terrorists were suspected the spokesman replied: ``We don't know yet.'' </P>
<P> One passenger said the smell, which swept through three open air railway stations in Yokohama at about 1 p.m. (0400 GMT), resembled that of sulphur. </P>
<P> But at a hospital where some of the injured were treated a doctor said their symptoms may have been caused by ammonia or a hydrochloric acid-based substance. </P>
<P> The stations are on the trunk Keihin Tohoku railway line connecting the port city of Yokohama with Tokyo, 30 km (16 miles) to the north. </P>
<P> There was no indication that the incident was linked to last month's sarin nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway system, which killed 12 people and injured more than 5,000. </P>
<P> The doomsday cult Aum Shinri Kyo (Supreme Truth sect) is under investigation for the March 20 Tokyo attack. </P>
<P> ``It does not appear sarin is involved,'' the police spokesman said. </P>
<P> The chief of the emergency center at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo, Nobukatsu Takasu, said no patients had symptoms of nerve gas poisoning. </P>
<P> ``The possibility that it was sarin or other military gas is remote,'' he said. </P>
<P> In a sign of the nervousness gripping Japan since the March 20 Tokyo subway attack, Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama and other key ministers interrupted parliamentary proceedings to bring members up to date on the latest reports of the incident. </P>
<P> ``Its very worrying and we will be making every effort to deal with this as soon as possible,'' Murayama said. </P>
<P> Ironically, the Lower House of parliament was at the time passing a bill to ban the use, production, import or possession of sarin and other lethal gases. </P>
<P> Nearly all those taken to hospital were on trains or waiting for them at the three stations on the regular surface railway in Yokohama. First reports had said the fumes were in Yokohama's subway system. </P>
<P> The reports of the foul odour came from Ishikawacho, Kannai and the main Yokohama station. </P>
<P> According to East Japan Railway Co, which operates trains running through the three stations, fumes inside a train that stopped at Ishikawacho seemed to come from air conditioners which started operating on Wednesday as the weather gets warmer with the approach of summer. </P>
<P> Kyodo news agency quoted one female victim on a train as crying out: ``Please open the windows.'' The woman said that within a minute or two she felt pain in her throat. </P>
<P> Dozens of fire engines, ambulances and police units converged on the three stations, and chemical experts wearing gas masks rushed on to the platforms. </P>
<P> The army also immediately dispatched its anti-chemical warfare unit. </P>
<P> ``This was not caused by sarin. There will be no deaths,'' Home Affairs Minister Hiromu Nonaka told parliament. </P>
