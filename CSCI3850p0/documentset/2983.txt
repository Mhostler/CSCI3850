<P>  PLO-Israeli talks on Palestinian elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip have been delayed at Israel's request, PLO officials said Saturday. </P>
<P> ``The talks will be held in Cairo Tuesday instead of Monday. Israel requested the delay,'' said Nabil Shaath, the top PLO negotiator who holds the planning portfolio in the Palestinian self-rule authority. </P>
<P> Israeli officials would not confirm the delay. </P>
<P> Last year's peace deal between Israel and the PLO called for the election of a council and for ``permanent status'' negotiations on the West Bank and Gaza to begin by the third year of an interim self-rule period. </P>
<P> The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) took control of Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho from Israel in May. </P>
<P> Talks on elections have been bogged down over a dispute on the nature and size of an elected Palestinian body and the scope of an Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank on the eve of balloting. </P>
<P> Shaath told reporters after the weekly Palestinian Authority meeting in Gaza that the talks starting Tuesday would be conducted by two PLO-Israeli committees. </P>
<P> ``One committee will discuss the concept of the interim settlement and another specialized committee will discuss elections,'' he said. </P>
<P> Azmi al-Shuaibi, member of the Authority in charge of youth, said: ``Information minister Yasser Abed Rabbo will head the PLO's Higher Negotiations Committee in tha absence of Abu Mazen (PLO Executive Committee member Mahmoud Abbas).'' </P>
<P> The committee, formed prior to the 1992 Madrid peace conference to supervise Palestinian-Israeli talks, has not convened since secret PLO-Israeli talks began in Oslo last year. </P>
