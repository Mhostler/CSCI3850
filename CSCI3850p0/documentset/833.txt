<DATELINE>MASERU, Lesotho (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Four people were killed and several seriously wounded Wednesday when Lesotho soldiers and police opened fire on protesters outside the king's palace in the capital Maseru, mortuary officials said. </P>
<P> A correspondent for Reuters was shown the bodies of four people at the mortuary. Officials said all had been shot dead in the clashes. </P>
<P> Heavily armed police and soldiers patrolled the streets of the capital in the late afternoon, after dispersing the demonstrators who had been protesting at King Letsie III's dissolution of the government and parliament. </P>
<P> Troops and police opened fire and wounded at least eight demonstrators who had planned to petition the king, saying they wanted the tiny southern African kingdom declared a republic. </P>
<P> Seven of those hurt were seriously wounded, hospital officials said. </P>
<P> More than 2,000 protesters marched on the monarch's palace after an early morning broadcast in which he told the 1.6 million people of the mountainous nation he was dismissing the 16-month-old government of Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle. </P>
<P> ``There has been some shooting. I counted eight people who have been wounded,'' said a witness outside the palace. </P>
<P> The 34-year-old king, who replaced his father Moshoeshoe II in 1990, said in his 5 a.m. broadcast he was also suspending part of the constitution and ordering fresh elections because people were dissatisfied with the government. </P>
<P> Western diplomats said that despite the sacking of the southern African country's government, officials of the Basutoland Congress Party (BCP) government carried on work as normal, apparently ignoring the king. </P>
<P> The BCP easily won elections in March 1993 that were the country's first multi-party polls for 20 years. </P>
<P> Lesotho, which is about the size of Belgium and ringed by South Africa, has been rocked this year by a police strike and a mutiny by soldiers in which the deputy prime minister was killed. </P>
