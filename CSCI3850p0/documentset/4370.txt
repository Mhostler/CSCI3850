<P>  European Union foreign and development ministers failed Wednesday to agree on how much aid to offer some of the world's poorest countries after Britain sought a major cut. </P>
<P> As a result, the 15-member bloc postponed a two-day trade and aid negotiating session with the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) grouping of states due to start Thursday. </P>
<P> ``I will tell the ACP states tomorrow there is no proposal,'' French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, whose country holds the EU presidency, told a news conference after the meeting. </P>
<P> Juppe said it was public knowledge Britain wanted to make a major cut in its contribution to a new five-year European Development Fund because it wants to give priority to bilateral aid, which it considers more effective. </P>
<P> ``It's a question of philosophy,'' Juppe said, adding that such an approach, if pursued, would lead to the end of the EU. </P>
<P> Britain, the third largest donor, sought to cut its contribution to $1.6 billion, EU sources said. A British spokesman declined comment on the figure. </P>
<P> Britain provided $2.2 billion to the previous fund. </P>
<P> Germany, the Netherlands and Italy opposed an increase in EU aid in real terms. </P>
<P> Juppe said the EU would need to increase aid to $16 billion over the next five years, from $13.3 billion to take account of contributions from three new members -- Austria, Sweden and Finland -- and inflation. </P>
<P> But less than $14.4 billion was offered. </P>
<P> ``It would be unpresentable,'' Juppe said, adding it was totally unacceptable for 15 member states to offer less than that granted by 12 members previously. </P>
<P> British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, describing EU aid programs to developing countries as ``diffuse'' and ``haphazard,'' said Britain would cut the amount it channeled through the EU. </P>
