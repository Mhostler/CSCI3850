<P>  A Berlin clinic has for the first time successfully treated a patient for heart disease by fitting an ``artificial heart'' alongside his own, the clinic said Monday. </P>
<P> A spokeswoman at the German Heart Center in Berlin said the 38-year-old patient had been suffering from cardiomyopathy (cardiac muscle disease) and had carried the device for 160 days to support his own sick heart while it recovered. </P>
<P> The device was removed by surgery five weeks ago. Since then the patient has been able to eat and move about, she said. </P>
<P> The patient, from Thuringia in eastern Germany, had been in serious condition and underwent the operation because he could not wait for a heart transplant. </P>
<P> The operation could pave the way for treating several other heart diseases, the clinic said. </P>
