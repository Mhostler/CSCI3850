<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, April 13 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Malaysia's opposition Democratic Action Party (DAP), fighting what it calls ``national euphoria'' over a booming economy, asked voters on Thursday to ``save the country from a one-party state.'' </P>
<P> DAP Secretary-General Lim Kit Siang, Malaysia's opposition leader for 25 years, also called for greater democracy, accusing Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of ruthlessly using ``draconian'' laws to suppress dissent. </P>
<P> The DAP theme in general elections on April 24 and 25 is ``to bring about full liberalisation and to give every Malaysian an equal place under the Malaysian sun and save the country from a one-party state,'' Lim told a news conference after issuing the party manifesto. </P>
<P> He said Mahathir's ruling National Front coalition was confident that with ``national euphoria'' over seven straight years of eight percent economic growth ``it is heading for a landslide victory to crush the opposition.'' </P>
<P> Lim said the DAP was appealing to voters to keep opposition alive in Malaysia. ``Without a strong and effective opposition, those in office would be even more tempted to flaunt their power with a 'so what' mentality,'' he said. </P>
<P> Balloting is for 192 seats in an expanded parliament and 394 seats in 11 of Malaysia's 13 state assemblies. </P>
<P> The National Front, made up of 14 racially based parties, had 141 seats in the recently dissolved 180-seat parliament. </P>
<P> The DAP had 20 seats, with the remainder divided among smaller opposition parties. </P>
<P> Mahathir's coalition won a thumping two-thirds majority in in the last parliamentary election in 1990, despite an econony in recession, the opposition was united and his own party was badly wounded after a bitter leadership battle. </P>
<P> This time around Malaysians are enjoying a period of unprecedented prosperity, the opposition is divided and Mahathir's party and coalition are more united than ever. </P>
<P> Lim said the DAP would campaign on the themes of growing official corruption and suppression of dissent and of less than total democracy. </P>
<P> ``Malaysia is undoubtedly more undemocratic than when the nation achieved independence 38 years ago in 1957,'' the party's manifesto says. </P>
<P> Lim's son, member of parliament Lim Guan Eng, has been charged under the Sedition Act after accusing former Malacca state chief minister Rahim Tamby Chik of corruption. </P>
<P> Chik, a member of Mahathir's United Malays National Organisation, faces trial on corruption charges shortly after the elections. </P>
<P> On Friday, a Federal Court was due to rule on the appeal of another DAP member of parliament, Wee Choo Keong, against a two year jail term for contempt. </P>
<P> Two investigative journalists for a Malay language newspaper were charged earlier this month under the Official Secrets Act for publishing information about a kidnapping. </P>
<P> ``We are concerned that this could be used as an example to other journalists as well as politicians,'' DAP deputy leader and noted criminal lawyer, Karpal Singh, told Reuters. </P>
<P> The DAP is calling the 1995 election the most ``unfair, unfree and unclean in Malaysian history. </P>
<P> It alleges the DAP is being denied access to television, that a ban on mass rallies prevents it from reaching voters, and that the short nine-day official campaign period favours the ruling coalition. </P>
