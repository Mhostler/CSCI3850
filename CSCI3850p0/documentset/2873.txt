<P>  Vinny Pazienza has a simple reason for wanting to fight Roberto Duran again. </P>
<P> ``It's hatred,'' Pazienza said of the legendary 43-year-old Panamanian fighter at a news conference Monday to announce their January 14 rematch at the Atlantic City Convention Center. </P>
<P> ``I have genuine dislike of the man,'' said Pazienza. ``He is not a good person. To beat up somebody I hate and I'm going to be paid for it I said, 'we got a date.''' </P>
<P> Pazienza is reported to be earning $750,000 while Duran is getting $610,000 for the scheduled 12-round fight at the 168-pound super middleweight limit. </P>
<P> Pazienza is angry at Duran for his behavior after their first fight five months ago in Las Vegas when he gave Duran only his 10th loss in 104 professional fights. Pazienza got off the floor in the fifth round and put on a furious rally to win a close but unanimous 12-round decision. </P>
<P> ``He's bellyaching that he won the fight,'' Pazienza said of the former four-time world champion. ``It's okay when you beat 90 guys and knock people out, but then you get beat and you don't want to handle it and can't take it and you start crying. I don't like that. </P>
<P> ``Duran didn't win the fight. In this game there is no room for crybabies. This game you live and die by the sword. It's kill or be killed. </P>
<P> ``I just can't stand the way this guy disrespects me. He gives me no respect at all,'' said Pazienza, the former lightweight and junior middleweight world champion with a 39-5 record. </P>
<P> ``I want to end his career. I want to put the nail in the coffin. This should be his last fight.'' </P>
<P> Pazienza said that this time Duran won't be able to dispute the outcome. </P>
<P> ``That wasn't my best last time,'' he said.'' I will be at my best. Duran is not going to hit me. I'll be faster for this fight, I'll be throwing more combinations. </P>
<P> ``I don't think he'll be around by the time the time 12th round comes around because I'm going to be hitting him a lot. </P>
<P> ``The only way is he going to beat me is if he pulls a George Foreman and I don't get knocked out,'' Pazienza said of the 45-year-old Foreman's one-punch knockout of former heavyweight champion Michael Moorer last month. </P>
<P> ``It happened for George but that is one in a million.'' </P>
