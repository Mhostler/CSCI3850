<P>  An 18th-century Korean porcelain jar sold for $1.6 million Wednesday at Christie's Korean Works of Art Auction. </P>
<P> The Choson Dynasty jar is significant because it is unusually tall -- 205/8 inches -- and because it depicts five-clawed dragons, a symbol of China's Ming Dynasty, to whom Koreans remained loyal despite its overthrow. The final price was $1,652,500, including Christie's commissions. It had been expected to sell for $1.5 million to $2 million. </P>
<P> Another porcelain piece from Korea's Choson Dynasty in the 18th century, a brush holder, sold for about $1.02 million. It is unusual to find such a hexagonal pot in perfect condition. </P>
<P> An inlaid jar from the 13th-century Koryo Dynasty with a replaced neck, which had been expected to sell for between $40,000 and $60,000, sold for $332,500. </P>
