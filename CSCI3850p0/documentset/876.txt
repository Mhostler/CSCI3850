<P>  A thrifty New Zealander conducted an unusual funeral Friday -- his own. </P>
<P> Wheelchair-bound Alan Kearns, 66, pre-recorded his own funeral service for 120 mourners with readings from the Bible and a selection of songs including his theme tune, ``Wheels.'' </P>
<P> Kearns, who died of cancer Thursday in the South Island city of Christchurch, wrote his own death notice announcing he had ``left this world for a better place, or if not, at least for a warmer climate.'' </P>
<P> Kearns had planned to save on undertaker's fees by catching a taxi to his funeral, but was thwarted because hospital authorities did not want the body lying around waiting for a cab, a spokesman for undertakers Simplicity Funerals said. </P>
