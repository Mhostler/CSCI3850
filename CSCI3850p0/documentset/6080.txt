<DATELINE>BOSTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Mariusz Czerkawski's goal with 4:09 to play snapped a scoreless tie and the Bruins held on for a 1-0 victory over the Hartford Whalers Wednesday, clinching a playoff berth. </P>
<P> Blaine Lacher made 22 saves for his fourth shutout of the season, including a blocker save on a 3-on-1 breakaway to start the Bruins' goal-scoring rush in the other direction. </P>
<P> John Rohloff then took a shot from the right slot that Czerkawski re-directed past Hartford goaltender Sean Burke. ''It was like playoff style all the way,'' said Lacher. ``It was a lot of clutch-and-grab, the refs let a lot of stuff go. </P>
<P> ``It's probably a good indicator of what the playoffs will be like. You could tell early on it was going to be a 1-0, 2-1 game all the way.'' </P>
<P> Boston became the fourth team in the Eastern Conference to clinch a playoff berth. </P>
<P> Burke made 33 saves for Hartford, which fell two points behind the Rangers for the final playoff spot in the East. Hartford has two games remaining. </P>
<P> ``I knew it was going to be a tight one, you could see it starting to develop into that,'' said Burke. </P>
<P> ``I knew a power play or anything like that, or a break one way or another could decide the game, and it did. They got a bounce, it went their way, and that was the difference.'' </P>
<P> In New York, Adam Graves tallied a pair of third-period goals to rally the Rangers to a 6-4 win over the Tampa Bay Lightning. </P>
<P> New York goalie Glenn Healy, who replaced Mike Richter at 3:39 of the third, stopped 22 of the 23 shots he faced. Richter was lifted after allowing three goals on 18 shots. </P>
<P> New York's Mark Messier had three assists to tie John Bucyk for seventh on the all-time scoring list with 1,369 points. </P>
<P> In Buffalo, Dominik Hasek made 31 saves for his fourth shutout of the season as the Sabres won their their third straight game, 5-0 over the Florida Panthers. </P>
<P> Donald Audette, Alexander Mogilny and Garry Galley each had a goal and an assist and Pat LaFontaine set up a pair of goals for Buffalo, which has 46 points and a one-point lead over the Rangers and a three-point lead over Hartford. </P>
<P> John Vanbiesbrouck allowed all five goals on just 19 shots as the Panthers had their three-game winnng streak snapped. Florida is four points behind the Rangers. </P>
<P> At Washington, Sylvain Cote snapped a tie midway through the third period to lift the Capitals to a 6-5 victory over the New York Islanders. </P>
<P> Dmitri Khristich had two goals and an assist, Michal Pivonka had a goal and three assists, and Joe Juneau set up three goals for the Capitals, who have 47 points. </P>
<P> At New Jersey, Tomas Sandstrom scored 2:11 into the third period as the Pittsburgh Penguins rallied from a two-goal deficit for a 3-3 tie with the Devils. </P>
<P> Kevin Stevens scored twice for the Penguins, who remained two points behind Quebec in the race for the top record in the East. Pittsburgh has 59 points. </P>
<P> Pittsburgh welcomed back goaltender Tom Barrasso, who missed the first 43 games of the season after off-season wrist surgery. Barrasso, who had not played since last April's first-round playoff loss to Washington, stopped 31 shots. </P>
<P> In Quebec, Mike Ricci poked in a rebound of a missed shot by Uwe Krupp in the opening seconds of the third period to lift the Nordiques into a 1-1 tie with the Montreal Canadiens. </P>
<P> Stephane Fiset made 38 saves for the Nordiques. </P>
<P> Bryan Fogarty scored for Montreal, three points behind the Rangers for the final Eastern playoff berth. The Canadiens have not missed the playoffs in 25 years. </P>
<P> In Philadelphia, Alexei Yashin's second-period goal snapped a tie and Steve Larouche and Sylvain Turgeon each added a goal and an assist as the Ottawa Senators defeated the Flyers 5-2. </P>
<P> Ottawa won for just the third time in 22 road games this season. Ottawa, which had seven road wins in franchise history coming into this season, won back-to-back road games for the first time since 1993. </P>
<P> The loss snapped a six-game home winning streak for Philadelphia, which is five points behind Quebec for the top spot in the East. </P>
<P> In Toronto, Dave Andreychuk and Todd Gill scored 28 seconds apart in the second period to lift the Maple Leafs to a 5-2 victory over the Vancouver Canucks. </P>
<P> Toronto moved into fourth place in the Western Conference standings, two points ahead of Chicago. </P>
<P> The Canucks are in sixth place in the conference, two points behind Chicago and one ahead of Dallas. </P>
<P> In Anaheim, Sergei Makarov snapped a second-period tie and Craig Janney and Igor Larianov had two assists apiece to lead the San Jose Sharks to a 5-2 victory over the Mighty Ducks. </P>
<P> Sandis Ozolinsh and Pat Falloon each had a goal and an assist for the Sharks, who moved into a tie with Los Angeles for the eighth and final Western playoff berth. </P>
<P> The Ducks, even with Winnipeg with 35 points, trail Edmonton by one point and Los Angeles and San Jose by two. </P>
