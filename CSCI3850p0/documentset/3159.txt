<P>  The investigation of outgoing Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy has not broadened beyond its original mission despite reports of a drastically wider probe, an official involved in the investigation told Reuters Monday. </P>
<P> ``Our mission has not changed, and that's to look at possible gratuities and that includes the giver and the givee,'' said the official. </P>
<P> Espy is under criminal investigation by independent counsel Donald Smaltz for a broad range of improprieties, including whether the cabinet member violated federal law by illegally accepting gifts from companies regulated by the Agriculture Department, among those the nation's largest poultry processor, the Arkansas-based Tyson Foods. </P>
<P> Recent media reports have said that Smaltz has broadened his probe to include the relationship between Tyson Foods and President and Hillary Rodham Clinton, and that Smaltz's investigators are now examining the global operations of Tyson and looking closely at the relationship between Don Tyson, the company's chairman, and Espy and other government officials. </P>
<P> The official, who is on Smaltz's investigation team, denied the probe had taken a new turn or suddenly enlarged its scope. The inquiry, under way since late September, has always focused on a wide array of issues, said the official. </P>
<P> ``This is about Mr. Espy and about gratuities. We're not just looking at poultry, we're looking at a whole host of things,'' said the source. </P>
<P> Espy has been accused on taking gifts not only from Tyson, but also from food company Quaker Oats and Sun Diamond, the California-based almond and raisin cooperative. He has also been charged with improperly using government vehicles and using taxpayer money to make personal trips. </P>
<P> And in a charge that surfaced shortly before Espy submitted his resignation, his girlfriend was found to have accepted a college scholarship from Tyson Foods. </P>
<P> A close look at the relationship between Don Tyson and Espy is an important part of the probe. </P>
<P> ``Both Mr. Tyson and Mr. Espy have admitted that things went back and forth between them, so we have to look into them,'' the official said. ``But we are not investigating Mr. Tyson personally, meaning things unrelated to Espy.'' </P>
<P> Early on in the investigation, Smaltz told Reuters that the investigation would be broad. ``I intend to view my grant of jurisdiction broadly,'' he said in an interview on Sept. 23. At that time, Smaltz said that as issues arose in the press, his legal team would be obligated to look into them. </P>
<P> Asked if the probe had widened to a broader look at the U.S. poultry industry and its regulation, the investigatory official said those reports were an exaggeration, but noted that ``Espy is Secretary of Agriculture and in charge of policy.'' </P>
<P> Reports that the investigation team had been expanded to 35 attorneys are wrong, said the official. Smaltz's team is expected to consist of seven attorneys, with a support staff of investigators and clerical workers. </P>
<P> ``We're trying to stay as lean as we can, and get it done as quickly as we can,'' said the official. Smaltz has repeatedly said the investigation could take up to a year. </P>
<P> Reports have also surfaced that Agriculture Department employees were pressured to contribute to the Clinton campaign in 1992, in return for being promoted later. </P>
<P> The official on Smaltz's team said the independent counsel's office is interested in those reports, but has not decided to officially investigate the charges. </P>
<P> ``We are interested in that, but no decision has been made on what will happen,'' he said. </P>
