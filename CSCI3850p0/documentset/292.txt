<P>  A 22-year-old British woman accused of snatching an hours-old baby, prompting a huge outcry and nationwide search, is herself four months pregnant. </P>
<P> Her father, Eric Kelley, was quoted by newspapers Tuesday as saying his daughter Julie, who has been charged with kidnapping newborn Abbie Humphries on July 1, could not wait for her own child to be born. </P>
<P> ``She must have been so desperate to have a baby that the remaining five months seemed like a lifetime so she decided to take someone else's baby,'' Kelley said. </P>
<P> ``She saw the baby's big blue eyes and couldn't resist it.'' </P>
<P> Police reunited Abbie with her parents Saturday in Nottingham, central England, after raiding a house near the hospital following a telephone tip-off. </P>
