<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Federal Reserve bought at least a billion dollars in currency markets Wednesday to rescue the greenback from a drop to a new post-World War II low against the Japanese yen. </P>
<P> Dealers described the Fed's dollar buying as an unusually aggressive move aimed at sending a signal to speculators trying to drive the currency lower. </P>
<P> They estimated the central bank spent between $1 billion and $1.5 billion in the intervention against the yen and the German mark. </P>
<P> ``This last round was pretty big,'' said one trader. ``It was different from the others. They just kept paying.'' </P>
<P> In the past, the Fed has stepped in with ``rounds of $10 million to $20 million,'' one dealer said, but added that in this round, ``they're coming with $50 million each time.'' </P>
<P> The dollar faced heavy selling Tuesday and early Wednesday after a report by the National Association of Purchasing Management showed vigorous manufacturing activity in October and hinted at higher prices in coming months. </P>
<P> The report sparked fears of higher inflation and sent U.S. stocks and bonds sharply lower. Currency traders, worried about the flight from dollar-based assets, sold the greenback heavily, pushing it through its previous postwar low of 96.35 yen set Oct. 25 to a new low of 96.11 yen. </P>
<P> Shortly after the dollar touched that low, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen called the recent foreign exchange developments ``counterproductive'' and warned that the United States and its allies were monitoring the activity. </P>
<P> Minutes later, traders reported that the Federal Reserve, which takes orders from the Treasury on currency market intervention, had entered the market to buy dollars for both marks and yen. </P>
<P> ``The dollar was at a very critical level and the Federal Reserve probably knew that it was going to take another large move down if they did not intervene,'' said Paul Farrell, vice president at Chase Manhattan Bank. </P>
<P> By late Wednesday in New York, the dollar was almost a full yen higher at 97.60 yen vs. late Tuesday's 96.70 yen. It surged more than two pfennigs to 1.5165 marks from 1.4956 marks late Tuesday. </P>
<P> Wednesday's intervention helped to allay concerns that the American officials were operating under a policy of ``benign neglect,'' and were content to let the dollar drop. </P>
<P> A lower dollar makes U.S.-made products cheaper in other countries and makes foreign goods more expensive here. </P>
<P> Such concerns surfaced as the Fed refrained from open currency market intervention when the dollar came under heavy selling pressure throughout October. </P>
<P> The view that American officials were not concerned about the dollar was reinforced last month, when at one point, Bentsen told reporters that the United States had no immediate plans for intervention. He later backpedaled, saying officials were ready to intervene when necessary. </P>
<P> ``They had to get the message through that they don't want to see the dollar any lower and, in order for the signal to hit home, we had to see someone intervene,'' said Richard Vullo, vice president at Hypobank. </P>
<P> While two interventions involving the Fed and other nations' central banks May 4 and June 24 were deemed failures by the market, traders said Wednesday's move proved to be at least a temporary remedy for the dollar's weakness. </P>
<P> Many analysts said the longer term fate of the dollar may rest with the Fed's policymaking Federal Open Market Committee, which meets Nov. 15 and is likely to discuss raising interest rates for the sixth time this year to stave off inflation. </P>
