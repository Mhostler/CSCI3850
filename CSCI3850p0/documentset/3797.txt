<P>  Beijing announced Monday a crackdown on compact disc piracy to start during the Chinese New Year festival beginning Jan. 31, thus addressing a key dispute in a looming trade war with the United States. </P>
<P> A senior U.S. trade official said in Hong Kong a new proposal from China on intellectual-property rights had narrowed the gap between the two sides, less than three weeks before the threatened start of the trade war. </P>
<P> But the two countries remained far apart on details, the official, who asked not to be identified, told reporters. </P>
<P> China's announcement comes just two days before U.S. and Chinese officials are to meet in Beijing to try to end the trade dispute over U.S. charges that China has done too little to enforce intellectual-property rights protection. </P>
<P> Intellectual property is central to the deepening rift between Beijing and Washington, which on Dec. 31 threatened to punish China with stiff tariffs on $2.8 billion worth of its exports on Feb. 4 unless it acts to enforce protection. </P>
<P> China pledged tit-for-tat sanctions against U.S. goods if the U.S. tariffs are imposed, raising the specter of a Pacific trade war that would damage both countries. </P>
<P> Among Washington's chief complaints has been Beijing's failure to close 29 south China plants, some state-owned, that have been pressing 75 million pirated compact discs a year. </P>
<P> As a first step in the new battle to combat pirate discs, officials this month sent a high-level team to the booming southern province of Guangdong to gather evidence, Xinhua quoted State Copyright Administration official Gao Linghan as saying. </P>
<P> The campaign would also be aimed at examining compact disc production lines, Gao said. </P>
<P> Reproduction firms must re-register with the Press and Publication Administration before April 1, or they will lose approval to run their businesses, Gao said. </P>
<P> China confiscated 2.2 million pirated compact discs last year, with the biggest raid netting one million pirate CDs in just four hours at the Rixing Shopping Center in Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong, Gao said. </P>
<P> From December, all China-made CDs must carry a source identification mark or the maker could face piracy charges. </P>
<P> China is negotiating with the U.S. Film Market Association to properly identify sources of U.S. copyrights, Gao said, adding that similar contracts signed with the International Federation of the Phonograph Industry and the Hong Kong Film Association have already taken effect. </P>
<P> U.S. trade negotiators will meet their Chinese counterparts in Beijing Jan.18-20, but the U.S. official declined to say if he thought an agreement could be reached. </P>
<P> He cited as an example a state-owned company in Shenzhen near Hong Kong that he said produced crates of laser discs of Disney's ``The Lion King'' months before the hit movie was even released on videotape. </P>
<P> U.S. publishers, film studios, software firms and other copyright owners have calculated that their industry loses $827 million a year to Chinese pirates. </P>
