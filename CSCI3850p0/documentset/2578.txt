<P>  Hijackers diverted an Algerian aircraft to Majorca Sunday and called for the freeing of all political prisoners in Algeria, airport officials said. </P>
<P> They said the hijackers were also demanding that elections interrupted in 1991 be resumed. They were annulled after the first round was won by Islamic fundamentalists. </P>
<P> Airport director Pedro Meauria, involved in the negotiations with the hijackers, said he had been told there were explosives on board but had not been able to confirm this. </P>
<P> But he said the hijackers had described themselves as ``peaceful citizens.'' </P>
<P> Meauria said two passengers and two air hostesses had been allowed off the plane. Another passengers was released earlier after suffering a nervous breakdown. </P>
<P> The Fokker 27, with 38 passengers and four crew on board, was on a domestic flight between Algiers and Ouargla, 340 miles to the south in the Sahara desert, when it was diverted to Majorca. All those on board are believed to be Algerians. </P>
