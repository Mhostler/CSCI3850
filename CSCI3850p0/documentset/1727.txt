<P>  British newspapers used puns on drinking Saturday to express skepticism at official explanations why Russian President Boris Yeltsin failed to get off his plane to meet Irish leaders. </P>
<P> ``Hiccup as Boris can't get off jet,'' said the top-selling Sun tabloid, which is also widely available in Ireland where Yeltsin stopped briefly Friday on his way home from a visit to the United States. </P>
<P> ``Boozski Boris out of action,'' declared the Daily Star. </P>
<P> The Today newspaper headlined its report: ``Zzzzzzzz, hic, snore -- Boris on state visit.'' </P>
<P> Yeltsin, whose erratic behavior on previous public engagements has led to speculation of heavy drinking, failed to emerge from his aircraft for talks with Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds, who waited on the tarmac. </P>
<P> Russian and Irish officials at Shannon airport, near the western city of Limerick, tried to hide their embarrassment. </P>
<P> ``He's been traveling for 17 hours. He's very tired and is sleeping,'' said Russia's First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets, who met Reynolds in Yeltsin's place. </P>
<P> The presidential press office in Moscow said Yeltsin was slightly unwell because of the pressure of the trip. </P>
<P> But when he arrived back in Moscow a smiling Yeltsin told reporters he felt fine and that it had all been a mistake because bodyguards had not allowed anyone to wake him up. </P>
<P> Some supporters have become embarrassed at his public behavior, particularly during ceremonies in Berlin last month to mark the withdrawal of the last Russian troops from Germany. </P>
<P> The Russian leader stumbled after a champagne lunch, seized a conductor's baton to direct an orchestra and, on another occasion, grabbed a microphone and sang tunelessly. </P>
