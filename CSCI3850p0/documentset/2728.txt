<P>  Colorado head coach Bill McCartney, the most successful football coach in school history, announced Saturday he will resign at the end of the season. </P>
<P> McCartney, who has coached the Buffaloes since 1982 and guided Colorado to a share of the 1990 national championship, made the announcement following a 41-20 win over Iowa State. </P>
<P> ``I've been thinking about this for some time now,'' he said at a post-game news conference. ``It's time. It's been 13 years and this chapter has ended. </P>
<P> ``There are no negatives, there are no reasons, except that this is the time,'' McCartney continued. ``This is the right thing for us to do as a family.'' </P>
<P> The 54-year-old McCartney compiled a record of 92-55-5 and will take the Buffaloes to a post-season bowl this year for the ninth time since he succeeded Chuck Fairbanks as coach. </P>
<P> In McCartney's first three seasons, the Buffaloes were 7-25-1. In his fourth campaign, 1985, they finished 7-5 after losing to Washington in the Freedom Bowl. </P>
<P> In 1990, Colorado capped an 11-1-1 season with a 10-9 victory over Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl and split the national championship with Georgia Tech. </P>
<P> McCartney denied rumors he would replace George Perles at Michigan State, but refused to rule out another coaching job. </P>
<P> ``I wouldn't rule out coaching again, but I don't anticipate coaching any time soon,'' McCartney said. </P>
<P> Colorado Athletic Director Bill Marolt, who learned of McCartney's decision with the rest of the coaching staff Saturday morning, said he was ``shocked and surprised'' by the resignation. </P>
<P> ``It comes at a time when we really didn't expect it,'' Marolt said. ``I felt ultimately we would see Bill McCartney be our football coach for the next 13 years.'' </P>
