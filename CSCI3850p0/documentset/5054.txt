<DATELINE>WELLINGTON, March 21 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  New Zealand Prime Minister Jim Bolger signalled on Tuesday he would try to set aside disagreements on nuclear policy and open a new chapter in relations when he meets President Bill Clinton next week. </P>
<P> Bolger, who leaves for the United States on Wednesday on his biggest foreign policy mission since taking office in 1990, said the two sides should acknowledge their differences and focus on new areas as they patch up a decade-long rift. </P>
<P> ``It's entirely up to them to make their policy decision and for us to make ours, and to deal with that as we must -- but frankly to get on with living in those many, many other areas where we do not have any fundamental disagreement,'' Bolger told Radio New Zealand. </P>
<P> When he meets Clinton on March 27, Bolger will become the first New Zealand prime minister to visit the White House since Ronald Reagan greeted Sir Robert Muldoon in 1984. </P>
<P> The Labour government of David Lange, which took power in New Zealand later that year, angered Washington by pushing through anti-nuclear legislation which effectively made it impossible for U.S. warships to visit the country's ports. </P>
<P> The penalty was New Zealand's suspension from the ANZUS defence pact with the United States and Australia, and exclusion from top-level diplomatic contacts in Washington. </P>
<P> Although New Zealand is still barred from joint military exercises and intelligence-sharing, the Clinton administration restored high-level access last year. </P>
<P> Bolger will be seeking to broaden the relationship and define what is possible when two sides agree to disagree. The emphasis at the 45-minute working meeting will be on rebuilding areas of common interest outside the nuclear issue. </P>
<P> New Zealand's anti-nuclear stance enjoys such overwhelming public support that it is virtually set in stone. Washington has been equally adamant about its policy of neither confirming nor denying whether its ships carry nuclear weapons or are nuclear powered. </P>
<P> ``The meeting sets the tone for what follows,'' Terence O'Brien, head of New Zealand's independent Centre for Strategic Studies said in an interview. </P>
<P> ``There might be some mention of the nuclear issue but it can only be a rehearsal of the basic positions on both sides.'' </P>
<P> Given both sides' entrenched positions, New Zealand officials expect trade and investment, the future of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum and world security issues to make up the bulk of the discussion. </P>
<P> New Zealand exporters have expressed their anger at the sale of subsidised U.S. dairy exports in Asia in recent months. </P>
