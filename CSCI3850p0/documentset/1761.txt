<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  South African President Nelson Mandela promoted an image of stability and market-friendly policies in his country Sunday in a bid to attract foreign and domestic capital to help rebuild the nation. </P>
<P> ``I am here, confident that I will not go back to my country with empty hands,'' Mandela said at an outdoor reception hosted by New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani at Gracie Mansion, the official residence of the mayor. </P>
<P> U.S. officials expect an announcement of more assistance for South Africa when Mandela is in Washington Tuesday. </P>
<P> Mandela made his remarks before several hundred business and political leaders. He said he wants the United States to open its market wide to South Africa. </P>
<P> ``We want American businessmen to come and invest in our country. Conditions for investments are there. We have a stable government which has succeeded in uniting the country. </P>
<P> ``We have brought down the level of violence and crime...but to put an end to the violence in our country, is not something we can achieve overnight,'' Mandela said. </P>
<P> Mandela arrived here Saturday to start his first U.S. visit since he was elected president in South Africa's first all-race election last April. </P>
<P> Mandela's eight-day trip, includes a speech to the United Nations Monday, a visit Tuesday with President Clinton and meetings with business leaders, that will blend a goodwill celebration of South African democracy with a bid for foreign investment. </P>
<P> At Gracie Mansion, Mandela told guests his government has now created an ideal environment for investments and tourism. </P>
<P> ``We have a strong government of national unity which embraces three political parties,'' Mandela said. </P>
<P> He said his country was ``trying to heal the wounds and unite the country'' from the ravages of apartheid and create millions of jobs. </P>
<P> He said five million people are unemployed in South Africa, about seven million people live in shelters ``under the most deplorable conditions'' and there was a shortage of schools. </P>
<P> ``There is disease because there are not sufficient hospitals and clinics and pre-medical care,'' Mandela said, adding that some people in urban areas do not have electricity or running water. </P>
<P> He said a reconstruction and development program, endorsed by all political parties, is now being developed to deal with these problems. </P>
<P> ``But that program requires resources,'' he said. ``And that is why my visit to the United States of America and especially to this city is of more significance than all my four visits to this city before,'' Mandela said. </P>
<P> Later, Mandela met with New York Governor Mario Cuomo who announced the state will open an economic development office in Johannesburg to expand mutual trade and business opportunities.  ``The world is interconnected. The world is interdependent. That is not poetry. That's reality. You have to do business both ways,'' Cuomo said in describing how the office will benefit South Africa and New York. </P>
<P> ``The notion of leaving a large part of the world underdeveloped and the rest of the world super-developed, that's not realistic,'' Cuomo added. </P>
<P> He said the trade office will serve as a liaison to South African investors seeking opportunities in the state and will assist New York companies wishing to export to South Africa. </P>
