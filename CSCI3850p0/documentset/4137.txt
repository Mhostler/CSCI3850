<P>  The United States Saturday warned Americans in Bolivia to heighten security awareness after the Bolivian Supreme Court ruled to allow the extradition of a former narcotics squad chief to Florida. </P>
<P> ``While no specific threats have been made, acts of violence against American citizens are possible as a result of the extradition,'' the State Department said in a statement issued by the U.S. Embassy in Bolivia's capital, La Paz. </P>
<P> The extradition of Col. Faustino Rico Toro, an ex-head of Bolivia's Special Anti-Drug Smuggling Force who faces charges of drug money laundering in Florida, is imminent, the department said. </P>
