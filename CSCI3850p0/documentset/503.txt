<P>  The presidents of Russia and Ukraine said Sunday they planned to sign a new agreement soon on the Black Sea fleet that would settle its disputed future. </P>
<P> ``We are determined to conclude talks on the Black Sea fleet as soon as possible and to sign an agreement which will fully meet the interests of the fraternal Russian and Ukrainian nations,'' said Boris Yeltisn and Ukraine's newly elected Leonid Kuchma in a joint statement reported by Itar-Tass news agency. </P>
<P> The dispute over ownership of the 800-vessel fleet is one of several that have troubled relations between Russia and Ukraine since the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991. </P>
<P> Yeltsin told Kuchma soon after his victory over previous incumbent Leonid Kravchuk that he hoped his election would lead to an improvement in ties between Moscow and Kiev. </P>
<P> Kuchma said during his campaign Russia should be granted a lease on the Sevastopol naval base in the Crimean Peninsula. He also insisted Crimea, where many ethnic Russians have been seeking eventual reunification with Moscow, must remain part of Ukraine. </P>
<P> In June, the two countries said they had made headway on splitting the fleet, agreeing on separate bases once the fleet is divided, negotiators said. </P>
<P> Russia would keep the fleet's base at Sevastopol on the Crimean peninsula and Ukraine would probably base its ships at two other Crimean ports, Balaklava and Donuzlav, Ukrainian officials said. </P>
