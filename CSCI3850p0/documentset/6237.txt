<P>  Indian and Sri Lankan leaders are working on a plan to contain a separatist uprising in Sri Lanka, diplomats said Wednesday, although the two countries maintained official secrecy over the talks. </P>
<P> ``This is a very grave situation and confidentiality is of paramount importance,'' Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar told Reuters when asked whether the two countries had discussed a possible role for India in the conflict. </P>
<P> He declined to comment further on Tuesday's talks between Sri Lankan President Chandrika Bandarnaike Kumaratunga and Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao. </P>
<P> But diplomats said the two leaders had discussed a likely logistical role for India in Sri Lanka's battle against intensified attacks by the Liberation Tigers for Tamil Eelam (LTTE) guerrillas. </P>
<P> ``Our information is that the Sri Lankan president asked Mr Rao to what extent he could get involved,'' one diplomat said. ``The Indian position is yet to be spelt out but the response was positive.'' </P>
<P> The talks came after the LTTE last week raised the intensity of its 12-year-old guerrilla war by downing two air force planes, killing 94 people. </P>
<P> Diplomats said India might be reluctant to send troops into action against the Tigers after its failed effort to crush the Tamil rebellion when former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi sent in troops in 1987. </P>
<P> The Indian troops, numbering 60,000 at their peak, eventually pulled out in March, 1990, after 2 3/8 years of indecisive warfare in which some 1,100 Indians were killed. </P>
