<P>  Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, pursuing Israel's drive for peace with the Arab world, flew to Oman Monday to meet its sultan, in the first public visit by an Israeli leader to a Gulf Arab state. </P>
<P> Rabin's spokesman, Oded Ben-Ami, said the prime minister was due home early Tuesday after a one-day visit. </P>
<P> ``This is the first time an Israeli prime minister visited the Gulf,'' said Ben-Ami, who did not accompany Rabin. ``He met Sultan Qaboos Bin Said. They talked about the peace process.'' </P>
<P> A number of Israeli officials have in recent months visited Gulf states, many of which are taking part in multinational Middle East peace talks. The Gulf Arab states have previously had no official contact with Israel. </P>
<P> ``The prime minister praised the courage and the wisdom of the sultan of Oman,'' said Ben-Ami. ``This is a very important step and a dividend of Middle East peace.'' </P>
<P></P>
<P> ``Sultan Qaboos Bin Said met this evening with the prime minister of Israel, Yitzhak Rabin, to support the peace process and efforts to accelerate the achievement of a comprehensive and just peace in the region.'' </P>
<P> The Gulf Arab states recently lifted a 46-year boycott on companies trading with the Jewish state. </P>
<P> Israel television said the Sultan received Rabin at his palace in Muscat. </P>
<P> Rabin, who took office in mid-1992, vowed to accelerate peace moves with Arab states. After sealing a peace deal with the Palestinians in 1993 he promised to expand ties with the Arab world. </P>
<P> In October Rabin and Jordan's Prime Minister Abdul-Salam al-Majali initialed a peace treaty, cementing an end to the 46-year state of war between their countries. </P>
