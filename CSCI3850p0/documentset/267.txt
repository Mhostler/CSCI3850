<DATELINE>CAIRO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Israeli and Palestinian negotiators return to Cairo Monday for talks on limited autonomy for parts of the West Bank still under Israeli rule. </P>
<P> The Palestine Liberation Organization is also expecting the Israelis to produce a list of hundreds of prisoners it wants Israel to release. </P>
<P> PLO and Israeli officials in Cairo said that as far as they knew the talks would continue despite riots Sunday on the northern edge of the Palestinian self-rule area of Gaza. </P>
<P> Two Palestinians were killed and more than 100 people injured in the riots, the worst since the Palestinians took control of Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho in May. </P>
<P> The chief negotiators, Nabil Shaath for the PLO and Major-General Danny Rothschild for Israel, were expected to arrive in the Egyptian capital Monday morning, the officials said. </P>
<P> At the first round in this set of talks in Cairo last week they agreed to start by discussing education in the rest of the West Bank and a budget for Palestinian areas. </P>
<P> Under the self-rule agreements, the Palestinians outside the self-rule areas should soon be responsible for their own education, health, tourism, taxes and social affairs. </P>
<P> One of the committees meeting in Cairo will also discuss disputes left over when PLO leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin signed an agreement May 4. </P>
<P> The PLO sees the prisoners as one of the most urgent disputes and at the end of last week's talks Shaath said he wanted to know who were the 800 or so prisoners who have apparently failed to sign a renunciation of violence. </P>
<P> The PLO says Israel has freed only 4,200 of the 5,000 Palestinian prisoners it promised to free in May and it is not convinced that all of the rest have refused to sign. </P>
