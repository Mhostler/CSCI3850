<P>  Bishop of London David Hope, who last month admitted his ``ambiguous sexuality,'' was named the new number two in the Anglican Church of England Tuesday. </P>
<P> Hope, 53, will become Archbishop of York in August when the incumbent, John Habgood, retires. </P>
<P> Hope, who had been targeted by homosexual activists, fuelled a debate about Anglican attitudes towards homosexuals last month when he described his own sexual orientation as being in a ``grey area.'' </P>
<P> At a news conference to mark his nomination Tuesday, Hope said he appreciated the work of homosexual clergy within the Church of England. </P>
<P> ``As a bishop, where there are contentious issues, it is my job to ensure that all sides are given a proper voice and that this is listened to,'' he said. </P>
<P> In his previous interview, Hope said he had always been celibate but had enjoyed ``good, close, warm relationships'' with both men and women. </P>
<P> ``People should not be stereotyped sexually and some may choose to describe themselves as being homosexual... For some the area is slightly greyer and that is the sort of area that I find myself in,'' he said. </P>
<P> The Church of England, Britain's state religion, teaches that homosexuality is not sinful but that gays should refrain from sex. </P>
<P> The Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement called on Hope to ``lead the Church towards a full acceptance of lesbian and gay people.'' </P>
<P> ``He will have to be prepared to depart with traditional church teaching in this important respect if the church is to be a place in which we can feel welcomed and affirmed,'' a spokesman said. </P>
<P> As Bishop of London since 1991, Hope developed a scheme to ensure that people with different views over the ordination of women priests could remain in the diocese whatever their opinions. </P>
<P> ``I believe that as we move towards the new millenium there are many opportunities for the church in society. </P>
<P> ``My hope is for a deeper spiritual renewal and for a church which will be better equipped to take forward the mission entrusted to it by God into the 21st century,'' he said. </P>
