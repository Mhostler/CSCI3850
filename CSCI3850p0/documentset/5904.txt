<DATELINE>OKLAHOMA CITY (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The United States launched a massive international manhunt Thursday for two men wanted for a devastating car blomb explosion in Oklahoma City that killed at least 52 people.  The FBI said their agents had also escorted a Jordanian-American ``possible witness'' to the outrage back to Washington after he was detained at London airport. </P>
<P> He was being interviewed by investigators late Thursday. </P>
<P> President Clinton vowed vengeance for the attack, the worst terrorist incident in U.S. history and Attorney General Janet Reno offered a reward of $2 million for information leading to conviction of the culprits. </P>
<P> Clinton said there would be nowhere for the bombers to hide from U.S. justice. </P>
<P> The Jordanian-American had flown to London from Chicago. A Justice Department spokesman said he could become a suspect. </P>
<P> Rescuers raced against time in an increasingly futile search for survivors in the crumbling wreckage of a federal building gutted by the huge fertilizer and gasoline bomb. </P>
<P> Assistant fire chief Jon Hansen said 40 bodies had been removed from the twisted wreckage but at least a dozen more were still in the building. </P>
<P> Up to 150 people were still thought to be missing and rescuers described a grim and demoralising task picking through dismembered bodies in the rubble. Children's smashed and bloody corpses littered a day-care centre in the building. </P>
<P> Some firefighters fought back tears as they described the scene. </P>
<P> Firefighter Homer Thompson told reporters: ``You look down a hole and all you see is hands, legs, blood spattered everywhere.'' </P>
<P> Federal Bureau of Investigation special agent Weldon Kennedy told an Oklahoma news conference that the wanted men, both white, were considered armed and very dangerous and should not be approached. </P>
<P> He said their identities were unknown but sketches were released with descriptions. </P>
<P> Kennedy said investigators had traced a vehicle identification number on an axle found near the blast site to a rented truck used in Wednesday's attack and that the men were ``associated with this vehicle.'' </P>
<P> One of the suspects was described as 5 foot, 10 or 11 inches tall with light brown hair. The other was said be of medium build, 5 foot 9 or 10 inches tall with brown hair and was believed to have a tattoo, Kennedy said. </P>
<P> Authorities said the truck was rented April 17 in Junction City, Kansas, about 250 miles north of Oklahoma City. </P>
<P> Kennedy said the bomb was made of fertilizer and fuel oil and contained several thousand pounds of explosives, larger than the half-ton device that had been reported earlier. </P>
<P> ``It was very, very large indeed,'' he said. </P>
<P> No survivors have been found since a critically injured 15-year-old girl was pulled out of the rubble overnight. </P>
<P> Oklahoma City Fire Chief Gary Marrs told a news conference the death toll from the blast was expected to climb.  Vowing the bombers would be brought to justice, President Clinton said: ``There is no place to hide ... Nobody can hide any place in this country, nobody can hide any place in this world, from the terrible consequences.'' </P>
<P> He ordered flags flown at half-mast and observed a minute's silence for victims of the attack. </P>
<P> ``Make no mistake, this was an attack on the United States, our way of life, everything we believe in,'' he said. ``Whoever did it, we will find out, and there will be justice that will be swift and certain and severe.'' </P>
<P> Britain said it had sent back to the U.S. ``a man wanted for questioning in connection with the Oklahoma bomb.'' </P>
<P> The man was stopped at London after arriving from Chicago and promptly put on another flight back to the United States. </P>
<P> He had apparently been due to fly on from London to Rome. </P>
<P> Police at Rome airport said they had seized three suitcases, apparently belonging to the man, that had arrived unaccompanied on a flight from Chicago. </P>
<P> Rome airport sources said the luggage had started its journey in Oklahoma City and was bound for Amman, Jordan. </P>
<P> They said the contents included electrical wire, silicone and photographs of military missiles and tanks. </P>
<P> U.S. friends and foes alike condemned the bombing with even Islamic fundamentalists who have spearheaded similar blasts against Israel expressing disapproval. </P>
<P> Firefighter Gary Thurman said the nursery in the building was the worst place for rescuers . </P>
<P> He described finding mutilated and broken infant bodies and added grimly: ``All the toys are covered with blood.'' </P>
<P> Another firefighter said he was unable to move for several minutes when he came upon a toy truck. </P>
<P> ``It was the same kind my son had,'' he said, choking back tears. </P>
<P> ``We have a lot of (body) pieces and no way to tell which part goes with which,'' said firefighter Thompson. </P>
<P> Marrs said search crews had spotted more bodies in the rubble but they had not yet been added to the death count. </P>
<P> He said rescuers faced ``a very, slow tedious process.'' Rescue workers were using tiny cameras and teams of dogs in a painstaking hunt for the missing, worried that the building could collapse if they used heavy equipment. </P>
<P> Marrs said the hunt could take up to six more days. </P>
<P> Still unknown was exactly how many children may have perished. </P>
<P> Marrs said the day-care center, which was licensed to handle up to 32 children, was ``pancaked'' in the building's collapse, suggesting the chance of survival was minimal. </P>
