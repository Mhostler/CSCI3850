<P>  A Brazilian judge has overruled an expulsion order that would have forced a Greenpeace boat and its crew to leave Brazil, Greenpeace said Friday. </P>
<P> Police in the Amazon town of Santarem ordered Greenpeace to leave Brazil last month after campaigners halted loading of mahogany wood for export in a protest against the trade in precious timber in the region. </P>
<P> The judge ruled that Greenpeace's campaign was legitimate, Greenpeace said in a statement. </P>
<P> The MV Greenpeace boat is currently in Rio de Janeiro after a campaign in the Amazon to highlight environmental damage. </P>
