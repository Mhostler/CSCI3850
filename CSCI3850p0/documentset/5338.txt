<P> Christopher said this is why Clinton has ordered a sweeping review of the U.S. government role in the two deaths allegedly ordered by a Guatemalan colonel who had been a CIA informer. </P>
<P> He said he is ``very concerned about this matter'' and pledged that when the facts are known, the admnistration will make the ``fullest possible disclosure'' to the American people. </P>
<P> Clinton ordered the Intelligence Oversight Board, part of an independent advisory group, to review ``any and all aspects'' of the killings of Guatemalan innkeeper Michael DeVine, a U.S. citizen, in 1990, and leftist guerrilla commander Efrain Bamaca Velasquez, husband of an American lawyer, in 1992. </P>
<P> Christopher specifically said he could not answer when asked about reports that the Central Intelligence Agency provided millions of dollars in covert aid to Guatemala after the Bush administration cut off publicly-acknowledged military aid in 1990. He expressed U.S. government sympathies to DeVine's family and also to Jennifer Harbury, the American wife of Bamaca. </P>
