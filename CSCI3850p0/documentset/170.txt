<P>  Washington's top Far East diplomat said Monday he felt a positive mood on a recent trip to Vietnam, but could report no breakthroughs on U.S. prisoners of war or those missing in action. </P>
<P> ``There were not dramatic breakthroughs in this visit,'' said Winston Lord, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs. </P>
<P> ``But the mood was positive, (it showed) a willingness to listen to our proposals for better implementation and research ... and so we thought it was a productive and positive visit,'' Lord said at a briefing. </P>
<P> Lord traveled to Vietnam and Laos primarily to encourage further progress on the POW/MIA issue. </P>
<P> He said there was no plan for Secretary of State Warren Christopher to visit Vietnam during a swing through Asia later this month. </P>
