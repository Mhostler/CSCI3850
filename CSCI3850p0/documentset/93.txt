<DATELINE>PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A U.N.-led human rights observer mission in Haiti has temporarily suspended its activities after the army-backed government told the group its presence in the Caribbean nation was illegal, a U.N. spokesman said Wednesday. </P>
<P> The two-month de facto government of Emile Jonassaint sent the joint U.N.//Organization of American States mission a note explaining its position Tuesday. </P>
<P> U.N./O.A.S. spokesman Eric Falt said authorities have demanded they stop their activities in Haiti. </P>
<P> The two bases where the more than 50 observers work in Port-au-Prince were closed Wednesday. To avoid any incident both organizations have temporarily suspended their activities, Falt said. </P>
<P> The United Nations imposed a crippling economic embargo on Haiti in May to try to unseat the military rulers who overthrew democratically elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in a bloody coup 33 months ago. </P>
<P> The U.N./O.A.S. observer mission has consistently criticized the military regime for human rights abuses it said are carried out mostly against Aristide supporters or pro-democracy activists. More than 350 people have been killed in politically-related incidents this year and dozens more have been raped, beaten or tortured, the mission said. </P>
<P> Falt said talks were being held Wednesday in Washington and New York, the seats of the O.A.S. and the U.N., but added that the mission had ``no plans to leave.'' </P>
<P> Although many extreme right-wing politicians have denounced the presence of the mission, the Jonassaint administration's statement was the first official note to the mission on its status since the government was installed on May 11. </P>
<P> The authorities said the mission was illegal because its mandate had expired and its terms of reference not ratified by parliament, according to source who read the note. </P>
<P> Officials from the Jonassaint administration were not immediately available for comment but one government source said the mission's one-year contract had run out. </P>
<P> Aristide extended the mission's mandate earlier this year but the de facto authorities refuse to recognize Aristide's legitimacy. </P>
<P> The U.N.//OAS human rights mission originally began its operation in Haiti early in 1993, but fled the country last October when a wave of political violence successfully aimed at stopping Aristide's scheduled return swept across the country. </P>
