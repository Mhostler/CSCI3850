<DATELINE>JAKARTA, March 23 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Indonesia's soothsayers, in the spotlight after the questioning of a prominent psychic, have been warned against making predictions that could create chaos, the official Antara news agency said on Thursday. </P>
<P> It quoted the armed forces' chief of socio-political affairs, Lieutenant-General Ma'ruf, as saying on Thursday that soothsayers were free to make predictions, but they should maintain the national stability. </P>
<P> ``They can make predictions, but they should not create chaos among the people,'' he was quoted as saying. </P>
<P> Antara said Ma'ruf referred to the government questioning of Permadi, head of the Association of Indonesian Psychics, who has been accused of calling the Prophet Mohammad a dictator and whose predictions that Indonesia was heading for political turbulence had caused a stir. </P>
<P> ``Everybody, including soothsayers or others, have similar national interest. That is to keep the stability,'' he said. </P>
<P> Permadi, no stranger to controversy in the predominantly Moslem country here many people respect and fear soothsayers' utterances, was questioned earlier by the attorney general's office over allegations he had insulted Islam. </P>
<P> Antara said Permadi was in trouble over remarks at a seminar in the central Java city of Yogyakarta during which, a scholar alleged, he called Mohammad a dictator. </P>
<P> The Jakarta Post newspaper on Sunday quoted permadi as saying his speech had been manipulated and taken out of context. </P>
<P> Permadi has also been questioned over pessimistic comments about the country's political future aired by a local radio station. </P>
