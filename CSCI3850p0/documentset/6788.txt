<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P> By Andrew Hill  Northern Ireland's economy minister, Baroness Denton, said Tuesday that the results of this week's Ireland investment forum could take more than a year to reach the province and border counties. </P>
<P> ``It could take up to 18 months. People are not going to turn the sod tomorrow and start building the next day,'' she told Reuters. </P>
<P> Denton paid tribute to President Clinton for arranging the May 24-26 forum to attract investors to Northern Ireland and border counties, which investors have shunned for years because of guerrilla war. </P>
<P> ``It is a unique opportunity. It is not charity. The Americans are very much teaching us how to fish rather than giving us a fish for the day,'' she said. </P>
<P> Denton said she was not dismayed by reports that the U.S. delegation to the conference would comprise around 300 people compared to the 500 businessmen the U.S. organizers wanted. She said the main task facing Irish businessmen was to ``recorrect the image'' of Northern Ireland and border counties after the 25-year guerrilla war that stopped when the Irish Republican Army (IRA) called a cease-fire last September. </P>
<P> ``I perfectly understand why people didn't want to come to Northern Ireland before the cease-fire and it never ceases to amaze me how many investors did. This is a unique opportunity,'' she said. The chance being offered Northern Ireland, she added, might make development agencies in the Scottish or Welsh areas of Britain ``green with envy.'' </P>
<P> Denton said tourism was the main growth area since the IRA cease-fire, with foreign inquiries up 73 percent and the number of tourists consistently over a million a year. This was not a major area for potential investors although the Radisson and Hilton hotel chains were both opening in Northern Ireland. </P>
<P> Denton identified high technology electronics as a key area for industrial growth and said she hoped the regional capital, Belfast, could become the ``information capital of Europe.'' </P>
<P> Since the cease-fire there has been tangible evidence of economic renewal and growth. Unemployment, once the highest in the United Kingdom, is declining by about 1,000 monthly. </P>
