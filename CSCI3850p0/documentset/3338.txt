<P>  North Korea's U.N. ambassador Pak Gil Yon cast doubt Tuesday on a report that one of his staff had said the surviving pilot of a downed United States helicopter would be released if the incident stemmed from a navigational error, as Washington says it did. </P>
<P> Pak was asked about a report by South Korean's Yonhap news agency that a North Korean diplomat at the United Nations had given it that information about a possible release. He told Reuters by telephone: ``I don't know about that. I don't think anyone in my mission said (anything) like that. You know how the Yonhap agency in South Korea distorts the facts.'' </P>
<P> Asked about the incident in which North Korea said it shot down the helicopter Saturday after it entered its airspace, killing one of two crewmen and capturing the other, Pak said: ``I don't have anything to comment at this moment.'' </P>
<P> He also declined to speculate about prospects for the release of the surviving pilot. He would only repeat the gist of a report by North Korea's official news agency, saying: ``The helicopter intruded into the airspace of DPRK (the Democratic People's Republic of Korea) and was shot down by the Korean anti-aircraft gunners. They are investigating the incident.'' </P>
<P> Asked if any warning shots had been fired, Pak repeated: ``I don't have anything to comment on that.'' </P>
