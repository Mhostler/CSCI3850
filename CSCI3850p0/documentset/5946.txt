<P>  A Liverpool welder has found one of the Beatles' earliest recordings, which could fetch up to $320,000 at auction, The Sunday Times reported. </P>
<P> Peter Hodgson, 30, whose grandfather lent the group a reel-to-reel tape recorder for a session in 1959, found the recording when he cleared out his dead grandfather's attic. </P>
<P> The tape's 16 songs include ``Hello Little Girl,'' a Lennon-McCartney composition which later became a hit for the 1960s band Fourmost, but was never recorded by the Beatles. There is also a Ray Charles song ``Hallelujah, I Love Her So.'' </P>
<P> ``I could hardly believe it. I thought it was someone copying them but I listened again and decided I would call McCartney,'' Hodgson said. </P>
<P> McCartney told Hodgson the tape was authentic and Sotheby's has expressed an interest in auctioning it, the paper said. Last year a tape of Lennon singing two songs at a church fete in 1957 was bought by EMI for $112,200. </P>
