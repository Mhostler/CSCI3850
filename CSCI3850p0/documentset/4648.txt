<P>  Six people convicted of crimes ranging from rape to robbery and murder were executed in Beijing Wednesday and another 12 were sentenced to death, the Beijing Evening News reported. </P>
<P> The six were the first victims of a three-month nationwide crackdown on crime launched on March 1. </P>
<P> Death sentences against the six for crimes including rape, robbery, grievous bodily harm, possession of firearms and murder passed by the Beijing People's Intermediate Court were upheld by the Beijing People's Higher Court Wednesday and they were executed immediately, it said. </P>
<P> Executions in China are usually carried out immediately after sentencing with a single bullet to the back of the head. </P>
<P> The other 12, many of them criminals with long records, were sentenced to death for similar crimes but could still appeal, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> China is battling a soaring crime wave across the country but the frequent imposition of death penalties has done little to stem the tide of violent crime. </P>
