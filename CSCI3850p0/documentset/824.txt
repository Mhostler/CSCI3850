<P>  PLO chairman Yasser Arafat, under pressure to end guerrilla attacks against Israelis, has warned Gaza Islamic militants against carrying weapons in public, activists of the Muslim Hamas said Wednesday. </P>
<P> They said a senior Palestinian security officer in the south of the Gaza self-rule zone met seven Hamas activists in his office late Tuesday, telling them that Arafat ordered a crackdown on violations of security in the Gaza Strip. </P>
<P> ``We were informed... that the (Palestinian) Authority, on orders from the president (Arafat), will act to ensure security, tranquility and quiet no matter what the consequences are,'' one Hamas activist who attended the meeting said. </P>
<P> The officer was quoted as saying Palestinian security forces will curb those who carry weapons or cover their faces with masks. </P>
<P> Hamas has spearheaded violent opposition to the 11-month-old Israeli-PLO peace deal. </P>
<P> After Hamas gunmen killed one Israeli and wounded six Sunday in Gaza, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said the future of peace moves depended on the PLO's making a serious effort to suppress the violence. </P>
<P> The Palestinian Authority, which administers self-rule, rounded up some 40 Hamas activists for questioning about the attacks, sparking the anger of radical and Muslim opponents of the peace deal. </P>
<P> Hamas sources said all but five activists have been released. </P>
<P> Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said before leaving for talks with senior Palestinian officials in Egypt Wednesday the PLO's role in stemming attacks would be high on the agenda. </P>
