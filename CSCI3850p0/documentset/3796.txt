<P>  Rebels killed seven civilians in a raid on a university campus over the weekend, eyewitnesses said Monday. </P>
<P> Saturday's attack on Njala University College 125 miles southeast of Freetown was the latest in a series of raids since Jan. 1 that have come closer to the capital than at any time since the rebel campaign started in 1991. </P>
<P> ``I saw the bodies of seven men and most of them were members of the college junior staff,'' a lecturer told Reuters. ``There were about 20 paramilitary police on campus when the rebels attacked but they fled across a nearby river, leaving the lecturers at (the rebels') mercy,'' he said. </P>
<P> He said the attackers identified themselves as members of the Revolutionary United Front, which is believed to be holding two British aid workers missing since a Nov. 7 RUF attack in the north. RUF representatives had their first meeting with the Sierra Leone military government Dec. 6 but attacks resumed over Christmas. </P>
<P> Last week rebel leader Foday Sankoh said he would not open peace talks until Nigerian and Guinean troops helping the Sierra Leone army went home. </P>
