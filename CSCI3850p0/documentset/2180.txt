<P>  An eccentric philosophy professor who has come to represent the public's disgust with traditional politicians is set to become mayor of Colombia's capital after municipal elections next week, according to a poll published in the Bogota daily El Tiempo Sunday. </P>
<P> Independent candidate Antanas Mockus, popular for his outspokenness, won the support of 57.7 percent of people polled to become mayor of the country's largest and most chaotic city. His closest rival, Enrique Penalosa of the ruling Liberal party, trailed far behind with 25.7 percent of decided voters. </P>
<P> Mockus, who lost his job last year as rector of Colombia's largest university for pulling down his trousers and exposing his buttocks to quiet a group of rowdy students at a public function, has come to embody the public's rejection of the country's traditional Liberal and Conservative parties. </P>
<P> Elections for provincial governors, mayors and municipal councillors are to be held next Sunday. he daily El Tiempo conducted its survey with the local polling firm Yankelovich Colombia, polling 550 people between October 14-17. The survey has a margin of error of 4.3 percent. </P>
<P> Bogota is a burgeoning city of more than six million inhabitants with inadequate public services, horrendous traffic jams and rampant crime. </P>
