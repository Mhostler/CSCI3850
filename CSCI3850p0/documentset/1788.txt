<P> By Maggie McNeil  Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, under federal criminal and ethics investigations for numerous alleged improprieties, said Monday he is resigning from President Clinton's Cabinet. </P>
<P> Espy said he would devote his energies full-time to defending his reputation. </P>
<P> ``I must personally overcome the challenge to my good name that continues to distract me from my work in the U.S. Department of Agriculture. I have therefore decided to tender my resignation to the president effective December 31 of this year,'' Espy said at a news briefing. </P>
<P> ``The president deserves to have his agenda go forward with a minimum of distraction,'' Espy said. </P>
<P> He was the first member of Clinton's Cabinet to resign under fire. </P>
<P> Clinton said Espy's decision was ``appropriate.'' </P>
<P> In accepting his resignation, Clinton said, ``Although Secretary Espy has said he has done nothing wrong, I am troubled by the appearance of some of these incidents and believe his decision to leave is appropriate.'' </P>
<P> Espy has repeatedly denied breaking any laws, but in announcing his resigation, he said he had been careless and apologized to Clinton and staff members. </P>
<P> ``In as much as I was indeed careless in managing some of the details of my personal activities ... and for that I apologize to the president and to the loyal people who have served so well,'' said Espy. </P>
<P> Both a federal special prosecutor and the White House counsel are investigating a broadening array of charges against Espy, a former Mississippi congressman and one of four blacks in Clinton's Cabinet. </P>
<P> The investigations have been under way in one form or another since the spring, when the Justice Department began investigating charges that Espy broke federal laws by accepting gifts from people and organizations regulated by his department, including the country's largest poultry producer, the Arkansas-based Tyson Foods Inc. </P>
<P> The Federal Meat Inspection Act specifically bars anyone involved in meat inspection from accepting anything of value from the meat-processing industry. </P>
<P> The Agriculture Department is in charge of the nation's meat inspection system, and Espy was criticized early in his tenure for being lenient in regulating the poultry industry. </P>
<P> The scope of the probes have widened to look at charges that Espy improperly charged the government for vehicles used for personal affairs and took personal trips financed by taxpayer money. </P>
<P> In the latest development, administration sources said the White House probe revealed that Espy's girlfriend, Patricia Dempsey, received a $1,200 educational scholarship from a Tyson foundation. </P>
<P> Dempsey has returned the money, but the accepting of the scholarship would be a violation of government ethics rules barring officials from receiving gifts either directly or indirectly from people they deal with. </P>
<P> Agricultural lobbyists expressed general disappointment at Espy's decision, and said whoever takes Espy's place will have major decisions to make, including the writing next year of a new five-year farm bill that sets the nation's farm policy. </P>
<P> ``We're sorry to see him resign,'' said Richard Newpher, executive director of the Washington office of the American Farm Bureau Federation, the nation's largest farm group. </P>
<P> National Farmers Union vice president of government relations Larry Mitchell said, ``It's very unfortunate, he was a secretary with much potential.'' </P>
<P> In recent weeks, Espy has repaid anything that smacks of impropriety, including $6,200 to the government for use of a leased car he was said to have kept at government expense. </P>
<P> But congressional and administration officials said the embattled Cabinet member had become an embarrassment to the White House, which is already worried about upcoming November elections. </P>
<P> High among the possibilities to replace Espy is former North Dakota Gov. George Sinner, a father of 10 who underwent heart bypass surgery in 1991. </P>
<P> Also widely being mentioned to head up the huge agency was Agriculture Deputy Secretary Richard Rominger, who is going to resume many of Espy's duties for the next three months. </P>
<P> Other possible candidates include Indiana Rep. Jill Long, one of the few women on the House of Representatives' Agriculture Committee, Ruth Harkin, head of the Overseas Private Investment Corp and wife of Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa, a powerful advocate for farm interests; and Oklahoma Rep. Michael Synar. </P>
