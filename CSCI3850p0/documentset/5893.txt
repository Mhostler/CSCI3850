<P> ``Human beings everywhere, all over the world will condemn this out of their own religious convictions and we should not stereotype anybody,'' Clinton said during a news conference with Brazil's President Henrique Cardoso. He specifically noted that at least three Arab-American groups, which have been subjected to some angry backlash, had condemned the bombing. </P>
<P> Clinton also left the door open to possible U.S. military retaliation if it were discovered that a particular government had instigated the attack, although he stressed that he was making no accusations and that the identity of the attackers or any possible sponsors remained unknown. </P>
<P> ``I must urge you not to speculate on who is guilty yet or what their connections are,'' he said when first asked about possible retaliation. But later he reopened that issue himself, leaving open the possibility of U.S. retaliation and saying: ''Make no mistake, this was an attack on the United States, our way of life, everything we believe in.'' </P>
<P> ``Whoever did it, we will find out, and there will be justice that will be swift and certain and severe. And there is no place to hide, nobody can hide any place in this country, nobody can hide any place in this world from the terrible consequences,'' he said. </P>
