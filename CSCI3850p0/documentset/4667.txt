<P>  A British policeman walking in a field stumbled across the largest single cache of silver and bronze coins dating back to the Roman Empire, officials said Thursday. </P>
<P> Roger Bland, curator of Roman coins at the British Museum, said it was ``the greatest find of its kind not just in Britain but anywhere in the Roman Empire.'' </P>
<P> Policeman Philip Gage, a keen amateur archaeologist, found 10 Roman coins scattered in a field on state-owned land in Wiltshire in southern England three years ago. </P>
<P> A court ruled Wednesday that the coins had been buried deliberately and therefore formed a ``treasure trove.'' </P>
<P> This means the British Museum will end up with most of them, with Gage and the archaeologists being given a reward of an undisclosed amount. </P>
