<P>  President Clinton Monday strongly defended Henry Foster as his choice to become Surgeon General ahead of Senate confirmation hearings that begin Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``If we can't confirm Henry Foster to be the surgeon general of the United States, what kind of person can we confirm?'' Clinton said in an impassioned speech to Foster supporters. </P>
<P> Clinton staged an event in the Roosevelt Room for Foster and teen-agers, parents and clergy who have benefited from the ``I Have a Future'' program that Foster headed in the public housing developments of Nashville, Tenn. </P>
<P> Clinton wiped away tears as he listened to two young people describe how the program had helped them develop self-esteem and encouraged them to get an education. </P>
<P> Referring to Republican criticism of Foster having performed abortions, Clinton said that ``We're not going to let this good man be put in a little box for somebody's political objectives.'' </P>
