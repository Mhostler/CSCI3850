<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A federal judge has ruled that the village of Island Park on Long Island rigged a housing lottery in the 1980s to exclude blacks from federally subsidized houses and to reward people with political connections, The New York Times reported in Friday editions. </P>
<P> Judge I. Leo Glasser of Brooklyn's Federal District Court ruled that the village of 4,000 had violated the Fair Housing Act by using ``nepotism and word of mouth'' to manipulate the sale of 44 federally subsidized houses built in the early 1980s, the newspaper reported. </P>
<P> ``The village's pre-selection scheme discriminated against the group of all black residents,'' Glasser wrote in his opinion. </P>
<P> None of 44 homes constructed in Island Park, which is just east of the borough of Queens, were received by blacks. </P>
<P> The decision, released Thursday, singled out a cousin of N.Y. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato as an example of a homeowner who received ``unjust enrichment'' because he was allowed to buy a house for $40,000. </P>
<P> A former village clerk of 30 years, Harold Scully, testified that D'Amato ordered him to add the cousin to the list of people who would get the opportunity to buy a subsidized house, the Times reported. </P>
<P> The civil rights lawsuit was filed by the U.S. Attorney's office in 1990. </P>
<P> No action has yet been taken on redress for the plaintiffs, the report said. </P>
<P> A lawyer for the town blamed Scully for the ``outlaw acts.'' Scully was originally a defendant in the case who turned state's witness. </P>
<P> A statement from D'Amato's office said: ``The senator was not involved. It doesn't involve the senator.'' </P>
