<P>  Palestinian businessman Hikmat al-Masri, a leading organizer against British mandatory rule of Palestine before 1948 and against Israeli occupation later, died at age 88, his family said Wednesday. </P>
<P> Masri, a member of one of the most prominent West Bank families and a co-founder in 1964 of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), died Tuesday in his native city of Nablus and will be buried Thursday. </P>
<P> Masri, who until his death served as chairman of the board of trustees of An-Najah University -- the West Bank's largest college -- was on a Palestinian committee that coordinated a six-month general strike by Arabs in Palestine against British rule in 1936. </P>
<P> Under Jordanian rule of the West Bank between 1948 and 1967, he was elected to the lower house of parliament, served as a cabinet minister and was appointed by King Hussein to the senate. </P>
<P> A leading Nablus journalist, Zuhair al-Dibi'i, described Masri as a symbol of Palestinian national struggle. </P>
<P> ``The city (Nablus) and Palestine has lost ... one of the main symbols of the Palestinian national struggle, an advocate of Arab unity and a knight of public service,'' Dibi'i wrote in East Jerusalem's al-Quds newspaper. </P>
