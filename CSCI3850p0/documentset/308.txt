<DATELINE>LONDON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  British Prime Minister John Major, in a bold bid to boost his unpopular government's fortunes, fired four Cabinet ministers Wednesday in the most sweeping reshuffle since he took power in 1990. </P>
<P> Major dumped his ministers of education, transport and national heritage, as well as the government's spokesman in the House of Lords (upper house), officials said. </P>
<P> The top three in the Cabinet -- Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister) Kenneth Clarke, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and Home Secretary (interior minister) Michael Howard -- were unaffected. </P>
<P> The shake-up is aimed at installing a more vibrant administration to face the challenge of a resurgent Labor Party opposition before the next election, due by 1997. </P>
<P> Labor, 15 to 20 percentage points ahead in opinion polls, will elect a new leader Thursday. </P>
<P> Tony Blair, who is 41 -- 10 years younger than Major -- and viewed as a major threat by the government, is the hot favorite to take over from Labor's late leader, John Smith, who died of a heart attack in May. </P>
<P> Most of those climbing the ministerial ladder are young and have impressed Major with their drive. Labor claims the government is ``sleazy'' and self-satisfied image, and say it is time for a change in British politics. </P>
<P> The Conservatives, in power since 1979, are unpopular among many voters because of recent tax rises, sex scandals and a feeling the government is no longer in control. </P>
