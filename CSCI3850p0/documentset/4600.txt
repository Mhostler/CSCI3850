<P>  A detective in the O.J. Simpson case was the target of internal police investigations into allegations that he had a Nazi swastika in his possession and once claimed to be ``familiar'' with Simpson's ex-wife's anatomy, the defense alleged Monday. </P>
<P> In a motion filed with Judge Lance Ito, defense attorneys leveled new charges against Det. Mark Fuhrman, who they have accused of being a racist rogue cop who may have planted the bloody glove he found at Simpson's estate. </P>
<P> The police department investigated the allegations of evidence-tampering earlier and determined that they were groundless. Fuhrman could testify as early as this week. </P>
<P> But Simpson's defense team Monday asked for access to Fuhrman's personnel file, saying it had learned that Fuhrman was scrutinized by the department's internal affairs unit for allegations he had ``in his possession a swastika or other Nazi-like symbol at the West Los Angeles Division station house.'' </P>
<P> ``Clearly, information that Fuhrman is associated with a hate group such as the Nazis is relevant to his credibility as an important witness in this case,'' the defense said in court papers. </P>
<P> Defense lawyers also said they were ``informed of an investigation into an allegation that Fuhrman had made statements suggesting his personal acquaintance'' with Nicole Brown Simpson. The U.S. football legend is charged with killing his ex-wife and her friend Ron Goldman last June 12. </P>
<P> The defense asked for any documents showing that Fuhrman ''made statements to others suggesting that he knew Nicole Brown Simpson personally, or was familiar with her anatomy.'' </P>
<P> ``If Fuhrman knew Mrs. Simpson well enough to have commented on some aspect of her anatomy, he would have harbored personal animosity toward any potential suspect in her death,'' the motion stated. </P>
<P> Monday's motion followed a Newsweek magazine report that at an administrative board hearing 10 years ago, Tia Morris, a black policewoman, identified Fuhrman as the leader of a police ''clique'' called Men Against Women and of a group that went by the acronym WASP, for White Anglo-Saxon Policemen. </P>
<P> Morris reportedly testified that Fuhrman told her she did not belong on the force and suggested that she become a secretary or a ``dancer on 'Soul Train.''' ``Soul Train'' was a popular TV show that featured black musicians. But Fuhrman's attorney, Robert Tourtelot, said the fact that Fuhrman was never disciplined showed the allegations were not ``relevant.'' </P>
<P> The defense team has suggested that Fuhrman may have planted evidence to implicate Simpson because of his disdain for interracial marriages. Simpson is black and Nicole Simpson was white. </P>
