<P>  Peru's Attorney General Blanca Nelida Colan on Friday formally charged former president Alan Garcia with corruption and other crimes linked to the construction of a railway project. </P>
<P> The attorney general's office is also seeking to freeze Garcia's property assets in Peru and abroad for possible use as part of a case settlement, Colan said. </P>
<P> Garcia, in a letter published this week, dismissed the allegations of wrongdoing as ``political persecution.''  Last week, Congress approved a ``constitutional accusation'' against Garcia, who is in exile in Colombia, clearing the way for Peruvian courts to charge him with corruption, illegal enrichment, improper negotiation and bribery. </P>
<P> ``My office has asked for civil damages of 50 million soles ($22.2 milion), testimony by (businessman) Alfredo Zanatti and the deposition of Alan Garcia and others mentioned in the report of the congressional investigative commission,'' Colan told reporters. </P>
<P> Zanatti, a fugitive charged with misuse of state funds who turned himself in last week, said he will give proof of Garcia's links to corruption in return for immunity. </P>
<P> Zanatti's lawyer Victor Lazo said his client opened a Cayman Islands account at Barclays Bank at Garcia's request. The businessman in now in police custody. </P>
<P> The account is the same one where Italian businessman Sergio Siragusa last year said he deposited bribes paid to Garcia to secure a government contract for an Italian group to build an electric commuter train in the late 1980s. </P>
<P> The attorney general said the case would now go Peru's Supreme Court which has five days to decide if there is enough evidence to bring Garcia, president of Peru from 1985-90, to trial. </P>
