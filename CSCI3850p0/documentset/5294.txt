<P>  A fatal cattle disease has broken out in Tanzania and could spread to all of southern Africa, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said Wednesday. </P>
<P> The Rome-based agency said it had begun an emergency program which includes vaccines to try and contain the outbreak. </P>
<P> The FAO said 15,000 cattle had died so far from the contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP), which destroys the lungs of cattle. It said another three million animals were at risk. </P>
<P> ``Cattle movements from Uganda and Kenya, sometimes as a result of civil strife, have caused major outbreaks in countries like Zaire, Rwanda and now dramatically in Tanzania,'' said FAO Animal Health Officer Peter Roeder. </P>
<P> FAO said the ``alarming'' spread of CBPP in Tanzania, which had been free of the disease until recently, now threatened Zambia, Malawi and the rest of southern Africa. </P>
