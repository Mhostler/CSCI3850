<P>  Six months after a jury ordered Exxon to pay $9.7 million in oil-spill damages to Native and public lands, the state judge who presided over the trial ruled Exxon does not have to pay anything. </P>
<P> The Native corporations that were plaintiffs in the case have already been more than compensated for their Exxon Valdez oil-spill damages through a federal liability fund and a past legal settlement, Alaska Superior Court Judge Brian Shortell said in the order issued last week. </P>
<P> Reuters obtained the order Friday. </P>
<P> The judge cited payments from the Trans Alaska Pipeline Liability Fund and a $98 million spill settlement reached in 1993 with Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., the consortium that operates the trans-Alaska oil pipeline. </P>
<P> Shortell ruled that the settlements and payments from the Alyeska and Trans Fund payments more than satisfied damage compensation for the plaintiffs. </P>
<P> Exxon attorney John Clough was not available for comment Friday. </P>
<P> But Sam Fortier, an attorney for the Native corporations, said the groups are planning to appeal Shortell's decision. </P>
<P> ``What kind of a social policy is this if we've determined to have sustained damage of millions of dollars and Exxon doesn't have to pay anything?'' Fortier said Friday. </P>
<P> The $100 million Trans liability fund, established by Congress in the 1970s and replaced in 1990 by a much larger fund, ``wasn't set up to help Exxon get out of liability,'' Fortier said. </P>
<P> As for the $98 million Alyeska settlement, ``That was clearly for a different wrong committed to the Native corporations,'' he said. </P>
<P> The five Native corporations that won court awards in last summer's trial argued that the 11-million gallon spill, the nation's worst, damaged their lands and archaeological sites and diminished their business opportunities. </P>
<P> The five corporations, in addition to a sixth and the Kodiak Island Borough, had sought some $120 million in compensation from Exxon. </P>
<P> The corporations are owned by villagers in Prince William Sound and the Gulf of Alaska, areas affected by the 1989 oil spill. </P>
<P> The land-owning Native corporations were among those set up for Alaska Eskimos, Indians and Aleuts by the 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. The act established corporations in lieu of the Indian reservations set up in the Lower 48 states. </P>
<P> Also yet to be determined by Shortell is the prevailing party in the state trial, Fortier said. Under Alaska law, the prevailing party in a civil case may be entitled to recovery of legal fees and costs. </P>
