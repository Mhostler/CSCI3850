<DATELINE>LEXINGTON, Ky.(Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A 22-year veteran of the police department who killed an unarmed teen-ager last October plans to resign even though a grand jury cleared him in the racially charged case, the officer's lawyer said Friday. </P>
<P> Police Sgt. Phil Vogel, who is white, said he accidentally killed Antonio Sullivan, 18, a black, while uncocking his semiautomatic pistol during an arrest last October. </P>
<P> The gun went off, and a bullet hit Sullivan in the head. </P>
<P> A Fayette County grand jury Thursday refused to indict Vogel, but Lexington Mayor Pam Miller said administrative charges had been filed against the sergeant which could lead to dismissal. </P>
<P> Vogel's attorney said the officer was retiring from the force and that a pension board would decide on Vogel's retirement package in the next few days. </P>
<P> ``This is horrible. It is very scary here. This is affecting everyone -- blacks and whites of all ages and all denominations,'' said Lexington resident Alice Alexander. </P>
<P> ``But most of all, I'm worried about what this is doing to our children,'' she said. </P>
<P> The slain teen-ager's mother, Mary Clark, said, ``He (Vogel) has to live with that for the rest of his life. </P>
<P> ``It was wrong, and by him being a police officer, and knowing about guns, it doesn't seem possible for him make a mistake.'' </P>
<P> Vogel was serving a warrant for Sullivans' arrest. The shooting sparked two days of civil unrest as demonstrators rioted, causing thousands of dollars in damages. </P>
<P> As the jury of 11 whites and one black released their decision Thursday night, city officials and ministers urged a crowd that had gathered at an inner-city Baptist Church to pray for peace and to vote for change. </P>
