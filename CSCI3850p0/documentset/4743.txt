<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's Labor party has been politically stung by a police investigation of corruption at Israel's main trade unions federation, its long-time powerbase, a minister said Monday. </P>
<P> Police are looking into allegations that membership dues to the Histadrut federation were used to finance several Labor officials' election campaigns in party primaries in 1992. </P>
<P> An estimated 67 percent of all Israeli workers, from all political persuasions, belong to the Histadrut. </P>
<P> The investigation has been under way for months, but the scandal drew banner headlines -- and questions about Rabin's political future -- Sunday when Israeli newspapers reported a low-level Histradrut official had turned state's witness. </P>
<P> ``Without a doubt we are having a rough ride right now because investigations like these...are a political shock for the Labor party,'' Trade Minister Micha Harish said Monday. </P>
<P> ``As we know from the experience of others, (the investigation) can go on for months. We hope it will be completed quickly with a clear result,'' he told Army Radio. </P>
<P> Rabin, whose popularity has plunged in Israel over the slow pace of peace and a string of Arab guerrilla bombings, said late Sunday: ``Whatever some individuals may or may not have done in no way reflects on the party or the government.'' </P>
<P> Monday, Rabin said once the investigation ended, any legal steps required would be taken. ``There is no one above the law and there is no framework above the law,'' he said. </P>
<P> Political columnist Nahum Barnea, in a front-page commentary in the mass-circulation Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper, said there could be a public backlash with the force of a ``bombshell'' that could ultimately destroy Rabin's career. </P>
<P> ``His ship of state is breaking up and sinking,'' he wrote. </P>
<P> Israel's Jerusalem Post newspaper said at least one cabinet minister, Yisrael Kessar, a former Histadrut chairman who now holds the transport portfolio in the government, had been questioned by police over the corruption allegations. </P>
<P> Kessar issued a statement denying any wrongdoing. ``I rose from the ranks of the proletariat, which I faithfully represented,'' Kessar was quoted by the Post as saying. </P>
<P> Police have yet to file charges against anyone. </P>
<P> Silvan Shalom, a legislator from the main right-wing opposition Likud party, said he believed the investigation would uncover layers of corruption at the Histadrut. </P>
