<P>  British mystery writer Robin Cook, who wrote dark and violent novels under the nom de plume Derek Raymond, has died of cancer at 63, his family said. </P>
<P> The Press Association news agency reported Sunday that his daughter Zoe said Cook had died Saturday. </P>
<P> His books sold well in France and Cook was made a Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres in 1991. French director Claude Chabrol turned Cook's ninth novel ``How the Dead Live'' into a film. </P>
<P> In recent years Cook won greater popularity in Britain, particularly after publication of his autobiography ``Hidden Files.'' </P>
<P> ``I'm pleased that at the age of 61 my work is getting wider recognition at last in my own country,'' he said in 1992. </P>
<P> His first book, ``The Crust on His Uppers'' published in 1962, was based on his own experiences as a young man who rebelled against his middle-class roots and went to work for gangsters from London's East End. </P>
