<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Argentine President Carlos Menem looks set to score a first-round victory in elections May 14 but his nearest rival continues to pick up support, according an opinion poll published Sunday. </P>
<P> The Peronist Party's Menem would win 45.4 percent of the vote according to the survey to May 5 by pollsters Julio Aurelio published in the La Nacion newspaper. Jose Octavio Bordon of the center-left Frepaso alliance would win 32.3 percent, up four percentage points since April 21, the date of the last Julio Aurelio poll. </P>
<P> Support for Menem has fallen by one percentage point in the same period. </P>
<P> But while Bordon is narrowing the gap, these results if repeated next Sunday would leave Menem automatically declared winner, after meeting both conditions to avoid a second round. </P>
<P> Under Argentine rules, the winning candidate must either win at least 45 percent of the vote or at least 40 percent plus a 10-point lead over the runner up. </P>
<P> Taking the poll's margin of error into account, the survey indicated that Menem would win a maximum 47.1 percent and a minimum 43.7 percent. Bordon's range would be from a minimum 30.7 percent to at most 33.9 percent. </P>
<P> Also rans in the poll were Horacio Massaccessi, of the traditionally powerful Radical Party, with 17.1 percent of support, and a far-right former army officer, Aldo Rico, with 3.0 percent. </P>
<P> The poll, which apparently included a projection of the likely behavior of undecided voters, was based on replies from 3,500 respondents in major centers throughout the country. </P>
<P> Only one opinion poll, released May 2, has shown Menem without the 10-point lead he needs for instant re-election. But the next day two surveys gave Menem 46 percent of the vote. </P>
