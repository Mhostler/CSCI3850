<P>  Defense Secretary William Perry arrived in Argentina Saturday for talks with President Carlos Menem and government leaders on international humanitarian aid, terrorism and closer bilateral military cooperation. </P>
<P> Perry flew here for two days of meetings on the final leg of a six-day South American trip to improve U.S. military relations with Brazil and Argentina. </P>
<P> He told reporters traveling with him from Rio de Janeiro that he would discuss expanded joint military exercises with Menem in a meeting Sunday morning and was anxious to talk about Menem's plan for a new international humanitarian aid corps under the United Nations. </P>
<P> ``I want to discuss with them their proposal which they call the 'White Helmets', which is forming a school and some training in international humanitarian operations,'' Perry said. </P>
<P> ``That idea is fairly matured and we would like to reach sort of a final agreement on what they are going to do and how we are going to support them in that area.'' </P>
<P> Argentine troops and civilian workers are now serving in a number of peacekeeping and humanitarian roles in several countries, including Zaire, Haiti and Croatia, and Menem has proposed formation of a new international humanitarian aid corps. </P>
<P> U.S. officials said they were enthused at the idea because it would help avoid delays by quickly utilizing a group of international volunteers and government organizations when the United Nations called for a humanitarian aid operation. </P>
<P> Perry told reporters that he would also discuss with Menem cooperation between the United States and Argentina in combatting international terrorism. There have been recent high-profile bombing attacks against Israeli government and private Jewish facilities in Buenos Aires. </P>
<P> The secretary said he would be willing to discuss sharing intelligence information with Argentina but gave no details. </P>
<P> Perry said he did not intend to bring up the subject of arms sales to Argentina, but he told reporters earlier in the week that the Buenos Aires government was seeking to purchase ``TOW'' anti-tank missiles from the United States and a decision was expected in Washington within weeks. </P>
<P> The trip by Perry, who also discussed closer bilateral military cooperation with Brazilian officials in Brasilia this week, is being made to emphasize the growing economic and political importance of South America to the United States. </P>
<P> ``We have a good program of joint (military) exercises with Argentina and we want to build on that,'' Perry said Sunday. </P>
<P> ``They are going to an all-volunteer Army and they are seeking to professionalize their military. They see these joint exercises and exchanges as very important vehicles to doing that.'' </P>
<P> Perry told reporters earlier in the week that the United States would no longer rule out the possibility of selling such front-line arms as the Lockheed Corporation F-16 fighter jet to South American countries, who have thrown off military dictatorships and are now operating under civilian democratic rule. </P>
<P> But he stressed again Sunday that such sales would have to be made on a regional context so as not to disturb the balance of power in the region. </P>
<P> U.S. officials said that regional tensions that have existed in South America in past decades are largely now a thing of the past thanks in great part to Argentina's persistent efforts to forge regional political ties and closer economic integration in the region and the hemisphere. </P>
<P> In addition to Menem, Perry will hold meetings Monday with acting Argentine Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella and Defense Minister Oscar Camilion. He will hold a press conference Monday afternoon and depart for home that night. </P>
