<P>  Japan's main opposition parties announced Thursday that they had selected ``New Progressive Party'' (Shinshinto Party) as the name for the grand new political party they plan to merge into next month. </P>
<P> All of Japan's opposition parties, apart from the communists, are involved in the merger, which will be launched Dec. 10. </P>
<P> The decision on the new name was taken by a vote of the 213 Lower and Upper House opposition parliamentarians involved in the new merged party, which plans to challenge Socialist Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama's three-party coalition government. </P>
<P> Lower House parliamentarian Shogo Abe of the Japan New Party said the name ``New Progressive Party'' received 130 votes, far more than any of the other four proposed names. </P>
<P> ``This name reflects our efforts to turn a new page in Japanese politics,'' Abe said. </P>
