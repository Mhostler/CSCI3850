<P>  Panama President Ernesto Perez Balladares said Thursday that a plot to kill him and seize control of the country was the isolated work of ``crazy'' people that does not threaten his government. </P>
<P> ``The people behind this are disaffected, crazy and isolated,'' Perez Balladares said in a television interview. ''This should be understood as the normal risks of any democratic government ... it happens around the world.'' </P>
<P> Perez Balladares spoke a day after officials said they had discovered a plot by officers of Panama's National Police and former officers of the defunct military to assassinate the president Friday and seize control of the country. </P>
<P> ``There are active groups of people that want a return to military dictatorship ... we are acting within all legal means to finish with these groups and bring these people to justice,'' Perez Balladares said. </P>
<P> Officials arrested six people early Thursday in connection with the plot, according to a statement by Panama's office of the president. Ten more people, all of them mid-level police officers in the western province of Chiriqui, were arrested Wednesday. </P>
<P> Perez Balladares, a stalwart of the political party that once supported military dictator Manuel Noriega, appeared to scuttle speculation in Panama that the plot involved high- ranking members of his own Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD). </P>
<P> Many Panamanians believe some PRD members are unhappy that the president, who took power in September of last year, has refused return to the military rule that ended with the 1989 U.S. invasion of Panama and ouster of Noriega. </P>
<P> ``That is mere speculation. The names that I have seen involved with the plot have nothing to do with the PRD,'' Perez Balladares said. </P>
<P> ``The plotters are people that are simply accustomed to military regimes and ... thought foolishly that when we returned to power we would return to something similar,'' he said. </P>
<P> Perez Balladares, a U.S.-educated former banker, appeared relaxed and joked with reporters Thursday that the plan to kill him and his aides was ``a hare-brained and absurd scheme ... that would not have worked.'' </P>
<P> The president said that since his inauguration his intelligence officers had investigated groups of former military officers in Chiriqui province that had tried to assassinate former President Guillermo Endara. </P>
<P> ``During late last year, we discovered that concrete plans were being made by the same people to overthrow the government,'' Perez Balladares said. </P>
<P> Panamanians were stunned by the news of a plot to kill Perez Balladares, who has gained widespread popularity for cracking down on crime and boosting government spending to lower high jobless rates. </P>
<P> ``They want to kill 'Toro,''' the headline of the Panama- America newspaper blared Thursday, referring to the leader's popular nickname, ``The Bull.'' </P>
