<P>  Russia is far from establishing an effective system for protecting and accounting for its nuclear bomb materials such as plutonium and highly enriched uranium, The New York Times reported in Thursday editions. </P>
<P> The newspaper, quoting officials and experts in Moscow and Siberia, said Russia also has no way of knowing for sure if any of its vast supply of bomb ingredients is missing. </P>
<P> Plutonium and uranium are the critical ingredients for making nuclear weapons. </P>
<P> Much of the West's focus in recent years has been directed at keeping any of Moscow's 30,000 warheads from falling into the hands of terrorists or countries like Iraq and Iran that have nuclear ambitions, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> Quoting Western and Russian experts, the Times said Russia's supplies of nuclear bomb materials are spread across scores of unsecured research institutes, weapons laboratories and assembly plants, power plants, nuclear waste storage facilities, naval fuel depots and other facilities. </P>
<P> It said that under the Soviet regime, authorities relied on a system of rewards for its nuclear elite and the iron grip of the state to protect its nuclear materials. </P>
<P> But it said that in a world where citizens travel freely, where criminal syndicates marshal vast economic resources while workers and scientists sometimes go unpaid, protection of bomb materials requires far closer and constant scrutiny than currently exists. </P>
<P> ``It's possible to buy anything in our country, including weapons and samples,'' Russian physicist Igor Matveyenko told the newspaper. </P>
<P> Yuri Vishevsky, the director of the nuclear regulatory agency GAN, told the Times: ``We would like to bring some order to the area of stockpile accountability. </P>
<P> ``Unfortunately, today there are too many possessors of nuclear material. We have to find out who possesses nuclear materials and get them to carry out an inventory.'' </P>
<P> The newspaper, quoting Russian and U.S. experts, said Russia's nuclear network is so balkanized and its system of checks so uncertain that it is impossible to say for sure whether any of its nuclear bomb material has been lost or stolen. </P>
<P> The New York Times said the West estimates that existing nuclear resources include some 170 tons of military and civilian plutonium and 1,000 tons of highly enriched uranium. </P>
<P> It said the challenge was especially great in that the amount of plutonium needed to make a bomb, several kilograms , is no bigger than a can of soda. </P>
