<DATELINE>HOUSTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A Vermont native scheduled to be executed in Texas early Tuesday Monday faced an uphill fight for his life as he sought a last-minute reprieve to pursue his claims of innocence. </P>
<P> Lawyers for convicted killer Robert Drew, 35, said they were asking federal courts for a stay of execution and also appealed to Governor Ann Richards for a 30-day reprieve. </P>
<P> The execution is scheduled for shortly after midnight . </P>
<P> ``The most likely outcome by far is that they're going to kill him tonight,'' said Drew's New York-based attorney Ronald Kuby, who flew to Texas Monday to be with his client. </P>
<P> Kuby said a U.S. district judge in Houston declined Monday to grant a stay and that an appeal was now before the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans. </P>
<P> A spokeswoman in the Texas Attorney General's office said: ''We don't expect any federal court to give Drew a stay of execution and his execution should go forward after midnight.'' </P>
<P> On Saturday, Texas's highest criminal appeals court voted 5-4 against a stay of execution for Drew. Last October, Drew received a reprieve just six hours before his previously scheduled execution for the 1983 slaying of a 17-year-old runaway. </P>
<P> The case has aroused anger in Vermont, where almost a third of state legislators signed a draft resolution last year calling for an economic boycott of Texas if Drew was executed without a hearing. Vermont does not have the death penalty. </P>
<P> A convicted killer in Vermont, Doug Mason, wrote Drew's lawyers offering to take Drew's place on Texas death row. </P>
<P> Drew is set to die by lethal injection at the state prison in Huntsville for the stabbing death near Houston of Jeffrey Mays, a runaway from Alabama from whom Drew had hitched a ride. </P>
<P> Another hitchhiker, Ernest Puralewski, who confessed his involvement in the murder and testified against Drew, later recanted his story and said he killed Mays. </P>
<P> But the recantation by Puralewski, who is serving a 60-year prison sentence, came 101 days after Drew's conviction -- past Texas's legal deadline to reopen the case. </P>
<P> The Texas attorney general's spokeswoman said of Drew's allegations of innocence that ``all the courts have reviewed his claims and those claims have been rejected.'' </P>
<P> A spokesman for Governor Richards said she received Drew's appeal for a 30-day reprieve, but that ``the governor never acts upon these requests until after all the appeals have been taken care of.'' </P>
<P> Drew would be the eighth inmate executed this year in Texas and the 79th since the state resumed executions in 1982. Texas has executed more people than any other state since the U.S. Supreme Court restored the death penalty in 1976. </P>
