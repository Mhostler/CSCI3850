<DATELINE>PARIS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Tens, perhaps hundreds, of thousands of people thronged the Champs Elysees avenue in the heart of Paris Sunday night to fete Gaullist Jacques Chirac's presidential election victory over Socialist Lionel Jospin. </P>
<P> Chirac backers raced up and down the tree-lined thoroughfare in their cars, honking their horns, waving tricolour French flags and chanting ``On a gagne'' (We won). A few splashed in the fountains on the wide Place de la Concorde on a balmy summer-like evening. </P>
<P> Most of those present, including many enchanted foreign tourists, appeared drawn more by the festive atmosphere than by political conviction. </P>
<P> Bemused Japanese visitors walked about with wide smiles on their faces, some young Spaniards danced in the middle of the avenue waving their own gold-and-red national flag. A dozen Israeli men belted out a Hebrew song about peace being near. </P>
<P> The celebrations were organized by ``Students for Chirac,'' a little-known youth group which handed out thousands of stickers to passing motorists. </P>
<P> Their aim was to match the festivities which marked outgoing President Francois Mitterrand's first election victory in 1981 when tens of thousands of people danced in the Bastille Square. </P>
<P> Those doing most of the shouting on the Champs Elysees, or weaving between cars on expensive rollerblades, appeared however to be ``Johnny-come-latelies'' to the Gaullist cause. </P>
<P> Their fashionable Bermuda shorts and expensive, American baseball caps were giveaway signs that they hailed from the nearby trendy 16th Arrondissement of the capital, parish of France's rich. </P>
<P> Shapely young women in form-hugging designer T-shirts sitting atop expensive cars flashed big smiles for the cameras. </P>
<P> Outside Chirac's campaign headquarters, ecstatic crowds cheered the Paris mayor when he appeared on a balcony flanked by top aides including Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, favored as the next prime minister. </P>
<P> Chirac, 62, had driven there in a motorcade from City Hall, his car window wide open to the cheers of his supporters, pursued by a horde of reporters on motorcycles. </P>
<P> Earlier at City Hall, about 1,000 guests had cheered ``Chirac! Chirac!'' as the mayor's face appeared on television screens when his victory was announced. </P>
<P> Sensing a Chirac victory, aides had already started serving champagne but, once the news was official, people jumped up and down hugging each other and shouting ``We won! We won!'' Then they broke into into singing the French national anthem. </P>
<P> At Jospin's campaign headquarters, the sting of defeat was quickly replaced by celebrations looking to a Socialist revival. </P>
<P> ``Jospin, don't stop now,'' the crowd cheered as he plunged into a crowd of supporters. Far from looking a broken man, Jospin smiled after admitting defeat and congratulating Chirac in a brief speech. </P>
