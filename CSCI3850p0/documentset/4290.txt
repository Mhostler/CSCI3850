<P>  Bankrupt Orange County, Calif., named businessman William Popejoy as its new top administrator Friday, giving him the thorny task of guiding the county through its financial crisis. </P>
<P> The appointment of Popejoy, 56, as the county's interim chief executive officer was announced by Gaddi Vasquez, chairman of the Orange County Board of Supervisors, after a closed meeting of the board. </P>
<P> ``It is imperative that we move forward with a plan to reorganize county government and correct our financial difficulties with the least impact to public services,'' Vasquez said in a statement. </P>
<P> ``Mr. Popejoy will bring to Orange County that role of leadership,'' Vasquez said. </P>
<P> Popejoy, the unanimous choice of the five-member board, will take up the post on an interim basis immediately. </P>
<P> The county said he was expected to serve for six months while the board of supervisors searches for someone to fill the position permanently. </P>
<P> The post of chief executive officer is a new one in Orange County, which declared bankruptcy Dec. 6 after suffering investment losses now estimated at $1.69 billion. </P>
<P> Bondholders and community leaders had called for the appointment of a strong, private industry-style chief executive to lead the county out of its financial crisis. </P>
<P> Popejoy, who will supervise all county offices, departments and districts, will have to make some tough decisions. The county faces a revenue shortfall of $172 million in the current fiscal year. </P>
<P> The county said he would focus on preparing the 1995/96 budget and developing plans to reorganize county government. </P>
<P> Popejoy, an Orange County resident, volunteered his services free of charge, saying he viewed the task as ``a civic duty.'' </P>
<P> Popejoy, currently chairman and owner of Western Financial Printing Co. of Santa Fe Springs, Calif., is a former president of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. </P>
<P> He has experience of trying to turn around dire financial situations. </P>
<P> In 1984, federal regulators appointed Popejoy chairman and chief executive officer of troubled American Savings & Loan and its parent company Financial Corp. of America. </P>
<P> Popejoy helped keep the institution alive despite a massive run on deposits, according to news reports. </P>
<P> American Savings was sold to an investor group in 1988, but regulators were forced to pour $1.7 billion into the thrift to keep it afloat. </P>
<P> Some critics said Popejoy's business strategy at the time added to American's problems, according to a recent report in The Los Angeles Times. </P>
<P> Popejoy was a surprise choice of the board, which had been considering several candidates. </P>
<P> The frontrunner was corporate turnaround specialist Sanford Sigoloff, who was reported to be backed by a majority of the supervisors. </P>
<P> Sigoloff wrote to a member of the board Friday saying he would withdraw his name from consideration unless the board made a decision by the end of the day. </P>
<P> Some supervisors had expressed concerns over Sigoloff's fee, reported to be $500 an hour. County government employees feared Sigoloff would sharply cut back services, according to local news reports. </P>
