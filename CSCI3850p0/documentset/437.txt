<P>  The mother of Ronald Goldman, the waiter murdered along with O.J. Simpson's ex-wife Nicole, filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the football legend, her lawyer said Wednesday. </P>
<P> Attorney Michael Brewer said that the lawsuit by Sharon Rufo, who is divorced from Goldman's father and lives in St Louis, Missouri, asked for unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. </P>
<P> Simpson has been charged with the brutal June 12 murders and last week pleaded ``absolutely, 100 percent not guilty'' at his arraignment. A trial date has yet to be set. </P>
<P> The lawsuit also names Ronald's father Fred as a defendant because he refused to cooperate with Rufo's action. </P>
<P> ``We believe, based upon all of the available evidence, there is sufficient evidence to proceed and obtain a verdict in civil court for Miss Rufo,'' Brewer told a news conference in downtown Los Angeles. </P>
<P> He said Simpson would be served with the complaint within the required time limit, and he expected him to respond within 30 days, but he declined to make any further comments. </P>
<P> In the lawsuit, which was filed July 20 in the Los Angeles Superior Court in Santa Monica, Rufo claimed to have ``sustained pecuniary loss resulting from the loss of the company, presence, companionship, society, comfort, attention, services, guidance and support'' of Ronald Goldman. </P>
