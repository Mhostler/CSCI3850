<P>  Three-time Wimbledon champion Boris Becker has decided to play for Germany in the Davis Cup this year after a break of more than two years. </P>
<P> ``He will play against Croatia in next month's first round,'' a spokesman for Becker's manager Axel Meyer-Woelden said Tuesday. </P>
<P> Becker, who led Germany to its first Davis Cup title in 1988, has not played for his country since a relegation playoff match against Belgium in September 1992. </P>
<P> Becker originally decided to opt out of the event to concentrate on improving his ranking. </P>
<P> His absence has been surrounded in controversy and he has been criticized by compatriot Michael Stich, who at one stage said he would not play if Becker returned. </P>
