<P>  Mexico expects foreign commercial banks to contribute about $3 billion to an $18 billion rescue package to stabilize its economy after a drastic devaluation of the peso, foreign minister Jose Angel Gurria said Tuesday. </P>
<P> Gurria, in Japan to seek its help in the loan package, said the United States and Canada would put up about $10 billion while the Bank for International Settlements, based in Basle, would give $5 billion. </P>
<P> He told a meeting of Japanese business executives that the remaining $3 billion would come in loans from foreign banks. </P>
<P> Financial sources said about four of Japan's biggest private banks were believed to be part of the international group raising the $3 billion. </P>
<P> The sources said the group was led by U.S. banks which have the biggest exposure in loans to Mexico. </P>
<P> In his talks with Japanese officials and business executives, Gurria has stressed that Mexico's banking system is in sound shape despite the pre-Christmas economic upheaval. </P>
<P> He said the Dec. 20 devaluation of the peso under speculative pressure had a limited impact on Mexico's banks, mainly because they square their books in U.S. dollars. </P>
<P> ``I can assure you the banking system is sound,'' Gurria said. </P>
<P> But his words have so far fallen on cautious ears, with nervous Japanese investors saying they want to see how Mexico handles its recovery from the nearly 40 percent devaluation before committing themselves to more investment. </P>
<P> Gurria forecast Mexico's current account deficit would decrease to around $14 billion to $15 billion in 1995, with exports rising to around $70 billion and imports falling slightly. </P>
<P> He said one of the government's greatest challenges would be to control inflation. </P>
<P> Toshio Morikawa, chairman of the Federation of Bankers' Associations of Japan, said the Japanese banking industry has not yet made a decision about financial aid to Mexico. </P>
<P> ``We have not received official requests for financial assistance from Mexico,'' Morikawa told a news conference. </P>
<P> However the Bank of Japan, the Japanese central bank, was expected to contribute up to $1 billion through the Bank for International Settlements, financial sources said. </P>
<P> Japanese investment in Mexico has risen significantly in the past year and before the crisis there were hopes in Mexico that it could become a new haven for Japanese investors attracted by deregulation. </P>
<P> In November 1994, the latest monthly figure available, Japanese exports to Mexico totalled $317 million, while imports from Mexico were $120 million. </P>
<P> Gurria, who was due to leave Japan on Wednesday, has said in his speeches to business executives that the Mexican economy is in basically good shape and that the devaluation was inevitable. </P>
