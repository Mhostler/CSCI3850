<P>  Detained dissident Aung San Suu Ky's first meeting with the Burmese junta's top generals focuses attention on whether and when the charismatic democracy leader will be freed, diplomats said Wednesday. </P>
<P> Burmese state television Tuesday night broadcast pictures of the meeting earlier that day between the 49-year-old Suu Kyi, now in her sixth year of house arrest, junta chief General Than Shwe and military intelligence chief Lieutenant General Khin Nyunt. </P>
<P> The broadcast, monitored in Bangkok, did not say how long the meeting lasted. Nor did it give details about the discussion, except to say it was cordial. </P>
<P> Viewers saw brief pictures of a smiling and relaxed Suu Kyi, in a pink traditional shirt and sarong, talking to the generals across a table decorated with flowers. </P>
<P> The talks received a guarded welcome from diplomats and Burmese dissidents who said it was an important first step. </P>
<P> ``Whatever image they are trying to portray or news they are trying to gain, the fact is, whether it was stage-managed or not, the meeting took place,'' one Western diplomat in Rangoon told Reuters in a telephone interview. </P>
<P> ``It's a step in the right direction and hopefully the start of a series of meetings, a series of discussions between the two parties,'' he said. </P>
<P> Burma's state-run newspapers Wednesday carried a brief report of the meeting, again giving no details, and three large photographs of Suu Kyi with the generals. </P>
<P> Tuesday's talks at an army guest house in Rangoon were the first Suu Kyi, the daughter of Burma's assassinated independence hero Aung San, has had with leaders of the junta which took power in September 1988 after crushing a pro-democracy uprising. </P>
<P> It was also the first time she has been allowed out of the compound of her lakeside house since she was detained in July 1989 for ``attempting to endanger the state.'' </P>
<P> Earlier this year a senior official of the junta -- officially known as the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) -- told visiting reporters Suu Kyi would remain under house arrest at least until 1995. </P>
<P> The junta has in the past offered to free her on condition she leaves the country, but she has ignored the offers. </P>
<P> One source said that Suu Kyi had let it be known that she was prepared to put the question of her release ``on the back burner'' in order to get a dialogue started. </P>
<P> Both diplomats and Burmese dissidents noted the meeting comes prior to the United Nations General Assembly session, where the regime is condemned regularly for alleged human rights abuses and its suppression of democracy. </P>
