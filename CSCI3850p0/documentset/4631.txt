<P>  Lithuania's President Algirdas Brazauskas said in Israel Tuesday that he was ashamed of his people's persecution of Jews during World War II. </P>
<P> ``The fact that Lithuanians participated in the murder, deportation, arrest and torture of Jews during the Second World War generates a deep shame and imposes a difficult burden,'' Brazauskas said at a welcoming ceremony. </P>
<P> He said his government accepted responsibility for prosecuting those responsible. </P>
<P> Unconvinced, however, a leading Israeli Nazi-hunter assailed Lithuania for failing to bring war criminals to justice, and Jewish survivors demonstrated when Brazauskas visited the Yad Vashem national Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem. </P>
<P> More than 200,000 Jews were killed in what is now Lithuania following the invasion by Nazi Germany in 1941, part of the Nazis' systematic extermination of six million Jews known as the Holocaust. </P>
<P> Before the war Polish-ruled Vilnius contained one of eastern Europe's largest and most important Jewish communities. It was known as the ``Lithuanian Jerusalem.'' </P>
<P> Efraim Zuroff, head of Jerusalem's Nazi-hunting Wiesenthal Center, told Israel Television: ``Not a single Nazi war criminal has been prosecuted in Lithuania since that country obtained its independence despite the pronouncements made by government officials.'' </P>
<P> Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Israel opposed the pardons Lithuania had given people who collaborated with the Nazis in the systematic murder of Jews. </P>
<P> Rabin's office quoted Brazauskas as saying: ``We understand well the tragedy of the Holocaust and we will make every effort to remove every shadow from our past.'' </P>
<P> Brazauskas' visit coincided with a controversy over Aleksandras Lileikis, a Lithuanian-American fighting deportation to Lithuania by the United States for allegedly directing the killing of thousands of Jews in the war. </P>
<P> The United States wants Lithuania to prosecute Lileikis, 87, alleging that as a commander in the Lithuanian security police, he played ``a significant role in the Nazis' largely successful effort to kill off the Jews of Vilnius province.'' </P>
<P> Lithuanian officials have said they lack enough material to go ahead with a prosecution, and Lileikis has denied killing anyone or being responsible for any deaths. </P>
