<P>  The South Korean government said Thursday it would not allow citizens to visit the North for Sunday's state funeral of Kim Il-sung, despite the Stalinist state's offer to receive mourners. </P>
<P> ``It is the government's position that we will not allow South Koreans to go to North Korea to mourn,'' a Unification Ministry spokesman said. </P>
<P> North Korea said it would guarantee the safety of South Korean mourners who would be welcomed in the communist nation. </P>
<P> A statement carried by the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said: ``We will receive with warm compatriotic feelings mourning groups or mourners from South Korea who come to Pyongyang to express condolences before the bier of respected President Kim Il-sung and attend the national memorial service.'' </P>
<P> The statement, issued in the name of Pyongyang's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, added that mourners could enter the North through the border post at Panmunjom or through a third country. </P>
<P> North Korea has often encouraged South Korean citizens to visit what Kim Il-sung's propaganda machine called an ``earthly paradise.'' Seoul authorities have always blocked such individual trips, insisting the government alone must handle contacts with its Stalinist neighbor. </P>
<P> Pyongyang made clear Saturday when announcing Kim's death that it would not admit any foreign mourning groups for the funeral. </P>
