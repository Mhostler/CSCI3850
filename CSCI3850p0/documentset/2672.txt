<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Greek war planes scrambled Thursday to chase off 10 Turkish fighter-bombers which had violated Greek airspace during tense rival war games in the Aegean sea, senior Greek air force sources said. </P>
<P> They said the Greek fighters scrambled from eastern Aegean islands just off the Turkish coast to drive off the Turkish air force planes Thursday afternoon. </P>
<P> Rival wargames by the feuding NATO neighbors have worried the United States and other Western allies, although they are being staged at opposite ends of the disputed Aegean sea. </P>
<P> Greek planes often scramble to chase off Turkish fighters, which Athens accuses of violating its airspace but the present military exercises have heightened tensions in the Aegean and prompted the United States to send a warship into the region. </P>
<P> The war games coincide with the entry into force of an international sea treaty which has rekindled tensions between Greece and Turkey, which pulled back from the brink of war in March 1987. </P>
<P> The Law of the Sea Convention, which permits Greece to extend its territorial waters to 12 nautical miles from six, has been signed by Greece, but not ratified by its parliament. </P>
<P> A Greek government spokesman said this week the sea treaty would be submitted to the socialist-controlled parliament, but there were no indications when, or if, Greece would actually extend its present six-mile limit. </P>
<P> Turkey has warned Athens that a decision to extend Greek waters would be tantamount to an act of war. More than 60 countries have ratified the treaty, which went into force on Wednesday. Greece signed in 1982. Turkey has not signed it. </P>
<P> Turkey has said any extension of Greece's present limit would turn the Aegean into a ``Greek lake'' and choke off easy access to the sea from Turkey's western coast. </P>
<P> The separate military maneuvers this week at opposite ends of the Aegean have caused concern among Western allies, and the United States has stationed a warship between the forces of the NATO rivals. </P>
<P> Greek maneuvers, dubbed Niriis, are taking place mostly between the islands of Crete and Rhodes. They include ships from the United States, Britain, France and Spain. </P>
<P> Turkish ships left Monday for the northern Aegean to start air and naval exercises, dubbed Seawolf-94 and set to last until Nov. 23. </P>
<P> The United States has sent the warship USS Cape St. George into international waters between the rival maneuvers, ``to demonstrate U.S. interests in the region,'' according to a Pentagon statement. </P>
