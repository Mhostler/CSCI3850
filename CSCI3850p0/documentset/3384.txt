<P>  A newly formed council to organize parliamentary and local elections in Haiti began work Thursday with a call by President Jean-Bertrand Aristide for the elections to be peaceful and fair. </P>
<P> The nine-member council was sworn in at the Haitian Supreme Court and then met Aristide at the presidential palace. </P>
<P> New elections are seen as a key test of Haiti's newly restored democracy under Aristide, who was returned to power in October. </P>
<P> Speaking to the panel, Aristide said he hoped for ``security throughout the capital and throughout the country so the candidates will not be afraid...(and) for everyone to respect the rules of the game.'' </P>
<P> Past Haitian elections have frequently been marred by violence. </P>
<P> Aristide said he hoped a date for elections would be held as soon as possible. Most observers believe new elections could not be held before March. </P>
<P> The whole of the 83-seat Chamber of Deputies is to be chosen along with two thirds of the upper Senate and almost 2,000 other officials. </P>
<P> The Chamber of Deputies' four-year term -- a tumultuous period which saw Aristide toppled by military and police leaders then restored under U.S. military protection three years later -- is to expire Jan. 15. </P>
<P> The council has been criticized by some Aristide opponents as being made up mostly of Aristide supporters and for being only a provisional body, rather than permanent as required the constitution. </P>
<P> Also Thursday, the Haitian army announced it was suspending pay for all but 1,500 soldiers. The move effectively carries out an earlier order by Aristide to reduce the size of the army to 1,500 from about 7,000 prior to the U.S. occupation. </P>
<P> Many Haitian soldiers have already quit or fled. Those who are not kept in the army will be eligible for U.S. supported job retraining programs. </P>
