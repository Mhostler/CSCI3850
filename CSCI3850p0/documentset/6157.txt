<DATELINE>DACHAU, Germany, April 30 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Survivors of the first Nazi concentration camp at Dachau gathered in the rain on Sunday to remember the day 50 years ago when U.S. troops stormed the camp and led them to freedom. </P>
<P> More than 2,000 people were expected to gather at noon (1000 GMT) in the Appellplatz, the square where inmates had to line up every morning for inspection by Adolf Hitler's SS guards. </P>
<P> The camp, opened only two months after Hitler came to power in January 1993, became the model for the thousands of concentration and death camps built by the Third Reich and was seen as a ``murderers' university'' for notorious SS men like Auschwitz commandant Rudolf Hoess. </P>
<P> ``The men trained in Dachau created places that were a black hole that swallowed up life that God had created,'' said Simon Snopkowski, the Jewish community leader in Bavaria, at one of the many religious services being held in the Catholic, Jewish, Protestant and Russian Orthodox chapels at the former camp. </P>
<P> The stark Jewish chapel where Snopkowski spoke was built to symbolise an oven and chimney. It stood close to the ovens in which many of Dachau's more than 32,000 victims died. </P>
<P> At another service, Munich's Catholic Cardinal Friedrich Wetter said the legacy of Dachau's victims was a warning to later generations of the dangers of following false prophets preaching hate and destruction. </P>
<P> ``Be vigilant, do not be so naive to think this could not happen again,'' he said in his sermon. </P>
<P> About 1,000 former inmates, many wearing name tags bearing the numbers the Nazis tattooed onto their arms, had held an emotional reunion in Dachau on Sunday. </P>
<P> About 180 veterans of the U.S. Army's 42nd infantry ``Rainbow Division,'' which freed the camp on a warm spring day at the end of World War Two, returned for the ceremony. </P>
<P> For many it was the first they had been back since the day they blasted the last SS guards from their watchtowers and rescued about 30,000 frightened and emaciated inmates. </P>
<P> SS chief Heinrich Himmler opened Dachau on March 22, 1933 and soon filled it with the Nazis' left-wing opponents. On its gate was the motto ``Arbeit macht frei'' (Work makes you free). </P>
<P> That October, Dachau commandant Theodor Eicke drew up the sadistic rules that became the benchmark for all future camps. </P>
<P> These included three days' hard labour for taking seconds at meals, 21 days for moving anything without permission and possible death for any damage to barracks or workshops. </P>
<P> Impressed, Himmler named Eicke inspector general of all death camps and had him turn them into bureaucratic machines supplying slave labour for German industry -- especially armaments firms -- and profits for the SS. </P>
<P> Later, the Nazis added Jews, gypsies, homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses and common criminals to the victims' list. </P>
