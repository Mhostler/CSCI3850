<P>  Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros reached an out-of-court settlement Friday with his former mistress who had sued him for $256,000 in a breach-of-contract lawsuit. </P>
<P> Cisneros' lawyer Seagal Wheatley said Cisneros agreed to pay $49,000 to Linda Medlar of Lubbock. Wheatley said in a statement that the settlement was reached ``even though Henry G. Cisneros is not now nor had he ever been under any legal obligation to Ms. Medlar.'' </P>
<P> Cisneros and Medlar also agreed ``to make no further references to the past relationship of the parties and further to conduct no interviews of such nature,'' Wheatley's statement said. It added that the agreement was reached because it was cheaper than ``a possible long trial'' and to ``put an end to the disruption created by this suit.'' </P>
<P> Medlar filed a motion Friday with a state court in Lubbock, where her lawsuit was filed, to dismiss all claims against Cisneros. She also signed a release covering any future claims. </P>
<P> Her lawyer Floyd Holder said ``obviously it was about money and she needed money now instead of money two or three years from now.'' He said Medlar had been forced to sell her home and move in with her mother because she could not find a job. </P>
<P> ``Would you hire a woman you'd expect to see a television camera dogging every time she came through the door? I don't think so,'' Holder said. ``She can put this behind her now and get on with her life.'' </P>
<P> The Justice Department is asking for an independent investigation of Cisneros' past payments to Medlar. The probe began after she played tape recordings of their conversations and publicized her allegations in a paid television interview for ``Inside Edition.'' </P>
<P> The extramarital affair was disclosed in 1989 shortly after Cisneros decided not to seek a fifth term as mayor of San Antonio and about four years before he became a member of President Clinton's Cabinet. </P>
<P> Medlar, a campaign fund-raiser for Cisneros, was later divorced by her husband. Cisneros' wife sued for divorce but withdrew her petition shortly after he accepted the HUD post. </P>
<P> Medlar alleged that Cisneros paid her $215,000 between 1990 and July 1993 after their affair ended and promised to keep paying her $4,000 a month until her daughter by another marriage, who is now 16, graduated from college. </P>
<P> Cisneros, who admitted making numerous payments to Medlar, denied agreeing to make further payments. </P>
<P> The independent investigator, who has yet to be appointed, is to examine allegations that he misled the FBI about the payments before Clinton nominated him for the HUD post. </P>
<P> Cisneros denies misleading the FBI. </P>
