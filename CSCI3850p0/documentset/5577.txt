<P>  When one of the world's best putters needed a putting lesson, he went to one of golf's great teachers. </P>
<P> As a result, Ben Crenshaw sits near the top of the leaderboard halfway through the Masters -- just days after he buried his lifelong friend and mentor, Harvey Penick. </P>
<P> ``I had one last lesson with Harvey,'' Crenshaw confided after he shot a five-under-par 67 that put him within two strokes of the lead 11 years after he won the Masters. </P>
<P> After struggling most of this year with his putting, Crenshaw went home to Austin, Texas, to see the 90-year-old Penick, who had been in failing health in recent years. </P>
<P> ``He said 'Can you please get a putter and show me how you're stroking the ball,''' Crenshaw remembered. ``'And now I want you to take two goods strokes and trust yourself.' </P>
<P> ``And I've thought about that quite a lot,'' Crenshaw said. </P>
<P> Penick, who died Sunday and was buried Wednesday, was one of the game's greatest instructors. He numbered among his prize pupils both Crenshaw and Tom Kite, who is the leading money winner in the history of the game. </P>
<P> ``We dreaded that day for a long time,'' Crenshaw said of Penick's passing. ``But he was in pain for the last 10 years. I don't know how he made it as long as he did.'' </P>
<P> Crenshaw admitted that this week had been very emotional for him. He interrupted his practice at Augusta to attend Penick's funeral in Austin. </P>
<P> ``It has been emotional. You're losing somebody you owe your life to. Whatever Tom and I have accomplished we owe to him.'' </P>
<P> But Penick's advice, which he turned into a wildly popular best-selling book three years ago, has stayed with Crenshaw -- as was evident with his fine round Friday. </P>
<P> ``Harvey always said there's nothing that can boost your confidence like holing a couple of putts.'' </P>
