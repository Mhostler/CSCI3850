<DATELINE>SYDNEY, April 24 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A gay man in Australia's island state of Tasmania, which outlaws homosexual sex, is trying to establish a network to supply sperm to lesbians refused access to mainstream sperm banks. </P>
<P> Richard X -- his surname was withheld -- has placed advertisments in The Mercury newspaper in Hobart seeking gay men willing to donate sperm and plans to collect sperm in glass jars and inseminate women using syringes. </P>
<P> The unofficial sperm bank has had numerous calls from gay men and about six lesbians, Rodney Croome, a spokesman for the Tasmanian Gay and Lesbian Rights group, said on Monday. </P>
<P> ``The idea is to put gay men in touch with lesbians who want children. They can either donate their sperm or arrange sex,'' Croome told Reuters. </P>
<P> ``It's much safer than what exists now where lesbians have to have casual sex,'' Croome said. </P>
<P> But the conservative state government, criticised by a United Nations committee last year for outlawing male homosexual acts, has said it will investigate the safety standards of the unofficial sperm bank. </P>
<P> The Australian Medical Association, which represents doctors, said it does not oppose the unofficial sperm bank, but called on the bank to freeze sperm for six months to ensure the AIDS-causing virus HIV and hepatitis are screened out. </P>
