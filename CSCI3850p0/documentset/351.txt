<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A volcano in southwestern Mexico began spewing lava and ash after an explosion at its peak, and several hundred people were evacuated from nearby villages, authorities said Friday. </P>
<P> There were no reports of injuries or loss of life. </P>
<P> ``It was not an eruption as such, but there was a violent explosion at the cone of the Colima volcano about 8 p.m. Thursday , and some lava and ash began to flow,'' Jose Ismael Dominguez of the Civil Protection service of western Jalisco state said in an interview. </P>
<P> ``The population of the nearest village, Yerbabuena, and some other villages has been evacuated, and we are waiting for reports from the experts before deciding whether to evacuate more people.'' </P>
<P> The 12,670-foot Colima volcano, which last erupted in 1941, lies about 290 miles southwest of Mexico City. </P>
<P> State news agency Notimex said as many as 500 people had been evacuated to towns further from the volcano. </P>
<P> Dominguez said experts from Colima and Guadalajara universities were taking readings from the volcano to try and gauge if it was calming down or if more explosions were likely. </P>
<P> One automatic monitoring station near the volcano's cone was destroyed in the explosion, but others further down its slopes were still working, he added. </P>
