<P>  The campaign to reduce lead exposure in the United States is paying off but may not have reached children in some poor neighborhoods, researchers said Tuesday. </P>
<P> A check for lead levels in the blood of more than 13,000 people ``demonstrates a major public health success in primary prevention efforts,'' a study from the National Center for Health Statistics said. </P>
<P> ``However, exposure to lead at levels that may adversely affect the health of children remains a problem, especially for those who are minority, urban and from low-income families,'' said the study published in this week's Journal of the American Medical Association. </P>
<P> ``Strategies to identify the most vulnerable risk groups are necessary to further reduce lead exposure in the United States,'' it added. </P>
<P> Efforts have been under way for years to reduce lead exposure, through such tactics as phasing out lead in gasoline and paint. But exposure continues to occur from flaking paint in older buildings, dust from contaminated soil and drinking water from older lead service pipes. </P>
