<P>  Haitian slumdwellers saved an army sergeant from almost-certain lynching Thursday because he had protected the neighborhood from thieves. </P>
<P> A group of men chased Benjamin Excellent from his house in the dockside slum called Village of Peace and beat him down a back alley, accusing him of being a paramilitary Tonton Macoute. </P>
<P> But residents ran to his defense and hid the man until Haitian police arrived to escort him back to his house, from where he later emerged dressed in military uniform. </P>
<P> ``He is a good Haitian, he is a good Haitian,'' shouted the slum dwellers, who called for military commander Lieutenant General Raoul Cedras to be jailed. </P>
<P> ``He does no harm to us ... he protected us from robbers,'' said one woman. </P>
<P> The near lynching came after a bomb was thrown into marching supporters of exiled president Jean-Bertrand Aristide, killing at least five people and injuring 43. </P>
<P> Crowds of poor Haitians then looted a car parts shop owned by a police officer from where the explosive device was thrown. </P>
