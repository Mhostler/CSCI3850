<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  U.S. congressional leaders Friday set a December 1 date for a Senate vote on a sweeping world trade pact while denying that White House miscalculations had hurt prospects for passing the plan. </P>
<P> Unable to persuade South Carolina Democrat Ernest Hollings to end delaying tactics blocking pre-election debate on the measure, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell will bring the Senate back November 30 for two days of debate and a vote. </P>
<P> Mitchell denied that the administration's decision to introduce the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade legislation late in the session hurt prospects for passage, saying lawmakers were unable to agree until recently how to raise money to pay for the measure. </P>
<P> ``We might have had an early vote and lost,'' Mitchell said, adding he was convinced the Senate would pass the measure. which implements a sweeping trade pact negotiated by the 123-nation GATT set to cut worldwide tariffs and reduce other trade barriers. </P>
<P> In a speech on the Senate floor, however, Hollings said he had repeatedly warned President Clinton and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor that he would try to defeat the pact if it were brought up in the closing days of Congress. </P>
<P> ``Everybody connected knew my position,'' Hollings said. </P>
<P> ``I am fully intent on killing this measure.'' </P>
<P> Under special fast-track rules Hollings can hold the measure in his committee for 45 days, well past the Senate's scheduled October 7 adjournment. Saying the administration believed fast track meant ``instant track,'' he prepared for a series of hearings to air problems with U.S. trade policy. </P>
<P> Clinton has made passage of the pact his top priority for the waning days of the U.S. congressional session, arguing it is vital to the U.S. and world economies. After a series of losses to Republicans on other issues, it is especially galling to the adminstration to be thwarted by a fellow Democrat. </P>
<P> The measure is expected to pass easily in the House, but there is concern that some senators may vote against a procedural motion necessary to take up the bill. </P>
<P> In addition, some House members are grumbling about having to vote on the pact, opposed by a coalition of labor, environmental and consumer groups, while the Senate is allowed to delay. But House Speaker Thomas Foley said the House would vote on the measure next week. </P>
<P> ``I think GATT is in the interest of American workers and the American economy,'' Foley said. ``I think it expands American trade opportuntiy and expands opportunity for American exporters.'' </P>
