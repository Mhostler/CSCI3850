<P>  Pollution has pushed Russia to the edge of an ecological catastrophe, increasing the incidence of congenital birth defects and reducing life expectancy in some areas, a senior environment official said Friday. </P>
<P> Alexei Yablokov, head of the environment commission of President Boris Yeltsin's Security Council, said in a newspaper interview deformities among new-born babies had risen by between 1 and 3 percent a year for the last few years. </P>
<P> Yablokov, former head of the Soviet branch of the Greenpeace environmental group, told the daily Nezavisimaya Gazeta that industrial pollution was to blame. </P>
<P> ``For the last three to four years, we have seen a stable growth of 1 to 3 percent each year in the number of congenital deformities in new-born babies,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``This means we have passed a fateful point and are falling into the abyss of ecological catastrophe.'' </P>
<P> Yablokov did not say where he had obtained the data or how many babies were born each year with deformities. </P>
<P> He said life expectancy had fallen in some areas, most of them industrial regions, to two years less than the retirement age. In Russia, women retire at 55 and men at 60. </P>
<P> ``For example, in the town of Nikel on the Kola peninsula (in northern Russia), average life expectancy is less than 50 years. This is a disgrace not seen in any civilised country,'' he said. </P>
<P> Other badly polluted towns or cities were Prokopyevsk, Bratsk and Kemerevo in Siberia, and Nizhny Tagil in the Ural mountains. </P>
<P> He called for urgent measures to be taken, saying it was too late just to talk. </P>
<P> Yablokov was named adviser to Yeltsin on the environment in August 1992 but quit after a few months. He now advises Russia's Security Council, an inner circle of leaders headed by Yeltsin. </P>
<P> Also Friday, the World Health Organization and researchers from Russia, Belarus and Ukraine said the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986 had caused a significant increase in the number of cases of cancer in children in their countries -- all of which were then part of the Soviet Union. </P>
<P> The scientists, who screened 70,000 children, told the British Medical Journal their findings called for an immediate international response. </P>
