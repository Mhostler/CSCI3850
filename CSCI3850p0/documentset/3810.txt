<P>  Camps in Tanzania and Zaire for up to 1.5 million Rwandan refugees are to be moved more than 30 miles from Rwanda's borders, a U.N. envoy said Tuesday. </P>
<P> U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Special Envoy Carroll Faubert did not estimate when the Rwandans would be moved but aid workers said they expected it later this year. </P>
<P> ``What is left of the refugee population will be transferred further from the frontier,'' Faubert said in the Rwandan capital. </P>
<P> ``The idea is not to close the camps but to relocate them and offer the refugees the options of a return to their homes or continued exile in a different site,'' he told reporters. </P>
<P> The refugees, virtually all members of the Hutu majority, languish in camps as close as six miles to the borders of Rwanda which they fled from last April to July to escape a rebel advance. </P>
<P> On Tanzanian plains and volcanic rock Zairean hillsides, the refugees live on international aid, too scared to return because of fears they will be killed in revenge for the massacre of up to a million members of Rwanda's Tutsi minority. </P>
<P> The cost of relief is enormous -- aid agencies spend over $1 million a day to support the sprawling camps around the eastern Zairean town of Goma -- and few in the aid community believe the operation is sustainable. </P>
<P> Aid workers said moving the camps is aimed at finding better locations and to increase security in border areas of Rwanda by making it more difficult for militiamen based among the refugees to launch cross-border raids. Agencies also hope the greater distance will encourage more refugees to return home rather than live on handouts in camps. </P>
<P> UNHCR will ask authorities in Zaire and Tanzania to identify sites for new camps up to 125 miles from the border. </P>
<P> Tanzanian authorities have said Rwandans could be sent to camps vacated by Mozambican refugees in the south 950 miles from the present sites in the northwest of the country. </P>
<P> Faubert said he hoped more refugees would decide to return to their homes as Rwanda recovered from the massacres and war. </P>
