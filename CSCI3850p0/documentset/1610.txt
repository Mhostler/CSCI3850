<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton and about 40 other world leaders brought New York to a standstill Monday. </P>
<P> Call it gridlock or ``limolock,'' once an official motorcade for the U.N. General Assembly session began, traffic was halted all over town, leaving motorists fuming in what was called ``a frozen zone.'' </P>
<P> ``Once you have the frozen zone, that's where you're going to have tie-ups,'' Dwight Langhum, spokesman for the New York Department of Transportation said. </P>
<P> What the frozen zone means is that once a dignitary is on the move, traffic and pedestrians temporarily come to a halt and can't move from that spot until the motorcade passes. </P>
<P> About 870,00 automobiles normally come into the city daily, Langhum said. </P>
<P> Clinton spoke to the United Nations Monday morning. Yelstin was there in the afternoon. </P>
<P> Outside U.N. headquarters, meanwhile, virtually every East Side street in the midtown area from 42nd Street to 50th Street was closed to traffic. But that didn't stop a scattering of protesters from demonstrating nearby. </P>
<P> Among those to show displeasure over United States policy in Haiti were about 100 members of a group called International Action Center. </P>
<P> Holding signs reading ``U.S. Out of Haiti,'' Johnnie Stevens, one of the leaders of the group, accused the United States of collaborating with Haitian military leader Raoul Cedras. </P>
<P> ``Despite Clinton's talk about democracy, he's doing all he can to head off the justifiable anger of the Haitian people,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``The Pentagon is working hand-in-hand with the Haitian military. Saturday night's firefight between U.S. troops and Haitian police was an attempt by the Pentagon to establish some kind of credibility for the occupation,'' he added. </P>
