<P>  Guatemalan troops began patrolling the streets of the capital Monday in a bid to clamp down on rampant crime, the army said. </P>
<P> In a statement late Sunday the army said President Ramiro de Leon Carpio had ordered troops to begin patrols in Guatemala City ``to safeguard public order.'' </P>
<P> It added, ``The army will undertake intensive patrols 24 hours a day and we call for people's collaboration and comprehension to avoid false rumors which could confuse national and international opinion.'' </P>
<P> De Leon has called on the army twice during his rule in office to patrol the streets of the capital. The move follows weeks of increasing violence including the regular appearance of tortured bodies on the streets of the capital and a dramatic upsurge in kidnapping. </P>
<P> A mysterious explosion at army installations at the international airport Sunday caused a huge fire that spread to a munitions warehouse owned by the army. Four people were killed and 21 seriously injured in the fire, which raged out of control for more than two hours. </P>
<P> De Leon said late Sunday the explosion and fire may have been a ``criminal act'' and ordered an investigation. </P>
<P> The decision to use troops on the streets was criticized by Guatemalans opposed to the militarization of internal security because of the army's long history of human rights abuses. ''Troops in the street brings back memories of the excesses committed in the name of state security during military regimes,'' an editorial in the Prensa Libre newspaper said. </P>
<P> Human rights groups accuse the army of killing thousands of mainly indigenous Guatemalans at the height of the civil war in the early 1980's and of causing another 40,000 to disappear. </P>
