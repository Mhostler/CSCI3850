<P>  Lebanon's SOLIDERE company began work Friday on rebuilding the center of Beirut which was destroyed in the country's 1975-90 civil war. </P>
<P> ``The contractor has started work today,'' company chairman Nasser Chamaa told a news conference just over six months after SOLIDERE's formation with a mandate to rebuild the city center over the next 25 years. </P>
<P> Chamaa said the company signed a $63.7 million contract Thursday with a Lebanese-Italian consortium for the first phase of infrastucture work expected to take three years. </P>
<P> Rebuilding Beirut is the flagship project of billionaire Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri's ambitious plans for Lebanon's postwar reconstruction. </P>
<P> Other projects include a new national airport and sports city, new highways, power plants, electricity and telephone networks, new hospitals and the reopening of the Casino du Liban which helped make Lebanon the entertainment and gambling center of the Middle East in the 1970s. </P>
<P> Hariri is seeking to win back Beirut's pre-war role as the financial center and playground of the Middle East. </P>
<P> The SOLIDERE infrastructure contract went to Italy's Consorzio Cooperativo Costruzzioni and Lebanon's Khlat and Mouawad which offered the lowest bid. </P>
<P> SOLIDERE was formed on May 5 after a successful $650 million share flotation in January. </P>
<P> Chamaa said the company negotiated for about a month with the Italian-Lebanese consortium to reduce the length of infrastructure work from four to three years. </P>
<P> ``We will pay the contractor an extra $13 million if the works are completed in 36 months instead of 48 months,'' he said. </P>
<P> The work on the 400 acres site will include roads, tunnels, bridges, traffic and street lights, drains, sewerage, power and telecommunications networks. </P>
<P> The consortium will also install public squares, gardens, park benches and telephone booths. </P>
<P> SOLIDERE has demolished a huge swath of damaged buildings in the devastated city center -- site of the Muslim-Christian civil war battle line for 17 years -- to prepare for the work. </P>
<P> Chamaa added that work had already begun on rehabilitating some buildings retained for their architectural value. SOLIDERE had also completed studies for seven projects to start next year, including rebuilding Beirut's souks (covered markets). </P>
<P> Earlier this month SOLIDERE initiated the tendering process for the second stage of infrastructure work which includes treating and expanding a huge landfill off the city center, installing sea-defense lines and a power sub-station at an expected cost of about $350 million. </P>
<P> The landfill will be the site of a new financial district with parks, yachting marina and a seafront promenade and highway. </P>
