<DATELINE>WELLINGTON, April 3 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  About 50 demonstrators occupied part of New Zealand's leading Maori tourist site on Monday, accusing the government of secret plans to sell off the complex to foreign owners. </P>
<P> A protest leader said they were claiming the site of the Maori Arts and Crafts Institute at Rotorua as ancestral land of the local Te Arawa tribe. </P>
<P> ``We're reclaiming the land. We're saying it's our ancestral land,'' Kiri Potaka Dewes told Radio New Zealand. </P>
<P> ``Whakarewarewa thermal valley is the jewel in the crown of New Zealand's tourism industry. We're not about to see that disappear from Te Arawa hands.'' </P>
<P> The Arts and Crafts Institute, located in a thermal area renowned for its geysers, hot mineral springs and mudpools, is a showcase for traditional Maori culture and ranks as one of New Zealand's most popular tourist attractions. </P>
<P> ``The risks of the Arts and Crafts Institute being privatised are very real,'' Dewes said ``Rumour has it that there is a Japanese buyer waiting in the wings,'' Dewes said. </P>
<P> Government ministers denied any plans to privatise the complex, which stands on leased government land. The member of parliament for Rotorua, Attorney-General Paul East, was due to hold talks with the protesters. </P>
<P> The complex was open as usual for tourists. Visitors were free to tour the thermal area but not the ceremonial meeting house, or marae, where protest leaders were meeting directors of the institute. </P>
<P> Maoris, who make up 13 percent of New Zealand's population of 3.5 million, are locked in dispute with the government over settlement of their claims to land taken from them by Europeans after 1840. </P>
<P> Hundreds of Maoris have been camped out in the North Island town of Wanganui for a month on public gardens which they claim as ancestral land, forcing local authorities to seek a resolution through the courts. </P>
