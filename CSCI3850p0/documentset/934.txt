<P>  Bomb threats were made against Britain's Queen Elizabeth II during her stopover in Canada's Arctic territory, but police said Sunday they were not tightening security around the monarch. </P>
<P> The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said two bomb threats were made against the queen over the past few days, one contained in a letter left for police at a local park and the other in a phone call to a local radio station. </P>
<P> ``We've had a number of threats that said people would kill the queen in Yellowknife ... We're taking them seriously, but there has been no change in security arrangements,'' said police spokesman David Grundy. </P>
<P> One bomb threat said the queen would be targeted at a farewell ceremony at the Yellowknife airport Monday with Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, Grundy said. Sniffer dogs are patrolling the airfield but have turned up nothing, he said. </P>
<P> ``There was a call to a local radio station that said, 'Bomb. ... Airport. Monday. Bang,''' he said. </P>
<P> Grafitti proclaiming ``Death to the Queen'' was painted on a highway near Yellowknife, he said. The town is the capital of the vast Northwest Territories, an area the size of India but with 55,000 residents. </P>
<P> The queen seemed unperturbed by the threats as she shook hands and viewed a celebration of aboriginal culture Sunday night and her phalanx of bodyguards appeared no larger than usual. </P>
<P> News of the threats marred an otherwise quiet stop at the end of the queen's 10-day tour of Canada. She finishes her trip Monday with stops in the tiny Arctic settlements of Rankin Inlet and Iqaluit. </P>
<P> The threats surprised local residents, who have given the 68-year-old monarch a warm welcome. During her visit, which began Saturday, she has mingled frequently with local people during walks at various locations around the town. </P>
<P> Police have no suspects and are still investigating the threats, Grundy said. A tape of the phone call to the radio station will be broadcast in an attempt to identify the caller. </P>
<P> The letter was signed with names of local groups who denied any involvement upon questioning by the police, Grundy said. He declined to identify the groups. </P>
<P> One native Indian group, the Gwich'in of the western Arctic, boycotted a meeting with the queen Sunday evening because of Britain's stance against fur trapping. </P>
<P> But native Indians and Eskimos -- or Inuit as they prefer to be called -- took pains to distance themselves from the threats. </P>
<P> Many of Canada's aboriginal people are bitter after struggling for decades for return of their traditional lands and right to self-government. The queen, who is officially Canada's head of state although she has no active role in government, has become a symbol of that resentment for some people. </P>
<P> ``Chiefs have been fighting for their basic rights ... But we're not fanatical people. </P>
<P> One theory circulating in the local community was that elements opposed to greater aboriginal power made the threats in a bid to discredit the natives. The incident has revived memories of a September 1992 bombing at a Yellowknife gold mine that killed nine workers at the height of a labor dispute. </P>
