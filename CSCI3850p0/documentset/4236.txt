<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A strong earthquake shook cities and towns across western Colombia Wednesday, killing at least 27 people, injuring more than 200 and destroying dozens of houses and offices, radio reports said. </P>
<P> The quake, measuring 6.4 on the Richter scale, was the most deadly in Colombia for more than two decades. </P>
<P> It sent office workers in Bogota, the capital, running out into the streets in panic but the death and destruction was concentrated in the industrial and coffee-processing city of Pereira, 90 miles to the west. </P>
<P> Police Gen. Carlos Alberto Pulido Barrantes, speaking from national police headquarters in Bogota, said 20 people had been officially reported dead, 11 of them in Pereira, but radio reports put the toll at more than 27. </P>
<P> RCN Radio, using reporters on the spot to count victims, said 20 people died in Pereira alone and more than 85 had been injured, many of them seriously. Nationwide, 217 people were injured and 27 dead in six provinces, it added. </P>
<P> Barrantes said the quake badly damaged or destroyed more than 60 buildings in Pereira, including the provincial government building, a college, banks, a police station and offices. </P>
<P> Police and military chiefs immediately declared a state of emergency and ordered helicopters and army transports to airlift food, medicine and rescue workers to the quake zone. </P>
<P> ``This is a horrible, lamentable event,'' Health Minister Alonso Duque told reporters as he boarded a flight to the disaster area. </P>
<P> Residents of Pereira, a city of about 300,000 people, told how water leaped out of swimming pools, tiles fell off roofs and huge cracks opened up in the walls of offices and homes as the quake rocked the town at 1:43 p.m. EST. </P>
<P> Television pictures showed rescue workers and bystanders frantically tugging at pieces of walls and chunks of concrete in the tangled wreckage in a desperate search for victims. </P>
<P> Electricity supplies were cut off and the city's telephone network collapsed as the quake hit, witnesses said. </P>
<P> ``We watched as part of the facade of the newspaper building cracked up and crashed down to the street,'' Rosmira Corro, news editor at the Pereira newspaper La Tarde, told Reuters in a telephone interview. ``People here are terrified.'' </P>
<P> Rescue workers said four of Pereira's dead were a family buried alive under a landslide in a hilly city street. Other victims, including a 16-year-old girl in a southern city, died of heart attacks brought on by the terror of the quake. </P>
<P> Mayor Juan Manuel Arango clamped a curfew over the city center and drafted in extra police and soldiers to prevent looting. Hospitals in Bogota organized emergency airlifts of donor blood to the quake zone. </P>
<P> Pereira is located in the heart of Colombia's coffee growing and processing area. Colombia is the world's second biggest coffee exporter but exporters in Bogota said they did not believe that the quake would seriously affect crops. </P>
<P> Colombia is located at the end of the Andes mountain chain which begins in Chile and is highly prone to earthquakes. </P>
<P> Two strong quakes shook the centre and east of the country in January, killing at least seven people, but the last big earthquake with major loss of life was in March 1983 when a tremor destroyed the colonial city of Popayan in the southwest, killing several hundred people. </P>
