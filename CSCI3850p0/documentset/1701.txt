<P>  Germany wants Vietnam to take back some 40,000 Vietnamese living illegally in Germany but has not cut off aid in protest against Hanoi's attitude, as newspapers reported, the German ambassador said Friday. </P>
<P> Ambassador Christian Kraemer denied a Vietnamese report quoting a Frankfurt newspaper as saying Bonn had decided to cancel development aid to Hanoi. </P>
<P> ``There is no government decision to that effect,'' he told Reuters. ``There is no official decision by the federal cabinet in Bonn, and this is a matter for the whole cabinet, not an individual ministry.'' </P>
<P> Press reports quoted Germany's cooperation ministry as saying aid would be cut off in protest against Hanoi's refusal to take back Vietnamese evicted from Germany. </P>
<P> Vietnam has not publicly stated its position on the issue. </P>
<P> Germany has pledged about $110 million in aid to Vietnam since 1990. </P>
<P> Asked whether Bonn was using the threat of an aid cut as a lever in the dispute over illegal migrants, Kraemer said: ``There is an obvious link between all forms of cooperation between our countries.'' </P>
<P> Some of the 40,000 are llegal immigrants who crossed into Germany from other East European countries when communist regimes collapsed in 1989. More than 10,000 arrived later, allegedly aided by criminal gangs who arrange papers and travel for a hefty fee. Most of their asylum requests have been rejected. </P>
<P> A total of 95,000 Vietnamese live in Germany, including workers and students in the communist East who stayed on after reunification in 1990. </P>
<P> The two governments have held two rounds of inconclusive talks on the issue this year. </P>
<P> Germany is one of Vietnam's main European trading partners and is encouraging companies to invest in its emerging market economy. It agreed last month to reschedule about $103 million of Vietnamese debt. </P>
