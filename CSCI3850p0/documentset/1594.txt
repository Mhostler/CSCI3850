<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in a statement Sunday called a special session of Haiti's Parliament to consider amnesty for the military leaders who ousted him, and asked for more humanitarian aid to Haiti. </P>
<P></P>
<P> Full constitutional order will be restored to Haiti within the next 21 days, indeed, progress toward this goal is in sight. </P>
<P> To activate the free exercise of civil liberties inherent in and vital to every democracy, we call upon the Security Council of the United Nations to take necessary measures to facilitate the repair of our communications and information systems consistent with UN Security Council Resolution 841. </P>
<P> The nation stands ready to participate peacefully in the return to constitutional order and has spontaneously initiated a campaign to improve public sanitation and public hygiene badly neglected during the three years since the coup d'etat. These efforts must be supported. Therefore, we ask that all materials that can assist in this endeavor be exempted from the current regime of sanctions in place against Haiti. </P>
<P> In keeping with our commitment to minimize the adverse effect that the embargo has had on the population, we call on the international community to increase humanitarian assistance to Haiti and to enhance those mechanisms necessary for the prompt delivery of such aid. </P>
<P> Similarly, several countries have unilaterally adopted a series of measures to facilitate the departure of the coup regime. Some of these measures affect the entire population. We urge these countries to consider the suspension of those measures while maintaining targeted sanctions against those obstructing the restoration of democracy until the full implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 940. </P>
<P> These steps will help facilitate the efforts of the multinational force as they assist in creating the environment necessary for democracy. </P>
<P> In order to accelerate the process of full restoration of constitutional order and pursuant to the amnesty decree of October 3, 1993, promulgated in accordance with the Governor's Island Agreement, we have convened an extraordinary session of the Parliament for Wednesday, the 28th of September 1994 to study a draft of the amnesty law.  In a separate statement Aristide said: </P>
<P> Our condolences to the families of those who were killed or injured on Saturday night in Cap-Haitien. This incident of violence points again to the urgent need for immediate disarmament. The success of the mission to restore peace, reconciliation and justice to Haiti is linked to this key issue. </P>
