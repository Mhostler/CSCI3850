<P>  Six men were charged Thursday with killing a co-worker at a paper mill by tossing him into a pulp vat, allegedly because he told police one of the men planned to steal an extension cord. </P>
<P> The six, all charged with being parties to first-degree intentional homicide, were ordered held on $300,000 bond each in the Brown County Jail following a court appearance at which preliminary hearings were set for later in the month. </P>
<P> The body of Thomas Monfils was found two and one-half years ago in a deep, pulp-filled vat at a James River Corp. mill. Police said he had been severely beaten but was still alive when he was tossed into the mush with a weight tied around his neck. </P>
<P> The six, who were arrested Wednesday, were Keith Kustra, Rey Moore, Mike Piaskowski, Mike Hirn, Michael Johnson and Dale Basten. </P>
<P> Investigators said Monfils had called police saying Kustra planned to steal an extension cord from the plant. Kustra allegedly found out about the call, got a copy of the tape and confronted Monfils along with the others. </P>
<P> In addition, two other men, one president of the United Paper Workers International Union local at the mill, were named in lesser misdemeanor charges related to the case and were released on bond. </P>
<P> The victim's widow had earlier filed a civil damage suit against the same eight men charging that they were responsible for the slaying. </P>
