<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Egyptian writer Naguib Mahfouz, the only Arab writer to win the Nobel prize for literature, is in stable condition after a suspected Muslim militant stabbed him, a hospital official said Saturday. </P>
<P> A spokeswoman at the police hospital, where doctors Friday operated to save the 82-year-old writer's life after he was attacked outside his Cairo home, told Reuters Mahfouz's condition was ``good and reassuring.'' </P>
<P> No one has claimed responsibility for the attack but the interior ministry said Friday it suspected Muslim militants, some of whom once declared Mahfouz an infidel and put him on their hit list. </P>
<P> The Swedish Academy awarded Mahfouz the Nobel prize for literature in 1988. </P>
