<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES, (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  O.J. Simpson's lead defense attorney and the judge hearing the football legend's murder case clashed in court Friday over the level of confidentiality Simpson has been afforded while in jail. </P>
<P> At issue was a jailhouse conversation between Simpson and football star-turned-minister Rosey Grier in November, which included a shouted exchange in which Simpson might have incriminated himself. </P>
<P> The 46-year-old Football Hall of Famer has pleaded not guilty to the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, 35, and Ronald Goldman, 25. They were stabbed to death outside Nicole's West Los Angeles townhouse the night of June 12. </P>
<P> Prosecutors are trying to obtain a report of the conversation the deputy filed with Superior Court Judge Lance Ito about the incident. Defense attorneys contend Simpson's conversations with Grier, an ordained minister since 1986, are privileged under California's so-called minister-penitent law. </P>
<P> Ito asked Gerald Uelmen, a defense constitutional law expert, how he would respond to the argument that Simpson waived his expectation of privacy by not using phones provided specifically for Simpson's confidential conversations with his attorneys and instead shouting in a manner that was easily overheard. </P>
<P> ``If the parties choose to shout at each other, that's their problem ... how do you answer that?'' Ito asked. </P>
<P> Robert Shapiro, Simpson's lead attorney, then reminded the judge that Ito himself had a hand in providing a special area in the jail for attorneys to visit Simpson -- an area Ito assured them would be secure from eavesdropping. </P>
<P> ``I think its disingenuous of your honor to even make that suggestion, that you gave us privacy with those phones and you indicated yourself and saw we didn't have privacy,'' Shapiro said sharply. </P>
<P> ``Let me caution you. I was posing a question,'' Ito warned the attorney, telling him to ``take a deep breath.'' </P>
<P> ``I have participated in the creation of this facility,'' Ito continued. ``When you argue that the court is being disingenuous in that question, I'm a little concerned and I would ask you to sit back and think about that for a moment.'' </P>
<P> Shapiro said he would take the judge's suggestion and Ito recessed the session for lunch. </P>
<P> Although Ito would not allow Simpson's statement and Grier's response to be uttered in court, the deputy who overheard the exchange testified Wednesday that Simpson slammed down the phone, slammed his hand on a counter and with tears in his eyes shouted something to Grier. </P>
<P> Grier then shouted something back, the deputy said, adding that the entire exchange took about ten seconds. </P>
<P> Uelmen argued Friday that Simpson's talks with Grier were not only privileged, but taken out of context by the deputy who overheard them. </P>
<P> Arguments on the matter were to continue Friday with a ruling from Ito expected later in the day. </P>
