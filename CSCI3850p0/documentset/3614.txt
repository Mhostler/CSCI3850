<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  ``Dream big and dare to fail,'' Norman Vaughan said Friday. </P>
<P> The 89-year-old Alaskan dog musher knows the truth of his advice. </P>
<P> It took him over 65 years, $1.5 million, one failed attempt that ended in a plane crash and the loss of four favorite sled dogs and nine days of climbing to reach the peak named after him by polar explorer Adm. Richard Byrd. </P>
<P> On Dec. 16, Vaughan managed to climb the 10,302 foot mountain in Antarctica, about 240 miles from the South Pole, and celebrate his birthday three days early by lighting 89 Fourth of July sizzlers. </P>
<P> Because of a fused ankle and a knee replacement, Vaughan had to climb straight up, using 7,128 footsteps hacked out of the ice with a pickaxe by lead climber, Vern Tejas. </P>
<P> Vaughan told a press conference at the National Geographic Society, which helped sponsor the trip, that the sparklers were a gift from his wife, fellow climber Carolyn Muegge-Vaughan. He said she told him ``the whole mountain was Norman's birthday cake, with the snow being the frosting.'' </P>
<P> Vaughan marked the occasion by reading a message on the windswept, frozen peak, dedicating the climb to Byrd and two Harvard University roommates, the late Edward Goodale and Freddy Crockett. The three dropped out of school in 1928 to work as dog handlers in Byrd's 1928-30 Antarctic expedition.  He said Byrd named one mountain for each of his ``three musketeers,'' the name he gave his friends. The three mountains adjoin in the Queen Maud Mountain range, 450 miles inland from the Ross Ice Shelf.  Vaughan's first attempt to climb the mountain the previous year ended when a DC-6 supply plane crashed. Sticker, Magoo, Pudge and Pandy, four of his sled dogs, wandered off after the crash and were never found. </P>
<P> He carried a stuffed toy husky, Zippy, to the summit in tribute to them and all the Antarctic sled dogs ``who never gave up. They have been my inspiration,'' he said of a bygone era. Sled dogs are now banned from Antarctica along with any other non-native species. </P>
<P> ``A message I wish to bring everyone is to dream big and dare to fail,'' Vaughan proclaimed from the summit. </P>
<P> Vaughan, who once took Pope John Paul II on a dog sled ride and finished his last grueling trans-Alaska Iditarod dog sled race at 84, said he plans to announce his next adventure in three months. </P>
<P> Asked if it would top climbing a mountain named after him, Vaughan laughed, saying ``I don't know whether it's going to top it, but I hope it is going to equal it.'' </P>
<P> National Geographic made a documentary of Vaughan's climb and will televise it on April 2 on TBS. </P>
