<P> DENVER (Retuer) - An Oklahoma hunter who survived three nights in frigid temperatures and snowstorms in a remote area of southwestern Colorado was found unharmed Tuesday, a police spokeswoman said. </P>
<P> Bob Chance, 45, from Ponca City, Okla., was rescued close to where he was last seen Saturday morning, when heavy snowfall separted him from his hunting party of four. </P>
<P> ``We did air reconnaissance and spotted a blanket from the air,'' said the spokeswoman from La Plata sheriff's office, Linda Stock. Chance, who only had candy bars with him when he disappeared, refused medical care, Stock said. </P>
<P> Other hunters remain stranded, but are safe and have sufficient provisions to wait for a clearing in the weather, Stock said. </P>
<P> Heavy snowfall in the rugged, remote area blanketed the area with drifts of up to six feet over the weekend. </P>
