<DATELINE>GENEVA (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  PLO leader Yasser Arafat and the president of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Sheikh Zaid Bin Sultan al-Nahayan met in Geneva for private talks Saturday, a spokesman for the UAE mission said. </P>
<P> He declined to give any more details. </P>
<P> Relations between Arafat and Gulf Arab states have been cool since the PLO adopted a pro-Iraqi stance following Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. But Arafat met King Fahd of Saudi Arabia about three months ago. </P>
<P> Arafat left Palestinian-ruled Gaza early Saturday and headed for Cairo at dawn, but it was unclear whether he met Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. </P>
<P> PLO officials said Arafat cancelled a planned visit to Egypt last week because he was preoccupied with handling problems resulting from armed attacks by Muslim militants on Israelis in the Gaza Strip in which one Israeli civilian was killed. </P>
<P> Arafat would also pay a short private visit to Tunis, the Palestine Liberation Organization's headquarters before it moved to self-rule areas in Gaza Strip and Jericho, the officials said. </P>
