<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  China cancelled an order for 630,000 tonnes of U.S. corn Wednesday, just days after the United States slapped tariffs on Chinese imports in a war over intellectual property rights. </P>
<P> While it was unclear if the cancellation was in retaliation for the U.S. tariffs, U.S. grain analysts said they could think of no other reason. </P>
<P> ``Corn makes sense if they want to send a political statement but not hurt themselves strategically,'' a grain trade official said. </P>
<P> News of the cancellation came in a brief statement from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which gave no details or reason. </P>
<P> A trader with China's state grain import and export company in New Jersey said the order for the cancellation came from Beijing, bypassing the U.S. office. </P>
<P> He declined to comment further. </P>
<P> Earlier Wednesday, Beijing laid out tough battle lines for upcoming negotiations to try to head off an all-out trade war over the copying of U.S. music, movies and films by Chinese companies. </P>
<P> U.S. negotiators should leave behind their ``irrational demands'' when they go to Beijing for the February 13 talks, an unnamed Foreign Trade Ministry spokesman was quoted by the Xinhua news agency as saying. </P>
<P> U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor Saturday announced 100 percent duties on Chinese imports worth $1.08 billion per year starting February 26 in retaliation for Chinese intellectual piracy. </P>
<P> Although China, with its booming urban population, is becoming increasingly dependent on food imports, its need for corn is much less than its need for wheat. </P>
<P> ``Cancelling a wheat sale would hurt them a lot more,'' the grain trade official said. </P>
<P> The United States has tried to keep agriculture separate from the dispute over intellectual property rights, offering China one million tonnes of subsidized wheat Tuesday. </P>
<P> The U.S. government pays the subsidy to U.S. exporters to keep its domestic wheat price above the international price. </P>
