<P>  Saudi Arabia has agreed to reschedule Russia's $250 million debt to the kingdom, Interfax news agency quoted Russian deputy prime minister and chief debt negotiator Oleg Davydov as saying. </P>
<P> The agreement would mean Moscow could defer until 1996 repayment of the first $100 million, Davydov was quoted as saying in the Saudi capital Riyadh, where Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin ended a two-day visit Sunday. </P>
<P> Interfax said the debt was part of a $750 million Saudi credit made to the former Soviet Union in 1991. </P>
<P> Davydov, who is also foreign trade minister, told RIA news agency the two sides also agreed to set up an Arab investment fund in Russia. No details were available. </P>
<P> Chernomyrdin Saturday invited Saudi Arabia's businessmen to increase investment in Russia. </P>
<P> RIA said the Russians proposed that Saudi Arabia consider clearing part of Moscow's debt with arms supplies. </P>
<P> The chairman of Russia's state committee for the defense industry, Viktor Glukhikh, was quoted by RIA as saying that if Saudi Arabia bought Russian arms, 50 percent of the value of contracts should go to pay off Moscow's debt. </P>
