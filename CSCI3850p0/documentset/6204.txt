<P> Croatian MiG-21 jets swooped on the Stara Gradiska bridge over the Sava River border at 6 a.m. (0400 gmt) but it was not immediately known whether they found their target, a U.N. peace force spokesman said. </P>
<P> It was the second attempt in 12 hours to knock out the bridge, a potential conduit of arms and reinforcements for the Krajina Serbs from Serbs in Bosnia. Rockets fired in the initial attack sailed wide and hit a Serb base instead. </P>
<P> The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said Croatian artillery shelled Bosanska Gradiska on the Bosnian side of the bridge early on Tuesday, killing an elderly man and a three-year-old child. </P>
<P> The U.N. spokesman told Reuters that Croatian troops were also bombarding the main western Slavonian town of Okucani in the heart of the pocket with at least 100 shells crashing since the early hours of the morning. </P>
