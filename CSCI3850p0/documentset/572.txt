<P>  The Senate Wednesday approved $2.1 billion to continue work to put a U.S. space station in orbit around the Earth by the year 2002. </P>
<P> The action came on a 64-36 vote rejecting an amendment to a National Aeronautics and Space Administration appropriations bill killing the space station. The House of Representatives approved the funds last month. </P>
<P> Arkansas Democrat Dale Bumpers, the author of the amendment, called the space station a ``turkey'' and said it was too expensive and did not provide enough benefits to justify its construction. </P>
<P> Supporters said the station was needed to continue space exploration and research and to keep the United States ahead in technology. </P>
<P> ``The space station represents a new frontier, an opportunity and challenge for the United States and the whole world,'' said Ohio Democrat John Glenn, a former astronaut. </P>
<P> ``This is not the time to step back. We must look ahead to the future,'' said Texas Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison. </P>
<P> President Clinton supports the station, which he ordered redesigned last year to save money. It has been renamed Alpha from Freedom. </P>
<P> Russia recently signed an agreement to join the European, Japanese and Canadian space agencies as partners with the United States in the station, which has an estimated cost of $30 billion to build. </P>
<P> NASA said the agreement with Russia would save the United States $2 billion, but a study by the General Accounting Office, the investigating agency of Congress, said it would increase the cost by that amount. </P>
<P> Conceived in the last decade as a possible platform for lunar and planetary exploration, the space station's mission has evolved over the years, with scientific research now a key priority. </P>
<P> Assembly of the station is expected to begin in 1997 with material for the station carried into orbit by U.S. space shuttles. </P>
