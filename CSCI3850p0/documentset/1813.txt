<P>  Israel's social welfare minister, accusing Jews in Russia of dumping their aged parents in Israel, touched off a heated debate Tuesday on whether the Jewish state should curb Jewish immigration. </P>
<P> Ora Namir proposed barring elderly immigrants unless their family also came to Israel -- challenging the Law of Return under which any Jew, regardless of age or economic circumstances, can live in the country. </P>
<P> ``Israeli immigration emissaries will tell them, ``dear comrades, the entire family please','' she told Israel Radio. </P>
<P> Namir, known for her severe demeanor, said an increasing number of Jews in Russia have been burdening Israel with their parents while they themselves left for richer pastures in the United States or Canada. </P>
<P> ``I cannot accept...children shirking a basic obligation towards their elderly parents and placing the entire responsiblity for their welfare on Israel while they run off to another country,'' she told Israel Radio. </P>
<P> ``That is not how I view Zionism.'' </P>
<P> Her comments angered the Russian Jewish community in Israel and put on the public agenda the issue of whether massive immigration is still needed to bolster the Jewish state as it approaches a new era of peace. </P>
<P> ``This is the end of Zionism,'' said Natan Sharansky, a former Soviet dissident, calling for her resignation. </P>
<P> ``How can a cabinet minister call for a selection among the Jews coming to Israel,'' he asked, referring to the process by which Nazis chose who would live or die in concentration camps. </P>
<P> ``I stand here ashamed and astonished over the proposal for selection,'' right-wing Likud legislator David Mena told a parliamentary debate on Namir's comments. </P>
<P> Namir had already drawn an official censure from Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's office Sunday when she said in a newspaper interview that ``elderly and disabled'' Russian Jews were straining Israeli welfare coffers. </P>
<P> About 550,000 Jews have immigrated to Israel from the former Soviet Union since 1989, forcing Israel to turn to the U.S. government for $10 billion in loan guarantees to fund their absorption. </P>
<P> Of those who have arrived in the last 18 months, Namir said, one-third were elderly and many others disabled or in single-parent families. </P>
<P> ``This disturbs and hurts our ability to ensure a good absorption of immigration from the former Soviet Union,'' Namir told the radio, taking aim at an issue which she said has been a ``sacred cow.'' </P>
<P> Namir's comments have struck a chord among some Israelis resentful over housing and tax benefits for immigrants. </P>
<P> ``Can a modern state remain open to unlimited immigration,'' asked an Israeli who identified himself only as Avi on the radio call-in program in which Namir spoke. </P>
<P> ``Hasn't the time come to place limitations on the Law of Return or cancel it,'' he said, echoing the views of several other callers. </P>
<P> ``(Jews) cannot demand that in the 21st century Israel will accept them regardless of their profession, age, health or composition of family,'' he said. </P>
