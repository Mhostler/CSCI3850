<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The former Argentine dictator, Juan Carlos Ongania, was rushed to hospital Friday suffering from high blood pressure while on his way to withdraw formally from presidential elections. </P>
<P> A doctor at the military hospital where the 80-year-old general was being treated said, ``Let's hope he gets better but for now his condition is serious.'' </P>
<P> Ongania, who headed the 1966 coup that toppled president Arturo Illia and ruled until 1970, emerged from years of silence earlier this year to run for president at the request of two far-right fringe parties. </P>
<P> But he said Thursday he was throwing in the towel because of inter-party bickering. The news coincided with the dramatic army mea culpa for human rights abuses in its 1976-83 rule. </P>
<P> Ongania's regime was mild compared to that period. </P>
<P></P>
<P> ``The conditions are not right to carry on. Thank you.'' </P>
<P> Asked early in the campaign if he thought he would win votes in the elections scheduled for May 14, Ongania replied, ''Difficult. But there will always be some poor bastard who'll vote for me.'' </P>
