<DATELINE>BELMONT, Calif.(Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Two men and a woman were found shot to death in a house Wednesday after an apparent domestic dispute, officials said. </P>
<P> Another man was wounded in the shooting in a quiet, middle- class neighborhood of Belmont, 20 miles south of San Francisco. A 14-month-old girl, in the house during the shooting, was unharmed, authorities said. </P>
<P> The incident began Wednesday afternoon when a woman made an emergency call from the house saying there was a domestic argument, said Rick Reed, a spokesman for San Mateo County, where the shooting took place. </P>
<P> The emergency dispatcher heard shots fired while the woman was speaking on the telephone, Reed said. </P>
<P> Police sent SWAT teams to the single-story, three bedroom house and they waited outside for more than three hours, trying in vain to make contact with the occupants of the house. </P>
<P> When they eventually entered the house, police found the bodies of a woman and two men, aged in their 20s, Reed said. </P>
<P> Reed said police believed that the woman's estranged husband had come to the house where she was staying and had apparently shot the other victims before taking his own life. But he said police were still investigating. </P>
<P> The third victim was the woman's cousin, who lived in the house, police said. A 14-month-old baby girl, apparently the couple's child, was in the house but survived unharmed, they said. </P>
<P> The woman's brother, wounded in both legs, managed to escape from the house during the shooting. The man, who was in stable condition at a local hospital, said his brother-in-law ``went nuts'', according to news reports. </P>
<P> Police found a revolver at the scene. Names of the victims were not immediately released and it was not known what prompted the shooting. </P>
