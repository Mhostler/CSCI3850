<DATELINE>BATAVIA, NY (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  An Amtrak train that veered off the tracks early Wednesday, injuring 163 people, was put back on the rails Thursday as investigators looking for a cause of the derailment interviewed passengers and crew. </P>
<P> Amtrak officials said that of those injured, 30 remained hospitalized. There were no deaths among the 340 passengers or 20 crew members. </P>
<P> In Washington, Transportation Secretary Federico Pena said he would call a rail safety summit that will include Amtrak, local commuter rail lines, state and local officials and the Federal Railroad Administration. </P>
<P> The Lake Shore Limited derailed in the early morning hours as it raced through northwestern New York state at 78 mph , just below the 79 mph speed limit. </P>
<P> Fourteen of its 16 cars jumped the track, with nine sliding down a ravine. </P>
<P> Ted Lopatkiewicz, spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board, said that the cars were put back in place Thursday and moved to a siding. He said the track was also repaired and due to go into service later in the day. </P>
<P> He said state and federal investigators spent the day examining the scene and interviewing passengers and crew from the passenger train, coupled from two separate trains departing from New York and Boston. The two sections are joined together in western New York before proceeding to Chicago. </P>
<P> He said they were also talking to crew members from a freight train who had reported seeing sparks coming from under one of the passenger cars just before the accident. </P>
<P> Pena, who announced the proposed summit in an interview on CBS This Morning, stressed that rail travel remains very safe. </P>
<P> He noted that there are 40,000 deaths on the highways each year while Amtrak has had only 88 deaths in its 23 years of operation. </P>
<P> He said that many of the accidents involving Amtrak could not be blamed on the rail system since they involved cars and trucks blocking grade crossings. </P>
