<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The trial of a British couple charged with buying and trying to smuggle a baby out of Romania re-opened Wednesday with lawyers expecting a verdict soon. </P>
<P> ``I do hope it will finish today,'' Bernadette Mooney, 40, told Reuters as she arrived at court with her husband Adrian, 42, for the latest session of their trial -- postponed since Sept. 28. Three alleged middlemen to whom they paid $6,000 for a five-month-old baby girl are also on trial. </P>
<P> However, later Wednesday, a judge said a verdict would not come before Friday. </P>
<P> ``We will need two days to deliberate to judge the case and the verdict and sentence will be on Friday,'' presiding judge Madalina Buta said in response to a query from a lawyer as the trial of Adrian and Bernadette Mooney opened. </P>
<P> Judge Buta heard submissions from lawyers for the Mooneys and three alleged middlemen. The Mooneys then gave short statements themselves. The judge then adjourned the case for a verdict and sentencing Friday. </P>
<P> The Mooneys were arrested on the Hungarian border July 6 with baby Monica sedated and hidden in a box in their car. </P>
<P> Bernadette Mooney told Reuters she had told the judge she and her husband had not intended to break Romanian law when they tried to take baby Monica out of the country. </P>
<P> They are the first foreigners to face trial under tough adoption laws passed in 1991 to control baby trafficking after the 1989 overthrow of communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu exposed tens of thousands of children in gruesome orphanages. </P>
<P> While they could face a five year jail sentence, legal experts expect the Mooneys, who have a three year old legally adopted Romanian daughter, to be fined and given suspended sentences. </P>
