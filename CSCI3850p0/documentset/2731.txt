<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO, (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The chief Palestinian negotiator in the Middle East peace talks said peace in the region depends on Israel's total withdrawal from settlements in the Gaza Strip. </P>
<P> ``Leave us in the Gaza Strip and don't interfere,'' Faisal Husseini told Reuters before he delivered a speech here Saturday night. </P>
<P> ``The Israelis must make the decision to withdraw entirely from the Gaza Strip. By keeping the situation as it is now ... there will continue to be instability in the area.'' </P>
<P> To quell the violence, Husseini called for the confiscation of all weapons, apart from those used by police, in the area which Israel recently turned over to Arab control in an historic move. </P>
<P> ``Until all weapons are removed from ... the West Bank and Israeli settlements withdraw completely, outbursts of violence will spread and threaten the peace process,'' Husseini said. ''If there will be no positive results soon, you'll find more events'' like Friday's. </P>
<P> Violence in Gaza and the West Bank has surged since Friday, when at least 13 Gazans were killed and more than 200 wounded when Palestinian police opened fire on a demonstration by Islamic fundamentalists opposed to the Middle East peace initiative. </P>
<P> Hours after the Muslim group Hamas urged its guerrillas to avenge the deaths of the 13, its gunmen sprayed automatic fire at the Israeli army Netzarim checkpost in Gaza Saturday, mortally wounding one soldier. </P>
<P> Earlier Saturday, Israeli troops guarding a Jewish settlement opened fire on stone-throwing demonstrators at Netzarim, fatally wounding a 17-year-old. </P>
<P> ``What happened (Friday) was painful but not surprising,'' Husseini told a crowd that gathered in the sprawling San Francisco cathedral. </P>
<P> Outside, a small group of protesters held a candlelight march, denouncing the negotiations and Palestinian Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat. Arafat controls the Palestinian police in Gaza, who have conducted raids on the homes of suspected Hamas guerrillas. </P>
<P> ``Occupation Continues,'' read one protestor's placard. </P>
<P> ``You can see change'' in the territories since the peace process began, Husseini said in his speech. But many Palestinians ``aren't feeling it yet'' and are growing impatient. </P>
<P> In order to avoid further bloodshed, he said Israel should quickly remove Jewish settlements and the Palestinian police should disarm everyone but the police in the terrorities. </P>
