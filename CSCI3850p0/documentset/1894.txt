<DATELINE>KUWAIT (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A large force of American warplanes rushed to join growing naval and army contingents in the Persian Gulf Sunday to counter the deployment of 60,000 Iraqi troops near Kuwait. </P>
<P> In Kuwait, which has 10 percent of the world's oil reserves, tanks rumbled into desert strongpoints near the frontier prepared to counter an Iraqi offensive. </P>
<P> Iraq reiterated threats to take unspecified action within days unless the U.N. eases Persian Gulf War sanctions strangling its economy. </P>
<P> ``We will not allow the tragedy ... to be repeated, no matter what the cost,'' said Kuwaiti Information Minister Sheikh Saud Nasser al-Saud al-Sabah, referring to Iraq's 1990 invasion. </P>
<P> He said Kuwait's own forces had been fully deployed on the border and added that if the Iraqis north of the border adopted an offensive position ``that is the time to take action.'' </P>
<P> He said they were not at present in an offensive position. </P>
<P> He dismissed an Iraqi deadline of Monday for settling the sanctions issue. ``Let Saddam Hussein set the dates he wants to set. We are not about to deal with Saddam according to the dates he sets,'' he said. </P>
<P> Defense Secretary William Perry said in Washington the U.S. was moving ``many squadrons'' of F-15, F-16 and other warplanes to the region in response to the Iraqi buildup. </P>
<P> The aircraft, also including A-10 anti-tank attack jets and AWACS radar planes, were being sent to the region from the United States and Europe, he said. </P>
<P> The United States already has aircraft based in Saudi Arabia and Turkey and can also use bases in Kuwait itself. </P>
<P> The captain of a British frigate that arrived in Kuwaiti waters Sunday said the vessel had loaded its missiles and was five minutes away from action status. </P>
<P> ``We have live missiles. Launchers are ready and everything is loaded,'' said Charles Freeman, captain of the frigate Cornwall after it arrived in Kuwaiti waters. </P>
<P> The British frigate steamed into Kuwaiti waters carrying anti-ship missiles, anti-aircraft and anti-missile missiles, torpedoes and a helicopter armed with anti-ship missiles. </P>
<P> Four Navy ships carrying 2,000 Marines have arrived in the northern Gulf and 4,000 more Marines are due in Kuwait in the next day or so, U.S. officials said. </P>
<P> The U.S. Embassy told American expatriates in Kuwait to carry on business as usual but be alert following a large Iraqi troop buildup near the border. </P>
<P> Crippling U.N. trade sanctions, imposed within days of Kuwait's seizure, are still in force more than 3 3/8 years after a U.S.-led alliance routed President Saddam Hussein's army and liberated Kuwait in February 1991. </P>
<P> Kuwait's emir, Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah, called parliament into emergency session for Monday. </P>
<P> Many Kuwaitis stocked up on essentials such as flour, rice, sugar. Some supermarkets sold out of bottled water. </P>
<P> The dinar was steady, although residents said some bank branches ran out of dollars. Bankers said they were promised adequate supplies by the authorities. </P>
<P> Traffic was lighter than normal and some people said they were staying home from work to prepare for any crisis. </P>
<P> Iraq, which recently cut food rations for its hard-pressed people, remained defiant. The ruling Baath party newspaper al-Thawra said unless Baghdad was guaranteed a favorable review on sanctions ``that will definitely take Iraq to the doors leading to the barns of the world.'' </P>
<P> Iraq has told the world to mind its own business about troop movements, saying it can do as it likes within its own borders. </P>
