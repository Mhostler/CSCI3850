<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  China and the United States Tuesday began talks that could lead to an opening of China's vast markets to U.S.-grown citrus, fruit and tobacco. </P>
<P> The three-day talks, in San Francisco, are the first between the two nations on plant safety issues since an agreement last month between them on various trade concerns, including U.S. support for China's entry into the World Trade Organization. </P>
<P> ``If China is living up to the agreement, there could be an opening of markets,'' said a U.S. official close to the talks.  The talks will focus on health worries China has over the imports of citrus, certain fruits and tobacco, and will review scientific analysis China is to have completed by this time. </P>
<P> China currently bans the imports of any U.S. citrus, leaf tobacco and certain fruits such as cherries and grapes unless they comply with ``phytosanitary'' regulations that establish tough standards and costly testing. </P>
<P> U.S. trade officials contend that China's phytosanitary standards ``are often overly strict, unevenly applied, and not backed up by modern laboratory techniques.'' </P>
<P> Officials at the talks will review pest risk assessments done by China to determine if they are scientifically valid. </P>
<P> ``This is a fairly new game with China,'' said an official. ''We are very concerned that their science is appropriate.'' </P>
<P> In last month's understanding, China agreed to protect U.S. copyrights, discuss more imports of U.S. farm goods and base its food safety standards governing imports of plants and animals on sound science. </P>
<P> In return, Washington agreed to support China's entry into the new World Trade Organization. </P>
<P> The phytosanitary issue has been a contentious one between the two nations, and just last year China agreed to eliminate so-called ``scientifically unjustified'' standards that were barring the imports of apples from Washington state. </P>
<P> A long dispute has also been over U.S. wheat grown in the Pacific Northwest, which China says is infected. China has agreed to address this issue, but officials said the wheat dispute will not be discussed at this week's meeting. </P>
<P> Leading the U.S. delegation at the talks is Glenn Lee, Deputy Administrator for the Agriculture Department's Plant Protection and Quarantine division. Lee's Chinese counterpart is heading Beijing's team. Also at the talks are officials from the U.S. Trade Representative's Office. </P>
