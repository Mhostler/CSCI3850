<DATELINE>ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The navies of the World War II Allies joined forces for a review along St. Petersburg's Neva river Monday to pay tribute to the city that held out against a 900-day Nazi siege. </P>
<P> More than 20 vessels dropped anchor in the heart of Russia's second largest city in a display of military unity that would have been unthinkable only five years ago, when it was still called Leningrad after the Soviet Union's founder. </P>
<P> Huge crowds braved wind and rain to see the review, packing the bridges and embankments and scrambling up trees and onto window ledges to get a better view. </P>
<P> Sailors saluted from the decks of their ships and Russian servicemen marched along the embankment in World War II uniforms. The review was crowned by cannon fire after a speech by Mayor Anatoly Sobchak. </P>
<P> ``It was a truly international victory,'' Sobchak said of the allies' defeat of Nazi Germany 50 years ago, underlining the significance of the presence of ships from Britain, the United States, Netherlands and France. </P>
<P> Sobchak recalled the suffering borne during the siege, which lasted from 1941 until it was broken by the Red Army in 1944 and killed more than a million people, many of them by starvation. </P>
<P> But he also referred to the purges of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin which followed the war. </P>
<P> ``We remember the tragedy of Leningrad after the victory, those who were shot or sent to concentration camps,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``Now we must do all we can to live as free people in a free country ... in peace with all the countries of the world.'' </P>
<P> A military band then began playing by a statue of Peter the Great, whose dream of integrating Russia with Europe in the 18th century matched the spirit of Monday's commemoration. </P>
<P> Much of the elegant city which Peter founded on the Gulf of Finland had to be rebuilt after the siege. </P>
<P> Most of the victims are buried in mass graves in a cemetery in the northeast of the city and some of the remains are still being found in marshes around St. Petersburg. </P>
<P> A reminder of the blockade is also preserved in a sign on a wall on the central Nevsky Prospekt, which reads: ``Citizens, during artillery bombardment, this side of the street is the more dangerous.'' </P>
