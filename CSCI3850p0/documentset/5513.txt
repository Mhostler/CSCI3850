<DATELINE>SOUTHAMPTON, England (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Queen Elizabeth formally christened Britain's first new luxury liner for 25 years with French champagne Thursday and tried to brush off criticism that the Oriana was not built in a British shipyard. </P>
<P> The queen, wearing a coral-colored suit, smashed the traditional magnum of bubbly against the ship's side in front of 2,500 spectators braving a chilly spring breeze in this southern English port. </P>
<P> ``Though built in Germany, she was very much a British ship, British-owned and British-registered and flying the red ensign,'' the queen said during a 30-minute ceremony alongside the Peninsula and Oriental Steam Navigation Co. (P&O) ship, the first designed and built specifically for the British cruise market. </P>
<P> Their design was too big to be handled by any British shipyard, so the Swedish architect, Norwegian cabin designer, French and Polish bathroom fitters and Italian lift manufacturers had to work at the Mayer Werft shipyard near Bremen in Germany. </P>
<P> The 853-foot Oriana has a top speed of more than 25 knots and its four diesel engines and the world's largest stabilizers will smooth the waves for the ship's 1,975 passengers and 760 crew. </P>
<P> After the public relations disaster of rival Cunard, when its QEII flagship sailed on a Christmas cruise with workers still completing a $48 million refit, P&O chairman Lord Sterling predicted Oriana's maiden voyage would go like clockwork. </P>
<P> The 69,000-ton cruise liner, with decks of teak, is the fastest to be launched in more than 25 years and has the biggest shipboard swimming pool, a waterfall that cascades four decks to the foot of a sweeping staircase and the largest theater afloat. </P>
<P> An on-board art collection of nearly 3,000 works by British artists surpasses the number hung in Britain's National Gallery. </P>
<P> Demand for berths on the 17 cruises planned for the ship's first year of operation have exceeded the company's forecasts. The most expensive cruise will be a three month round-the-world voyage, with suites costing $51,600 per person. </P>
<P> Next weekend, exactly seven years after P&O conceived the new Oriana, the cruise fleet's flagship will sail on its maiden cruise to Madeira, the Canary Islands, Morocco and Portugal. </P>
