<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  An Afghan faction opposing President Burhanuddin Rabbani said Sunday its fighters had captured the strategic northern town of Kunduz, but a government spokesman in Kabul denied the report. </P>
<P> An Islamabad-based spokesman for the Jumbish-i-Milli party of northern warlord General Abdul Rashid Dostum said the opposition forces took the town Sunday afternoon after 500 armed tribesmen supporting Rabbani switched sides. </P>
<P> But a government spokesman, quoted by the official Kabul Radio, said the government forces had repelled a fresh assault by Dostum's militia starting early in the morning. </P>
<P> Fourteen militiamen were killed and 40 arrested, he said, adding that the attackers also lost two tanks and other equipment captured by the government forces. </P>
<P> ``Our forces took control of Kunduz airport and Kunduz city at 1 p.m. (3 a.m. EST) today,'' Jumbish spokesman Maulvi Abdul Baqi Turkistani told Reuters in Islamabad earlier Sunday. </P>
<P> Another Jumbish source said later that Dostum's forces had also captured Khanabad town southwest of Kunduz and were on the border of neighboring Takhar province negotiating surrender terms with pro-Rabbani commanders. </P>
<P> If confirmed, Kunduz's capture would be the most significant gain for Dostum since Rabbani's forces drove out opposition forces from their bases in Kabul in June last year. </P>
<P> The town is the capital of Kunduz province bordering the Central Asian republic of Tajikistan and lies on a highway to Sher Khan Bandar port on the Oxus river on the Tajik-Afghan border. </P>
<P> Dostum and Hezb-i-Islami party leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar lead a coalition that has been fighting to topple Rabbani since January last year. </P>
<P> The Kunduz fall claim coincided with the arrival of U.N. peace envoy Mahmoud Mestiri in Kabul from neighboring Pakistan for talks with Afghan leaders. </P>
<P> A Kabul Radio broadcast, monitored in Islamabad, said Hekmatyar's militia had fired 64 rockets on Kabul Saturday night and Sunday, killing 12 people and wounding 64. </P>
<P> Turkistani said more than 500 local tribesmen helped Dostum's forces seize Kunduz, about 170 miles north of Kabul, without a fight. ``We took control without any bloodshed.'' </P>
