<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Clinton and official Washington waited Friday with the family of downed U.S. helicopter pilot Bobby Hall to hear if the Army flier will be home for the holidays. </P>
<P> Meanwhile, New Mexico Democratic Rep. Bill Richardson was due in Washington Friday afternoon to report to Clinton on his negotiations with the North Koreans over Hall's release. </P>
<P> Hall and his fellow pilot, Chief Warrant Officer David Hilemon, went down in North Korea in their helicopter Saturday when it apparently strayed several miles north of the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas. </P>
<P> Richardson had escorted the remains of Hilemon, of Clarksville, Tenn., to Seoul Thursday after leaving North Korea. </P>
<P> He had told reporters that he expected Hall to be released after interrogation ``very soon,'' suggesting he could be released before Christmas. </P>
<P> A Pentagon spokesman said there was no more information on the Army Chief Warrant Officer from Brooksville, Fla. </P>
<P> U.S. military officials in South Korea were awaiting a response Friday from North Korea to a request for a border meeting to arrange the return of Hall by Christmas. </P>
<P> ``We will be ready for talks whenever the North accepts the offer,'' said Jim Coles, a spokesman for the U.S. military in South Korea. </P>
<P> Richardson had been in North Korea for talks on a nuclear agreement the United States had struck with Pyongyang when the helicopter apparently wandered over the demilitarized zone. </P>
<P> He was thrown into diplomatic discussion with North Korean officials over the helicopter incident, which threatened to further chill U.S.-North Korea relations. Relations had recently appeared to be thawing since the October nuclear agreement. </P>
<P> U.S. officials have described Richardson's talks as acrimonious, according to The Washington Post in a report Friday from Seoul. </P>
<P> Discussions over the downed OH-58A helicopter became so heated at one point that Richardson was ordered to leave the country, but he refused, the Post reported. </P>
<P> Richardson told the Post in an interview that the North Koreans were initially skeptical about U.S. explanations that the helicopter strayed into their territory. </P>
<P> Tension subsided following a break from the discussions, Richardson told the paper. </P>
<P> He also told the North Koreans that failure to resolve the incident ``would cloud the atmospherics'' in Washington over improved relations with Pyongyang. </P>
