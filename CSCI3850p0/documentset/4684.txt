<P>  The Cuban Foreign Ministry confirmed Thursday that a diplomat in its embassy in Jamaica had defected but gave no other details. </P>
<P> Asked about reports that the first secretary at the embassy, Jose Martinez, had defected, ministry spokesman Rafael Dausa told a weekly press briefing that this was the case. </P>
<P> The spokesman did not give details and said he could not say where the diplomat was. </P>
<P> Politicians and diplomats in Kingston, Jamaica, said Wednesday that Martinez had disappeared and could have sought asylum in a third country. </P>
<P> Martinez's car was found Monday in the parking lot at Kingston's Norman Manley International Airport. A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Kingston said he was unaware of the incident and that Martinez had not defected to the United States. </P>
<P> Various officials in Kingston speculated that Martinez, who had served at the embassy since June 1993, may have taken a flight to Cancun, Mexico, and defected either to Mexico or a Central American country. </P>
