<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A South Korean court has sentenced a college student to two years in jail for mourning the death of North Korean communist leader Kim Il-sung, officials said Friday. </P>
<P> A court official said Lee Young-kyu, 23, a student leader of a provincial university, was jailed Thursday for violating the National Security Law. </P>
<P> The official said Lee was found guilty of taking part in a secret memorial service at the university with 10 other students and of leading illegal anti-government protests. </P>
<P> Human rights groups say dozens of students have been arrested and convicted in connection with mourning Kim Il-sung, who died July 8. The justice ministry said it did not have precise figures. </P>
<P> South Korea had warned its citizens that anyone who paid condolences to the North Korean president would face legal charges under the National Security Law, which bans all unauthorized contacts with the Stalinist North. </P>
<P> International human rights organizations have called for the scrapping the sweeping security law, saying it violates freedoms of conscience and speech. </P>
<P> Seoul says the law must remain because, it says, North Korea maintains a policy of taking over the South by force. </P>
