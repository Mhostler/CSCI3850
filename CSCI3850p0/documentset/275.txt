<P>  All 365 passengers and crew escaped in lifeboats after fire broke out aboard a ferry off south Norway Monday, police said. </P>
<P> ``Nobody was injured, the evacuation went smoothly in calm summer weather,'' said Alf Martin Evensen, deputy chief of police in Sandefjord, south Norway. </P>
<P> Fire broke out in the electrical system in the engine room of the 1965 vintage M/S Sandefjord, sailing from Sandefjord to Stroemstad in western Sweden, a trip of less than 62 miles. The fire was quickly extinguished. </P>
<P> All 322 passengers and 43 crew were evacuated in the ship's lifeboats and taken to Norway. </P>
<P> The 3,920-ton ferry is owned by Norway's Larvik Scandi Lines. </P>
