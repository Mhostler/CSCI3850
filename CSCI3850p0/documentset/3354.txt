<DATELINE>BUJUMBURA, Burundi (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  At least 10 people were killed in overnight ethnic attacks in Burundi's capital of Bujumbura, which was close to a standstill Wednesday as workers fearing more violence stayed at home. </P>
<P> Residents said the night was punctuated by hand grenade blasts and outbreaks of shooting following the killing of five people -- most of them members of the Hutu majority -- in the main market Tuesday. </P>
<P> There have been widespread fears of a full-blown ethnic war after genocide between April and July in neighboring Rwanda, Burundi's ethnic twin. In October and November, hundreds of people in Burundi were killed in attacks by Hutu extremists and in army reprisals. </P>
<P> The latest attacks focused on the the capital's northeastern district of Bwiza, where witnesses said at least a dozen houses were set ablaze and destroyed. Buildings were still burning Wednesday morning. </P>
<P> Troops in Bwiza, one of the few remaining mixed districts of Tutsis and Hutus, told reporters at least 10 people were killed. But an independent source estimated the death toll Tuesday and overnight at up to 30. There was no official confirmation. </P>
<P> Residents of Bwiza said they were angry and scared. A group of youths, apparently members of the Tutsi minority, demonstrated Wednesday in protest against the election of Jean Minani, a Hutu, as speaker of the national assembly last month. </P>
<P> No strong military presence was visible on the streets of the capital Wednesday. Small groups of soldiers and policemen gathered near junctions while others were visible in buildings. </P>
<P> All government offices and virtually all businesses in the capital remained closed Wednesday as workers stayed at home. Only a few private cars moved on the streets. </P>
