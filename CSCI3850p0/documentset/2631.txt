<P>  Lt.-Gen. Daniel Schroeder, deputy commander of the United States Army in Europe, was named Tuesday to command a 6,000-member U.N. mission that will replace the U.S.-led multinational force now in Haiti. </P>
<P> Last summer he headed a U.S. humanitarian mission in civil war-torn Rwanda. </P>
<P> Schroeder's appointment, which requires confirmation by the U.S. Senate, was announced by U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali during a brief visit to Haiti. </P>
<P> No date has yet been announced for the United Nations to take over from the U.S.-led force, which began arriving in Haiti in September to oversee the departure of a military junta headed by Lt.-Gen. Raoul Cedras and the return from exile the following month of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, overthrown in a 1991 coup. </P>
<P> The U.S.-led multinational force numbered some 20,000 at its peak but is now below 14,000. </P>
<P> United States troops are expected to comprise between a third and a half of the U.N. mission. </P>
<P> American U.N. envoy Madeleine Albright said in a statement Schroeder's appointment would smooth the way for the transfer of responsibility from the United States to the United Nations. The U.N. force is expected to remain in Haiti until early 1996. </P>
