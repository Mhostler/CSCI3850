<P>  The United States has initialed liberalized air agreements with three Nordic nations to complete its goal of reaching ``open skies'' pacts with nine smaller European countries, U.S. officials said Thursday. </P>
<P> The agreements with Denmark, Norway and Sweden came as the European Commission adopted a draft mandate for the European Union itself -- and not individual members -- to negotiate a wider EU ``open skies'' accord with the United States. </P>
<P> Earlier, the United States reached accords with Belgium, Iceland, Austria, Luxembourg, Switzerland and Finland. Switzerland, Iceland and Norway are not EU members. </P>
<P> Transportation Department officials said a date for signing the bilateral accords and implementing them has not been set. </P>
<P> The agreements will end restrictions on flights between the signing countries and allow airlines of both countries to operate air services from any point in one to any point in the other, as well as to and from third countries. </P>
<P> No other details of the accords were made public. </P>
<P> EU Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock, urging the mandate to negotiate a single accord with the United States, had sent letters to some member states complaining that bilateral accords jeopardized the EU's own liberalization effort. </P>
<P> ``Without (the mandate),'' he said, ``we will witness the implementation of a policy that is not just America first, but America first, last, both ways across the Atlantic and within and beyond Europe.'' </P>
<P> The draft must win the backing of the 15 EU members, which is seen in no way certain. </P>
<P> Kinnock's remarks and letters reflect a battle between the EU, which says it is in a better position to serve the aviation interests of the 15-member nations, and many member states who favor acting on their own. </P>
<P> One of the letters went to Britain, even though there is no liberal aviation accord between it and the United States, But the United States and Britain have been trying during the past four years to ease some of the restrictions in their current accord, so far unsuccessfully. </P>
<P> The United States has long had a free-market air accord with the Netherlands and an accord with Germany that will gradually end restrictions over the next several years. </P>
<P> In addition to Britain, the United States has restrictive aviation service accords with France and Italy, and no talks to ease them are planned. </P>
