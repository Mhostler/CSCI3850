<P>  Overseas successes have helped boost President Clinton's popularity in California, where half of the public now approve of his performance, according to an opinion poll published Friday. </P>
<P> The survey by the independent Field Poll found that 50 percent of Californians approved of Clinton's performance as president, compared to 38 percent who disapproved. </P>
<P> Some 35 percent viewed his job performance as ``very good'' or ``good,'' up from 32 percent in a similar poll in September, the poll said. </P>
<P> Pollsters said Clinton's recent foreign policy successes had helped lift his popularity in California. </P>
<P> ``Most of the bounce he is getting is in the foreign policy area ... from his foreign policy achievements in Haiti and Kuwait,'' said Field Poll director Mark DiCamillo. </P>
<P> Clinton quickly dispatched U.S. forces to the Middle East this month after reports that Iraqi troops had advanced towards the Kuwait border. </P>
<P> The Clinton administration also brokered an accord allowing ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to return to Haiti. </P>
<P> Fifty-two percent of those polled said they approved of Clinton's handling of foreign policy compared to 41 percent who disapproved. </P>
<P> But only 44 percent approved of Clinton's handling of the economy, with 45 percent disapproving. </P>
<P> Forty-four percent of those polled also said they would not support Clinton in a re-election bid in 1996 while just 39 percent said they would support him. </P>
<P> The survey of 681 Californians, carried out October 21-25, has a margin of error of 4.5 percentage points. </P>
