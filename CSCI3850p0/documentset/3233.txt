<P>  U.S. helicopters and ferries carried Marines to Kuwait from U.S. ships off the coast Thursday at the start of nine-day military exercises with Kuwaiti troops in the emirate. </P>
<P> Nine Super Stallion and Sea Knight helicopters roared over Kuwait as they carried groups of the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit from the vessels anchored off Kuwait City. </P>
<P> Some 150 Marines, part of 2,200 to be on Kuwaiti soil by midday Friday, were taken to a Kuwaiti military camp north of the city where they stormed two abandoned buildings kicking off the exercises with Kuwaiti troops. </P>
<P> Others were carried by ferries, along with heavy equipment, to take part in the exercise, codenamed Eager Mace. </P>
<P> The Marines will start individual training with Kuwaiti soldiers before they go to live-fire drill in the Kuwaiti desert Wednesday, a unit spoksman told reporters. </P>
<P> ``If there were a need for the Kuwaitis and the Americans to fight side by side, you need to know who the other person is because you depend on him for your life at times,'' Gunnery Sgt. Ron Turner said. </P>
<P> ``I think probably the most significant thing that we can accomplish out here is that understanding,'' he said. </P>
<P> Turner said the Marines were part of 4,350 U.S. troops taking part in the exercises designed to demonstrate continued U.S. commitment to the security and stability of the Gulf. </P>
<P> The joint exercise was not being staged in relation to the Iraqi October buildup near the emirate's borders, he noted. </P>
<P> Iraq briefly massed some 60,000 troops near the Kuwaiti border in October leading the United States, and other allies of the oil-rich emirate, to rush troops to the region to counter any repetition of the 1990 Iraqi invasion and seven-month occupation of Kuwait. </P>
