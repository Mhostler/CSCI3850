<P>  Japan's main opposition party Tuesday ended loose cooperation with the government over the Kobe earthquake and launched an all-out attack on Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama for his handling of a credit union scandal. </P>
<P> The executive board of the New Frontier Party unanimously agreed to oppose government plans to rescue two debt-ridden credit firms, Tokyo Kyowa Credit Association and Anzen Credit Bank, a senior party official said. </P>
<P> The affair involves a Bank of Japan-led scheme to bail out the two credit firms at the expense of taxpayers, BOJ funds and the country's big commercial banks. </P>
<P> The two credit firms hold unrecoverable loans totalling some $1.1 billion. </P>
<P> The affair has raised questions about links between politicians and bureaucrats of the Finance Ministry and officials of the Bank of Japan. </P>
<P> ``It is unclear how, when and where this bailout scheme was decided on. It is also unclear under what sort of basis such a scheme will be applied,'' if other financial institutions were to go bankrupt in the future, the NFP official said. </P>
<P> On March 9, the two businessmen at the heart of the scandal, Harunori Takahashi, former head of Tokyo Kyowa Credit, and Shinsuke Suzuki, former president of Anzen Credit, will appear in parliament to testify under oath. </P>
<P> The central bank has said the two firms lent some $650 million to companies related to Takahashi's own firm, land developer EIE International Corp. </P>
<P> The affair had already cast shadows on Tokyo's stock exchange when the collapse of Britain's merchant bank Barings triggered a huge share price plunge. </P>
<P> Led by ex-prime minister Toshiki Kaifu, the NFP had refrained from all-out attacks on Murayama in a bid to ensure earthquake reconstruction measures went smoothly. </P>
<P> With the budget in place, Murayama faces tough questioning over a number of issues including the credit union scandal. </P>
<P> The prime minister has already come under criticism for not responding quickly to contain earthquake damage and for failing to deliver on promises to slash government-run corporations. </P>
<P> The first test of the $1.6 billion credit firm rescue package will come Thursday when a key committee of the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly votes on a funding bill. </P>
<P> The Tokyo Metropolitan government had promised to provide $300 million, or about a fifth of the total bailout package. The rest would be from the Bank of Japan and commercial banks. </P>
<P> A Socialist party assemblyman said he doubted whether the committee would approve the bill, since the rescue package has become increasingly unpopular with Tokyo taxpayers. Elections for the 125-member Tokyo assembly and the governor are to be held in April, part of the nationwide local polls. </P>
