<P>  Two Israeli soldiers were killed and three wounded Monday in two guerrilla attacks in Israel's occupation zone in south Lebanon, pro-Israeli militia sources said. </P>
<P> The deaths brought to 19 the number of Israeli soldiers killed this year in south Lebanon. </P>
<P> The South Lebanon Army (SLA) sources said one soldier was killed and one wounded when guerrillas lobbed shells into an Israeli army post on Tallouseh hill in the central sector of the nine-mile-wide border zone. </P>
<P> A source with U.N. peacekeeping troops in the south said the guerrillas fired a dozen Katyusha rockets and a dozen anti-tank Sagger missiles at the post. </P>
<P> Another soldier died and two were wounded hours later when guerrillas rained rockets and machinegun fire on their patrol at Teeri in the western sector of the zone, the SLA sources said. </P>
<P> A clash then ensued between members of the patrol and the attacking guerrillas, the sources added. Details were not known. </P>
<P> The pro-Iranian Hizbollah (Party of God) group claimed responsibility for the first assault, but it was not immediately known who was behind the attack on the patrol. </P>
<P> The sources said Israeli and SLA gunners retaliated to the first attack by firing dozens of heavy artillery shells at guerrilla-held villages to the north but no one was hurt. The U.N. source said 150 shells were fired. </P>
<P> Sunday, Hizbollah chief Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah responded to Israeli threats of military action by vowing his Muslim militant fighters would wage suicide raids on Israeli targets worldwide. </P>
<P> Hizbollah, which is opposed to Arab-Israeli peace talks, is launching a guerrilla campaign against Israeli troops in the south Lebanon zone in a bid to force them out of the country. </P>
