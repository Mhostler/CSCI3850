<P>  The Texas Rangers took their turn in this off-season rotation of American League managers by signing former Baltimore Orioles pilot Johnny Oates Wednesday to a two-year contract. </P>
<P> The 48-year-old Oates, who was fired by the Orioles on Sept. 26, replaces Kevin Kennedy, who was named the new Boston Red Sox manager on Tuesday, just six days after being let go by the Rangers. </P>
<P> New Texas general manager Doug Melvin was the assistant general manager of the Orioles and hired Oates to manage Baltimore's Triple-A farm team in 1988. Oates took over as Orioles manager in May 1991. </P>
<P> ``We are very excited to have Johnny Oates as the new manager of the Texas Rangers,'' Melvin said. ``His strength with pitching and defense as well as his strong knowledge of the American League are great assets.'' </P>
<P> Oates, a former major league catcher, was fired after leading the Orioles to a 63-49 record and a second-place finish in the American League East, 6 3/8 games behind the New York Yankees in the strike-shortened season. </P>
<P> The Orioles were expected by many to contend for the division title in 1994 after signing high-priced free agents Rafael Palmeiro, Chris Sabo and Sid Fernandez in the off-season. </P>
<P> Baltimore was 291-270 in his four years as Orioles' manager. </P>
