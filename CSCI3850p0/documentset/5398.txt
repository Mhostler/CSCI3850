<DATELINE>LONDON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  British Prime Minister John Major flew to Washington Sunday to restore the shine to a relationship with President Clinton that has been tarnished by a string of differences over foreign policy. </P>
<P> Major made no comment as he left on a private Concorde supersonic flight for Washington. </P>
<P> Earlier this month, Major was reported to be barely on speaking terms with Clinton after Washington defied British demands and gave an unrestricted U.S. visa to Gerry Adams, head of the political wing of the Irish Republican Army. </P>
<P> Earlier visas had banned Adams from raising funds. </P>
<P> The row over what London saw as intervention by Washington in the Northern Ireland peace process led to a week's delay before Major answered a telephone call from Clinton. </P>
<P> But officials from both Britain and the United States say any disagreement is now forgotten and the two countries are back in step. </P>
<P> ``It's no secret we had a difference of view,'' said one official traveling with Major on his two-day visit. </P>
<P> ``But that's water under the bridge... We're not looking backward on this. We're looking forward.'' </P>
<P> Officials say the row was blown out of proportion by the media and dismiss newspaper talk of the death of the ``special relationship'' as a ritual as much a part of meetings of U.SS and British leaders as flags and anthems. </P>
<P> Major's trip is billed as brisk and businesslike. </P>
<P> Major, making a high-profile arrival (Eds: 8:15 p.m. EDT) on the Concorde supersonic airliner, will meet the new Republican leadership in Congress and top administration officials before a working lunch with Clinton Tuesday. </P>
<P> U.S. and British officials have gone to great lengths to stress how close Washington and London are on key issues. </P>
<P> On Bosnia, where tension over Congressional pressure to lift an arms embargo on Muslim forces has faded, a senior U.S. official said the two were now ``more in tune.'' </P>
<P> On Iraq, British officials say London agrees with the U.S. administration on the need for Baghdad to implement all U.N. Persian Gulf war resolutions before the Iraqis can hope for an end to an international ban on their oil sales. </P>
<P> Even over Northern Ireland, the two sides are back in line, with Washington pressing Sinn Fein leader Adams to make progress on the surrender of weapons by the guerrilla IRA. </P>
<P> But nagging doubts over the once rock-solid alliance between Britain and the United States will not go away. </P>
<P> The personal chemistry that characterized the golden days when former prime minister Margaret Thatcher and then-president Ronald Reagan formed a partnership of mutual admiration is gone. </P>
<P> Major and Clinton began on a bad note after strategists from Major's Conservative Party advised Clinton's opponent, then-president George Bush, in their election tussle. </P>
<P> U.S. officials say Clinton does not bear grudges, but the warmth that marked the Reagan-Thatcher years has gone. Clinton's decision not to attend Britain's celebrations of the 50th anniversary of Nazi Germany's defeat was seen as a slight in London. </P>
<P> For Major, under pressure at home from opponents of the European Union in the Conservative Party, the stakes are high. </P>
<P> He badly needs a successful trip to boost his image. The last thing he wants is another wave of obituaries for the special relationship. </P>
