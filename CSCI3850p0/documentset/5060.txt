<DATELINE>LONDON, March 21 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Prime Minister John Major faces another tough parliamentary vote on Tuesday that will highlight the deep divisions on Europe which threaten to tear apart the ruling Conservative party. </P>
<P> The evening vote is on European Union farm price proposals. The main opposition Labour party is trying to embarrass the government by enticing nine rebel Conservatives to back an amendment attacking the government's failure to push for reform of the EU's controversial Common Agricultural Policy. </P>
<P> The rebels, who were expelled from or quit the parliamentary party after a row over Europe, are bitterly opposed to what they see as fraud, waste and political interference in Britain's affairs by Brussels bureaucrats. </P>
<P> But they are reluctant to vote with Labour, whose support of close ties with Europe they also oppose. </P>
<P> ``On the one hand we don't want to give the impression that we support the (government's) policy. On the other, we don't want to mislead people by voting for a Labour amendment,'' Sir Teddy Taylor, the unofficial leader of the rebels, said. </P>
<P> Taylor's comments appeared to confirm predictions that the rebels will abstain in the vote. Northern Irish Unionist members of parliament are also expected to abstain, giving Major a victory margin of around 16 votes. </P>
<P> ``It would be extraordinary if we managed to lose this vote,'' Agriculture Minister William Waldegrave said. </P>
<P> The vote comes as squabbling among Conservatives, in power since 1979, over Europe broke out into the open again despite efforts by Major and senior ministers to put a lid on it. </P>
<P> Major has taken a tougher line towards Brussels, banned cabinet ministers from publicly discussing Europe and tried to entice rebel Conservative members of parliament to back him. </P>
<P> Chancellor of the Exchequer (Finance Minister) Kenneth Clarke, one of the most pro-European ministers, was forced on Monday to hit back at right-wingers who accused him of undermining Major and made a thinly-veiled demand for his resignation. </P>
<P> Clarke, at a meeting of EU finance ministers in Brussels, blamed his right-wing critics for ``doing great harm to the Conservative party'' and for weakening the pound. </P>
<P> ``I don't think the few of my colleagues who keep trying to raise the temperature on our relations with Europe to great heights are doing a great deal of good to market confidence.'' </P>
<P> The critics immediately hit back, with one unnamed former minister telling the Financial Times it was now not a question of if but rather of when Clarke would resign. </P>
<P> Former party chairman Lord Tebbit launched a bitter attack on Clarke, saying that his pro-European policies would lead to the British parliament losing control of its own budget. </P>
<P> ``(The budget) would have been faxed to him from Frankfurt, written by the European Central Bank in collaboration with the European Commission,'' Tebbitt said. </P>
<P> Major, struggling to claw back Labour's huge lead in the opinion polls ahead of the next election due by mid-1997, suffered another blow on Monday with the death of a staunch ally. </P>
<P> Northern Ireland politician Sir James Kilfedder, the only member of parliament for the Ulster Popular Unionist Party, died of an apparent heart attack, aged 66. </P>
<P> Kilfedder's death will not significantly change the balance of power in parliament. But he was a loyal supporter of the prime minister, particularly in his drive to bring peace to Northern Ireland -- an initiative crucial to Major's re-election chances. </P>
