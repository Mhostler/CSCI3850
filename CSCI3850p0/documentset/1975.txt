<P>  For the past nine months, a Miami city commissioner has acted as an informal diplomat, exchanging letters with Haiti's coup leaders and expressing admiration for their devotion to their country. </P>
<P> Some Haitian activists in Miami Wednesday condemned the contact between the city's vice-mayor, Miller Dawkins, and the military leaders who toppled elected president Jean-Bertrand Aristide in a bloody coup three years ago. </P>
<P> ``It seems he has a special affinity for military dictators,'' said Roger Biamby, director of the Haitian Catholic Center. </P>
<P> Since last December, Dawkins sent letters and newspaper clippings to Haiti's now-deposed top leaders; Army chief Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, Lt. Col. Michel Francois, the feared police chief of Port-au-Prince, and president Marc Bazin. </P>
<P> ``Of all the people that I have talked with, you and I appear to be the only ones who are genuinely concerned about the (Haitian) children,'' Dawkins wrote in a Jan. 27 letter to Cedras. </P>
<P> In December, Cedras wrote that he would welcome a visit from the commissioner. </P>
<P> During a January meeting in Port-au-Prince, Dawkins gave Cedras a gift worth $275, and billed city taxpayers for the present and the flight, the Miami Herald reported. </P>
<P> In a letter to Francois, Dawkins said: ``I am aware of your patriotic love and devotion for your country and your desire to produce an atmosphere for mental growth of all Haitians.'' </P>
<P> Later in the same letter, Dawkins mentioned television footage of police beating unarmed civilians and asked him to please ``have the police show a little more restraint.'' </P>
<P> About three weeks ago, Dawkins told Cedras that the American public owed him a debt of gratitude. </P>
<P> Biamby called for a federal investigation of Dawkins' ties to the deposed Haitian leaders. </P>
<P> ``It's a bit frustrating to learn that a Miami city commissioner is engaging in foreign policy issues and supporting a regime that the U.S. government denounces as one of the most notorious criminal regimes in the world,'' he said. ``Was he paid by Cedras?'' </P>
