<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Former Philippine president Corazon Aquino Friday led thousands of people in a campaign to reject the senatorial bids of the son of the late ousted dictator Ferdinand Marcos and coup plotter Gregorio Honasan. </P>
<P> Hundreds of people marched through Manila's financial district carrying banners urging voters to reject Ferdinand ``Bongbong'' Marcos Jr and ``Gringo'' Honasan, who led three of six coup attempts while Aquino was president. </P>
<P> Marcos and Honasan are running for the Senate in May 8 elections. </P>
<P> The marchers, including former anti-Marcos activists, wore yellow clothes, the color associated with the ``people power'' protest movement that brought down Ferdinand Marcos in 1986. </P>
<P> Office workers showered confetti from tall buildings as the marchers passed by under the banner of a church-backed group called the ``Never Again Movement.'' </P>
<P> ``Ferdinand (Bongbong) Marcos Jr. is a son of a thief, coward and liar who plundered the economy and violated human rights with impunity,'' Aquino told the marchers. </P>
<P> Marcos Sr. died in exile in Hawaii in 1989. The rest of his family returned to the Philippines in 1991. </P>
<P> The government has accused Marcos Sr of stealing up to $5 billion from the Philippines, a charge the family denies. </P>
