<DATELINE>LAGUNA BEACH, Calif (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Actress Harriet Nelson, one of America's favorite television ``moms'' of the 1950s and 1960s, has died at her Laguna Beach home at the age of 80, a family spokesman said Monday. </P>
<P> Spokesman Joe Sutton said Nelson, who died Sunday, had recently been hospitalized for treatment of congestive heart failure in Laguna Beach, an oceanside city south of Los Angeles. </P>
<P> He said the actress, who appeared with her husband, Ozzie, on the long-running TV show, ``The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet,'' had suffered from emphysema for several years. </P>
<P> Her eldest son, David, 57, told reporters last week that his mother had not been in good spirits since the death of her husband 19 years ago. </P>
<P> Nelson lost her other son, former teen idol and rock 'n' roll star Rick Nelson, who was killed with six other members of his band in a plane crash in Texas, in 1985. </P>
<P> Americans tuned in to watch the antics of Nelson and her husband and their two sons in ``The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet,'' a situation comedy on ABC, from 1952 to 1966. </P>
<P> Nelson played the droll wife to her slightly bemused cardigan-wearing husband. </P>
<P> Behind the scenes, Ozzie Nelson was anything but bemused. He was the brains behind the production and oversaw every aspect of it. </P>
<P> After her husband's death in 1975 Nelson continued to work occasionally in television, appearing in just four TV films and one episode of the NBC show, ``The Father Dowling Mysteries,'' in 1989, her last television appearance. </P>
<P> Nelson was born Peggy Lou Snyder in Des Moines, Iowa, and moved to Hollywood in the 1930s, where she became a starlet but never quite the movie star she wanted to be. </P>
<P> After marrying Ozzie Nelson, then a popular bandleader, she joined his band as a singer and appeared on radio shows such as ``Believe It or Not,'' ``Seeing Stars,'' and ``Red Skelton.'' </P>
