<DATELINE>LONDON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Ireland's Labor Party leader Dick Spring pulled out of negotiations to form a new coalition government early Tuesday, Britain's Press Association news agency reported. </P>
<P> The agency quoted Spring as saying in a statement there was no basis for continuing discussions about a government with the Fianna Fail party. </P>
<P> The Labor leader said he had received inadequate explanations for Fianna Fail ministerial actions surrounding last month's appointment of former attorney-general Harry Whelehan as Irish High Court president. </P>
<P> Whelehan was forced to step down over his alleged bungling of a warrant for Norbertine priest wanted in a child sex abuse case and Albert Reynolds was forced to resign as prime minister over his appointment of Whelehan. </P>
<P> Ireland's government has been in turmoil since those events three weeks ago. </P>
<P> Talks between Labor and Fianna Fail on forming a new government were abruptly suspended Monday amid fresh controversy over the case. </P>
<P> Until Monday afternoon Fianna Fail leader Bertie Ahern, the acting finance minister, had seemed certain to become prime minister with Spring as his deputy. </P>
<P> The collapse of Labor-Fianna Fail talks came just hours before a session of the Dublin parliament had been expected to elect a new prime minister later Tuesday. </P>
<P> A further delay in forming a new Irish government would slow the Northern Ireland peace process, which enters a crucial phase Friday with the first official talks between Britain and the IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein. </P>
<P> The chances of Labor and Fianna Fail clinching an agreement seemed remote after allegations that Fianna Fail had tried to cover up some of the background in the sex abuse case. </P>
<P> The controversy was stirred by a report in the Irish Times which suggested Reynolds and his Fianna Fail party had misled parliament over the conduct of Whelehan. </P>
<P> Labor objected to Whelehan's promotion by Reynolds to the post of High Court President because of a seven-month delay by the Attorney-General's office in dealing with extradition warrants for a suspected pedophile priest. </P>
<P> But the Irish Times said Reynolds had asked Whelehan to resign as High Court President the day before he went to parliament and publicly exonerated Whelehan from any blame in the case of the priest, Father Brendan Smyth. </P>
<P> Whelehan defended his office against charges of incompetence by saying that the Smyth case was the first of its kind and took legal officials a long time to deal with because of its uniqueness and the fact the crimes were committed years before. </P>
<P> But the Irish Times said Reynolds and other Fianna Fail ministers knew before defending Whelehan that there had been a legal precedent and that Whelehan's explanation was inadequate. </P>
<P> Its implication was that Reynolds and his cabinet colleagues had tried to cover up the fact that Whelehan's office had bungled the affair. </P>
<P> Whelehan quit as High Court President shortly after Reynolds ended his two-year permiership. </P>
<P> A spokesman for Reynolds, currently acting prime minister and in Budapest for the European security conference, said the report was inaccurate. </P>
<P> The main opposition party, Fine Gael, tried in vain to forge a coalition with Labor, whose 32 parliamentary seats give it the balance of power. </P>
