<P>  A Jewish leader criticized Poland's Roman Catholic Primate Cardinal Jozef Glemp Tuesday for saying equal homage should be paid to all people killed at the Auschwitz death camp. </P>
<P> Kalman Sultanik, a vice-president of the World Jewish Congress, said the former Nazi death camp was a shrine to the victims of the Holocaust and Glemp's comments in a homily Sunday were out of step with the times. </P>
<P> ``I am shocked by him saying all victims are equal. I regret that when the whole world is trying for better relations he is back to the old words, the old tricks about anti-Semitism,'' Sultanik told Reuters by telephone. </P>
<P> ``He is falsifying history and twisting the truth. He is going back to being the old cold war warrior on anti-Semitism,'' he said. </P>
<P> More than a million people were killed at Auschwitz, in Oswiecim in southern Poland. The vast majority were Jews and the world Jewish community regards it as a unique monument to the six million victims of the Holocaust. </P>
<P> A dispute over the presence of a Carmelite convent at the former death camp had long soured relations between Poland's Catholic church and Jewish leaders but the closure of the convent last year was part of a gradual improvement in ties. </P>
<P> At a commmemoration Sunday on the 12th anniversary of the canonisation of Saint Maksymilian Kolbe who died at Auschwitz, Glemp said all victims should be remembered equally. </P>
<P> ``We will not contend who has more martyrs and we pay homage to those who are more numerous but martyrdom is universal and is to be revered by everybody,'' PAP news agency quoted Glemp as saying. </P>
<P> Sultanik, in Poland for meetings to prepare for the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz in January 1945, made clear Glemp's remarks disappointed many Jews. </P>
<P> ``It is a particular shame to hear these comments as we prepare for January's anniversary,'' he said. </P>
