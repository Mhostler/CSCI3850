<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Republicans delivered a major political blow to President Clinton Wednesday, forcing House of Representatives leaders to delay a final vote on a sweeping GATT trade treaty until late November. </P>
<P> Admitting that they simply did not have the votes to bring up the treaty -- one of Clinton's top priorities -- before crucial November elections, Democratic leaders agreed to a deal with Republicans that could allow a procedural vote on GATT Wednesday night but delay a final vote for over a month. </P>
<P> ``You had a significant body on both sides that didn't want to fuss with it,'' said House Republican Leader Robert Michel of Illinois, who admitted he was surprised by the depth of Republican opposition. </P>
<P> Top Republican and Democratic House leaders sent a joint letter to Clinton pledging to work together to pass the GATT pact and requesting a delay until November 29. </P>
<P> Although the Senate has already delayed a vote until December 1, due to delaying tactics by South Carolina Democratic Senator Ernest Hollings, Democrats had hoped to salvage a partial victory for the president by passing the measure in the House. </P>
<P> ``As strong supporters of an expanding economy through free trade, we believe the GATT legislation currently before the Congress should become law,'' the letter said. </P>
<P> ``The Senate decision to postpone the vote has quite frankly undermined our ability to guarantee strong bipartisan support for the effort in the House at this time,'' it said. </P>
<P> U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said he was ''delighted'' by the letter, saying ``you couldn't ask for a stronger measure of support.'' He added that the delay would not make a substantive difference. </P>
<P> The key to the House delay was Tuesday's surprise decision by Republican Whip Newt Gingrich, who had been working to round up votes for the legislation, to oppose a special rule setting procedures for debating the GATT bill. </P>
<P> Because the House is set to adjourn October 7, defeat of the rule would kill chances for a pre-election GATT vote. </P>
<P> For their part, Democrats late Wednesday had less than 170 votes for the rule, far short of the 218 needed for passage. </P>
<P> Democrats tried to meet Gingrich's demands -- holding a special hearing on controversial telecommunications provisions of the GATT bill -- but the Republican leader refused to budge or even tell Democrats how many GOP votes were possible. </P>
<P> It wasn't supposed to be this way. Unlike the North American Free Trade Agreement, which had stiff opposition from a variety of industries the GATT treaty had strong support from pro-Republican business groups. </P>
<P> Politically, some Democrats were in trouble due to labor, environment and consumer concerns about the pact. </P>
<P> But Republicans were clearly nervous about opposition from Ross Perot's United We Stand political organization and saw no reason to hand the President a pre-election victory, especially since the Senate had delayed a vote. </P>
<P> ``Obviously he (Gingrich) thinks the Perot factor is significant in this election and could make the differnce in a number of districts,'' said Arizona Republican Jim Kolbe. </P>
<P> Up to the last minute the White House was urging Democrats to proceed with a vote. But many lawmakers said the administration bungled the debate by not submitting GATT to Congress until the very end of the session. </P>
<P> The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade pact would effectively re-write the rules of world commerce. Its approval by member governments last December was hailed as a major economic breakthrough. The administration estimates that the agreement would reduce worldwide tariffs by $750 billion. </P>
<P> In an effort to reassure Republicans, the House Energy and Commerce Committee held a hastily called hearing Wednesday on the so-called ``pioneer preference'' provisions of the bill. </P>
<P> Tucked away in the massive legislation is a provision to require The Washington Post Co, Cox Enterprises and Omnipoint Communications to pay 85 percent of the cost of federal licenses for state of the art telecommunications services. </P>
<P> GATT opponents say the provision would provide the companies with an up to $2 billion government windfall. </P>
<P> But Democrats say the companies would have received the licenses for free under Bush administration rules and claim that forcing them to pay 85 percent of the cost raised over $400 million to make up for lost tariffs under the GATT pact. </P>
<P> ``Some scabby people are opposed to it for their own corrupt reasons and the taxpayers will lose $500 million,'' said an angry John Dingell, chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee Committee, which regulates communications. </P>
