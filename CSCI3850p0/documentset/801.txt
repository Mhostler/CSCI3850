<DATELINE>SANAA, Yemen (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The United Nations Tuesday appealed for $22 million in aid for Yemen to cover urgent food and sanitation needs and help clear mines left from the two-month civil war. </P>
<P> The appeal, based on a report by a U.N. team which visited Yemen in July, said 375,000 people were suffering ``temporary displacement, destruction of vital infrastructure, lack of food, soaring prices of basic commodities and limited water supplies.'' </P>
<P> U.N. spokesman in Sanaa, Nejib Friji, told a news conference the United Nations hoped member states would ``respond positively, promptly and generously to the emergency human needs'' in Yemen. </P>
<P> The war in Yemen, which started on May 4, ended when Sanaa government forces crushed a separatist breakaway state in the south and captured its declared capital Aden on July 7. </P>
<P> Friji said the appeal ``covers only a part and rather a short period of the needs of the Yemeni population.'' </P>
<P> He said the aid would be used to cover six months of urgent health and food needs, restoration of water supplies and sewerage, and to set up a de-mining database with information on numbers, types and locations of land mines. </P>
<P> The aid did not cover the cost of repairing infrastructure damaged by the war, he said. </P>
<P> President Ali Abdullah Saleh has estimated Yemen's war losses at $7.5 billion. </P>
