<P>  One of the biggest bird's eggs ever laid -- from a now extinct Madagascan Great Elephant Bird -- sold at auction in London Thursday for $25,060. </P>
<P> The bird, which resembled a giant ostrich, became extinct well before the turn of the 19th century. </P>
<P> The egg was about 300 years old and the owner was a French biologist. </P>
<P> The 15-inch-long egg was bought by Museon, a museum in The Hague in the Netherlands, where it will go on display in an exhibition about island evolution, said Bonhams auctioneers. </P>
