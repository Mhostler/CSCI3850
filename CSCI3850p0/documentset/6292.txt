<P>  A former high school wrestling champion who allegedly raped two teen-age girls a decade ago and then fled overseas before trial entered a not guilty plea in a Connecticut court Thursday. </P>
<P> Alex Kelly, 27, was charged in Stamford Superior Court with three counts of first-degree sexual assault and two counts of first-degree kidnapping. In an arraignment hearing, the judge set a $1 million bail. </P>
<P> He returned to the United States Wednesday night after spending years in the Bahamas, Europe, Scandinavia and elsewhere. He surrendered in Switzerland in January because he believed he had been discovered, authorities said. </P>
<P> Kelly allegedly raped the two teen-agers in February 1986 within four days of each other. The victims alleged that he raped, choked and threatened them. </P>
<P> Officials said in court today that Kelly also allegedly raped a 13-year-old girl while living as a fugitive in the Bahamas. </P>
<P> His parents, Joseph and Melanie Kelly, said they would put up their home in the wealthy Connecticut community of Darien as security to cover their son's bond. If bond is posted, court officials said Kelly would be under house arrest and subject to electronic surveillance. </P>
<P> His lawyer, Thomas Puccio, said Kelly returned to the United States because he wanted to come home and looked forward to having ``his day in court.'' </P>
