<P>  Four Pan-American Games swimming records went tumbling on the first day of action in the pool as U.S. dominance was challenged Sunday. </P>
<P> Gustavo Borges of Brazil, Angel Martino of the United States, Joanne Malar of Canada and the U.S. women's 4x200 meters freestyle relay team all broke Games records on their way to winning gold. </P>
<P> Borges produced the most impressive performance as he won the men's 200 meters freestyle, even though the event is not his strongest. </P>
<P> The Brazilian, an Olympic silver medalist in the freestyle 100 meters which he prefers, led from the start and finished in one minute 48.49 seconds, beating the previous record of 1:49.67 set by American Eric Diehl in 1991. American Gregory Burgess was second Sunday in 1:51.69. </P>
<P> ``Everything went well from the start,'' Borges said. ``In the first 50 meters I felt I was going to win. The final stretch left room for improvement but I'm not going to complain. I feel I could have knocked another couple of tenths (of seconds) off if I had finished better.'' </P>
<P> Borges added that he may now reconsider his decision to quit the 200 meters later this year. ``In the last four years, I had just stagnated in the 200 meters,'' he said. </P>
<P> Canada's Malar set her record in the women's 400 meters individual medley to show that the United States, aiming to beat their last Pan-Am Games total of 24 swimming gold medals, would not have everything their own way. </P>
<P> Malar's time of 4:43.64 smashed the previous record of 4:46.05, which was set by American Tracy Caulkins and had stood since 1979. </P>
<P> And in another blow to American dominance, Mexico's Fernando Platas won the gold in the men's three metre springboard diving, quickly shattering the U.S. attempt at a clean sweep of the six gold medals up for grabs in the sport. </P>
<P> U.S. swimmers still managed three gold medals, however. </P>
<P> Angel Martino and fellow-American Amy van Dyken both beat the Games record of 56.10 seconds held by Costa Rica's Sylvia Poll in a thrilling finish to the women's 100 meters free. </P>
<P> Martino, Olympic gold medalist in the 400 meters relay in 1992, finished in 55.62 seconds, just three tenths of a second ahead of Van Dyken, who had led at the start. ``I couldn't believe I came so close to beating her,'' said Van Dyken. </P>
<P> The United States also won the 800 meters relay in a Games record time of 8:07.30 while Seth van Neerden won the men's 100 meters breaststroke in 1:02.48. </P>
