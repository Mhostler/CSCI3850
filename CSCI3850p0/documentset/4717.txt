<P>  China's parliament will ignore petitions from dissidents deprived by law of their political rights and its spokesman raised suspicions Saturday over their motives in making public their appeals. </P>
<P> In another matter, a large group of Chinese citizens sent a letter Saturday to the National People's Congress, or parliament, demanding that Japan compensate victims of its 1937-45 invasion of China -- and insisting that parliament establish a special committee to ask for reparations. </P>
<P> In a rare display of courage, prominent dissidents and intellectuals had submitted four other petitions in the past week to the legislature demanding political rights. </P>
<P> Their demands to parliament, which begins its annual session Sunday, included a constitutional democracy and an independent judiciary. </P>
<P> ``All citizens have the right to criticize or raise suggestions to state organs and personnel,'' parliament spokesman Zhou Jue told a news conference. </P>
<P> ``But for those people deprived of their political rights according to law, they have no such rights,'' he said when asked if the rubber-stamp body would consider the petitions. </P>
<P> Several of the dissidents who have tried to present petitions to the parliament this week are free on parole from lengthy prison terms, and are thus denied their political rights. Others, though, have completed their terms or have never been charged with offenses. </P>
<P> ``Long before these people mailed their petitions, they disseminated their ideas and suggestions to overseas news media to play up this issue,'' Zhou charged. </P>
<P> ``It is not difficult to see their real motives,'' he said, but did not elaborate on what those motives might be. </P>
<P> Dissidents, long chastened by extended prison terms and intrusive police surveillance, burst into a rare flurry of activity this week with appeals to parliament demanding human rights, judicial independence and an end to police powers of virtually unlimited detention without charge. </P>
<P> The group demanding Japanese compensation for war crimes submitted Saturday its fifth petition in as many years, signed this time by 600 well-known intellectuals and 12,463 victims of the Japanese invasion. In 1971, China formally renounced any claim to war reparations. </P>
<P> Activists and intellectuals bombarded the parliament with similar, abortive petitions last year. </P>
<P> The legislature rarely defies the Communist Party. While Zhou described the body, which has nearly 3,000 delegates, as the ``organ of supreme power'' he hinted at its true role when he said it operated under party leadership. </P>
<P> The unusually bold actions were timed to precede the start Sunday of the assembly session, a time when the party is at pains to show it welcomes open discussion and listens to public opinion -- and when it may be less likely to muzzle its critics. </P>
