<P>  The crew of the space shuttle Atlantis, undeterred by the loss of a key instrument, continued Monday to study the Earth's protective ozone layer. </P>
<P> The six astronauts, divided into two teams, were operating a suite of onboard instruments around the clock as the 11-day mission neared its midpoint. </P>
<P> Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration downplayed the loss of the device, part of a $120 million onboard observatory called the Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science, or ATLAS. </P>
<P> The six other ATLAS instruments continued to supply scientists with valuable data. The failed instrument was designed to measure airborne chlorine monoxide, a known cause of ozone depletion in the atmosphere. </P>
<P> NASA's Tim Miller said data produced by ATLAS had confirmed the size of a seasonal ozone hole above the Antarctic that has been measured on similar shuttle missions and by unmanned satellites. </P>
<P> ``Those are certainly very dramatic results,'' Atlantis mission specialist Scott Parazynski said. </P>
<P> Also Monday, French mission specialist Jean-Francois Clervoy received a phone call from European Space Agency officials who congratulated him on becoming the fifth astronaut from France. </P>
<P> Clervoy on Friday deployed a free-flying, reusable German satellite which is making eight days of companion atmosphere measurements. It will be retrieved by the shuttle on Saturday and returned to Earth. </P>
