<DATELINE>GEORGE TOWN, Cayman Islands (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Former Peruvian President Alan Garcia Perez and other former high-ranking officials of that country have won a court decision preventing the Cayman government from releasing financial records. </P>
<P> The decision issued Wednesday by the Cayman Islands court of appeals overturned a lower court ruling that would have allowed the Cayman government to release financial records on Worldwide Financial Holdings Ltd. </P>
<P> Peru's government is seeking the documents as part of an investigation into possible bribery involving a contract awarded during Garcia's presidency. </P>
<P> Charles Guin, who represents Worldwide Financial Holdings, argued in court that releasing confidential financial information is prohibited by the Cayman Islands constitution. The British colony is one of the world's foremost offshore banking centers with more than 540 registered financial institutions, mainly because of its strict financial secrecy laws. </P>
<P> Attorneys for the Peruvian government claimed the records were needed as part of their investigation into whether bribes were paid to Worldwide in a train contract awarded during Garcia's presidency. </P>
<P> Garcia is reportedly living in Venezuela. </P>
