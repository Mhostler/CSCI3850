<DATELINE>JACKSON, Ga (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A 39-year-old man was put to death in Georgia's electric chair Wednesday afternoon for the kidnapping, rape and murder of a 12-year-old girl in 1979. </P>
<P> Darrell Gene Devier was pronounced dead at 1:28 p.m. EDT , eight minutes after electricity was applied to his body. </P>
<P> ``If there's ever been a case for capital punishment, it is this case,'' Georgia Pardons and Paroles Board chairman Wayne Garner said Monday in rejecting a request for clemency. </P>
<P> Devier was convicted of murdering Mary Frances Stoner after she stepped off a school bus in northwest Georgia. He lured her into his car, took her to a wooded area, raped her, choked her and crushed her skull with a 50-pound rock.  The execution was originally scheduled for Monday evening, but was delayed by the U.S. Supreme Court while it considered Devier's appeals. </P>
<P> Devier offered no final statement after he was strapped into the chair made of Georgia pine. When asked if he wanted a minister to pray for him, he replied:''I'll take all I can get when it comes to that.'' </P>
<P> The execution was the 20th in Georgia since use of the electric chair resumed in 1983, and was the second in just over a month. British-born murderer Nicholas Lee Ingram was executed April 7. </P>
<P> Members of Stoner's family gathered outside the prison grounds while Devier was executed. The girl's uncle, Vince Stewart, told reporters ``we are relieved this is over.'' </P>
<P> ``Not once in the last 15 3/8 years did the killer ever say he was sorry or try to apologize,'' Stewart said. </P>
