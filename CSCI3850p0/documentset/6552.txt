<P>  Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, hoping to ease nearly half a century of strained relations with Sweden, has condemned the 1948 murder by Jewish guerrillas of U.N. mediator Count Folke Bernadotte. </P>
<P> ``We vigorously and deeply condemn the murder of Count Bernadotte,'' a spokesman for Peres quoted him as saying at a ceremony in the count's honour in Tel Aviv late on Sunday attended by Swedish Deputy Prime Minister Mona Sahlin. </P>
<P> ``We hope this ceremony will help in healing the wound,'' Peres said. </P>
<P> Bernadotte, a Swedish count appointed to mediate in the 1948 Middle East war, was assassinated in September of that year by the Stern Gang whose leaders included Yitzhak Shamir, later an Israeli prime minister. </P>
<P> The Stern Gang opposed Bernadotte's policies, including the internationalisation of Jerusalem. Bernadotte helped save Jews from the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two. </P>
<P> The Foreign Ministry denied Israeli media reports that Sahlin, due to leave the Jewish state on Monday after a one-day visit, had cut short her trip when Israel objected to her visiting PLO headquarters in Jerusalem. </P>
<P> ``Those reports are wild exaggerations,'' a spokesman said. He said Israel had made known as it always did to visiting foreign officials that it would frown on their visiting the PLO's Orient House in Arab East Jerusalem. </P>
<P> Israel and the Palestinians both lay claim to East Jerusalem. The sides are to negotiate the status of the holy city in final-settlement talks due to begin in May 1996. </P>
<P> The ministry spokesman said Sahlin, who had planned a longer visit, adjusted her programme already before leaving Sweden to include only the Sunday ceremony for Bernadotte. </P>
