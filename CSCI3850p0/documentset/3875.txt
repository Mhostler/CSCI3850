<P>  South Korea said Saturday it hopes the lifting of the U.S. embargo on trade with North Korea will help open the reclusive Stalinist regime further and improve inter-Korean dialog, which has soured over the North's nuclear program. </P>
<P> ``Further easing of economic sanctions will be subject to progress on issues agreed in Geneva, including inter-Korean dialog,'' said Chang Ki-ho, Seoul's foreign ministry spokesman. </P>
<P> The United States announced plans Friday to ease some trade restrictions on the North under a landmark nuclear accord the two nations signed in Geneva last October. </P>
<P> Chang said South Korea hopes the relaxation of trade curbs will help the North Koreans open their country to the outside world and implement the Washington-Pyongyang agreement in a sincere manner. </P>
<P> He said the easing of sanctions represented only initial steps in response to the North's freezing of its nuclear program, which could lead to production of atomic bombs. </P>
<P> In the Geneva deal, Pyongyang agreed with the United States to freeze its nuclear reactor program in exchange for Western aid for nuclear technology and steps toward diplomatic recognition. </P>
<P> A key part of the deal is a U.S. promise to provide light water reactors -- less suitable for making bomb-grade plutonium -- to replace the North's existing graphite reactors. </P>
<P> Seoul's foreign ministry officials said Seoul and Washington would closely consult on the scope and timing of a further relaxation of the trade embargo in line with Pyongyang's implementation of the agreement. </P>
<P> The U.S. officials said Friday's decision would allow the first direct telephone links between the United States and the North and permit U.S. businesses to import North Korean magnesite, a rare metal used to coat the insides of steel industry blast furnaces. </P>
<P> Officials also said U.S. news organizations will now be permitted to open offices in North Korea and American visitors will be allowed to make unlimited credit card purchases associated with personal travel. </P>
<P> In addition, North Korea will be permitted to use the American banking system to clear financial transactions not beginning or terminating in the United States. </P>
<P> Also, U.S. firms will be considered for participation in the $4.5 billion U.S.-led project to provide North Korea with new nuclear technology and alternative energy supplies, officials said. </P>
