<DATELINE>MELBOURNE (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Second seed Andre Agassi showed no mercy in knocking out local hero Patrick Rafter to maintain the American charge into the Australian Open quarterfinals Monday. </P>
<P> Agassi became the fifth American to reach the last eight of the year's first Grand Slam event with a supercharged 6-3, 6-4, 6-0 victory in front of a packed center court which accorded him the unfamiliar role of the villain. </P>
<P> However, Rafter, the only Australian left in the tournament, drew little inspiration from all the vocal support and could not match the speed and court craft of the electrifying American. </P>
<P> ``It certainly seems that every time I step on the court it is getting better and better,'' said Agassi, who has yet to drop a set in four matches. </P>
<P> The Las Vegan, with his piratical bandana, earring and beach shorts, achieved his victory with almost nonchalent ease, in total contrast to the protracted demise of sixth seed Stefan Edberg. </P>
<P> Edberg suffered his earliest exit in more than a decade at the Australian Open as unseeded American Aaron Krickstein joined compatriots Agassi, world No. 1 Pete Sampras, Jim Courier and Michael Chang in the last eight. </P>
<P> Edberg, who has reached at least the last eight in Melbourne on every visit save his first as a 16-year-old in 1982, won the first two sets only to see Krickstein conjure a 6-7, 5-7, 6-4, 7-6, 6-4 triumph from near-certain defeat. </P>
<P> It abruptly ended a brief European fightback led by Russia's Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Dutchman Jacco Eltingh who earlier in the day prevented Todd Martin and Patrick McEnroe from joining the long list of American title contenders. </P>
<P> While American men were dominant, two 21-year-olds were giving the women's quarters a multinational flavor. </P>
<P> Mexico's Angelica Gavaldon brought off the major upset of the fourth round by ousting third-seed Jana Novotna who called her 7-5, 6-0 humiliation ``a horrible match.'' </P>
<P> Japan's Naoko Sawamatsu was another unexpected winner, beating 11th seed Mary Joe Fernandez, 6-4, 7-6, to reach her first Grand Slam quarterfinal just days after her family home was destroyed in her country's earthquake. </P>
<P> Sawamatsu now plays top seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario after the Spaniard dismissed the Czech Republic's Karina Habsudova in straight sets. Gavaldon meets another unseeded player, American Marianne Werdel Witmeyer. </P>
<P> But Monday's spotlight was again on Agassi who now has to beat Kafelnikov to stay on track for his second successive Grand Slam title after his dramatic unseeded capture of the U.S. Open title last September. </P>
<P> Agassi said he played ``almost flawlessly'' in the final 21-minute set against the 21st-ranked Rafter during which he conceded only eight points. </P>
<P> ``My matches have been rather consistent, but now it's going to shift a little bit...that's when I want to see myself move to another level,'' he said. </P>
<P> The 45th-ranked Krickstein was not expected to occupy a quarterfinal place but his performance against Edberg left him on the brink of only his second Grand Slam semifinal. </P>
<P> Despite turning an aged 29 last week, Edberg was convinced he could add a seventh Grand Slam title to his collection and it took a dubious line-call at a crucial stage in the fourth set to undermine his challenge. </P>
<P> A desperate Krickstein had already fought back from 5-2 down to 5-4 when he sent a lob over the Swede's head which was judged to be in by the baseline official. </P>
<P> Had the decision gone the other way, Edberg would have had match point and the world No. 7 was uncharacteristically annoyed afterwards. </P>
<P> ``I didn't think it was out, I knew it was out,'' said the normally unflappable Edberg. ``The guy's sitting in sunglasses and the umpire's too afraid to overrule. You just have to accept it and hope maybe it's in your favor next time.'' </P>
<P> In the fifth set, Edberg hauled Krickstein back to 4-4 from 3-0 down, but fell short. </P>
<P> ``That's probably some of the best tennis I've seen him play,'' Edberg said. ``Maybe I should have won the match but he managed to come up with the points at the right time.'' </P>
<P> Krickstein will now face Eltingh, ranked 24th in the world, in a quarterfinal match-up far removed from the seeding committee's visions of an Edberg-Boris Becker showdown. </P>
<P> The Dutchman had his ankle strapped midway through the first set but still hammered 34 aces past McEnroe in another fluctuating five-setter which he finally won, 6-4, 6-4, 6-7, 5-7, 6-4 after more than three and a half hours. </P>
<P> Eltingh, 24, is now looking forward to his first Grand Slam quarterfinal, as is 10th seed Kafelnikov after thrashing last year's losing finalist Martin, 6-1, 6-4, 6-2. </P>
<P> The Russian has rocketed almost 100 places to the fringe of the world's top 10 in the past 12 months. </P>
<P> ``The tournament is just starting for me,'' he said. ``I know exactly what I need to do, but I was struggling a little bit today with my serve,'' said Kafelnikov, who knows he must have all his weapons firing. </P>
<P> ``If I do the same thing against Agassi, he's going to make beefsteak of me Wednesday.'' </P>
<P> The beaten Martin said Kafelnikov was on the rise. </P>
<P> ``Everyone I know thinks he's going to get better,'' said Martin. ``He is a threat to everyone.'' </P>
