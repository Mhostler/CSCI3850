<P>  Burundi's new prime minister has named a government charged with rebuilding trust between Hutus and Tutsis and ending ethnic conflict. </P>
<P> State radio said Antoine Nduwayo, a Tutsi appointed last week by Hutu President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, named seven new ministers Wednesday night and said consultations for the commerce and industry portfolio were continuing. </P>
<P> Nduwayo called on the people of the small central African state to support the new government which he acknowledged was largely the same as that of his predecessor, Anatole Kanyenkiko. </P>
<P> ``I call upon you to trust the new government and help it extricate our country from its problems,'' he said. </P>
<P> He added: ``As you know, the new government has been formed at a time when the country has many problems and there is no peace. For it to carry out its duties successfully, all Burundians must support it.'' </P>
<P> Nduwayo appointed Gabriel Sinarinzi as new minister of interior and public security, Gerard Niyibigira as minister of planning, development and reconstruction and Ignace Bankamwabo as minister of territorial development. </P>
<P> Claudine Matuturu was named as minister for the return of the displaced and refugees, Bernard Barandereka as minister of public works, Innocent Nimpagaritse as minister of posts and telecommunications and Vincent Ndikumasabo as minister for the civil service. </P>
<P> Nduwayo took over from Kanyenkiko, another Tutsi, who was forced out by his own Uprona party for refusing to support a successful campaign in December to oust the Hutu speaker of parliament, accused of being an ethnic warmonger. </P>
<P> The opposition controls the premiership under the pact known as the Convention and organised a week-long strike that paralyzsed the capital and much of the country from February 14 to force Kanyenkiko to step down. </P>
<P> Uprona and the army are both dominated by the minority Tutsi tribe. </P>
<P> Nduwayo asked Burundians to give the new team time before judging its performance. </P>
<P> ``Our request is that the new government is given time and people should observe how it behaves. No government lacking the support of Burundians can succeed.'' </P>
<P> Burundi has been plagued by fears of a repetition of the ethnic slaughter between Tutsis and Hutus that tore apart neighboring Rwanda last year. </P>
<P> Over a week ago, Ntibantunganya warned that di risked plunging into ethnic bloodshed worse than Rwanda's if militant groups on either side were not quickly isolated. </P>
<P> Bujumbura has been under a dusk-to-dawn curfew since December while strikes and violence have become the order of the day in the city. </P>
<P> Burundi and Rwanda have the same ethnic mix. Hutu soldiers and militiamen slaughtered between 500,000 and a million people in Rwanda last year before Tutsi-led rebels won a three-month civil war. </P>
