<P>  Paramount leader Deng Xiaoping is no longer able to exercise day-to-day leadership of China or make decisions on policy issues because of poor health, authoritative sources said Wednesday. </P>
<P> The sources, who have access to wide-ranging intelligence reports, said for about the past two months Deng had played no significant role in the leadership of the country. </P>
<P> They said poor health forced Deng to withdraw from day-to-day leadership for several months but he was still able to issue occasional edicts on policy matters like the future of Hong Kong or economic reform. </P>
<P> ``But in the last couple of months he has not even been able to do this,'' one of the sources said. </P>
<P> The sources said a ``big team'' of doctors was treating the 90-year-old Deng, who has ruled China since 1978, for various illnesses. </P>
<P> ``A big team of experts is trying to keep him going,'' the sources said. ``He could survive for just days or for months.'' </P>
<P> The sources said there were no signs so far of any one individual emerging as the paramount successor to Deng and the country was basically in the hands of ``five or six'' key people. </P>
<P> Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported Tuesday that Deng's medical team believed they could keep him alive for ``at least three to four months.'' </P>
<P> The newspaper quoted Beijing sources as saying Deng's medical team of more than 20 specialists in Western and Chinese medicine, had been renamed earlier this month ``an emergency rescue group.'' </P>
<P> The Beijing-stationed group keeps watch over the senior leader on a 24-hour basis, according to the Post. </P>
<P> Recent speculation about Deng's health was sparked when one of his daughters told The New York Times that he was deteriorating steadily. </P>
<P> ``His health declines day by day,'' said the daughter, Deng Rong. ``People have to understand that at this point, he's 90 years old, an old man. And someday there will be a day when he passes away.'' </P>
<P> Officially, Beijing takes a much more cautiously optimistic line on the health of the architect of China's reform process. ``For a man in his 90s, Comrade Deng Xiaoping is, generally speaking, in good health,'' a Foreign Ministry spokesman said. </P>
