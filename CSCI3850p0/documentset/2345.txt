<P>  A federal grand jury has handed down more charges against three former top executives of American Honda Motor Co, the U.S. Attorney's office here announced Tuesday. </P>
<P> The new indictment returned by the grand jury in Concord, New Hampshire alleges that Stanley Cardiges, a former senior vice president and former members of the American Honda board of directors, John Billmyer and Dennis Josleyn were paid $1.5 million in kickbacks in connection with a nationwide bribery scheme involving dealerships of Honda cars. </P>
<P> The charges stem from a nationwide Justice Department investigation began in 1989 that alleges between $11 million and $12 million in bribes were paid between 1979 and 1992 in the form of cash, expensive cars, jewelry and real estate. </P>
<P> As a result of the probe, following a complaint by a Honda dealer in Concord, 18 people have so far been charged with such crimes as racketeering, mail fraud, conspiracy, obstruction of justice and witness tampering. Apart from Cardiges, Billmyer and Josleyn, 15 of the accused have pleaded guilty, Connolly said. </P>
<P> American Honda has said it is outraged by the criminal activities described in the indictments which have harmed the company and cost it millions of dollars. </P>
<P> The new indictment further charges that Cardiges, Billmyer and Josleyn awarded new Honda and Acura dealerships to ``straw'' or nominee owners in order to conceal the fraudulent kickback scheme and the identities of individuals who allegedly paid bribes. </P>
<P> It also charges Cardiges with witness tampering by attempting to persuade an informant to lie to FBI agents conducting the investigation. The charge adds to a prior accusation against Cardiges of mail fraud. </P>
<P> Cardiges faces a maximum sentence of 40 years on all charges, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Connolly. </P>
<P> Josleyn is also charged with mail fraud and faces a maximum sentence of 30 years. Billmyer faces five years in confinement. </P>
<P> The three will be rearraigned on the new charges Nov. 18 in U.S. District Court in Concord. A trial date is expected to be set at that time, Connolly said. </P>
<P> The superseding indictment deletes charges in the original indictment against former executives David Pedersen and Damien Budnick, who have since pleaded guilty. </P>
