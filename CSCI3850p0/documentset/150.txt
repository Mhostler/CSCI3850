<P>  Two top officials in Nelson Mandela's government are fighting over who controls housing in South Africa's richest and most powerful province, the Sunday Times reported. </P>
<P> The paper said Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging province premier Tokyo Sexwale and national Housing Minister Joe Slovo had produced conflicting plans for delivering houses. </P>
<P> Mandela's ANC-led government has made housing a priority in its reconstruction and development program to improve living conditions for blacks deprived of good housing during decades of apartheid rule. </P>
<P> The paper said Sexwale had rejected Slovo's plan, saying it would only provide ``corrugated iron shacks'' for the homeless in his PWV province. </P>
<P> The ANC government of PWV province, which embraces the commercial and industrial heartland around Johannesburg and its teeming black townships, is also under pressure to deliver election pledges on housing. </P>
<P> The Sunday Times reported that Slovo, national chairman of the South African Communist Party, slammed Sexwale's plan as ``chancing the housing future of the country in the hands of one construction company.'' </P>
<P> He has commissioned experts to evaluate Sexwale's plan. </P>
<P> Slovo and Sexwale could not be reached for comment, but analysts said their outburst was the first sign of cracks in Mandela's government of national unity, formed after South Africa's all-race elections in April. </P>
<P> The paper quoted Sexwale as saying nothing would stop him from going ahead with the plan. </P>
<P> ``We wish to make it unambiguously apparent that nothing will deviate us from the plans that we have set about to deliver low-cost homes,'' Sexwale told the Sunday Times. </P>
<P> Slovo's plan, drafted in consultation with housing pressure groups, unions and civic associations, said 50,000 homes would be built across the country this year. By the year 2001, 300,000 would have been constructed. </P>
<P> ``The policy of the National Housing Ministry remains unchanged. We are not repeating the old serviced site approach. We are going to build proper houses,'' Slovo said. </P>
<P> Sexwale's plan, drawn up by a major construction company, proposed that R750 million ($205 million) from taxpayers and R4.5 billion ($1.5 billion) from insurance companies be used to finance 150,000 houses a year in the PWV only. </P>
<P> Mandela's government has promised to build one million houses during the next five years, but politicians and political analysts say the ANC will not be able to fulfill its election promises. </P>
<P> Its housing policy, they add, will cost five times the projected amount of R510 million ($142 million) for all nine regions. </P>
