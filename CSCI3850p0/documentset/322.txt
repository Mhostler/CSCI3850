<P>  A tape recording of an adolescent John Lennon belting out an Elvis Presley number is expected to fetch up to $231,000 at a sale in September, Sotheby's auctioneers said Wednesday. </P>
<P> On the tape, Lennon, who as one of the Beatles revolutionized popular music in the 1960s, is singing with his original group the Quarrymen. The day of the recording is the day he first met fellow Beatle Paul McCartney in 1957. </P>
<P> The tape, together with the reel-to-reel machine on which it was recorded, will go on sale September 15. </P>
<P> The 16-year-old Lennon plays an early Elvis Presley B side, ``Baby Let's Play House,'' and Lonnie Donegan's ``Putting on the Style,'' which was number one in the British charts at the time. </P>
<P> The reel, which will be star attraction at Sotheby's rock 'n' roll memorabilia auction, has been hidden away in a bank vault for 30 years since being recorded at a garden fete in Liverpool. It was there that Lennon and McCartney, who is not on the tape, first met. </P>
<P> ``Beatlemania'' swept Britain, the United States and the rest of the world, and the Beatles became the biggest-selling musical group of all time. By the end of 1982 they had sold more than 1 billion discs and tapes. </P>
<P> Lennon was shot to death in 1980 outside his New York apartment. </P>
