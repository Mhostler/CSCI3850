<P>  Two Democratic senators said Tuesday they would try to end filibusters next year so a minority could not block the will of the majority, but they conceded the odds were against them. </P>
<P> Under current rules, 60 of the 100 senators, rather than a simple majority, must vote to end debate on a bill or nomination if opponents refuse to allow final action. </P>
<P> Senators Tom Harkin of Iowa and Joe Lieberman of Connecticut said the filibuster was being abused and was one of the changes the public wanted to see in the way Congress was run. </P>
<P> They said there were 32 filibusters in the 1993-94 session, most led by Republicans, compared to only two or three in previous sessions two decades ago. </P>
<P> ``It is time for us to bury the dinosaur called filibusters,'' Harkin said at a news conference. </P>
<P> ``It is time that we all stopped using procedural tricks to frustrate the majority will,'' Lieberman added. </P>
<P> They said they were making their proposal even though Republicans will take control of the Senate from Democrats next January because they believed it was time to change. The House of Representatives does not permit filibusters. </P>
<P> The Harkin-Lieberman plan would permit four Senate votes on ending filibusters. The first would require 60 votes to succeed, the second, 57; the third, 54; and the fourth, 51, or a majority of the full Senate. </P>
<P> Harkin said this would allow ample time for debate on controversial measures without allowing minority control. </P>
<P> They said they would offer their rule change Jan. 4, the first day the Senate meets next year. The change would have to be adopted by the Senate and could be filibustered itself. </P>
<P> ``It's an uphill battle,'' Harkin said. </P>
<P> Incoming Majority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said Sunday he opposes changing the filibuster rule and that some Democrats may want to keep it to use against Republican bills. </P>
<P> ``That's why the rules are there -- to protect the rights of the minority,'' Dole said on ABC's ``This Week with David Brinkley''. ``It's not just a Democrat tool when Republicans are in charge or a Republican tool when Democrats are in charge.'' </P>
