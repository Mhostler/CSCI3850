<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Prime Minister Tansu Ciller defied Western criticism of Turkey's unprecedented drive into Iraq Tuesday, insisting her troops had every right to be there hunting rebel Kurds. </P>
<P> In a veiled reference to Germany, Turkey's NATO ally which froze military aid in protest at the now 16-day-old thrust, she said angrily: ``You can keep your weapons.'' </P>
<P> The cross-border drive by 35,000 troops against Kurdish rebels fighting for a homeland in Turkey has raised fears in Britain, France, Germany and the United States of a long stay and the harm which might come to civilians. </P>
<P> New Turkish Foreign Minister Erdal Inonu was heading for Washington Tuesday on a diplomatic tour to defend the drive into northern Iraq. </P>
<P> ``We have one thing to say to those who threaten us about using their arms when they should be standing by us -- we will use our right to defend ourselves under any circumstances,'' Ciller told members of her conservative party in parliament. </P>
<P> It was the first time Ciller, however indirectly, had publicly answered Germany's freeze last week on credits to help finance construction of two frigates and suspension of a shipment of military engineering equipment. </P>
<P> Turkish troops in Iraq battled rain and fog but a spokesman insisted the campaign was not stuck in the mud. </P>
<P> ``The weather is not very good but certainly not so that the overall operation is hampered,'' military spokesman Col. Dogu Silahcioglu said of the thrust by 35,000 Turkish troops. </P>
<P> ``Our troops are equipped and trained to carry out the operation in all weather,'' he told Reuters from Diyarbakir, nerve center in southeast Turkey for the operation. </P>
<P> The rainy season, normally about the first two weeks of April, came in with a vengeance Monday, grounding helicopters and turning search routes into muddy quagmires. </P>
<P> The military campaign, Turkey's biggest of modern times, has drawn fire from abroad but Ciller has picked up popularity at home, diverting attention from economic woes. </P>
<P> Political analysts say Ciller may even have planned the incursion to appease Turkish hardliners and clear the way for hard-to-sell democratic reforms which would make life easier for the Kurds in Turkey. </P>
<P> Ciller told the deputies from her True Path Party that Turkey would pull out as soon as possible after achieving its aim of wiping out bases of some 2,500 rebels from the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). She gave no target date. </P>
<P> The military achievements of the push were so far uncertain. The two sides give widely conflicting death tolls. </P>
<P> The Turks said Monday they killed 306 rebel fighters since the start of the operation, for the loss of 26 Turkish soldiers. The separatist PKK says more than 500 soldiers have died, for the loss of about 20 rebels. </P>
