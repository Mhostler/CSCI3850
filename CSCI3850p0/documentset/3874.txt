<P>  Cambodia's Khmer Rouge guerrillas Saturday said they were responsible for last weekend's attack on a tourist convoy in northwestern Siem Reap province which killed a U.S. woman and seriously wounded her husband. </P>
<P> In a clandestine radio report, the rebel faction accused the couple of being U.S. military experts helping the government's armed forces. </P>
<P> ``In the morning of January 15, there were American military personnel belonging to American military teams assigned to Cambodia. They came to examine the geography of Siem Keap and Banteay Srey. </P>
<P> ``(When) they reached south of Banteay Srey, we ambushed (the convoy) by detonating mines and opening fire... killing one American on the spot and wounding another,'' the radio broadcast, monitored in Phnom Penh, said. </P>
<P> Susan Hadden, 50, of Austin, Texas, was killed last Sunday together with her Cambodian tour guide on the road to Banteay Srey temple. Her husband, William, 54, was critically wounded. He had gunshot and shrapnel wounds and was evacuated to Singapore Monday. </P>
<P> The woman was a professor at the Lyndon Baines Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas in Austin where she specialized in environmental policy and telecommunications. A university spokeswoman said Hadden's trip to Cambodia was a 50th birthday present from her husband. </P>
<P> Hadden's body was cremated at a ceremony in Phnom Penh Monday, Bangkok-based travel agent Diethelm Travel, which handled the couple's tour arrangements, said in a brief statement. </P>
<P> The Cambodian government had said robbery was the motive and that Khmer Rouge guerrillas were not involved. </P>
<P> Tourism Minister Veng Sereyvuth said earlier this week that recent defections by Khmer Rouge guerrillas from around Banteay Srey might have caused security problems in the area. </P>
<P> But a senior provincial official, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters Saturday that Khmer Rouge guerrillas could have taken part in the ambush. </P>
<P> ``I believe there must be Khmer Rouge among those armed robbers,'' the official said. </P>
<P> Siem Reap governor Toan Chay said Thursday that a police investigation indicated a group of 10 armed bandits carried out the attack. </P>
