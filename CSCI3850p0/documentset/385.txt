<DATELINE>LAGOS, Nigeria (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Nigerian oil workers, whose strike is into its fourth week, said Monday they were sticking to demands including release of detained politician Moshood Abiola. </P>
<P> ``We want all our demands met,'' Wariebi Agamene, president of the junior oil workers' union NUPENG, told Reuters. </P>
<P> Bola Owodunni, president of the other striking oil union PENGASSAN, said: ``If the government meets all our demands, both political and economic, we can call off the strike this evening.'' </P>
<P> The oil strike is part of a pro-democracy campaign to force General Sani Abacha's military government to free Abiola, who was accused of treason and jailed after he declared himself president, and surrender power to him. </P>
<P> Hundreds of women marched through central Lagos Monday, singing anti-government songs and carrying placards demanding Abiola's release and installation as president. </P>
<P> The women were dressed in colorful traditional attire and were cheered by bystanders. </P>
<P> Agamene said the campaign was gaining ground in Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation. ``Everywhere is boiling. We are confident of victory,'' he said. </P>
<P> Ibadan, Nigeria's second biggest city, was tense Monday morning as people awaited the start of a planned pro-democracy protest by local university students, residents said. </P>
<P> There were violent pro-democracy protests in Ibadan last week in which at least two people were reported killed. </P>
<P> A curfew was imposed over the weekend in the southeastern town of Calabar after a student riot there. </P>
<P> The strike by the oil unions has severely disrupted domestic fuel supplies and has had some impact on crude oil production, although exports have been unaffected. </P>
<P> Prices of most goods and services have soared, increasing pressure on millions of people already living close to the poverty line. </P>
<P> Abacha, who seized power last November, has indicated his administration is prepared to free Abiola on condition he renounces his claim to the presidency. </P>
<P> But Abiola, a wealthy businessman, has said in messages sent from his police cell in Abuja through family members that he has no intention to drop his claim. </P>
