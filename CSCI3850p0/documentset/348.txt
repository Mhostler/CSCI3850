<P>  The U.S. army's European Command is sending at least seven aircraft to boost the humanitarian relief operation for more than one million Rwandan refugees fleeing civil war and threatened by starvation and cholera. </P>
<P> General George Joulwan, Commander in Chief of the U.S. European Command based in Stuttgart, said in a statement the U.S. forces would support French, United Nations and other relief organizations in the region. </P>
<P> ``Our action to save lives in the short term will be the decisive element in the success of this undertaking,'' he said. ``Success will be measured in how many lives are saved today, tomorrow and the next day: we must move rapidly to do so.'' </P>
<P> At the direction of President Clinton, the United States sent three C-5A Galaxy aircraft with medical supplies and vehicles from bases in Europe to Nairobi, Kenya, Thursday, the statement said. Three C-141 transport aircraft were scheduled to leave Germany with water purification and distribution equipment for the Zairean border town of Goma where thousands of Rwandan refugees are dying of disease and exhaustion. </P>
<P> Another mission of an unspecified number of aircraft was due to fly to Nairobi from Copenhagen Sunday and a chartered DC-8 will transport the first shipment of rice and cooking oil from Nairobi to Goma Saturday. </P>
<P> As of Sunday, the statement said, the DC-8 would fly twice a day, delivering a total of 1,293 tons of rice and 150 tons of oil over 40 flights. </P>
