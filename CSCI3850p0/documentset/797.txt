<DATELINE>BREMEN, Germany (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Authorities in the north German city of Bremen said Tuesday they had arrested a 34-year-old German for possessing a sample of plutonium -- the third case of plutonium smuggling discovered in four months. </P>
<P> A spokesman for the Bremen prosecutor's office said the man had been arrested Saturday after producing a sample of just under 0.07 ounces of the radioactive material for a prospective client, and offering to supply more. </P>
<P> Bavarian police revealed last weekend that they had arrested couriers in possession of more than 10.6 ounces of plutonium-239, a substance so toxic that a few millionths of a gram will kill. </P>
<P> That was the third find of smuggled weapons-grade nuclear material this year -- two of plutonium and one of uranium. </P>
<P> German authorities believe the material originated in Russia and the former Soviet Union and they say their analyses prove it. Moscow says it can account for all its plutonium, used for making atomic bombs and warheads. </P>
<P> No information was immediately available on the quality of the plutonium seized in the latest find, although the prosecutor's office said there was no evidence of a link with the other cases. </P>
