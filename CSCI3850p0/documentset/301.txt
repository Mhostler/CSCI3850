<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A gunman and two others were shot and wounded Tuesday after the man barricaded himself in his apartment and kept police at bay for more than four hours, firing more than 40 shots, police said. </P>
<P> The standoff at the San Jose apartment complex began at about 4:30 a.m. Tuesday when neighbors said they were awakened by a loud argument between a man and a woman, soon followed by volleys of gunfire. </P>
<P> Between eight and 10 bullets ripped through the wall of a neighboring apartment and one of them grazed the arm of a man living there, police said. </P>
<P> Police sealed off the area and evacuated the 200 apartments in the building. A SWAT team took up position outside the building. </P>
<P> The woman got out of the apartment safely, but a male relative of the gunman remained in the apartment during the standoff, according to police. It was not immediately clear whether he was held hostage. </P>
<P> About five hours later, the gunman, whose name was not immediately released, emerged from the apartment. Police ordered him to drop his assault rifle and handgun. Instead, he fired at them. </P>
<P> Police returned with a fusilade of bullets. No police officers were injured. </P>
<P> The gunman was taken to a hospital, where his condition was not released. </P>
<P> The gunman squeezed off about 40 shots during the incident, police said. They did not release any estimate of the number of shots police used. </P>
<P> Unsure whether any gunmen remained in the apartment, police fired in teargas before entering. They found the gunman's relative with a bullet wound to the leg and took him to the hospital. </P>
<P> It was not immediately clear how he suffered the wound. </P>
<P> An investigation was continuing, police said. </P>
