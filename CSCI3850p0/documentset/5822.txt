<DATELINE>BUJUMBURA, Burundi (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Hutu gunmen killed two soldiers in northeast Burundi Tuesday in an assault on an army post in which five attackers also died, state-run radio said. </P>
<P> The assailants were presumed to be Hutu guerrillas stepping up their hit-and-run operations against the mainly Tutsi army. </P>
<P> State-run Burundi Radio said two soldiers and five of the attackers were killed and eight people were wounded, including a soldier who was seriously hurt. It said the gunmen were of Rwandan origin. </P>
<P> A police spokesman said they were spotted Monday near the Tanzanian border and had earlier ambushed a truckload of troops. The number of casualties from that attack was still unknown, he added. </P>
<P> Gasorwe, 125 miles northeast of the capital Bujumbura, was the scene of a massacre of hundreds of Hutu civilians by Tutsi soldiers and civilians in late March, according to the U.S. ambassador, aid workers and survivors. </P>
<P> The army denied any slaughter had occurred. </P>
<P> In another incident, a mine exploded Tuesday in the Doyen Hotel in the heart of the capital Bujumbura, destroying two rooms on the first floor but causing no casualties, witnesses said. </P>
<P> Shootings and grenade blasts are fairly common in Bujumbura but it was believed to be the first attack with a landmine on a downtown hotel. Police said they were investigating. </P>
<P> The state-run news agency said Monday three people were killed and 32 wounded when unidentified attackers lobbed hand grenades into a market in the northern town of Ngozi Sunday. </P>
<P> As in neighboring Rwanda, Burundi has a big majority of Hutus. In Burundi the Tutsis dominate the army and civil service, while the weak government is a fragile ethnic coalition. </P>
