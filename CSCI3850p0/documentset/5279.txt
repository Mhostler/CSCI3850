<P>  Supporters of a California measure that would end state affirmative action programs vowed Tuesday to work to put the issue before voters after it failed in the state legislature. </P>
<P> The California Senate Governmental Organization Committee voted five to four against a proposed state constitutional amendment that would effectively ban state government programs which increase opportunities for women and racial minorities. </P>
<P> All four senators who voted for the measure were Republicans, all five opponents were Democrats. </P>
<P> The amendment would bar state or local governments from discriminating against or granting preferential treatment to anyone on the basis of race or sex in public employment, education or contracting. </P>
<P> Senators backing the bill said they would push for its reconsideration. </P>
<P> Backers of a virtually identical measure outside the legislature responded to the vote by saying they would launch a signature-gathering campaign to put the issue before voters in a statewide referendum in November 1996. </P>
<P> ``The state legislature has failed in its responsibility to allow the people of California to express themselves on this critical issue ...,'' Tom Wood and Glynn Custred, two academics who authored the measure, said in a statement. </P>
<P> Wood and Custred need to collect some 700,000 signatures to put their proposed California Civil Rights Initiative on the ballot. Opinion polls have shown that a majority of Californians support their initiative. </P>
<P> California Gov. Pete Wilson, who has endorsed the initiative, said the committee vote effectively blocked ``any further serious discussion in the legislature of the value of affirmative action.'' </P>
<P> But Californians would get a chance to decide at the ballot box, Wilson said in a statement, referring to the drive by Wood and Custred. </P>
<P> Wilson, who has launched an exploratory committee for a possible run for the Republican presidential nomination in 1996, has said that reform of affirmative action programs is likely to be one of the planks of his presidential campaign. </P>
<P> A national debate is raging over the future of affirmative action, used since the 1960s to increase opportunities for women and minorities in employment and education. </P>
<P> To amend the state constitution, a measure must pass the state legislature by a two-thirds majority and then be put to a popular vote. Alternatively, it can be put directly on the ballot through a signature-gathering drive. </P>
