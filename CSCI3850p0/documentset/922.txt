<P> Representative Vic Fazio of California, a member of the Democratic leadership, said the National Rifle Association was busy telephoning members to try to defeat the bill. </P>
<P> ``I think everybody worries about what will happen when the NRA turns it on one more time,'' he told reporters. </P>
<P> Fazio spoke as a bipartisan group prepared its final phase of work on a reworked crime bill. </P>
<P> He said this bill was expected to go to the floor at about 1:00 p.m. EDT (1700 GMT) Sunday. </P>
<P> Opponents want to try to kill it and replace it with another bill that does not contain the assault weapons ban. </P>
