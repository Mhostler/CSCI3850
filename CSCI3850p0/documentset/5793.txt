<P>  Muslim extremists fleeing pursuing troops in the southern Philippines hacked to death 14 hostages, beheading some of them, after they became too weak to carry on, a survivor said Monday. </P>
<P> Rustico Secundo, taken to hospital with slash wounds after being rescued by soldiers Sunday, said one other hostage escaped while another, a woman, was taken along by the rebels. </P>
<P> The guerrillas carried out the massacre at about 2 a.m. Saturday shortly after he overheard them saying that ``we had become extra baggage to them.'' </P>
<P> ``I kept praying Psalm 23, 'The Lord is my Shepherd. I shall not want'. I kept repeating the prayer when they started hacking us.'' </P>
<P> He said of his mortally wounded companions: ``I heard them calling their mother's names as they lay dying.'' </P>
<P> The deaths brought to at least 20 the number of hostages killed since the fleeing guerrillas of the Abu Sayyaf fundamentalist group dismissed the southern town of Ipil April 4 and massacred 53 people, most of them unarmed civilians. </P>
<P> A hostage who escaped last week alleged he saw the raiders slaughter a 14-year-old captive and eat his flesh. </P>
<P> ``I saw how they beheaded (some of) my companions,'' Secundo told reporters. ``Afterwards, they threw bodies into the sea.'' </P>
<P> He said he survived by playing dead and floating in a mangrove swamp until soldiers came. </P>
<P> ``This is barbaric. It is inhuman and un-Islamic,'' southern military command chief Maj. Gen. Edgardo Batenga said at his headquarters in Zamboanga, 500 miles south of Manila. </P>
<P> In Manila, President Fidel Ramos said he would hold a meeting of the National Security Council Friday to discuss the Abu Sayyaf threat and the Philippine dispute with China over their conflicting claims to the Spratly Islands. </P>
<P> The extremists are part of a group of 200 who attacked nearby Ipil, looted banks and shops and burned down the town center. </P>
<P> Two people, a Muslim policeman and a Christian convert to Islam, have been charged with multiple homicide, robbery and kidnapping in connection with the raid, police said. </P>
<P> The convert, Thomas Diolin de Vera, 26, cased the town eight days before before the raid and made a sketch of the places to attack while the policeman, Bahari Laurente, acted as lookout during the actual raid, police said. </P>
<P> ``I was hacked several times. My neck was hacked and also my backside,'' Secundo, a 24-year-old farmer, said. </P>
<P> He said the 14 were killed because they were too weak to carry on after their captors forced them to act as porters, sometimes carrying their firearms or duffel bags filled with bundles of money the rebels looted from the banks. </P>
<P> Secundo said he heard the rebels talking about killing the hostages Friday night while they were on an island off the Zamboanga coast. </P>
<P> Secundo was bleeding from his wounds and wearing only his briefs when soldiers found him. He said the rebels took away his pair of pants, shirt and slippers to wear themselves. </P>
<P> The soldiers also recovered the bodies of six of the butchered hostages. </P>
