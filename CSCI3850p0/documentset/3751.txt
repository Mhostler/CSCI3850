<DATELINE>TBILISI, Georgia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Georgian militants set off by bus for Abkhazia Friday, vowing to recapture the breakaway province more than a year after Abkhazian separatists chased the Georgian army out, but they were quickly arrested. </P>
<P> Georgia borders Chechnya, which Russian troops poured into a month ago in an attempt to crush another separatist revolt. </P>
<P> The convoy of 12 Georgian buses, transporting fighters loyal to ex-Defense Minister Tengiz Kitovani and ex-Prime Minister Tengiz Sigua, was stopped and passengers disarmed at points on the road west from the Georgian capital, Tbilisi. </P>
<P> Georgian radio said five men were wounded during clashes when the first six buses were stopped near the towns of Gori and Osiauri. Some 150 people were disarmed. </P>
<P> The other buses, along with Kitovani and Sigua, were stopped further west near Kutaisi, according to Russia's Interfax news agency. </P>
<P> Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze, describing the actions of Kitovani and his National Liberation Front actions as an attempt to trigger a civil war, had ordered him to be stopped and security measures to be stepped up. </P>
<P> Shevardnadze told a news conference Kitovani's claim to have Russian support for the attempted advance, which petered out long before it reached the Abkhazian frontier, was false. </P>
