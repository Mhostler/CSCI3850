<DATELINE>MOGADISHU, Somalia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Dozens of civilians working for the United Nations in Somalia were evacuated Tuesday as military forces prepared the ground for the departure of troops and their hardware later this month. </P>
<P> Some 50 expatriate civilians flew out of the U.N.-controlled airport bound for the Kenyan capital Nairobi. </P>
<P> ``I made a lot of Somali friends here,'' said Walt Johnson, who worked for the U.S. contractor Brown and Root which serviced the mammoth U.N. Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM). </P>
<P> ``They don't want us to leave. I feel things are going to get worse after we've gone.'' </P>
<P> Somalis who worked for the U.N. were also on the flight. </P>
<P> One Somali, complaining loudly that the world body's mission had been a failure and that the consequences for Somalia would be grim, waved the blue national flag and kissed the ground before boarding the aircraft. </P>
<P> U.N. special envoy Victor Gbeho and a skeleton civilian staff of less than 100 -- at its peak there were 730 UNOSOM workers -- will be left at Mogadishu's airport and port. They are due to go by the end of the month. </P>
<P> UNOSOM has failed to bring Somalia's belligerent clan warlords together to form an interim government over the last two years. </P>
<P> More than 130 peacekeepers and hundreds of Somalis have been killed in a mission which in 1993 turned sour as U.N. troops battled militias on the streets of Mogadishu. </P>
<P> The U.N. defends its record, pointing to the welcome it received from local people in the provinces, where a famine killed many thousands in 1992. Many areas are still relatively peaceful and rural life has returned to normal in many areas. </P>
<P> About 7,000 troops from Pakistan, Egypt and Bangladesh still remain in the U.N. base. Planeloads are leaving every day. </P>
<P> Many feared Somali militias could try to attack the outgoing U.N. troops and loot their vehicles, tanks and guns. </P>
<P> But the Somalis seem more intent on jostling for good positions in the city close to the airport and port so that when the U.N. goes, they can seize the facilities. </P>
<P> A bloody feud between rival Somali fruit export companies last week in which several Somalis died -- and an Italian cameraman was killed -- has calmed down and there is little shooting in the chaotic city. </P>
<P> At the airport, U.N. forces are bulldozing sand into defensive barriers around their evacuation route into the sea to waiting ships. </P>
