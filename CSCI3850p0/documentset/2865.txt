<P>  Canadian researchers looking at the effectiveness of mammograms recommended Monday that women in their 40s have routine breast X-rays, citing the benefits of catching tumors in their early, curable stages. </P>
<P> ``There is no authority in the world that would disagree that early detection of breast cancer leads to better outcomes,'' said Linda Warren, executive director of the Screening Mammography Program of British Columbia. </P>
<P> Whether women between ages 40 and 49 should undergo routine mammograms has become controversial, especially since the U.S. National Cancer Institute suggested last year that automatic yearly exams were unneccessary until women reach age 50. </P>
<P> Breast cancer research has been contradictory as to the age at which women should undergo regular mammograms, but the Canadian researchers indicated that the earlier the better. </P>
<P> ``Since we know that the survival advantage of early detection is independent of age, we are able to predict that it benefits all women age 40 and over,'' Warren said in a presentation to the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America here. </P>
<P> The Canadian study was based on results of mammograms beginning in 1988. Of 150,147 women studied, roughly one-third were under age 50 and those younger patients comprised 15 percent of the cancers detected. </P>
<P> Nearly 87 percent of the 150 cancers were detected in an early, curable stage, before the cancer had spread to the lymph nodes, the study found. </P>
<P> Fewer breast cancers were found among the younger women, but many tumors were discovered in denser tissue that can often hide the disease. Earlier detection allows for less invasive treatment. </P>
<P> However, the study did not compile cancer patients' mortality rates, a factor that some researchers believe would show that younger women often develop more aggressive cancers. </P>
<P> Warren said the incidence of breast cancer in British Columbia is the highest of all the Canadian provinces, yet the mortality rate is the second lowest and continues to decline. </P>
<P> ``We believe this is occurring because nearly 40 percent of all the eligible women in British Columbia are having annual mammograms,'' Warren said. </P>
