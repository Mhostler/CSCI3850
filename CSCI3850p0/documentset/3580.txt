<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  With the 1995 baseball season in jeopardy due to a players' strike and the owners' threat to field replacements, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan introduced a bill Wednesday to repeal Major League Baseball's antitrust exemption. </P>
<P> Moynihan said the 1922 antitrust exemption, unique in American sports, allows the owners to act as a cartel. </P>
<P> ``To end this monopoly, Congress must remove baseball's antitrust exemption and subject the game to the same rules of law that apply to all other major league sports,'' the New York Democrat said. </P>
<P> ``It may not solve all of baseball's troubles, but it is a necessary step and one that is decades overdue,'' he said. </P>
<P> The players' union began their strike on Aug. 12 over the owners' plan to cap salaries, and the season -- along with the playoffs and World Series -- was cancelled by the owners on Sept. 14. </P>
<P> Contract negotiations broke down last month with the owners declaring an impasse and unilaterally implementing their salary cap proposal. </P>
<P> The Supreme Court ruled in 1922 that baseball was not interstate commerce and so not subject to antitrust laws on commerce between the states. </P>
<P> The ruling has survived many challenges over the years. </P>
<P> Moynihan called his bill ``The National Pastime Preservation Act of 1995.'' </P>
<P> ``The bill is a good idea,'' said union head Donald Fehr. ''There is a fundamental problem with the law when the owners are allowed to act as a cartel.'' </P>
<P> Michael Bilirakis, a Republican representative from Florida, plans to introduce similar legislation in the House. Bilirakis also proposed legislation last year aimed at ending baseball's anti-trust exemption. </P>
