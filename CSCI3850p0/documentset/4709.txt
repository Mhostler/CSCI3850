<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Mary Rose Oakar, a former congresswoman from Ohio, pleaded innocent Friday to seven criminal charges in a Justice Department investigation stemming from the House bank scandal. </P>
<P> Oakar, a Democrat from Cleveland who served in Congress from 1977 through 1992, said clearly, ``not guilty,'' when asked in court how she pleaded to the charges that carry a maximum 40-year prison sentence. </P>
<P> Among other things, Oakar, 54, last week was charged with making false statements to the FBI about her house bank account, lying on her 1991 financial disclosure form and conspiring to violate federal campaign financing laws. </P>
<P> Also pleading not guilty with her was her nephew, Joseph DeMio, a former aide in her 1992 re-election campaign who has been charged with conspiring to defraud and lie to the Federal Elections Commission. </P>
<P> Minutes earlier, another nephew and former aide in the 1992 campaign, Ignatius DeMio, pleaded guilty to a lesser misdemeanor charge of conspiring with Oakar to violate federal campaign financing laws. </P>
<P> He faces up to a year in prison, but the judge said prosecutors have agreed not to seek any jail time if he cooperates in the investigation and testifies against Oakar. </P>
<P> DeMio gave Oakar a kiss and hugged his brother as he was leaving the courtroom after entering the guilty plea. </P>
<P> Outside the courthouse after the hearing, Oakar said she had no hard feelings toward her nephew. ``I love him very much.'' </P>
<P> Her defense attorney, R. Kenneth Mundy, said, ``We won't lose any sleep over it,'' when asked if he was concerned about DeMio's cooperation. </P>
<P> Asked what if felt like to stand in court as a defendant in a criminal case, Oakar replied, ``It's an interesting experience'' and added, ``My family has suffered tremendous intimidation at times.'' </P>
<P> Mundy, who was able to win an acquittal for Washington, D.C., Mayor Marion Barry on all but one of the drug charges against him, told reporters he was ``confident'' Oakar would be vindicated. </P>
<P> He told the judge during the hearing he would file constitutional challenges to the indictment, arguing that the Justice Department cannot bring charges that involve alleged violations by a member of Congress of House rules. </P>
<P> Mundy also said he would challenge whether there have been any criminal violations of the federal election campaign laws. </P>
<P> He said the only charges that should be heard by a jury at trial concerned the alleged false statements Oakar made to the FBI when asked about three stop-payment orders on her House bank account. </P>
<P> U.S. District Judge Harold Greene did not set a trial date for Oakar, who remains free without any bond. </P>
