<P>  Defense Secretary William Perry Monday rejected a call from Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole to remove all U.S. troops from Haiti by Thanksgiving. </P>
<P> Dole of Kansas said in a CBS television interview Sunday that all of the remaining 12,400 American troops on the island should be withdrawn by the Nov. 24 holiday. </P>
<P> ``Our plan is as we have announced before: to reduce to about 9,000 troops in Haiti by the end of the month (November),'' Perry said Monday in response to questions from reporters. ``There will be further reductions in December. But they will not all be out by Thanksgiving by a longshot,'' he added during a Pentagon photo opportunity with visiting Tunisian Defense Minister Abdelaziz Ben Dhia. </P>
<P> Dole, who is expected to be Senate majority leader in the new Congress, said on the ``Face the Nation'' program that ``We ought to get the troops out of Haiti by Thanksgiving. We don't have to sit around while they (Haitian officials) postpone their elections.'' </P>
<P> He added: ``My view is we ought to hurry up and bring back the other 9,000 troops. It doesn't serve any purpose if there's no problem there. Do we have to just sit there until they have their elections maybe sometime next February?'' </P>
