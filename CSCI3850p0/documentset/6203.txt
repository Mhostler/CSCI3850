<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Dan Ferry's long-range bomb bounced off the rim at the buzzer Monday as the New York Knicks survived a defensive struggle with an 83-81 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA playoffs. </P>
<P> ``We dodged a bullet. We were very fortunate to win,'' said Knicks coach Pat Riley, whose team claimed a 2-1 lead in the best-of-five series and put the Cavs on the brink of elimination in the Eastern Conference first-round series. </P>
<P> Cleveland controlled much of the game with their stifling defense and overcame poor shooting by their backcourt with frequent trips to the foul line. </P>
<P> Down the stretch, however, the Knicks came up big and took advantage of two breaks as the teams otherwise traded free throw opportunities by committing strategic fouls. </P>
<P> After Derek Harper converted two free throws to snap a 79-79 tie, Mark Price lost control of the ball on the dribble in Cleveland's next possession for a costly turnover. </P>
<P> Missed free throws by Patrick Ewing and John Starks set up a final chance for Cleveland and the Cavs had a chance to win when Price escaped a double team and found a wide-open Ferry. </P>
<P> But Ferry missed the three-pointer that would have turned the tables on the Knicks. ``I got a good look,'' said Ferry. ''We got what we wanted, an open shot, but it didn't go down.'' </P>
<P> ``Mark (Price) made the pass and Danny (Ferry) was wide open and you go for it in that situation,'' said Cavs coach Mike Fratello. ``If it goes in, it's a happy locker room. Unfortunately, this time it didn't go in.'' </P>
<P> Patrick Ewing led the Knicks with 23 points and 10 rebounds. Mark Price had 21 points for Cleveland, including 16-of-16 from the free throw line. But Price hit only 2-of-9 field goal attempts. Cleveland's other starting guard -- Bobby Phills -- converted only 2-of-11 shots from the field. </P>
<P> Riley knows there is more work to be done. ``If anyone watched these two teams play during the regular season, they won two at the (Madison Square) Garden and we won two here. </P>
<P> ``Every game was a grinder and I fully expect the same on Thursday. The only thing we have guaranteed is we can get it back to the Garden and the pressure is on them.'' </P>
<P> Game Four will be Thursday night in Cleveland. </P>
<P> In Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Lakers came out red-hot and held off the Seattle Supersonics 105-101 to also move within one victory of advancing in the playoffs. </P>
<P> Cedric Ceballos scored 24 points and Nick Van Exel added 23 to lead the Lakers, who took a 2-1 lead in their Western Conference series. </P>
<P> The loss put Seattle one defeat away from falling in the first round of the NBA playoffs for a second year in a row. Last season the Sonics became the first top seed to lose to an eighth seed when they were upset by the Denver Nuggets 3-2. </P>
<P> The Lakers raced to a 12-2 lead in the first 3:42 of the game and held a 34-22 advantage after the first quarter as Ceballos and Anthony Peeler scored nine points apiece. </P>
<P> ``We're playing playoff basketball,'' said Lakers coach Del Harris. ``When you get in the playoffs, there's a certain playoff mentality and an intensity that comes with it.'' </P>
<P> Sonics head coach George Karl said: ``We got shocked early. Our fight didn't start until we got 15-18 points down. But it's not over.'' </P>
<P> A 12-4 run late in the fourth quarter pulled the Sonics within 96-93 with 2:37 left. </P>
<P> Seattle pressed hard as the teams exchanged baskets down the stretch until a key turnover gave the Lakers some breathing room. A steal and layup by Los Angeles' George Lynch off an inbounds pass with 9.8 seconds left sealed the win. </P>
<P> Shawn Kemp led Seattle with 30 points and 11 rebounds. </P>
<P> Game Four will be Thursday night in Los Angeles. </P>
