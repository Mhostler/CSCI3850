<DATELINE>BEIJING (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Last-ditch Sino-U.S. talks ended Saturday with no deal to curb rampant piracy of copyrights and other intellectual property in China, leaving the sides on the brink of a destructive Pacific trade war. </P>
<P> Officials of China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, quoted in a brief dispatch by the Xinhua news agency, gave no details other than that the talks had ended. </P>
<P> But they also gave what may have been a hint that a pact was still possible, saying the sides had ``not yet reached'' a deal. </P>
<P> China said last week the differences were ``not very big.'' </P>
<P> There was no immediate comment from the U.S. side, which had said the talks would last through the weekend. </P>
<P> Beijing has a history of stonewalling negotiations to the last possible hour -- and sometimes beyond -- before making meaningful concessions. </P>
<P> Analysts said they would not be surprised if more talks took place before Feb. 4, when Washington has threatened to slap crippling tariffs on $2.8 billion in Chinese exports if no deal to protect intellectual property in China is reached. </P>
<P> China has pledged swift retaliation for any U.S. sanctions, raising the specter of a trade war that could seriously damage Hong Kong and other interdependent Pacific economies. </P>
<P> Despite the round's failure, China Saturday ordered new moves to crush what the U.S. government and industry leaders say is rampant bootlegging of foreign recorded music and films. </P>
<P> The State Copyright Administration, in a decree reported in the People's Daily, said firms publishing foreign recordings must re-register from Feb. 1 and show valid contracts with copyright owners or face fines and other punishment. </P>
<P> Coming one week before the U.S. sanctions deadline, the edict laid the legal groundwork for expected raids on up to 30 major counterfeit centres in south China. </P>
<P> Beijing sent top investigators to piracy-plagued Guangdong province two weeks ago and called for a sweeping nationwide anti-piracy campaign for the first days of the Lunar New Year, which starts Tuesday. </P>
<P> U.S. officials say the bootleg plants, some state-owned, are flooding Asia with illegal laser and compact discs of U.S. music and films worth hundreds of millions of dollars. </P>
<P> Washington has been pushing China for plant closures or other ``down payments'' to show it is earnest about protecting U.S. copyrights, trademarks and patents, which are breached at a cost estimated by U.S. industry at nearly $1 billion a year. </P>
<P> The United States also wants Beijing to open up China's potentially huge market by removing barriers that U.S. movie and music industries say are virtually impenetrable. </P>
<P> U.S. business sources close to the talks had said Friday the sides were edging toward a final round of talks in Washington in the last days before the sanctions deadline. </P>
<P> They said China hoped to raise the talks to a higher diplomatic level, with Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi, one of China's toughest negotiators, meeting U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, a Clinton Cabinet member. </P>
<P> Leading the U.S. team now is Deputy Assistant Trade Representative Lee Sands, branded by the official China Daily in December as a progress-inhibiting ``bogeyman.'' </P>
