<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A bill subjecting Congress to the same workplace laws that apply to private business cleared the House Tuesday and headed to President Clinton for signature. </P>
<P> House passage on a unanimous vote of 390-0 followed Senate approval of the bill last week by 98-1. </P>
<P> The House had passed a slightly different version of the high-priority measure on the first day of the new Republican-controlled Congress Jan. 4. </P>
<P> The so-called congressional accountability bill meets complaints that Congress is arrogant and out of touch because it enacts costly laws for others which it does not observe. </P>
<P> Some proponents of the bill have said that applying the laws to Congress would make lawmakers think twice before enacting new workplace laws. </P>
<P> The measure would require Congress to comply with 11 laws, including those dealing with fair labor standards, age discrimination and family and medical leave. </P>
<P> Some Democrats complained that the measure was being considered under rules that allowed no amendments, in conflict with Republican promises of greater openness in the legislative process. </P>
<P> The brief House debate was in contrast to a five-day debate in the Senate, where Democrats sought unsucsessfully to use it as a vehicle for other congressional reforms. </P>
<P> The Senate did, however, codify a ban on senators' use of ''frequent flier'' airline miles on personal trips. </P>
<P> Asked why the House did not institute the same restriction, Speaker Newt Gingrich told reporters the question should be examined but it was ``not a simple issue.'' </P>
<P> ``The House Oversight Committee ought to look at it from a profamily standpoint,'' he said, adding that frequent flier awards could help the families of members who lived far from Washington and whose resources were meager. </P>
<P> ``I often used them for my wife and children,'' he said. </P>
<P> Gingrich chided reporters for what he called ``nitpicking'' on the frequent flier issue. </P>
<P> He said the bill was being sent to the president at the earliest point in a new Congress since 1933 and termed the action ``a pretty good first step.'' </P>
