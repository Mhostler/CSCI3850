<P>  President Clinton said Friday he was heartened that a long-delayed joint congressional committee hearing on anti-crime legislation would be held Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``I am confident that committee members will act quickly on the conference and that we will see a final bill passed,'' Clinton said in a written statement. </P>
<P> Members of the Senate and House of Representatives Judiciary committees are to meet next Tuesday to work out differences in the House and Senate crime bills after more a month's delay. </P>
<P> ``I am heartened to know that the House and Senate conference will convene next Tuesday to begin its final work on the proposal,'' Clinton said. </P>
<P> Action on the bill has been delayed because of a provision in the House bill that would allow appeals of death sentences based on claims of racial bias. </P>
<P> The Senate rejected 54-33 Friday night a Republican effort to prohibit such appeals. </P>
<P> ``We have put together a tough and serious legislative remedy to reduce violence and prevent crime. But until a bill is passed by Congress and signed into law, our work is not finished,'' Clinton said. </P>
<P> The bill includes the ``three strikes and you're out'' mandatory life sentence for anyone convicted of three violent crimes and funding to hire 100,000 local police and build more prisons. </P>
