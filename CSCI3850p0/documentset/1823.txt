<DATELINE>JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  King Fahd accepted an invitation from President Clinton Wednesday to visit the United States and voiced hopes he would be able to soon, U.S. officials said. </P>
<P> The Saudi leader also told U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen he plans to press ahead with his tight budget program next year and would push privatization of state-owned companies, starting with the government airline Saudia. </P>
<P> The 73-year-old King, whose health has been the subject of numerous rumors, looked alert at a photo opportunity for reporters at the start of his meeting with Bentsen at the Al- Salam (Peace) Palace here. </P>
<P> ``The King accepted the invitation to visit and indicated he hopes to be able to do so soon,'' said a U.S. Treasury official, who declined to be named. ``No date has been set.'' </P>
<P> This would be King Fahd's first visit to the United States since 1985, when he met then President Ronald Reagan. </P>
<P> Before his meeting with Fahd, Bentsen told reporters that Saudi Arabia is starting to have some problems paying its debts, but that its underlying creditworthiness is sound, thanks to its huge oil reserves . </P>
<P> ``They've begun to have credit problems in so far as meeting maturities on some indebtedness,'' Bentsen said. ``It's obvious they have to do more tighening of the budget.'' </P>
<P> After building an enormously wealthy, high-technology economy, the world's largest oil exporter is facing a cash crunch brought on by weak oil prices and $55 billion in payments to finance the 1990-91 Gulf War. </P>
<P> In order to put its finances back into better shape, the government has planned for a 20 percent budget cut this year. </P>
<P> King Fahd told Bentsen during their two hour meeting that Riyadh ``would continue to exercise budget restraint into 1995,'' Treasury officials said. </P>
<P> But he said he still placed a high priority for spending on human resources such as health, education, and investment in transportation and telecommunications. </P>
<P> The conservative kingdom has racked up some $70 to $80 billion in debt, almost all of it domestic, a local financial source said. </P>
<P> Earlier this year, Riyadh negotiated with Washington, delays in payments and delivery of some U.S. military equipment, including fighter planes and tanks. </P>
<P> The country, which will pay the U.S. government $3.3 billion this year under those contracts, faces a payments bulge of some $8 billion over the next two years. </P>
<P> Bentsen, who arrived for a two-day visit Wednesday, made clear that Riyadh's problems were temporary and were similiar to those faced by the United States before the Clinton administration took action to reduce the U.S. budget deficit. </P>
<P> ``They have short-term problems,'' he said. ``But the enormous oil reserves they have show the ultimate soundness of their indebtedness.'' </P>
