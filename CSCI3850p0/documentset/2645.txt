<P>  Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic, in a telephone call to the president of the Security Council, urged immediate council action Wednesday in response to what he called a ``massive attack'' against the Muslim enclave of Bihac launched from a U.N.-protected area across the border in Croatia. </P>
<P> A spokesman for council president Madeleine Albright of the United States quoted Izetbegovic as saying the attack ranged along a 62-mile front and involved at least 30 tanks, heavy artillery, infantry and helicopters. </P>
<P> The Bosnian leader said the offensive was launched under the umbrella of the United Nations because it originated in a Serb-inhabited U.N.-protected area of Croatia. </P>
<P> Albright reported to council members on Izetbegovic's call and there was some discussion of holding a meeting later, the U.S. spokesman added. </P>
