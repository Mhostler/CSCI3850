<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Doris Duke, once known as the richest girl in the world, may have been killed by being injected with a lethal dose of morphine, her private nurse said in court papers. </P>
<P> According to a sworn affadavit by one of the six nurses who attended the 80-year-old tobacco heiress, Duke's butler conspired with her physician to inject a lethal dose of morphine. The motive was money, she said. </P>
<P> When Duke died at her Beverly Hills, California mansion in Oct. 28, 1993, she left an estate valued at more than $1 billion and a will that made her butler, Bernard Lafferty, her co-executor. Under the will, being contested by Duke's adopted daughter, Chandi Heffner Duke, and her former doctor, Harry Demopolous, Lafferty would receive a $5 million fee and $500,000 a year for life. </P>
<P> The nurse, Tammy Payette, in an affidavit unsealed Friday in Manhattan Surrogate Court, where Duke's will was filed for probate, said: ``Miss Duke did not die of natural causes and was not in danger of dying until the large doses of morphine were given to her. She was asleep, medicated with a large amount of Demerol and certainly was not in pain when the morphine was administered.'' </P>
<P> Payette charged that the heiress's physician, Dr. Charles Kivowitz, at the urging of her butler, Lafferty, administered the fatal dose. </P>
<P> ``They came into Miss Duke's bedroom and Dr. Kivowitz told me ... 'It was time for Miss Duke to go,''' Payette said. ``At this time, Miss Duke's vital signs were still stable, she was not in distress or pain.'' </P>
<P> Duke clung to life after the first shot of morphine, Payette said. The butler ``Bernard became very excited and impatient because Miss Duke was lingering and called Dr. Kivowitz explaining that Miss Duke had not expired,'' Payette said. </P>
<P> ``Dr. Kivowitz returned and injected a needle into the I.V. tube and began to push the morphine,'' according to Payette. </P>
<P> At attorney for Kivowitz strenously denied the charges Friday, noting that his client was not a beneficiary in the will and had nothing to gain from her death. </P>
<P> Lee Ann Watson, a lawyer for Lafferty, told The New York Times the nurse's statement was ``ludicrous and absurd ... It's totally contrary to the medical evidence already given.'' </P>
<P> Kivowitz signed Duke's death certificate listing natural causes as the reason for her death. </P>
<P> The reclusive philanthropist, whose largesse included putting up $5 million in bail for former Philippines first lady Imelda Marcos, died at 5:30 a.m. The body was removed from the house two hours later and cremated. No autopsy was performed. </P>
<P> Duke, whose father James Biddle Duke was president of American Tobacco Co. and founder of Duke University, inherited most of his $300 million estate when he died. She was 12 years old. Newsreels and papers dubbed her the richest girl in the world. </P>
<P> Manhattan Surrogate Court Judge Eve Preminger, who has to decide whether to validate the will, appointed a former prosecutor, Richard Kuh, to temporarily oversee the estate, investigate the matter and report to her in 45 days. </P>
<P> ``None of these allegations have been proven and they may prove meritless. However, sufficient questions have been raised...'' the judge wrote. </P>
