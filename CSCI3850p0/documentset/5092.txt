<P>  Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi said in an interview published on Wednesday the country's fragile peace agreement could still collapse, but he was hopeful it would hold. </P>
<P> He told the Lisbon daily Diario de Noticias he shared U.S. fears the November agreement to end the nearly 20-year civil war in Angola might crumble. </P>
<P> ``I am convinced that the American worries are well founded,'' Savimbi said in the interview, conducted on March 17 and 18 at Bailundo, his headquarters in the central highlands of Angola. </P>
<P> But he added: ``There is a very strong conviction, on our side at least, that the accords can hold.'' </P>
<P> There have been numerous ceasefire violations since the U.N-brokered peace accord was signed four months ago and UNITA and the government have not yet begun disarming their forces. </P>
<P> Savimbi appealed for stronger international support for the peace process, particularly from the United States, which will foot up to 40 percent of the bill for a 7,000-strong U.N. peacekeeping force in Angola. </P>
<P> He also said that UNITA wanted to improve its strained relations with Portugal, the former colonial power in Angola, and with South Africa, which switched its support from UNITA to the ruling MPLA after the fall of apartheid. </P>
<P> Savimbi said he wanted to hold a long-delayed meeting with South African President Nelson Mandela and wanted Pretoria to play a bigger role in the Angolan peace process. </P>
<P> South Africa offered logistical support to the peace- keeping force after UNITA said South African troops would not be welcome because of the large number of South African mercenaries working as military instructors for the Angolan government. </P>
<P> Savimbi said he did not associate Mandela personally with the dispatch of South African mercenaries to Angola. </P>
<P> ``I want to tell President Mandela directly that I don't associate him with the mercenaries. We want him to use his enormous experience, influence and prestige so that we in Angola can learn from his example,'' he added. </P>
<P> The U.N. Security Council is due to decide this week whether to approve the dispatch of a first contingent. </P>
<P> Savimbi founded UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola) in 1966 to fight Portuguese colonial rule, but UNITA began a civil war with the rival MPLA (Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola) at independence in 1975. </P>
