<P>  Arkansas Governor Jim Guy Tucker on Thursday angrily denied discussing a failed savings and loan, Madison Guaranty, with his predecessor, President Clinton, or other White House officials. </P>
<P> ``We have never discussed anything that has to do with dealings with Madison with me or dealings with Madison with Clinton,'' Tucker told reporters. ``I haven't discussed it with anyone at the White House.'' </P>
<P> Notes made during a White House meeting on October 14, 1993, by presidential assistant Bruce Lindsay, which were released Wednesday by the House Banking Committee, included Lindsay's written comment that Arkansas's ``current governor may well be indicted.'' </P>
<P> U.S. House Republicans said they wanted to know if Clinton, Lindsay or other White House officials had passed word to Tucker that his dealings with the Arkansas savings and loan were under investigation. </P>
<P> Clinton met Tucker in the White House on October 6, 1993. Tucker's press secretary said the two did not discuss Whitewater-related topics. </P>
<P> White House Counsel Lloyd Cutler had said Lindsay did not know Tucker was a potential target of Whitewater investigators until the day following Tucker's meeting with Clinton. </P>
<P> Tucker has acknowledged that federal regulators have probed his business dealings with now-defunct Madison Guaranty and that a criminal referral by the Resolution Trust Corp to the U.S. attorney was made. </P>
<P> ``That was originally submitted to the U.S. attorney's office in the fall of 1992 and was rejected by the U.S. attorney, who happened to be a Republican,'' Tucker said Thursday. </P>
<P> ``I'm not going to go through 500 'What ifs?' on this thing,'' Tucker snapped. </P>
