<DATELINE>TOKYO, April 14 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  An anti-nuclear campaigner said on Friday that Japan had an important and historical role to play when global leaders meet in New York next week to discuss indefinite extension of a nuclear pact. </P>
<P> ``The position of the Japanese government is tremendously important in the non-proliferation treaty process as a world leader in science and technology issues and also as a world leader in being able to speak with a morale and historical perspective on nuclear weapons issues,'' Damon Moglen, a Greenpeace official, told a news conference in Tokyo. </P>
<P> Japan has said that it backs indefinite extension of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) -- the global treaty to be discussed at U.N. headquarters from April 17 -- which aims to stop the spread of nuclear arms. </P>
<P> Moglen said, however, that Japan's plutonium programme made its role confusing and complex. </P>
<P> Greenpeace has strongly attacked Japan's nuclear programme which calls for using recycled plutonium. </P>
<P> It criticised Japan's decision to transport its first cargo of reprocessed plutonium from Europe in 1993, without disclosing the route in advance. </P>
<P> Greenpeace protested again this year, when Japan decided to secretly ship high-level radioactive waste. The ship is due to reach Japan in April. </P>
<P> Moglen said that Japan's plutomium programme justifies other countries, even those seen as being a threat, for demanding to have plutonium. </P>
<P> The Greenpeace official said he found it ironic that Japan, the only country to have come under a nuclear bomb attack, should now be in a position to push forward a nuclear programme. </P>
<P> Over 200,000 lives were lost when the United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima in August 6, 1945 and on Nagasaki, three days later. </P>
