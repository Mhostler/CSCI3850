<DATELINE>KATMANDU, Nepal (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  King Birendra Tuesday named Man Mohan Adhikary as Nepal's first communist prime minister, ending two weeks of political deadlock following a general election that left the Himalayan Kingdom with a hung parliament. </P>
<P> ``I have been appointed as prime minister and I will be sworn in tomorrow,'' Adhikary told reporters as he left a meeting with the king, whose late father, King Mahendra, had jailed the communist leader for anti-monarchy activities. </P>
<P> Adhikary's Communist Unified Marxist-Leninist (UML) party won a plurality in the general election and staked a claim to form the nation's first communist government. </P>
<P> But the fate of Adhikary's government remained uncertain as the communists were still wooing rival parties, including one with close ties to the monarch, to try to win enough support to survive a vote of confidence within 30 days. </P>
<P> UML general secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal said the party would announce the new cabinet early Wednesday morning and the king would swear in Adhikary as prime minister soon afterwards. </P>
<P> Adhikary, 74, told a news conference from his party's modest headquarters that communism did not mean an end to Nepal's four-year experiment with democracy. ``Marxism or communism as a philosophy depends on how best we can put it into action according to the realities of the country,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``We have prepared the election manifesto of our party on the basis of the people's multiparty democracy plan. On the basis of this plan, communism will work in Nepal,'' he added. </P>
<P> Adhikary arrived at the palace in the capital Katmandu in an old Toyota car which he had used during the general election campaign, and departed in a black Mercedes-Benz limousine escorted by palace police vehicles. </P>
<P> The communist leader, who has long worn a shaggy beard, had trimmed it into a goatee. </P>
<P> The king, whose powers were dramatically reduced following pro-democracy demonstrations in 1990, was forced to choose the leader of the parliamentary party with the most seats as no lawmaker was able to build a majority coalition during two weeks of closed-door talk among parties. </P>
<P> The UML took 88 of 205 seats in the House of Representatives in the Nov. 15 elections, ahead of the outgoing ruling Congress Party's 83. </P>
