<DATELINE>ARAVA, Israeli-Jordanian border (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Israelis and Jordanians gathered to celebrate a treaty Wednesday along with President Clinton, but it took a blanket of security to keep the peace. </P>
<P> Thousands of soldiers and police from both sides sealed off a hastily erected arena on the border south of the Dead Sea. </P>
<P> Israeli Apache attack helicopters circled overhead as the first of an expected 5,000 guests arrived. </P>
<P> Israeli officials, guarding against feared guerrilla attacks, said guests and journalists would be confined to their assigned areas during the ceremony for security reasons. </P>
<P> ``They will stay,'' insisted Uri Dromi, director of Israel's Government Press Office, ``because three different security services will shoot them down if they move.'' </P>
<P> A week ago, a suicide bomber from the Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas killed 22 people and himself on a Tel Aviv bus -- the highest Israeli death toll in 16 years. </P>
<P> There was a brief alert. Hours before the ceremony, a sniffer dog located something suspicious in refrigerators for cooling bottled water beneath a grandstand. </P>
<P> ``They brought something out of there and took it far, far away, and I am sure they'll check into it,'' said a U.S. Secret Service man. </P>
<P> Security along the main road from the nearby Jordanian Red Sea resort of Aqaba was intense, with soldiers in camouflage uniforms posted 100 yards apart. </P>
<P> Jane Perry, of Cardiff, Wales, a tourist in Aqaba, said: ``It was a bit of a surprise to look out my hotel room window and see a soldier on the wall.'' </P>
<P> At the signing site, the spirit backstage was cheerful if not exactly fraternal. </P>
<P> Lital Bracha, a 20-year-old Israeli army secretary assigned to hand out bottled water, said: ``It's a big step. I hope everything will be OK. With a little effort, Israelis and Arabs can be friends.'' </P>
<P> She had not yet spoken to any Jordanian staff. </P>
<P> ``They are very shy,'' she said. </P>
<P> Mohammed, a 23-year-old barman with a Jordanian catering company, said he had had no time to speak to an Israeli. </P>
<P> ``Peace must be for all of us, Israelis, Jordanians and I hope for all other Arabs.'' </P>
<P> He said his wish was that the treaty would bring Jordan more trade and investment. </P>
<P> In what may be a glimpse of things to come, Israelis seemed to dominate the organization. </P>
<P> Apart from the catering, they provided everything from the portable toilets to the company which inflated the 10,000 balloons to be released during the ceremony in the colours of the Israeli and Jordanian flags. </P>
<P> Israeli security men, including some from a private company, seemed to overwhelm the Jordanian effort. </P>
<P> A Polish-born Israeli, Luba Kravitz, 58, whose son lost a leg in the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, said: ``Of course I'm happy, you can't imagine. If you lose your property or a border, you can always get it back. But when you lose a son, a soldier, you bury them and they're gone forever.'' </P>
