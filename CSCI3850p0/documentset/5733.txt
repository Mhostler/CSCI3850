<P>  World No. 1 Steffi Graf made short work of a long night Thursday. </P>
<P> After waiting more than two hours as the day program ran long, Graf needed just 56 minutes to dispose of American Tami Whitlinger Jones 6-2, 6-1 to earn a semifinal berth at the $430,000 Houston Women's Tennis Championships. </P>
<P> ``I felt I was in control of the points,'' said the top-seeded Graf, who kept her 1995 match record perfect at 16-0. ``I was playing pretty aggressive and I think that worked pretty well for me.'' </P>
<P> ``I'm feeling great on clay and I didn't know if I would before the tournament,'' the 25-year-old German said. ``But I've been feeling so good on the court after two matches. I feel in control of the points, I feel like I'm moving well, and have the patience. I'm feeling good.'' </P>
<P> Graf awaits the winner of the quarterfinal clash between defending champion Sabine Hack and 18-year-old qualifier Nino Louarsabishvili of Georgia. </P>
<P> The fifth-seeded Hack overcame the pesky moonball style of American qualifier Erika DeLone 6-4, 7-5 to reach the quarters. </P>
<P> Seventh seed Sandra Cecchini of Italy and unseeded Wiltrud Probst of Germany also gained the quarterfinals. </P>
<P> Cecchini beat Spain's Maria Sanchez Lopez 6-1, 6-7 (1-7), 6-2 in a two hour, 24 minute baseline battle while Probst defeated compatriot Meike Babel 5-7, 7-5, 6-2. </P>
<P> ``Yeah, I won ugly today,'' said Hack after her one hour, 38 minute struggle. ``It doesn't always have to be pretty, I guess. But I'm pretty satisfied.'' </P>
<P> Hack rallied from down 0-3 in the first set, and 1-3 in the second before beating the 180th-ranked DeLone. </P>
<P> ``It was pretty frustrating because I haven't played those kind of players in a long time, and she played without pace,'' said Hack, ranked 28th. </P>
<P> ``Usually I play topspin players and it's a hard ball, but that's a lob and kind of slow. So I got really impatient and frustrated, you could probably tell by my body language.'' </P>
<P> All that changed quickly as Hack began to draw DeLone off the baseline by hitting sharply angled shots. </P>
<P> ``I think I played a lot too defensive in the beginning,'' Hack said. ``I changed my tactic at love-three, and went for it a litle bit more. I played aggressive whenever I needed to and whatever I needed to do I did, I guess.'' </P>
