<DATELINE>SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Bosnian government troops came under a fierce Serb counter-attack Thursday in the northwest enclave of Bihac with Serb forces in Croatia backing Bosnian Serb kin with artillery and air power, U.N. officials said. </P>
<P> One United Nations spokesman said the escalation in fighting over the past two days posed the most serious threat in recent months to the international peace process for Bosnia. </P>
<P> Bosnian Serb Gen. Manojlo Milovanovic said his troops had recaptured ground in northwest Bosnia and called on Muslim-led Bosnian government forces in the area to surrender, local media reported. </P>
<P> Milovanovic said late Thursday in a statement that the town of Grabez, east of Bihac, had been taken back and the government army faced ``total defeat,'' Bosnian Serb radio and television reported. </P>
<P> The Bosnian Serb army (BSA) general said he would guarantee the safety of all those who surrender, ``especially the civilians, soldiers and junior officers,'' the television reported, quoting his statement. </P>
<P> Rebel Serbs in Croatia hammered government positions in the Muslim enclave with a barrage of artillery as the Bosnian Serb army pressed in from the east, U.N. spokesmen said. </P>
<P> Bosnian state radio reported more than 2,000 shells and mortar bombs had hit the Bihac town area. </P>
<P> ``They have been pulverizing Bihac and its outskirts,'' the radio reported from Sarajevo. </P>
<P> Serbs in Croatia from the self-declared ``Republic of Serbian Krajina'' (RSK) had moved their artillery to the Bosnia border and pounded Muslim-led government positions for the past 48 hours in the Bihac enclave, said a U.N. spokesman. </P>
<P> ``This is not isolated shelling from the so-called RSK as in the past. It has been quite sustained in the past couple of days,'' Michael Williams told reporters in Zagreb. </P>
<P> He said Krajina Serb guns had been blasting areas just north and south of Bihac town, assisting Bosnian Serb forces trying to regain land lost in a Muslim break-out from the enclave two weeks ago. </P>
<P> Wednesday, a Serb plane fired two rockets that destroyed what was believed to be an ammunition store in Bihac town. Bosnian radio said 10 people were killed in Wednesday's raid. </P>
<P> The aircraft took off from an airfield on Serb territory in neighboring Croatia and fired its rockets without entering Bosnian air space, which would have exposed it to the threat of attack by NATO warplanes policing a no-fly zone over Bosnia. </P>
<P> United Nations spokesman Thant Myint-U condemned the ``unprecedented'' air attack by Serb forces based in Croatia, which he confirmed had caused numerous casualties. </P>
<P> Thant said U.N. special envoy Yasushi Akashi was ``gravely concerned by the events of the last 48 hours, which constitute the most serious threat in recent months to any future success of the international peace process in Bosnia-Herzegovina.'' </P>
<P> The fighting threatened to spill over to neighboring Croatia as the government in Zagreb hinted it might break a cease-fire and attack rebel Serbs if they kept bombarding Muslim allies in Bihac. </P>
<P> ``We believe Croatia will do something (against Krajina Serbs) if this continues,'' Croatian Defense Minister Gojko Susak told reporters in Zagreb. </P>
<P> The Serb air raid, along with deteriorating security in Sarajevo, a Serb blockade of aid supplies and an escalation of fighting across the republic, had brought a sense of crisis to a head among U.N. peacekeeping commanders. </P>
<P> ``This is a very serious moment for UNPROFOR's mission and its ability to carry out its mandate,'' said Paul Risley, a spokesman for the U.N. Protection Force in Zagreb. </P>
<P> Muslim forces in Bihac apparently faced Serb advances from the east and south. The United Nations said Bosnian Serbs were moving southwest from the Serb-held town of Bosanska Krupa in the direction of Bihac. </P>
<P> Reuter journalists in the area said Serb forces moving up from further south had reached villages 10 miles from Bihac town. The Bosnian Serb news agency said Serb troops were at one point just 2.5 miles from Bihac. </P>
<P> Relief officials said there was growing concern at the plight of civilians in the Bihac pocket, where aid agencies were experiencing difficulty getting supplies through a Serb blockade. </P>
<P> The Serb onslaught was in response to a Muslim thrust from Bihac two weeks ago which took the Serbs by surprise and put the Muslim forces in control of large areas of territory. </P>
<P> The Muslims have since made advances north and south of Sarajevo, and, in a combined operation with Bosnian Croat forces, taken the central Bosnian town of Kupres. </P>
