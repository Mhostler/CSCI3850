<P>  The European Union and Canada will hold renewed talks Saturday evening seeking to resolve their acrimonious fishing dispute, a Canadian official said. </P>
<P> The meeting comes after pessimism set in late Friday over prospects for an imminent settlement after Spain said Canada had made fresh demands. </P>
<P> ``We are scheduled to have a meeting this evening,'' the official told Reuters. EU officials were not immediately available for comment. </P>
<P> ``I am very pessimistic about reaching agreement because Canada put new demands on the table,'' a Spanish spokesman quoted Spain's ambassador to the European Union Javier Elorza as saying. </P>
<P> Elorza said that Canada wanted to put fisheries inspectors on every vessel authorized to impose on-the-spot fines and had offered the EU only 32 percent of the 1995 total allowable catch for Greenland halibut (turbot). </P>
<P> Earlier officials at the European Commission, which negotiates for the 15-nation EU, said the EU was edging toward an agreement with Canada over fishing off the coast of Newfoundland. </P>
<P> Ottawa charges that Spanish and Portuguese fishermen are endangering stocks of Greenland halibut, the last major commercial species in the region. </P>
<P> Spanish fisherman say they have a right to fish in international waters and Canada has stopped them illegally. </P>
