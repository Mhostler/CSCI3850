<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  NBC television will file a petition with the FCC Wednesday asserting that media mogul Rupert Murdoch's Fox-TV network is illegal because it is foreign owned, The New York Times reported. </P>
<P> The newspaper reported Wednesday that NBC would ask the Federal Communications Commission to rule that Fox must drastically reduce its level of foreign ownership or that all other U.S. networks may seek unlimited foreign investment. </P>
<P> Spokesmen for NBC, Fox and Murdoch were not immediately available for comment on the report. </P>
<P> NBC is owned by General Electric Co, one of the world's largest industrial companies. </P>
<P> More than 99 percent of the equity in Fox is held by Murdoch's Australia-based News Corp, although FCC regulations prohibit foreign ownership of more than 25 percent of a station. </P>
<P> Fox has been raiding affiliates of the three major U.S. networks, convincing them to switch. In September, GE asked the FCC to block a Green Bay Wisconsin station from switching to Fox. </P>
<P> The question of Fox ownership is already before the FCC. Earlier this year, the cash-strapped civil rights group, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, challenged Fox ownership. </P>
<P> In response to the NAACP challenge, Fox asked for a review of the ownership question. The FCC has said since May that a ruling is imminent, The Times said. </P>
<P> But in response to the NAACP action, the FCC demanded that Fox disclose it equity structure, the newspaper said. That disclosure showed Murdoch owned less than 1 percent of the company, but his News Corp. owned more than 99 percent. </P>
<P> Murdoch spent freely to acquire the rights to televised national league football games and acquire more stations. </P>
<P> CBS, which lost the NFL telecast to Fox, and ABC are both supporting NBC's petition, The Times said. </P>
