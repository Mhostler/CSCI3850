<P>  Secretary of State Warren Christopher warned Tuesday that Croatian President Franjo Tudjman ``will be sorry'' if he does not rescind a decision to oust U.N. peacekeepers from his country. </P>
<P> Christopher's comments to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee were his strongest public protest to date on Croatia's plans to force U.N. troops to withdraw by March 31, a move the United States fears will result in all-out war between Croatia and Croatian Serbs. </P>
