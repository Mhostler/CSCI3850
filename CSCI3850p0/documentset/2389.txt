<P>  If more mothers breast-fed their babies it could save a million lives a year but governments are not doing enough to encourage nursing, a medical journal said Thursday. </P>
<P> In a strongly-worded editorial, the Lancet called on politicians, policy-makers and agencies to follow United Nations advice and teach mothers about the benefits of breast-feeding. </P>
<P> ``If a new vaccine became available that could prevent one million or more child deaths a year, and that was moreover cheap, safe, administered orally ...it would become an immediate health imperative. Breastfeeding could do all this and more,'' the Lancet said. </P>
<P> ``Breastfeeding helps to limit fertility and prevent ovarian and premenopausal breast cancer. It helps to prevent sepsis (infection) in newborn babies and gut, chest, ear and urinary tract infections in all young children, and is valuable in the management of... diarrhea.'' </P>
<P> But even when mothers wanted to breast-feed, they were sometimes discouraged from doing so, the journal said. </P>
<P> ``Practices known to be harmful are still common in maternity wards -- e.g. separation of mothers and babies, restrictions on the duration and frequency of breastfeeds, giving babies routine supplements of water or formula, and giving mothers free samples of formula to take home.'' </P>
<P> Instead, mothers should be taught how to breast-feed properly and should be told the health benefits to both themselves and their babies. </P>
<P> ``Families need to be able to make a truly informed choice about feeding their babies. Too often the message they receive is mixed,'' it said. </P>
