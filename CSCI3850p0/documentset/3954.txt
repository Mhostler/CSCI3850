<P>  A missile fired from Norway n Wednesday was part of a scientific research program at a civilian rocket range on an island off northern Norway, a defense official said. </P>
<P> Lt. Col. John Espen of the North Norway defense command at Bodoe told Reuters the missile was fired from Andoya island off North Cape and went down as planned in the Spitzbergen region. </P>
<P> In Moscow, Interfax news agency, quoting a high-ranking Russian air defense official, said a missile had been launched from Norway Wednesday, but it had not reached Russia and had fallen to the ground on Spitzbergen in Norway. </P>
<P> Earlier, Interfax set off a flurry of comment in European capitals and Washington when it had quoted an informed source in Moscow as saying the combat missile, which was violating Russian air space, was destroyed Wednesday morning. </P>
<P> But Russian air defense officials were quick to reject the initial Interfax report. </P>
<P> ``The Moscow and Moscow region air defense did not bring down any missile today,'' said an official said by telephone. </P>
<P> A press spokeswoman for national air defense, a separate unit, said: ``We do not have such information.'' </P>
