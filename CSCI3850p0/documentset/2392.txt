<P>  European Horse of the Year Lochsong turned in a blazing workout Thursday in preparation for Saturday's Breeders' Cup Sprint, running three furlongs in 33 2/5 seconds, the best of the day at the distance. </P>
<P> Two American horses scratched from the seven-race card, both suffering from fever. Call Now, the 5-1 second choice in the Juvenile Fillies, and Pineing Patty, a 30-1 longshot in the Juvenile, were both declared out. </P>
<P> Dispute, the 5-2 second choice in the Distaff, may also be scratched after developing an abscess in her right front foot. </P>
<P> Lochsong's workout was a full two seconds faster than any of the 12 other horses who worked out three furlongs and her time of 46 seconds for four furlongs was also faster than any of the other 20 horses who worked out at that distance. </P>
<P> It came as no surprise to English trainer Ian Balding, who is making his first try at a Breeders' Cup crown. </P>
<P> ``I hope she hasn't done too much, but it is very difficult to rate her once she gets going. She was relaxed and enjoying herself,'' he said of the horse's first taste of the Churchill Downs track. </P>
<P> Kenny Ransom, an 11-year veteran of the clockers' stand at Churchill Downs, said: ``I am in awe. It's the fastest at any distance I've ever seen.'' </P>
<P> Lochsong, ridden by Frankie Dettori, is the 6-1 second-choice in the Sprint, the first of seven races that make up Saturday's $10 million Breeders' Cup series. The favorite in the race, Soviet Problem, had the day off, walking easily in the paddock. </P>
<P> Impressed by the workout, London bookmakers William Hill slashed Lochsong's odds for the race to 7-2. </P>
<P> Balding made no predictions based on the workout, saying the horses from Europe ``are at a tremendous disadvantage'' and adding, ``there aren't many three furlong races.'' </P>
<P> Balding also said the six-furlong Sprint is not his horse's best distance. The 6-year-old filly came in a poor eighth at Ascot in England the last time she went more than five furlongs. </P>
<P> But Lochsong won at seven furlongs in 1991 at Newbury and was a close third at six furlongs in 1993 in the Grade I Haydock Sprint. </P>
<P> Trainer Ron McAnnally said he was sharply dispppointed by having to scratch Call Now, which he felt had a good chance of winning. </P>
<P> ``She's okay, but I don't want to take any chances,'' he said, adding the filly was ``slightly colicky'' overnight. </P>
