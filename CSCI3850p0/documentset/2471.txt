<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Americans voted Tuesday in elections shaping up as a mighty political backlash against Washington, the Democratic Party and Bill Clinton. </P>
<P> Despite prosperity and recent foreign policy successes on the president's watch, polls suggest that a sullen electorate goaded by nasty, negative campaign advertising will sock it to Clinton's Democrats -- seen in most places as the people in charge -- in voting for a new Congress and key state offices. </P>
<P> Day-long voting was scheduled to begin around dawn in most places. Results will emerge throughout the evening, with major poll-closings staggered from 7 p.m. EST in the east to 11 p.m. EST in California. </P>
<P> Late polling suggested the minority Republicans would do a better job of turning out their backers and stood an excellent chance of winning two of the three big prizes: Control of the U.S. Senate for the first time since 1986 and a majority of the 50 state governorships for the first time since 1971. </P>
<P> Some pollsters even saw a chance the Republicans would win back the House of Representatives, a Democratic fiefdom for 40 years, on a riptide of throw-the-bums-out fervor. No U.S. party has lost both houses of Congress at one go since 1954. </P>
<P> Continuing last-minute campaigning in a series of radio and television interviews Tuesday morning, Clinton and Vice President Al Gore were unwilling to concede defeat. </P>
<P> ``Historically there have been losses in midterm elections, but I'm not conceding that. It would not be good for our country,'' Gore told NBC television's ``Today'' Show. </P>
<P> While such an upheaval looked unlikely this year in view of the Democrats' 78-seat House majority, it was plain that a president who took office two years ago promising to produce change was about to have change forced upon him, in spades. </P>
<P> Clinton, trying to dodge a paralyzing blow to his current presidency and his 1996 re-election prospects, raced across the country on an election-eve campaign blitz for those Democrats who would let him into their districts. Many shunned him as a lightning rod for anti-Washington voter fury. </P>
<P> He pluckily likened himself at one point to new heavyweight champion, middle-aged George Foreman -- ``He's still got a terrific punch,'' Clinton said -- and predicted the voters would rally to his side and prove the experts wrong. </P>
<P></P>
<P> The Senate: Thirty-five of 100 seats are up for renewal. The Democrats have a 56-44 majority and have controlled the chamber for all but six of the last 40 years. By coincidence, the Democrats are defending 22 of the 35 vulnerable seats, giving the Republicans wide pickings for the net shift of seven seats they need to regain a majority. The most cautious forecasts concede them at a gain of at least five. </P>
<P> The House: All 435 seats are up. Democrats now hold a 256-178 majority with one independent. Republicans need a net gain of 40 seats to regain the majority for the first time since 1954. Even Democratic-leaning analysts predict a Republican pickup of at least 25 to 30 seats. </P>
<P> State governorships: At stake are 36 of the 50 state governorships, key political offices that wield big influence as campaign power bases in presidential election years. The Democrats now prevail by 29 to 20 with one independent, but most polls say they will lose that majority including possibly such coveted strongholds as Texas and Florida. </P>
<P> If the Democrats lose the Senate, Clinton will have to barter with Republicans to get anything done and will see key committees, which control legislation, chaired by fierce foes. Examples: arch-conservative Jesse Helms of North Carolina running the Foreign Relations Committee and Alfonse D'Amato of New York, a Clinton scourge, heading the Banking Committee. </P>
<P> A loss of the House as well would add up for Clinton to a catastrophe. The new House speaker would be Newt Gingrich of Georgia, who recently characterized Democrats as ``the enemy of normal people.'' He later called that a poor choice of words. </P>
<P> A loss of key governorships -- such as Texas and Florida -- would rob Clinton of campaign machinery key to a 1996 run. </P>
<P> He predicted Democrats would hold both houses of Congress. </P>
<P> ``Jobs are up, unemployment is down, the deficit's down, government is smaller ... When people know these this, I think we're going to do much better than the experts think,'' he said in a CNN interview from the campaign trail Sunday night. </P>
<P> But polls show that if the issue that swept Clinton into office in 1992 was ``the economy, stupid'' -- in his celebrated campaign strategy phrase -- in 1994 it is not. </P>
<P> The issues now are fear of crime, rage at meddlesome unhelpful government, worry about the future -- all issues on which voters say they trust the Republicans more. </P>
<P> An ABC News poll issued on election eve well summarized Clinton's dilemma: his personal popularity has inched up above 50 percent for the first time in over a year in any poll and Democrats have pulled back even with Republicans in general voter support -- but big setbacks are still in prospect. </P>
<P> Those surveyed do not buy Clinton's rosy economic analysis. Only 34 percent said the economy is ``getting better.'' Some 65 percent say it isn't and most prefer Republican leadership. </P>
<P> Last, Clinton was made a punching bag by Republicans everywhere who spent millions on TV ads tying him to local candidates -- often with computerized images in which the local Democrat's face mutates into Clinton's and both are portrayed as far-out liberals hooked on taxes and soft on crime. </P>
