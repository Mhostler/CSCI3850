<P>  President Clinton is urging Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to double the size of the new police force and has offered to train new recruits in the United States as of June 1, a U.S. Embassy source confirmed Saturday. </P>
<P> Shortly after his March 31 visit to the Caribbean nation, Clinton sent a letter to Aristide outlining the training to begin June 1, the Haitian Press Agency had reported Friday. </P>
<P> Clinton was in Haiti to observe the transition of multinational forces in Haiti from U.S. to United Nations control. </P>
<P> U.S. Embassy spokesman Stanley Schrager confirmed Saturday the United States is calling for increase from the intended 3,500 to 4,000-officer force to 7,000. The letter suggested training new recruits at Fort McClellan, Ala., because Haiti's police academy is full. </P>
<P> New recruits would be trained for four months in a program similar to one offered in Haiti. Schrager said it was not yet clear which country would pay the bill. </P>
<P> He said the United States proposed the plan in the interest of domestic security and was not a response to recent statement by Aristide wanting to eliminate the army. </P>
<P> ``This is totally independent of whether there is an army at all,'' said Schrager. ``That is up to President Aristide to determine.'' </P>
