<P>  A German Catholic group Tuesday criticised a Polish-Jewish dispute over the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, saying it did harm to the memories of the 1.5 million people killed in the death camp. </P>
<P> The German chapter of Pax Christi, an international peace group, said the dispute between the Polish organizers of commemorations on January 26 and 27 and leading Jewish groups had overshadowed the memory of the victims' suffering. </P>
<P> ``Nothing can harm the memory of the victims and the dignity of this place as much as the unfortunate dispute about protocol questions that we are now seeing,'' it said in a statement. </P>
<P> Several Jewish groups, charging the two-day commemoration planned by Warsaw did not reflect the unique horror of Jewish suffering, have threatened to hold their own separate ceremony. </P>
<P> Nazi forces murdered around 1.5 million people, most but not all of them Jews, at the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp near Krakow during World War Two. The camp was liberated by Soviet troops on January 27, 1945. </P>
<P> The Pax Christi statement said Germans born after the war still bore a responsibility for Nazi atrocities and had to be careful in discussing issues like Auschwitz. </P>
<P> ``Germans should be reserved about a controversy that could not have existed without the German crimes in Auschwitz,'' it said. </P>
<P> ``Our commemoration must be marked by mourning and shame, and by thankfulness for the liberation that others made possible.'' </P>
