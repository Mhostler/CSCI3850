<P>  A regional executive of the television empire of former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi has been released after being arrested on corruption accusations, his lawyer said. </P>
<P> According to Italian news reports, Maurizio Japicca was released after he agreed to cooperate with investigators. </P>
<P> Japicca, 55, director of Berlusconi's Fininvest group in Naples, was arrested Wednesday morning on a warrant alleging corruption, illegal party financing and false accounting. Fininvest has denied the accusations. </P>
