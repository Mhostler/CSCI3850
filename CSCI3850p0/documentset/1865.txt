<P>  Kuwaitis, long used to bad news from the emirate's former occupier, showed no sign of panic Friday at news of an Iraqi troop advance toward the border, but many expressed irritation and concern. </P>
<P> ``I wouldn't leave Kuwait if (Iraqi leader) Saddam Hussein comes in again,'' said civil servant Mohammad Haddad. ``I was steadfast during the occupation and if he comes in, I will be defending my country.'' </P>
<P> ``What is more important than one's homeland? It is bride, it is family, it is honor.'' </P>
<P> Some residents of the affluent oil-exporting emirate of 1.7 million people said the news made them remember images and feelings from the seven-month Iraqi occupation of 1990-91. </P>
<P> ``Are the days of anxiousness coming back?'' asked one housewife. </P>
<P> ``I pray God to destroy his house,'' one Lebanese expatriate said of Saddam upon hearing the news. </P>
<P> The U.S. government reported that Iraqi troops and armor moved toward the Kuwaiti border Friday and President Clinton ordered U.S. troops on alert for possible duty in Kuwait. </P>
<P> Residents crowded around television sets showing pictures of Clinton advising Saddam not to repeat the ``mistakes of the past.'' Others telephoned friends to discuss the news. </P>
<P> Some gasoline stations were busy with motorists filling up just in case Iraqi troops reach the border. But there were no long lines of cars. </P>
<P> On one of the main roads leading to Saudi Arabia, traffic was normal for that time of night and most cars carried only the driver. </P>
<P> After the 1990 invasion, many Kuwaitis drove their families to safety in Saudi Arabia before returning to their country to salvage whatever they could from the destruction of the occupation. </P>
<P> Information Minister Sheikh Saud Nasser Saud al-Sabah said Kuwait was ready for any emergency, even ``the worst possibilities.'' </P>
<P> The minister called on the media not to exaggerate their assessment of the situation. </P>
