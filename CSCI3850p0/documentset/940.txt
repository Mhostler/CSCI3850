<P>  The Major League baseball strike entered its 11th day Monday as the chief representatives of the players and owners met with a mediator in advance of a resumption of bargaining talks Wednesday. </P>
<P> Players Association head Donald Fehr and owners chief negotiator Richard Ravitch met with John Calhoun Wells, director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, to discuss ground rules for the negotiations. </P>
<P> The talks, which will be the first held since the day after the players went on strike, will begin at 10:30 a.m. EDT at the mediation service's Manhattan offices, Wells said. </P>
<P> Mediators will meet separately with the committees of the owners and the players Tuesday to further prepare for Wednesday's session, Wells added. </P>
<P> A total of 142 games have been officially canceled through Monday in the second-longest halt ever to a major league season. In 1981, a 50-day strike canceled 712 games. </P>
<P> Fehr, who had said he welcomed the inclusion of owners at the bargaining table, expressed impatience with the process. </P>
<P> ``The players were ready to sit down and negotiate but we are waiting for Ravitch, who has run this train from the beginning,'' Fehr told reporters. </P>
<P> ``This is about management wanting to reduce player prices and Ravitch is the hatchet man.'' </P>
<P> Bud Selig, the chairman of baseball's Executive Council, announced Monday a list of 12 owners and club officials who will attend the meetings. Selig said no more than five or six members of the group will participate in talks at one time. </P>
<P> Selig said the group was comprised of Bill Bartholomay, Braves; Paul Beeston, Blue Jays; David Glass; Royals; John Harrington, Red Sox; Stan Kasten, Braves; Andy MacPhail, Twins; Drayton McLane, Astros; Jerry McMorris, Rockies; Stuart Meyer, Cardinals; David Montgomery, Phillies; Jerry Reinsdorf, White Sox, and Wendy Selig-Prieb, Brewers. </P>
