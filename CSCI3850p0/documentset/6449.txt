<P>  Venezuelan authorities in the sweltering coastal state of Anzoategui Wednesday banned female civil servants from wearing mini-skirts. </P>
<P> Justifying her edict against bare legs, the local government's human resources director, Lidia Salazar de Rojas, said mini-skirts and shorts were ``disrespectful'' and ``hardly serious.'' </P>
<P> ``It is unjustifiable that government employees come to work practically nude,'' she was quoted as saying by the official news agency Venpres. </P>
<P> Anyone caught defying the ban will be barred from entering her office and deducted a day's pay, Salazar added. </P>
