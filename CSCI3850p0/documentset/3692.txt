<DATELINE>FLORENCE, Colo.(Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Attorney General Janet Reno Tuesday dedicated the highest maximum security prison in the federal system, dubbed the ``Alcatraz of the Rockies,'' which is expected to house some of the most notorious prisoners including Mafia chief John Gotti. </P>
<P> ``There is no excuse for violence in this country. There is going to be punishment,'' Reno said said at ribbon cutting ceremonies at the facility 90 miles south of Denver. </P>
<P> ``There is a beginning of a real shift in America on doing something about violence,'' she said. ``This prison will help protect Americans.'' </P>
<P> The new Administrative Maximum Security Penitentiary will house inmates once imprisoned in the Marion Federal Penitentiary, 350 miles south of Chicago. </P>
<P> Marion replaced Alcatraz in 1963. Inmates from the maximum security unit there will be transported to the Colorado facility, a stark complex with the most sophisticated high-tech surveillance equipment. </P>
<P> ``A large percentage of the inmates coming from Marion have been involved in murders in other institutions, 45 percent have (committeed) one or more murders in other institutions,'' said Warden Bill Story. </P>
<P> Some 24 percent are serving life sentences, according to prison figures. The average sentence is 36 years. </P>
<P> Incarcerated prisoners will enjoy some of Colorado's most beautiful scenery. On a good day, the tip of Pike's Peak is visible to the north. </P>
<P> But the facility is anything but a mountain resort. Security is extremely tight. Reporters were photographed and all equipment was inventoried. </P>
<P> Visitors had to pass thorugh a metal detector and had their hands stamped with an ultraviolet dye to prevent inmates from impersonating visitors. </P>
<P> As part of her tour, Reno visited the kitchen, cellblocks and a recreation area. But no inmates were visible during the tour. Inamtes are being transported to Marion in small groups, prison officials said. </P>
<P> Fifty-one inmates have been moved from Marion to the Colorado facility and another 250 are expected. The full capacity of the prison is 484. </P>
<P> Prison officials declined to disclose the names of inmates, but Gotti, who is serving a life sentence for murder and racketeering, is expected to be among them. </P>
<P> Charles Harrelson, father of actor Woody Harrelson, who was convicted of murdering a judge, is also among those expected to live in the 90-square foot cells. </P>
