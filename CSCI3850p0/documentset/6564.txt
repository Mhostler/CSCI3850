<DATELINE>BERLIN, Germany (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  German vandals have desecrated a Soviet Army memorial, pushing over hundreds of gravestones of soldiers who died in World War II, police said Monday. </P>
<P> All but five of 352 graves at the cemetery in the eastern city of Zwickau were toppled by untraced vandals who, unlike far-right groups responsible for similar incidents in recent years, did not daub political slogans over the site. </P>
<P> Soviet memorials in eastern Germany, as well as Jewish cemeteries or buildings, have been popular targets for young extreme-right nationalists since Germany reunited in 1990. </P>
<P> The last Russian troops stationed there went home in 1994. </P>
