<P>  President Clinton telephoned Russian President Boris Yeltsin Monday and urged a peaceful settlement of the conflict in Chechnya, where the Kremlin has been fighting secessionist rebels, the White House said. </P>
<P> The president made his phone call after Russian officials in Moscow said warring Russian and Chechen commanders had agreed on a cease-fire for heavy weapons. But the White House statement did not mention the cease-fire. </P>
<P> Clinton, who spoke to Yeltsin for about 20 minutes, restated that the United States recognizes Chechnya as part of Russia, but said he and others in the international community were concerned about the bloodshed, the White House said. </P>
<P> ``President Clinton reiterated the importance of an end to the bloodshed and the start of a process leading to a peaceful settlement of the dispute,'' said the statement issued by White House press secretary Mike McCurry. </P>
<P> ``He (Clinton) stated once again that Chechnya is part of Russia, but noted the legitimate international concern over the humanitarian toll the fighting has taken,'' the statement said. </P>
<P> ``He encouraged President Yeltsin to continue to work with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to alleviate the suffering in Chechnya and move to a political settlement there in accord with international standards.'' </P>
<P> Clinton placed the call about 1 p.m. EST, the White House said. It said he expressed ``strong U.S. support for the continuation for reform in Russia.'' </P>
<P> The discussion centered on the conflict in Chechnya, which has tarred Yeltsin's reformist image at home and abroad and raised questions around the globe as to whether other countries should continue to support Russian reforms with financial aid. </P>
<P> Moscow sent thousands of troops into Chechnya Dec. 11 to quell Chechnya's three-year independence bid. </P>
<P> Clinton has voiced strong support for Yeltsin despite the Chechnya crisis. But last week Clinton offered $20 million in U.S. humanitarian and refugee aid to help alleviate distress in Chechnya. </P>
<P> Clinton last week said that he and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, in their conversations with Yeltsin, ``have both made clear our fears about the corrosive effect the conflict in Chechnya can have on democratic market-oriented reform.'' </P>
