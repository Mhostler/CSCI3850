<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The United States has launched a top-level diplomatic effort to find a U.S. disaster relief expert who is missing in or near Russia's breakaway Chechnya region, the State Department said Tuesday. </P>
<P> Spokesman Nicholas Burns said Secretary of State Warren Christopher had written to Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, asking him to put all the resources of the Moscow government at U.S. disposal. </P>
<P> Defense Secretary William Perry had also written to Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, Burns said. </P>
<P> Frederick Cuny, last heard of on April 9, had been working for the Soros Foundation to set up a hospital in Dagestan near Chechnya and to bring humanitarian supplies to people left homeless by the war between Moscow and Chechen separatists. </P>
<P> Two diplomats from the U.S. embassy in Moscow -- a political officer and a consular officer -- were due to reach Chechnya Tuesday via neighboring Ingushetia, Burns said. </P>
<P> It will be the first time that U.S. officials have gone to Chechnya since Russian forces attacked the region Dec. 11 in an operation which drew sharp condemnation from Washington. </P>
<P> The action is still continuing, although Russian President Boris Yeltsin appeared poised Tuesday to suspend combat in Chechnya on April 27, before next month's World War II victory ceremonies when world leaders will descend on Moscow. </P>
<P> ``From the beginning we've urged an immediate end to the fighting. We hope that this halt in the fighting will lead to a lasting cessation of hostilities,'' the State Department said in a statement. </P>
<P> ``We urge all involved to take advantage of the OSCE (Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe) assistance group to work toward a lasting settlement of the conflict,'' the statement added. </P>
<P> Burns said the diplomats were ``going to remain there to try to work on the ground with the interior ministry, with the Russian military forces and other civilian officials of the Russian government to try to find (Cuny).'' </P>
<P> ``They don't have any other business there,'' he added, in an apparent attempt to head off speculation that the two officials might be involved in political mediation. </P>
<P> Burns said while the United States had no way of contacting General Dzhokhar Dudayev and other separatist leaders, ''obviously one of the objectives of sending people to Chechnya is to talk to Chechens, not just Russians.'' </P>
<P> He said there were a number of theories on what might have happened to Cuny, but all were speculation. </P>
