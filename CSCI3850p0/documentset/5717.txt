<P>  Dallas Cowboys tackle Erik Williams and a friend were arrested and questioned Thursday about an alleged sexual assault on a 17-year-old woman at Williams' home, police said. </P>
<P> Williams, 26, and Roderick Carson, also 26, from Madison, Wis., were being held at the Lew Sterrett Jail in Dallas, a police spokesman said. They were arrested around 2 a.m. after the teen-ager called police and said she had been sexually assaulted at the football player's north Dallas home. </P>
<P> When police arrived at the house, Williams denied the woman was there, but police heard a noise and spotted her at a window as they were leaving. </P>
<P> The spokesman said police were preparing formal charges, which were expected to be filed by Friday. The girl's name has not been released. </P>
<P> A Dallas Cowboys spokesman said the team had no comment. </P>
<P> Williams did not play football last season because of injuries suffered late last year in an auto accident. </P>
