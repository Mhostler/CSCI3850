<P>  Ugandan troops are digging in on their frontier to stop fighting spilling through after an escalation in the bush war across the border in Sudan. </P>
<P> Journalists visited two battle sites in the bush of southern Sudan and found victorious mainstream SPLA rebels on frontlines, with clear evidence of fierce fighting days ago. </P>
<P> A rebel commander reported a big battle last Monday, saying it was the first concerted attempt to thrust into Uganda by a combined force of Sudanese troops and their Ugandan and Sudanese militia allies. </P>
<P> Commander Oyay Deng Ajak of the mainstream Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) told reporters his men repulsed an attack by Sudanese troops allied with Ugandan and Sudanese militia. </P>
<P> Civil war has raged in south Sudan for 11 years. </P>
<P> ``This is the first concerted thrust...the first major operation they (Sudanese troops and allies) have conducted and we repelled them,'' he said at a heavily-defended SPLA base. </P>
<P> More than 20 bodies lay rotting in the sun, mutilated by scavengers including vultures amid shell casings and abandoned anti-tank rockets. </P>
<P> On the Ugandan frontier, four miles to the south, more than 100 Ugandan soldiers were digging trenches and setting up machinegun positions Sunday. </P>
<P> Ajak and other SPLA officers said a total of more than 100 Sudanese soldiers, fighters of a breakaway SPLA faction and members of Uganda's rebel Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) were killed in the two-pronged assault on Pagee. </P>
<P> ``There are 94 enemy dead on the ground but we estimate more than 100 were killed because some bodies were taken away by them as they retreated,'' said Ajak, adding that five SPLA fighters were killed and 19 wounded. </P>
<P> He said the attackers retreated after 12 hours of battle to the government-held village of Parajok, 13 miles northwest of Pagee. Parajok was captured from the SPLA by government troops on Jan. 5. </P>
<P> He said the aim of the Khartoum government attack was to disperse more than 75,000 displaced people just north of the Ugandan border, capture the key junction at Pagee and advance into northern Uganda and down to Kampala. </P>
