<P>  A New York congressman who was in a Chinese restaurant when a man walked in and shot the cashier, said Monday it may have been 30 minutes before emergency services responded to his calls for help. </P>
<P> ``I spoke to the EMS, to the 911 system that put me on to the ambulance people at least three, possibly four times pleading with them to get an ambulance there,'' Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., said. ``I was trying not to look at my watch to try and be as helpful as I could but it probably seemed like at least a half hour, I couldn't tell you the exact time.'' </P>
<P> Three people were killed Sunday night and four wounded, including two policemen, in shootings at the Tung Shing House restaurant and during a four-block chase through the middle class neighborhood of Rego Park in Queens borough of New York City. </P>
<P> The suspect, described by police as an Asian man in his 20s, walked into the restaurant at about 9.30 p.m. and without saying a word, shot the woman cashier. The suspect and a bystander were killed in a shootout at a nearby parking garage. </P>
<P> Ackerman, who was eating in the restaurant with his family, made the calls to the emergency services on his cellular telephone after hearing gunfire. </P>
<P> Police said they had not established a motive for the shooting of the cashier, whose husband was found shot dead Monday at his home about two miles from the restaurant. </P>
<P> ``It is unknown at this time whether he committed suicide or was shot by someone else,'' a police spokesman said. </P>
