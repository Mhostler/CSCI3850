<P>  Scientists may have discovered a way to deliver a ``one-two punch'' to some cancerous tumors, a report published Monday said. </P>
<P> Scientists said laboratory tests on mice showed combining two cancer-fighting treatments, monoclonal antibodies and interleukin-2, significantly supresses tumor growth and prolongs survival. </P>
<P> The antibodies make T cells more receptive to interleukin-2, which in turn stimulates the cells to fight the tumor. </P>
<P> ``It's like a one-two punch,'' said Dr Manikkam Suthanthiran at the Rogosin Institute, New York Hospital Cornell Medical Center. ``The net consequence is that the T-cells are more active killer cells.'' </P>
<P> Traditionally, high doses of toxic interleukin-2 are used to activate the anti-cancer properties of T cells and the new approach, if found to work on humans, could mean doctors would be able to use less of it in treating cancer. </P>
<P> ``I think it can be refined and I think it can be applied to a clinical situation,'' Suthanthiran said in a phone interview. </P>
<P> The findings will be published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. </P>
