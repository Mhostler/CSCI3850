<P>  The European Commission said Thursday that Canada had not responded to an invitation to send a representative to Brussels to try and avert a fisheries clash in international waters off Canada's east coast. </P>
<P> Canada, which issued an ultimatum this week to European fishing vessels to leave the disputed area or risk being boarded and seized, said Wednesday that about 15 Spanish vessels were still in the zone. </P>
<P> European Commission President Jacques Santer phoned Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien Wednesday night inviting him to send an emissary as soon as possible. </P>
<P> ``We regret that the Canadian mission won't take place,'' Commission spokesman Nikolaus van der Pas said. </P>
<P> If the Canadian decision was linked to a move towards a unilateral fishing ban in the disputed zone this would be unacceptable because such action would be illegal, the spokesman added. </P>
<P> But Van der Pas said the Commission, which negotiates on fisheries on behalf of the 15-nation European Union, remains ready to hold talks and hopes they will resume. </P>
<P> Canada is trying to stop a surge in EU catches of Greenland halibut, also known as turbot, which it says are threatening stocks of one of the last commercial species in the region. </P>
<P> The dispute flared up after the EU rejected its share of a 27,000-tonne 1995 quota for Greenland halibut fixed by the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) and instead set itself a much higher limit. </P>
<P> The EU has already exceeded its NAFO quota of 3,400 tonnes. </P>
