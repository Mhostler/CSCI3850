<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Texan Bob Estes shot a nine-birdie, 9-under-par 62 Thursday to lead the $1 million Texas Open by one stroke after the first round. </P>
<P> Alone in second place was 1986 PGA champion Bob Tway, whose 63 was his best round in years. Five players shared third place at 6-under 65. </P>
<P> Estes, 28, combined a good ball-striking round with strong putting on Thursday. Only three of his nine birdies came on a putt longer than eight feet, and he missed three other birdie chances inside eight feet. He had just 26 putts all day. </P>
<P> ``I thought I had it perfect with my putter a month ago in Milwaukee,'' said Estes, referring to a tournament where he finished third despite highly erratic ball-striking, ``but I've actually managed to make even more progress with my putting.'' </P>
<P> Estes, arguably the best player on tour without a victory, has been closing in on that first win all year, with seven top 10 finishes and $520,560 in 1994 earnings. </P>
<P> Said Estes: ``Not winning would be frustrating if I wasn't making so much progress. But I'm not worried about the first win, because I plan on winning a lot of tournaments.'' </P>
<P> Tway started his round by sinking a five-foot putt for an eagle 3, and then made three more birdies to turn in 31 strokes. </P>
<P> Said Tway: ``I've been out there pressing a lot, not getting much out of my rounds. But getting off to a good start today, I was more relaxed. It was the first time I've shot a decent round in a while. It's a nice feeling.'' </P>
<P> The field at the Texas Open lost one of its strongest attractions when Paul Azinger had to withdraw because of back spasms. Azinger said it was particularly disappointing to withdraw because, after an eight-month hiatus for cancer treatment, he was finally getting his game back. </P>
