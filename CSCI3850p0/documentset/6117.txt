<P>  South Africa's ruling African National Congress (ANC) said Friday an amnesty for thousands of prisoners announced by President Nelson Mandela would ease prison overcrowding only temporarily. </P>
<P> ``While the amnesty will help in the short term to alleviate the serious overcrowding in our prisons, previous amnesties have shown that this is not a long-term solution,'' said Carl Niehaus, an ANC legislator and its spokesman on prisons. </P>
<P> ``The ANC urges the government to make an all-out effort to develop more sustainable solutions,'' he told a news conference. </P>
<P> Niehaus said conditions in South Africa's prisons, where 118,000 prisoners were held in 250 jails, were among the worst in the world. </P>
<P> He said about 15,000 prisoners sentenced to six months or less would immediately benefit from the amnesty and in the longer term this figure could rise to 30,000. </P>
<P> Asked how the government could justify freeing thousands of prisoners while the country was gripped in a crime wave, Niehaus said effective rehabilitation programs in prisons could not begin while prisons were overcrowded. </P>
<P> In a warning to prisoners due be released under the amnesty, Niehaus said any who committed fresh crimes would be firmly dealt with. </P>
