<P>  U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC) officials warned Sunday that a potential drop in revenues may force it to scale back operations between 1996 and the turn of the century. </P>
<P> The USOC expects to begin the next cycle -- 1997-2000 -- after the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta with a comfortable cash position of $60 million. </P>
<P> But the organization will have to borrow money next year, as it prepares for the Pan-American Games and World University Games, because nearly half the revenues anticipated in a current four-year budget of $409 million won't be available until 1996. </P>
<P> ``Next year is our biggest expense year,'' said USOC Treasurer Sandra Baldwin, noting that expenses will reach a 1993-1996 peak of $110 million, with revenues stuck at only $89.9 million. </P>
<P> But the biggest financial challenge faces the organization after 1996, when its four-year budget balloons to $500 million and contributions from sponsors fall off as the Olympics move overseas. </P>
<P> ``Just like Fortune 500 companies are doing, you're looking towards the best interest of the United States Olympic Committee and you have to look at productivity and accountability,'' USOC President LeRoy Walker said at a news conference held during a USOC board meeting here. </P>
<P> Given the fiscal uncertainty about the post-1996 period, USOC officials decided to postpone consideration of a proposed 1997-2000 budget until April to put the National Governing Bodies (NGBs) for individual Olympic sports on notice about the potential for retrenchment. </P>
<P> ``We need to look at Atlanta; we need to get a little better insight into what the economy will look like,'' said Walker. </P>
<P> ``We will be looking, though there's no direct change coming from it, to the big changeover in Washington in terms of how Wall Street responds to the change and how sponsors in their own involvement for the next four to six years will respond. </P>
<P> The emerging revenue picture for the post-1996 period could encourage the USOC to curtail participation in international sporting events, including Olympic contests in which U.S. athletes are not expected to make a strong showing. </P>
<P> Walker said coin income projections already have been reduced, adding that everything from the Pan American Games and World University Games are being scrutinized for potential cutbacks. </P>
<P> ``The organization needs time to prioritize where it intends to spend its money in the next four-year cycle following Atlanta,'' said USOC Chief Financial Officer John Samuelson. </P>
<P> USOC officials said they do not intend to cut back on sporting fetes used by U.S. teams as qualifying events for the Olympics. </P>
<P> But Walker said all international competition from the Pan American Games to the World University Games and even the Olympics are ``on the table'' for potential cutbacks. </P>
<P> ``I don't think we aren't going to send teams ... but there are ways to do it other than sending teams that haven't made qualifying standards,'' the USOC president said, when asked about the prospects for future Olympic participation. </P>
<P> Asked later if he favored sending U.S. teams to the Olympics with athletes for all competing slots, said Walker, ``All slots, regardless? No, I've never been in favor of that.'' </P>
