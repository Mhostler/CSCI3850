<P>  Kim Jong-il, new leader of North Korea, is so sensitive about being short that he wears high-heeled shoes, a Japanese magazine revealed Monday. </P>
<P> Little is known for sure about the pudgy, mysterious Kim, who took the helm of the Stalinist state following the death of his father, President Kim Il-sung, on July 8. </P>
<P> Now, however, the weekly Shukan Bunshun reports that for years he has sent out aides looking for skilled shoemakers who could make him appear taller. </P>
<P> It backs up the report with two photographs clearly showing Kim Jong-il wearing platform shoes. </P>
<P> At first Kim had the shoes made in Switzerland and Austria, but later turned to artisans in his own country, the magazine said. </P>
<P> One North Korean craftsman who gave him particular satisfaction was rewarded with a Mercedes Benz, the report added. </P>
<P> Without revealing its sources, Shukan Bunshun said Kim Jong-il stands five feet two inches tall and weighs 187 pounds. </P>
