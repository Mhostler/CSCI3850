<P>  Libyan Foreign Minister Omar Mustafa Al-Montasser said Friday that his country would seek to compel ``colonialist states'' to compensate former colonies for the resources and wealth which he said had been plundered from them. </P>
<P> In a speech to the General Assembly, he urged adoption of ``a historic resolution condemning colonialism and forcing former colonial powers to compensate their former colonies.'' </P>
<P> This would prevent the re-emergence of colonialism and ``the powerful from blackmailing and oppressing the weak in the future,'' he said. </P>
<P> Al-Montasser spoke at length against sanctions which the Security Council first imposed on Libya in 1992 and strengthened last year for failing to hand over for trial in Britain or the United States two men indicted in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, in which 270 people were killed. </P>
<P> The sanctions, which he said had caused Libya an estimated $4.5 billion in economic damage, are also intended to press it to cooperate fully with a French investigation into the bombing of UTA Flight 772 in 1989 over Niger, in which 171 people died. </P>
<P> Al-Montasser said Libya accepted an Arab League proposal last March for the two suspects to be tried by Scottish judges, under Scottish law, at the seat of the World Court at The Hague. </P>
<P> Libya's position was supported by the non-aligned movement and the Organization of African Unity, he added. </P>
<P> ``All that Libya wants is for the trial to be fair and just, free from any emotional or media influences, in addition to the availability of all guarantees consistent with the norms and legality and international law, which Libya has observed and applied.'' </P>
<P> He said the Assembly should call on the three states concerned -- the United States, Britain and France -- to show flexibility and enter into a dialogue with Libya aimed at reaching a peaceful settlement. </P>
