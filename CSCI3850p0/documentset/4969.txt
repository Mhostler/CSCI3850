<P>  Larissa Lazhutina collected an unprecedented fourth gold medal Thursday at the Nordic skiing world championships as Russia raced to victory in the women's 4x5-kilometer relay. </P>
<P> Russia crossed the finish line more than 90 seconds faster than the field in the four-lap race in sunny, 40-degree weather but had to await a jury ruling on whether its first skier had broken the rules. </P>
<P> The five-member jury, responding to an inquiry by the Italian team, decided Russian Olga Danilova had not violated any rules by apparently cutting inside a course marker on the first leg of the race. </P>
<P> Russia's winning time was 53 minutes, 47.6 seconds. </P>
<P> Norwegian Anita Moen-Guidon overtook Anette Fanquist by one-tenth of a second in the final sprint to earn the silver for Norway in 55:18.6. Sweden took bronze -- its first medal of the championships -- with a 55:18.7 clocking. </P>
<P> Italy, a pre-race pick for a medal, was fourth and Germany finished fifth in the 14-team field. </P>
<P> Lazhutina, 29, said: ``Before these championships, I wanted to win one medal -- gold, silver or bronze -- and to start in the relay. There was no way to expect I would win four gold medals but, obviously, this is a most happy time for me.'' </P>
<P> Lazhutina has won all three women's indidvidual races so far in the championships having earlier taken the 15-km classical, the 5-km classical and the 10-km freestyle pursuit. Saturday she will race in the 30-km freestyle which concludes the women's events. </P>
<P> The Italian inquiry -- organizers were meticulous in pointing out no official protest was filed -- was scoffed at by other skiers. </P>
<P> ``It was just one track. If it were five seconds (between first and second), maybe okay but the Russian girls are the best,'' said Swede Anna Frithioff, who skied the first leg. ``To make a protest of this is nonsense.'' </P>
<P> Inger Helene Nybraaten, who skied the second leg for Norway, said: ``The Russians have proven in every competition they are the best girls,'' she said. </P>
<P> Earlier, Frithioff said: ``You couldn't tell it was a course marker and if she's disqualified, I probably should be, too, because I cut inside the marker...and I was leading at that point. And I've heard others cut inside it, too.'' </P>
