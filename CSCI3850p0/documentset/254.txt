<P>  Brazilian presidential election front-runner Luiz Inacio ``Lula'' da Silva said Friday an anti-inflation plan devised by his rival would keep Brazil ''stable in poverty''. </P>
<P> ``We have every possibility of winning the elections in the first round,'' Lula told a news conference in which he dismissed suggestions that his campaign for the presidency was flagging as support rose for his rival, ex-Economy Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso. </P>
<P> Lula was counterattacking in response to an opinion poll published Friday showing Cardoso had cut his left-wing rival's lead in the electoral race to nine percentage points from 17. The first round of the elections is scheduled for October 3. </P>
<P> The Datafolha poll showed Cardoso rising four points to 25 percent, while Lula fell to 34 percent from 38 percent. </P>
<P> Analysts said Cardoso, the candidate preferred by the business community, had been boosted by the July 1 introduction of a new currency, the real, under a government economic stabilization plan he had helped create as economy minister. </P>
<P> Lula attacked the Cardoso plan: ``I continue to say that what was stabilized (by the plan) was poverty in Brazil,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``We don't just want a stable currency. We want money in the pockets of the workers,'' he added. </P>
<P> Lula, the presidential candidate of Brazil's Workers' Party (PT), said parts of the government's economic stabilization plan leading up to the launch of the real had reduced state funds available for education and hit workers' pay packets. </P>
<P> President Itamar Franco, who supports the candidadcy of his former minister Cardoso, hopes the introduction of the real, backed by Brazil's foreign reserves, will cut back inflation, which was running at 50 percent a month in June. </P>
<P> At the news conference, Lula strongly defended his vice presidential running mate, socialist Senator Jose Paulo Bisol, who has come under fire from opponents who have accused him of financial irregularities and nepotism. </P>
<P> ``Bisol is our candidate for vice president, and he deserves every confidence ... I continue to say that I have complete confidence in Bisol,'' Lula said. </P>
<P> He said it was too early to say whether the accusations against Bisol were damaging his campaign and said the PT and its allies believed the senator should be given a chance to defend himself. </P>
