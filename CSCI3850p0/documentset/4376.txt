<P>  The United States gave the Palestinian Authority in the self-ruled Gaza Strip five ambulances Thursday as part of a $250,000 package to upgrade medical services. </P>
<P> Riyad al-Zaanoun, in charge of health in the Palestinian Authority set up after Israel handed over the Gaza Strip to self-rule in May, thanked U.S. Consul-General Edward Abington at the ceremony in Gaza. </P>
<P> ``I appreciate this symbolic present. We badly need ambulances and emergency cars,'' Zaanoun said. The package includes five ambulances and six other emergency vehicles. </P>
<P> Abington said: ``We are very pleased to be able to provide this assistance and we are sure that it is going to be put to a good use. It is a symbolic thing provided by the U.S. to the Palestinians.'' </P>
<P> Abington said the United States had given the Palestinian police 200 vehicles and planned to give them 200 more. The Gaza Strip is home to nearly a million Palestinians. </P>
