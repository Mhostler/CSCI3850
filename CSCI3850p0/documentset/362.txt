<P>  Thirty-two Cubans drowned when a tugboat stolen by a group of would-be refugees sank after colliding with a vessel trying to intercept it, an official newspaper said Saturday. </P>
<P> In an article that put the blame for the disaster squarely on those who stole the boat, the ruling Communist Party daily Granma said a total of 63 people set out in the tugboat from Havana port before dawn on July 12. </P>
<P> Authorities on the Caribbean island had already said that 31 people were rescued after the boat capsized seven miles north of Havana. They had not disclosed the number of people orginally on board, however. </P>
<P> Granma's lengthy article, which quoted several survivors of the disaster, stressed that the collision and sinking of the stolen tugboat was an accident, and accused those who stole the boat of being responsible for the loss of lives. </P>
<P> The dead included many women and children. It was the worst incident involving Cubans trying to leave the island illegally, often using fragile rafts to make the perilous sea journey to the United States. </P>
<P> The Granma report, which made frequent mention of the poor condition of the stolen tugboat, was clearly aimed at countering suggestions that the sinking 10 days ago was deliberate. </P>
<P> ``Investigations indicate that in this sad accident there were no deliberate intentions on the part of any of the three tugboats that tried to stop the thieves,'' Granma said. </P>
<P> ``The responsibility of those who organized the attempt, one of whom died and the other of whom is subject to judicial investigation, is clearly demonstrated,'' it added. </P>
<P> It said the stolen vessel, a 115-year-old wooden boat certified not fit for navigation outside Havana port in May, was leaking before it set out. </P>
<P> The article said the stolen vessel, the 13 de Marzo, was pursued out of the port first by one and then by two more tugboats, the Polargo Cinco, and Polargo Dos and Polargo Tres, which used fire hoses to try to stop the stolen vessel. </P>
<P> The steel-hulled Polargo Cinco took action at one point to avoid a collision when the stolen tugboat tried to ram it, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> At one point, it said, the pursuing vessels surrounded the renegade tug and its stern collided with the Polargo Dos. The impact caused the aging boat to start sinking within minutes, Granma said. </P>
