<P> SEOUL, South Korea - Censors in South Korea have given a film distributor a real ``Nightmare before Christmas'' by barring the Disney movie of that name on the grounds it is too violent. </P>
<P> The distributor, Buena Vista International, said Wednesday it had applied to the Korean Public Performance Ethics Committee to introduce the film to local screens next week. </P>
<P> ``According to Korean regulations, foreign animated movies should be suitable for all ages. They ruled that it was too cruel for children,'' said Kim Sang-il, local manager of Buena Vista. </P>
<P> Kim said the Ministry of Culture was reviewing the rules on animated films and he was hopeful the ban would be lifted. </P>
<P> ``I would guess we could get an import license before the end of the year, but we may have to change the title to the 'Nightmare After Christmas','' he said. </P>
<P> The ``Nightmare Before Christmas'' was released in the United States last year. </P>
<P> Film distributors face strict moral and political censorship in South Korea and a complicated web of bureacracy, including a quota system regulating the ratio of foreign to local films shown at cinemas. </P>
