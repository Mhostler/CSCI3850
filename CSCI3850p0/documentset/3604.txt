<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  South Africa's Housing Minister Joe Slovo, a white who dedicated his life to fighting apartheid, died peacefully in his sleep Friday after a long battle with cancer. </P>
<P> Slovo, 68, was chairman of the South African Communist Party (SACP) and a leading figure in President Nelson Mandela's African National Congress (ANC). </P>
<P> ``The nation mourns the passing of a great South African patriot. Joe Slovo dedicated his life to the struggle for justice, democracy, and freedom in our country,'' Mandela said in a statement. </P>
<P> Born into a Jewish family in the Lithuanian hamlet of Obelai in May 1926, Slovo was ``public enemy number one'' to many right-wing white South Africans brought up during the Cold War to regard the Kremlin as the source of all evil. </P>
<P> Blacks hailed him, however, for his fight against apartheid. His first wife, Ruth First, was killed in Mozambique by a package bomb sent by South African agents. </P>
<P> He came to South Africa at the age of nine, but spent 27 years in exile before returning in 1990 after then president F.W. de Klerk legalized the ANC and the communist party, which he had joined at the age of 16. </P>
<P> ``I was away for 27 years,'' Slovo said in a 1993 interview, referring to his years in exile. </P>
<P> ``I couldn't be quoted or seen, yet blacks were singing songs about me. </P>
<P> ``They were singing songs about me because the enemy regarded me as public enemy number one, therefore it followed for blacks that I must be okay -- so I became public friend number one.'' </P>
<P> He joined the communist party at the age of 16, when the movement was still legal, and married Ruth First seven years later. </P>
<P> Slovo obtained a law degree at the University of Witwatersrand and became involved in campaigns against the National Party that took office in 1948 and began entrenching white rule. </P>
<P> He met Mandela at the university. </P>
<P> ``He was terribly anti-communist,'' Slovo said. ``We spent long hours outside the law library having the most terrible arguments.'' </P>
<P> The apartheid government first acted against Slovo in 1954 in terms of the Suppression of Communism Act, banning him from being quoted or from attending public meetings. He was arrested and released twice, in 1956 and 1960. </P>
<P> When the ANC, allied to the SACP, formed its armed wing Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation) in 1961, Slovo was among the first members. </P>
<P> He was on a mission outside the country in 1963 when police swooped on a farm north of Johannesburg, arresting most of his comrades on the high command of Spear of the Nation. </P>
<P> Slovo remained in exile, spending several years in London before moving to Mozambique, where Ruth First was killed. </P>
<P> During his years in exile Slovo was appointed chief of staff of Spear of the Nation and general secretary of the SACP. In 1985 he became the first white member of the ANC national executive board. </P>
<P> A burly man with a shock of white hair until he started to waste away through bone marrow cancer, Slovo played an active role in the democracy negotiations that led up to South Africa's historic all-race elections in April last year. </P>
<P> Mandela named Slovo housing minister in his government of national unity, an important post as the administration sought to redress the inequities of decades of apartheid rule. </P>
<P> The president, who saw his old friend for the last time Thursday night, said Slovo, who remarried after Ruth First's death, died peacefully in his sleep at his home shortly before 3 a.m. (8:00 p.m. EST). </P>
<P> Mandela extended his sympathies to his wife, Helena, and children Shaun, Jillian and Robyn. </P>
