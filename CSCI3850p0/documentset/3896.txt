<DATELINE>TORONTO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A man convicted in the brutal sex slaying a decade ago of a 9-year-old girl was cleared Monday after a DNA test found he was not the killer. </P>
<P> Guy Paul Morin, found guilty in a 1992 retrial of murdering his next-door neighbor Christine Jessop, was acquitted by the Ontario Court of Appeal in the longest- running murder case in Canadian history. </P>
<P> Morin, surrounded by a crush of reporters outside the court, said he was ecstatic with the acquittal, which ended a 10-year battle to prove his innocence. </P>
<P> ``I know I didn't do it. I did not kill Christine Jessop, it's as simple as that, and finally DNA has exonerated me 100 percent,'' he said, his voice breaking. ``It's about time.'' </P>
<P> The girl was abducted on her way home from school in October 1994. Her decomposing remains were found three months later in a farmer's field about 30 miles west of her home in the village of Queensville, north of Toronto. An autopsy found she had been sexually assaulted and stabbed to death. </P>
<P> The appeal court took just 10 minutes to overturn the conviction after a DNA test conducted at the request of the prosecution proved that semen stains found on the girl's underwear were not from Morin. </P>
<P> DNA testing, which matches genetic coding and is as individual as a fingerprint, is a key part of the prosecution case against former football legend O.J. Simpson, whose trial in Los Angeles was hearing opening arguments Monday. </P>
<P> Morin was acquitted at his first trial in February 1986 but was convicted in July 1992 after the Supreme Court of Canada ordered a retrial. He spent a total of about 18 months in jail. </P>
<P> Morin said he wanted an inquiry into his case. ``What happened to me was wrong. It could happen to any of you ... We must not have this happen again.'' </P>
<P> However, he said he had not decided yet whether he would seek compensation or launch a lawsuit. </P>
<P> ``I don't know of anything when it comes to monetary value that could ever help me and my family for the suffering over 10 years. I'd like to believe it's possible.'' </P>
<P> Christine's brother Ken Jessop told reporters he felt ''hatred and distaste'' toward the police and the prosectors who had gotten the wrong man. </P>
<P> ``I hope he (Morin) sues the asses off them,'' Jessop said. </P>
<P> ``Somebody's out there who knows something, somebody's out there that committed a heinous, brutal crime,'' he said. ''Christine is still dead and there is still no person ... accused.'' </P>
