<DATELINE>GLASGOW, Scotland (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Scottish medical officials Saturday started tracking down patients who may have been exposed to the virus that causes AIDS by a surgeon who has tested positive for the infection. </P>
<P> They said a hotline for anxious patients was jammed with calls just hours after the doctor's name was released. </P>
<P> George Browning, a leading ear specialist, agreed to be named publicly to narrow the list of past patients who may need reassurance, the Greater Glasgow Health Board said. </P>
<P> Browning learned he was HIV-positive earlier this week, they said. </P>
<P> ``With such a tumultuous effect on his own situation, I think this decision was a remarkably quick and courageous one,'' said Dr David Goldberg, who was helping to track down patients. </P>
<P> Health Board officials emphasized that in similar cases worldwide there had not been one recorded instance of a patient being infected by a surgeon. </P>
<P> In the United States, an estimated 19,000 patients had been exposed to HIV-positive doctors or nurses with no recorded cases of infection. </P>
<P> Several patients of a Florida dentist were found to be infected after he died of AIDS, although whether he infected them has been disputed. </P>
<P> In line with British guidelines, Browning will not be able to operate on patients but will be able to continue consulting and teaching. </P>
