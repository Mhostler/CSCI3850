<P> Formal final results are expected to be reported later this week. </P>
<P> The new parliament will have 16 more seats than the previous 656-seat Bundestag because Germany's complex election law provides extra seats for any party whose constituency candidates outscore the party's overall result on state lists. </P>
<P> Provisional figures showed the CDU-led coalition had 48.4 percent of the vote, down from 54.8 percent in 1990. </P>
<P> The main opposition parties scored a combined 48.1 percent. Turnout was 79.1 percent compared with 77.8 four years ago. </P>
