<DATELINE>HONOLULU, Hawaii (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A jury Wednesday ordered the estate of the late Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos to pay about $770 million in compensatory damages to 10,000 Filipino dissidents said to have suffered torture and other atrocities under his rule. </P>
<P> The U.S. District Court panel had ordered the estate to pay $1.2 billion in punitive damages last February. </P>
<P> The jury of six men and three women took three-and-a-half hours to reach Wednesday's decision, contained in 14 pages detailing different class action and individual damages. </P>
<P> The damages are in line with those recommended by a special court judiciary officer, retired federal magistrate Judge Sol Schreiber, who said earlier this month that the victims and their families should receive $767 million in compensation. </P>
<P> Schreiber arrived at his figure by sampling 137 victims, among them Bartolome Alcantara, a tenant farmer and father of six who was shot and killed by Marcos forces in 1981 in front of his pregnant wife while holding their one-year-old child. </P>
<P> The atrocities are alleged to have taken place between 1972 and 1986 when Marcos was overthrown in a popular ``people's revolt.'' </P>
<P> Marcos, who ruled the Philippines for 20 years, fled to Hawaii where he died three years later. His body, which had been housed in an air conditioned crypt in Honolulu, was flown back to his home province of Ilocos Norte in 1993. </P>
<P> The civil suit marked the first time a case was ever tried in a U.S. court claiming human rights violations in another country. U.S. District Judge Manuel Real, who presided over the case, allowed the trial to be held under U.S. jurisdiction because Marcos was a resident of the United States at the time of his death. </P>
<P> Honolulu attorney Sherry Broder, who appeared for the plaintiffs, said after Wednesday's award she was very happy for the victims of the Marcos regime. ``I hope this sends a message to other dictators who abuse their victims,'' she said. </P>
<P> Her co-counsel, Philadelphia lawyer Robert Swift, also expressed pleasure at the award but injected a note of caution, saying collecting all the money might be ``problematical.'' </P>
<P> He said the Marcos estate, which includes the late dictator's widow, Imelda Marcos, had known assets of $400 million in Switzerland and $600 million in the Philippines, but the Philippines government also had claims on that money. </P>
<P> ``At this point we call on the Philippines government to sit down with us and reach an amicable resolution. I don't think the Philippines government can deprive its own human rights victims of fair compensation that's been awarded by the jury,'' Swift said. </P>
<P> Oklahoma attorney William Johnson, who represented the Marcos estate, said he was not surprised by the award and added that he would appeal it on the grounds that the Honolulu court did not have the jurisdiction to hear the claim. </P>
<P> Apart from such an appeal, Wednesday's award ends a marathon trial that began in September 1992, when the jury found Marcos' estate liable for damages after two weeks of gut-wrenching testimony from victims of the regime. </P>
<P> The award phases of the trial were then delayed by lengthy legal wrangling. </P>
