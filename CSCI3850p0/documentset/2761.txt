<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Clinton went jogging on the streets of Washington Tuesday for the first time since a gunman sprayed the White House grounds with bullets in an alleged assassination attempt. </P>
<P> Clinton, on a shorter than usual jog, ran less than two miles as he did a couple of laps near the Lincoln Memorial before running back to the White House. The president normally jogs between three and five miles per outing. </P>
<P> A White House aide said the president's quick retreat was due to a scheduled early morning breakfast with Vice President Al Gore. </P>
<P> Clinton's jog marked the first time he has run outdoors in Washington since Oct. 29, when Francisco Duran, 26, allegedly peppered the north side of the presidential mansion with bullets from a Chinese-made semiautomatic rifle. </P>
<P> No one was injured in the attack, during which the president was watching a college football game on television. </P>
<P> Duran, a Colorado hotel worker, had been recently released from a federal prison after serving time for assault. </P>
<P> He is charged with trying to assassinate the president, possession of a firearm as a convicted felon, destruction of U.S. property, assaulting a federal officer and the use of a firearm in a violent crime. </P>
<P> The U.S. attorney in the case has refused to discuss in detail the basis for the attempted assassination charge, but said he thought there was ``sufficient evidence'' to support it. </P>
<P> Duran, ordered held without bond after being found competent to stand trial, pleaded not guilty last week to the assassination charges. </P>
