<P>  As government officials from the 34 countries scheduled to attend next week's Americas summit negotiate last-minute agreements on trade issues, Latin American indigenous leaders are denouncing free trade as a scourge for their land and people. </P>
<P> ``This economic model can only bring more misery to our peoples,'' read an open letter released Wednesday by the Indian leaders after an international conference in Bogota. </P>
<P> The letter, signed by representatives of more than eight million indigenous people throughout South and Central America, said free trade would benefit multinational corporations at their expense. </P>
<P> ``This integration will ... reinforce the economic dominion of monopolies and the political dominion of one country over an entire continent,'' it said, referring to the United States. </P>
<P> Free trade would only accelerate the pillage of natural resources and worsen the exploitation of Indian labor, it added. </P>
<P> Heads of state from most of the region's countries are to participate in the Dec. 9-11 Summit of the Americas in Miami. </P>
<P> Officials from participating countries are holding preliminary meetings to prepare a series of communiques to be signed at the summit, including a call for the creation of a free-trade zone stretching from Canada to Argentina. </P>
<P> The indigenous leaders, who came from Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela and Panama to attend the three-day conference, will send a three-member committee to the summit. </P>
