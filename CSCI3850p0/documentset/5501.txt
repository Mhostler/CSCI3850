<P>  The Royal Cambodian Armed Forces has no plan to attack and take any key Khmer Rouge strongholds this year but will try to narrow the rebel's controlled territory, a senior army commander said. </P>
<P> ``Now, I tell the truth -- we will not attack Pailin, Anlong Veng, Malai this year but we will next year,'' Lt-General Nhek Bun Chhay told reporters at Pochentong airport late Wednesday. </P>
<P> Nhek Bun Chhay is the deputy chief of staff of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF) and is in charge of military action in the north and northwest. </P>
<P> He claimed recent military action against the Khmer Rouge guerrillas was designed only to reduce the outlawed faction's controlled territory rather than an all out offensive. </P>
<P> ``We divide (the country) into three zones -- white zone, grey zone and black zone. The black zone -- Anlong Veng, Pailin... the areas completely controlled by the Khmer Rouge. </P>
<P> ``The grey zone is the conflict areas and white zone is the areas completely controlled by the government. We're trying to expand the white zone and eradicate grey zone and narrow the black zone,'' Bun Chhay said. </P>
<P> A senior army official based in the country's north told Reuters earlier this week that Cambodian military units had withdrawn ``100 percent'' from the rebel's northern base of Anlong Veng after failing to capture the stronghold. </P>
<P> Bun Chhay admitted the government army had not taken Anlong Veng as previously claimed but had been based ``eight kilometres (five miles) and in some directions six kilometres (3.8 miles) from the (Along Veng) base.'' </P>
<P> Despite the government's denial of plans to take any key rebel base or stronghold, government spokesman Sieng Laprese on Wednesday told a news conference fierce fighting between the Khmer Rouge and government units was on the increase. </P>
<P> Bun Chhay warned that as long as the country remained in poverty it would not be easy to rid it of the Khmer Rouge. </P>
<P> ``It takes time to eradicate the Khmer Rouge -- to talk about the Khmer Rouge we must talk about poverty (in the country side),'' he said. </P>
