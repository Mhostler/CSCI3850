<P>  The death toll from the torrential rains that ravaged Haiti last weekend rose to more than 100 Tuesday and officials said the figure could still go higher once the devastation was cleared. </P>
<P> ``Our latest (toll) here is over 100,'' said Yvon Neptune, spokesman for President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. ``Yesterday it was about 80, today it is more, 100, maybe 125.'' </P>
<P> Neptune said it was very difficult to find and collate information in the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation, due partly to the poor roads and communications with the areas hit. Many observers acknowledged an accurate death toll would never be known. </P>
<P> ``It is more an estimate than a hard figure,'' Neptune said of the government's total. </P>
<P> Hundreds of American soldiers were helping in the clean up, a spokesman said. </P>
<P> American engineers were helping to clear roads and build bypasses, military advisers were working closely with the Aristide administration. The military had also provided helicopters to the government and aid groups. </P>
<P> Prime Minister Smarck Michel said the government would release $3.29 million in disaster relief as well as $25 million from the the United States. </P>
<P> The storm hit Haiti last weekend with torrential rains besieging the capital and the south for more than 24 hours. </P>
<P> Torrential rains set off floods that swept mud down streets and into houses and cut off roads and bridges. </P>
<P> Some streets were filled with rocks. Buses and cars had to be dug out of a sea of mud and debris that engulfed them. </P>
