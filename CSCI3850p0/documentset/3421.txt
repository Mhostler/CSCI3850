<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  An Arab suicide bomber blew himself up in Jerusalem early Sunday, injuring about nine people at a bus stop outside Israel's main convention center, police said. </P>
<P> It was Sunday and Christmas Day, but for Jews and Muslims at the heart of the Middle East conflict it was a normal working day. The site of the attack is a major stop for buses taking people to work and school and soldiers to army bases. </P>
<P> ``It was a very strong explosion,'' Israeli Police Chief Assaf Hefetz said, adding that it was a wonder most of the wounded appeared to be lightly injured. At least two were in fair to serious condition, hospitals said. </P>
<P> There was no immediate claim of responsiblity. </P>
<P> Militant Muslim Palestinians opposed to Israel's 1993 peace deal with the Palestine Liberation Organization have carried out a number of suicide attacks against Israeli targets. </P>
<P> In the biggest blast in October, a bus bomber from the Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas killed himself and 22 people in the heart of Tel Aviv. </P>
<P> ``I sat at the bus stop and five meters (yards) away I hear a boom and glass all over the place and food and stuff flying all over the place. The guy was in the street, everyone's crying and everyone's going nuts. It's crazy,'' a young man who saw Sunday's blast said. </P>
<P> ``I saw a man without legs and arms,'' he said. </P>
<P> Another witness said: ``I had just found a seat in the little bus stop and I just walked away, five feet away, and all of the sudden I hear a massive explosion and I turned around and I see glass everywhere. </P>
<P> Police said the bomber was wearing a belt filled with explosives, and it was unclear whether he intended the bomb to go off at the bus stop or somewhere else. </P>
<P> The blast occurred about 6.10 a.m. (11:10 p.m. EST Saturday) outside Binyanei Haooma, the international convention center, near the western entrance to Jerusalem and the main highway to Tel Aviv. </P>
<P> The street would have been far busier an hour later, and witnesses speculated many more people would have been hurt if a bus filled with soldiers had not moved out of the way seconds before the blast. </P>
<P> ``I was an eyewitness,'' a man said. ``I came this morning and air force men were getting on the bus and they in fact got on the bus, the bus went forward four or five meters (yards) and suddenly there was a blast, a boom, a giant explosion and that was it -- the back window of the bus blew out. </P>
<P> ``I don't know what would have happened if the bus would have stood in the same place or didn't come at all because there were a lot of soldiers there,'' the witness said. </P>
<P> The rush of ambulances taking people to hospital and the glass and debris strewn over the street contrasted sharply with the scene six hours earlier in nearby Bethlehem, the birthplace of Jesus, where thousands of pilgrims celebrated Christmas. </P>
<P> Residents said the atmosphere in Bethlehem's Manger Square was the most festive in years, reflecting progress in Israel's peace talks with Jordan and the Palestinians. </P>
