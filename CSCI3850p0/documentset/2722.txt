<P>  Horse-race enthusiast Andrew Lloyd-Webber, back in Britain a day after the Broadway debut of his musical Sunset Boulevard, saluted his latest star at Ascot Saturday. </P>
<P> Unbeaten Raymylette, running in the colors of Sir Andrew's wife Madeleine, produced an outstanding performance in the First National Bank Gold Cup. </P>
<P> Carrying top weight, Raymylette jumped immaculately, leading from start to finish to beat Couldn't be Better by a length with Beachy Head third. </P>
<P> The display was impressive enough to prompt a leading British bookmaker to introduce Raymylette at 20-1 for the Cheltenham Gold Cup in March. </P>
<P> ``He is a very exciting horse who has come forward from being a top novice to winning his first handicap. He's beaten some very good horses and will probably be very good himself,'' said Lady Madeleine. </P>
<P> Raymylette, confidently ridden by Mick Fitzgerald, was fitted with a special bit to prevent him running too freely in front. </P>
<P> Trainer Nicky Henderson said: ``That was a good performance. He's gone a good gallop with a lot of weight on his back.'' </P>
