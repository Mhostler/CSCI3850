<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A top Federal Reserve policymaker said Thursday she saw no reason to ``push the panic button'' over slowing U.S. economic growth and voiced optimism that the economy was heading for a sought-after soft landing. </P>
<P> ``I still feel comfortable that things are on track,'' Fed Governor Janet Yellen told Reuters in an interview. ``I remain quite optimistic we're getting the soft landing we hope for.'' </P>
<P> The U.S. central bank has raised interest rates seven times in the past 15 months in an effort to prevent the economy from overheating and engineer a soft landing of sustained growth with low inflation. </P>
<P> But a recent spate of economic statistics -- including Thursday's news of a 0.4 percent drop in retail sales last month -- has raised some fears that the Fed may have gone too far and risked pushing the economy into recession. </P>
<P> ``We certainly see clear signs of a slowdown,'' Yellen said. ''(But) we laid the groundwork for a slowdown and a lot of what we're seeing here ... should not surprise us.'' </P>
<P> Yellen acknowledged that the once high-flying economy may be losing altitude slightly faster than the central bank expected, but added that the evidence was not conclusive. </P>
<P> ``Let's not push the panic button,'' she said. ``It's hard to gauge at this stage whether it's precisely in line with our expectations or a little more than we expected.'' </P>
<P> She said the economy may experience a quarter or two of weak growth as car companies work off excess inventories. </P>
<P> Some analysts think growth could tail off in the current quarter to one percent or below, from 2.8 percent in the first and a torrid 5.1 percent in the final three months of 1994. </P>
<P> But Yellen saw reasons to believe that could prove to be the ``pause that refreshes'' and that growth could pick up later in the year to a more sustainable pace of about 2 3/8 percent. </P>
<P> ``I think the economy maintains a lot of strength,'' the Fed policymaker said. </P>
<P> Consumer confidence remains high. And the recent steep fall in long-term interest rates and the drop in the dollar should cushion the economy by spurring home-building and exports. </P>
<P> The news on inflation too has largely been good. </P>
<P> ``So far, inflation seems to be well-behaved,'' Yellen said. ''It really has stayed well-contained.'' </P>
<P> Commodity prices are levelling off or declining. Producers have not passed through much of the higher raw material costs they've had to pay onto consumers. And the growth of wages and benefits has been moderate, thanks largely to slowing health care costs. </P>
<P> Bond prices have rallied and long-term rates have dropped as signs of a softening economy have multiplied and inflation fears have ebbed. Yellen called the market's response ``probably not inappropriate.'' </P>
<P> ``The behavior of the market is like an automatic stabilizer for the economy,'' she said. ``It kicks in when the economy is going down ... and softens the impact.'' </P>
<P> While voicing her belief that the economy was heading for a soft-landing, Yellen said there were risks. The economy could slow more than the Fed expects, raising the risk of recession. Or growth could pick up strongly and fan inflation. </P>
<P> ``I'm losing more sleep on the downside (at the moment),'' she said. ``But I don't want to convey the idea that there is not sleep to be lost on both sides.'' </P>
