<P>  U.N. envoy Rolf Ekeus was quoted Tuesday as saying he feared Iraq had ruined its chances of obtaining a review of sanctions imposed four years ago after it invaded Kuwait. </P>
<P> Ekeus, the Swedish head of the U.N. Special Commission in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, told the daily Aftenbladet that Iraqi troops movements to the Kuwaiti border were a tragedy for the suffering Iraqi people. </P>
<P> ``This is very unfortunate, I had been convinced that sanctions would have been eased,'' said Ekeus, adding Iraqi President Saddam Hussein headed meetings he had in Baghdad last week. </P>
<P> ``Even the U.S. was prepared and the question (of easing sanctions) had moved on to another stage,'' before Iraq moved troops to near the Kuwaiti border, the 59-year-old Swede said. </P>
<P> ``This is a tragedy for the Iraqi people,'' he added. Ekeus said last week's meetings -- when he was attacked personally by the Iraqi media -- were tough. </P>
<P> ``Saddam himself led the meeting. There was a very gloomy and depressing atmosphere ... There was a very hard tone from Baghdad's side, threatening. It was as though they wanted to force us to make certain statements and I refused to accept, most of all under threat,'' he told the Stockholm daily from New York. </P>
