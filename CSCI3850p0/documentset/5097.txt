<P>  An inventor has sued the producers of the hit film ``Forrest Gump'' claiming they used his process for dubbed speech lip movements without permission, his lawyers said Wednesday. </P>
<P> Richard Bloomstein of Highland Park, Ill., sued Paramount Pictures Corp. and Industrial Light and Magic, operated by LucasFilm Ltd., alleging an infringement of U.S. patent laws. </P>
<P> The law firm of Phelan, Pope, Cahill and Devine said Bloomstein invented a special effects process that makes lip movements in films with dubbed dialogue look more realistic. </P>
<P> In ``Forrest Gump,'' which was nominated for 13 Oscars including Best Picture, the central character played by Tom Hanks appears in historical film footage chatting with three former presidents and the late Beatles member John Lennon. The suit alleges it was Bloomstein's process that made the scenes look as realistic as they did. </P>
<P> The suit was filed this week in federal court in Chicago following several months of unsuccessful discussions with Paramount and Industrial Light and Magic, the law firm said. </P>
