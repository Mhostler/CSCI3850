<P>  Canadian police are reopening an investigation into the sex slaying of a 9-year-old schoolgirl after the man convicted of the crime was cleared Monday by a DNA test. </P>
<P> Guy Paul Morin, found guilty in 1992 of murdering his next-door-neighbor Christine Jessop a decade ago, was acquitted by the Ontario Court of Appeal in the longest-running murder case in Canadian history. </P>
<P> Ontario Attorney General Marion Boyd said Morin, who had fought for 10 years to clear his name, would be compensated for his ordeal as soon as possible. </P>
<P> Boyd also said she was in favor of a full inquiry into the case, which has raised concerns about public confidence in the justice system. </P>
<P> ``Mr. Morin's exoneration means the killer is still at large. It is crucial that any inquiry not prejudice the reopening of a police investigation,'' she said. </P>
<P> Morin, 34, was surrounded by a crush of reporters shortly after the appeal court took just 10 minutes to quash his conviction based on a DNA test which proved that semen stains found on Jessop's underwear were not from Morin. </P>
<P> He had served a total of about 18 months in jail for the brutal killing. </P>
<P> ``I know I didn't do it. I did not kill Christine Jessop, it's as simple as that, and finally DNA has exonerated me 100 percent,'' he said, his voice breaking. ``It's about time.'' </P>
<P> The girl was abducted on her way home from school in October 1994. Her decomposing remains were found three months later in a field about 30 miles west of her home in the village of Queensville, north of Toronto. An autopsy found she had been sexually assaulted and stabbed to death. </P>
<P> Earlier DNA tests, which match genetic coding and are as individual as fingerprints, had proved inconclusive. </P>
<P> ``If this level of sophistication in DNA testing had been an option 10 years ago, this entire tragedy would have been averted,'' Boyd said in a statement. </P>
<P> DNA testing, which matches genetic coding and is as individual as a fingerprint, is a key part of the prosecution case against former football legend O.J. Simpson, whose trial in Los Angeles was hearing opening arguments on Monday. </P>
<P> ``Today's decision ... means that the murder of Christine Jessop must be considered unresolved,'' said Trevor McCagherty, chief of police for the Durham region, which is handing over the inquiry to Metropolitan Toronto police. </P>
<P> ``It is important that the investigation begin as soon as possible and be considered a new investigation,'' he said. </P>
<P> Boyd said she is retaining Alan Gold, former chief justice of the Superior Court of Quebec, as a special adviser in the Morin case. </P>
<P> ``While obviously money cannot wipe away the years of pain and turmoil caused to Mr Morin and his family, I hope Mr. Gold will have the details of a fair and just financial compensation package worked out with Mr. Morin and his lawyers as quickly as possible.'' </P>
<P> Morin was acquitted at his first trial in February 1986 but was convicted in July 1992 after the Supreme Court of Canada ordered a retrial. </P>
<P> ``What happened to me was wrong. It could happen to any of you...we must not have this happen again,'' Morin said in calling for an inquiry into his case. </P>
<P> However, he said he had not decided yet whether he would seek compensation or launch a lawsuit. </P>
<P> ``I don't know of anything when it comes to monetary value that could ever help me and my family for the suffering over 10 years. I'd like to believe it's possible.'' </P>
<P> Christine's brother Ken Jessop told reporters he felt ''hatred and distaste'' towards the police and the crown prosectors who had got the wrong man. </P>
<P> ``I hope he (Morin) sues the asses off them,'' Jessop said. </P>
<P> ``Somebody's out there who knows something, somebody's out there that committed a heinous, brutal crime,'' he said. ''Christine is still dead and there is still no person ... accused.'''' </P>
