<P> Six people were killed instantly when one of the bombs hit a packed video hall, he said without giving an exact number of wounded. </P>
<P> The guerrillas resumed their attack on the town early on Friday as officials were preparing to evacuate four seriously wounded people to hospital in Thailand. </P>
<P> In recent weeks, Cambodian government forces have been attacking guerrilla positions to the south of Poipet in what Cambodian leaders say is an attempt to keep the rebels bottled up in their strongholds near the Thai border. </P>
