<P>  Mexico's former president pressed for freer world commerce to spur economic growth but warned that ''trade wars'' will be a major challenge in the future, reports this week's issue of Newsweek. </P>
<P> In an interview with the international news magazine, Carlos Salinas De Gotari said greater economic growth in today's more tightly-knit world can only be achieved through freer trade. </P>
<P> But he said that ``trade wars'' are the most important challenges facing the world today. He told Newsweek he hoped other countries will sign the GATT world trade treaty to reduce trade barriers, recently ratified by the United States. </P>
<P> ``The expectations brought by the cold war can only be fulfilled by high economic growth. And in today's world of globalization, the only way we can have economic growth is through freer trade,'' Salinas said in the short interview in the magazine edition to go on sale Monday. </P>
<P> Salina's steered Mexico's entry into the North American Free Trade Agreement with the United States and Canada earlier this year. During his six-year term as president that ended with August 1994 elections, he has pushed for free trade and far-reaching economic reforms. </P>
<P> The former president also emphasized that freer trade would open up job opportunities at home and reduce migration. </P>
