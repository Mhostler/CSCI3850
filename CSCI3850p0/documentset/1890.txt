<P>  The bulk of an amphibious assault group carrying 2,000 U.S. Marines has arrived in the northern Gulf near Kuwait to prepare for possible hostilities with Iraq, a senior U.S. military official said Sunday. </P>
<P> The four-vessel U.S. Navy group, led by the helicopter-carrying amphibious assault ship Tripoli, carries a self-contained fighting unit including all the equipment needed to go swiftly into action if required. </P>
<P> The deployment closer to Kuwait is part of an overall strengthening of military forces in the region to deter Iraq, whose troops have massed near Kuwait's border. </P>
<P> Kuwaiti radio said that 4,000 U.S. Marines had arrived in Kuwait. </P>
<P> ``Currently we're taking precautionary measures to get forces into the area,'' the official said. </P>
<P> The U.S. aircraft carrier George Washington, which recently left the Gulf for the Mediterranean, was expected to return to the area, sailing through the Suez Canal into the Red Sea during the night between Sunday and Monday. </P>
<P> Its fighters and bombers would be able to fly over Saudi Arabia, refueling in mid-air if necessary, or the carrier could steam around the Arabian peninsula to the Gulf in a matter of days. </P>
<P> The Navy also has an arsenal of Tomahawk cruise missiles, used against Iraq during the 1990-91 Gulf War and again in January 1993. </P>
<P> ``We could probably put 150 (Tomahawk) missiles on target pretty quickly,'' the official said. </P>
<P> The cruiser Leyte Gulf and the destroyer Hewitt, both carrying Tomahawks, are already in the Gulf, and vessels accompanying the George Washington will add to the current Tomahawk capacity. </P>
<P> ``We are clearly in a position now that if (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein does something, we can punish him,'' Marine Corps Lieutenant-General John Sheehan, director of operations for the Pentagon's Joint Staff, said in Washington late on Saturday. </P>
<P> British and French forces are also in the area, and the British frigate HMS Cornwall arrived in Kuwait's waters Sunday. </P>
