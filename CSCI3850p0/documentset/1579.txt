<P>  A huge Romanian airline jet tumbled into a brief steep dive near Paris' Orly airport Saturday before the pilot managed to regain control and make a normal landing, eyewitnesses said. </P>
<P> Airport officials said there was no damage to the Tarom airline plane, an Airbus A310 carrying 173 passengers and 11 crew, which landed at Orly on a flight from Bucharest at about one p.m. local time. </P>
<P> ``Everybody was scared. We thought the plane was going to crash on the town. Everybody was shouting,'' Lucien la Grante, mayor of the nearby town of Villeneuve St Georges, told France-Info radio. </P>
<P> ``It was practically immobile before it got into a spin, and I saw some smoke coming out of the left engine. I have never seen a plane go into a dive so close to the ground. I don't know how they got out of it,'' another witness said. </P>
<P> An airport spokesman ruled out an explosion or any fire on board the jet. </P>
<P> Witnesses said the pilot suddenly opened the throttle to get out of the dive and the jet landed safely. </P>
<P> There was no immediate comment from Airbus. </P>
<P> The Airbus consortium consists of Aerospatiale of France, British Aerospace Plc, DAGA, a division of Germany's Daimler-Benz AG, and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA of Spain. </P>
