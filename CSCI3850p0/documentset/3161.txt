<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Clinton will address the American people Thursday attempting to further explain the direction he would like to take the country in the future, officials said Monday. </P>
<P> White House officials said the president would deliver the speech at 9 p.m. EST from the White House. Officials were hoping the three television networks, CBS, ABC and NBC, would carry the speech live. </P>
<P> ``It's a chance for the president to talk with the American people about his goals for the next two years, and the direction he would like to take the country,'' one senior White House official said. </P>
<P> Clinton said Sunday he would like to propose a tax break for the middle class if the government can afford it, and Thursday would be an opportunity for such an announcement if he and his top aides can find savings in the budget in time to do so. </P>
<P> The president is attempting to get some of his own proposals out for public consumption in advance of the January takeover of Congress by the newly-elect Republican majority. </P>
<P> Republicans have also made clear they would like to provide tax relief to Americans. </P>
<P> Clinton's senior advisers have prepared bold options for major cuts and restructuring of government departments and agencies in an effort to carry through with Clinton's commitment for a ``smaller, more effective government.'' </P>
<P> Clinton is expected to make his decisions on these items by Christmas. He also is expected to make some cabinet and staff changes in the near future to give his administration a new look as he attempts to recapture the political center. </P>
<P> The decision for Clinton to make a speech Thursday came at the end of a day in which the White House expressed uncertainty whether such an address would take place. </P>
<P> White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said the speech would be one in a series by the president explaining where he wants to take the country. </P>
