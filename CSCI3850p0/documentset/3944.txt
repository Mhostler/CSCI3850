<DATELINE>MELBOURNE, Australia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Arantxa Sanchez Vicario easily beat unseeded Naoko Sawamatsu of Japan 6-1, 6-3, and set up a potentially easy semifinal against another unseeded player, Marianne Werdel Witmeyer, who swept aside Mexico's Angelica Gavaldon at the Australian Open on Wednesday. </P>
<P> Sanchez Vicario, who will take the number one ranking from the injured Steffi Graf if she wins the year's first Grand Slam, has not lost a set and dropped only 18 games in her five matches on her way to the last four. </P>
<P> ``I think I am a better player than I was here last year,'' said the Spaniard, who lost to Graf in straight sets in the final but then went on to win the French and U.S. Opens. </P>
<P> Sawamatsu, 21, who reached her first Grand Slam quarter-finals despite learning her family home had been destroyed in last week's Kobe earthquake, believes Sanchez Vicario is playing well enough to win. </P>
<P> ``As far as mental toughness is concerned, placing the ball and movement around the court, she would have to be the number one player,'' Sawamatsu said after her defeat. </P>
<P> The 26th-ranked player battled desperately to stay in the match after tamely losing the first set. </P>
<P> But though she chased for every ball and clawed back to 4-3 with a service break in the second set, she just could not compete with Sanchez Vicario's deep groundstrokes and steady serve. </P>
<P> The best rally of the match, with both players making desperate returns, brought up match point for Sanchez Vicario when Sawamatsu netted a forehand and the Spaniard wrapped it up with a service winner. </P>
<P> If Sanchez Vicario beats the 47th-ranked Werdel Witmeyer as expected, she will not have played a seeded player on her way to the finals, where she will meet the winner of the other semifinal match, between fourth-seeded Mary Pierce and Spanish second-seed Conchita Martinez. </P>
<P> Werdel Witmeyer, the lowest-ranked woman to make the last four at Flinders Park in five years, proved far too strong for the even lower-ranked Gavaldon, who had caused the major upset of the women's event by knocking out third-seed Jana Novotna. </P>
<P> Werdel Witmeyer, the last American woman in the singles after the departure of four seeded compatriots, demolished the 96th-ranked Mexican 6-1, 6-2, in 55 minutes for her first-ever Grand Slam semifinal appearance. </P>
<P> Werdel Witmeyer, 27, delighted at her dramatic progress after beating fifth seed Gabriela Sabatini in the first round, said she was confident she could give Sanchez Vicario a tough game. </P>
<P> ``You don't get this far if you don't think you can win,'' she said. </P>
<P> Sawamatsu's thoughts were turning to her parents and a quick flight home to Kobe after her defeat and her biggest tournament pay check of $47,000. </P>
<P> The university student had been advised by her aunt, a former leading player, to play on to try to lift her parents' spirits by winning after their home in Nishinomiya, near Kobe, was destroyed in the January 17 earthquake. </P>
<P> Her parents, grandparents and her brother, who were in the home at the time, were uninjured. </P>
