<P>  Astronauts aboard the space shuttle Endeavour viewed more of what scientists call the ''invisible universe'' Sunday, the fourth day of a 16-day astronomy mission. </P>
<P> Astronomers from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and three participating universities were excited about the results of the mission involving three unique telescopes. </P>
<P> ``We've observed a volcanic eruption on another world and the stuff between the stars, and only in astronomy is that a typical day at the office,'' NASA's Robert Stachnik said in a U.S. space agency television broadcast. </P>
<P> Observations so far have ranged from a quasar at the edge of the universe, and Jupiter and its volcanically active moon, Io. Sunday, the crew in Earth orbit and scientists on the ground focused Endeavour's ultraviolet observatory on hot stars and interstellar dust -- some of the least understood objects in the cosmos. </P>
<P> Scientists have assembled a mission menu of some 600 potential targets. All the targets radiate in the ultraviolet, a region of the electromagnetic spectrum that can't be seen by humans or detected by telescopes on the ground. </P>
<P> The $195 million observatory in Endeavour's open cargo bay is equipped with three ultraviolet telescopes designed to shed light on exotic objects that could hold clues to the origin of the universe. </P>
<P> ``Experiment data continues to roll in,'' NASA spokeswoman Sara Moquin said. </P>
<P> Observations overnight included more efforts to detect and measure interstellar helium by viewing the filtered light from a quasar 10 billion light-years from Earth. </P>
<P> Scientists believe this helium was formed in the Big Bang that created the universe, so they are hoping for big returns from Endeavour. The actual detection of interstellar helium is one of the main goals of the flight. </P>
<P> The mission was launched from Florida on Thursday. The astronauts are working in two shifts around the clock to point the telescopes at distant stars, galaxies and other celestial objects. </P>
<P> They are looking for answers to questions about the shapes of nearby galaxies, the properties of massive hot stars within the galaxies, the evolution of star clusters, and the nature of the gas and dust that fills the space between the stars. </P>
