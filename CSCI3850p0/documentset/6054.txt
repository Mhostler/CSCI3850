<DATELINE>PRETORIA, April 26 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  South Africa denied on Wednesday reports that anti-apartheid veteran Allan Boesak, cleared by the government of misusing foreign aid funds, would become Pretoria's ambassador to Portugal. </P>
<P> Asked if President Nelson Mandela's government planned to send Boesak to Lisbon, presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana replied: ``No.'' He did not elaborate. </P>
<P> South African state radio, quoting diplomatic sources in Brussels, said late on Tuesday that Pretoria planned to appoint the controversial cleric as ambassador to Portugal. </P>
<P> Mandela said on Monday that Boesak, cleared at the weekend by a government inquiry of corruption charges, was a bright young man who deserved a high diplomatic post. </P>
<P> In Copenhagen, the Danish aid organisation DanChurch Aid said on Tuesday it stuck by its allegations that Boesak, a leading member of Mandela's ruling African National Congress, had misused Nordic aid funds and said it refused to apologise. </P>
<P> ``We see absolutely no grounds to respond to Allan Boesak's demands for a public apology or apologise for our remarks about the well-documented misuse of Nordic aid funds by the foundation of which Boesak is director,'' it said. </P>
<P> A police investigation into the DanChurch allegations is under way. Opposition parties in South Africa have said it would be premature to appoint him as an ambassador. </P>
<P> Boesak was due to have taken up a post as ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva before the corruption allegations were made. He withdrew from the post. </P>
<P> On Tuesday, Boesak said his accusers had never given him the chance to defend himself. </P>
