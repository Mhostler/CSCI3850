<P>  Beijing, which lost its bid for the 2000 Olympics, should try for the 2004 event, China's official media reported the president of the International Olympic Committee as saying. </P>
<P> Juan Antonio Samaranch told Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan that sports facilities in the capital were excellent and it had made a great success of hosting the Asian Games in 1990, the China News Service said Wednesday. </P>
<P> Beijing narrowly missed becoming the first city to host the Olympics on its first bid, failing to win the 2000 Games by just two votes in losing to Sydney. </P>
<P> Li told Samaranch he hoped the 2004 Games would be held in a developing country, the China News Service said. </P>
<P> Samaranch came to China to attend the closing ceremony of the World Table Tennis championships in the eastern port city of Tianjin Sunday. </P>
<P> About 12 cities, including Rio de Janeiro, Istanbul and Rome, have expressed the intention of bidding for the 2004 Summer Olympics but no official bid has yet been received, Samaranch said, according to the Xinhua news agency. </P>
