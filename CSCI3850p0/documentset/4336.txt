<P>  Russia Tuesday defended its decision to sell nuclear reactors to Iran despite U.S. protests, and said the deal posed no military threat. </P>
<P> Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Monday Washington was ``deeply concerned'' about Russia's plans to provide the reactors, fearing Iran will use them in a crash program to develop nuclear weapons. </P>
<P> But Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Grigory Karasin told a briefing: ``We are convinced it will not pose any threat of creating military potential.'' </P>
<P> The reactors would be open to supervision by the International Atomic Energy Agency, he added, and Iran was a signatory of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. </P>
<P> ``We do not believe there is any reason for concern,'' the spokesman said. </P>
