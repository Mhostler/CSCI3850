<P>  The Grand Mufti of Egypt, Dr. Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi, said Monday a controversial novel by British author Salman Rushdie was a ``a collection of lies and a collection of insults and vices.'' </P>
<P> But he sidestepped the issue of the death sentence imposed on the Indian-born writer in 1989 by the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeimi on grounds that his book, ``The Satanic Verses,'' blasphemed Islam. </P>
<P> Tantawi, now on a visit to the United States, told a news conference: ``As mufti of Egypt, I am opposed, I am opposed, I am opposed to killing. At the same time I am opposed to lying, I am opposed to lying, I am opposed to lying.'' </P>
<P> The mufti, appointed by the Egyptian government, is the highest Islamic authority in the country and issues opinions on various issues involving the interpretation of Islamic law. </P>
<P> Speaking through an interpreter, Tantawi said the country where Rushdie lived should select three religious scholars -- a Jew, a Christian and a Muslim -- who should study his book, discuss what he had written and ask the author the source of his insulting assertions regarding the Prophet Mohammed and Islam. </P>
<P> ``All objective laws specify a punishment for anyone who speaks lies against others,'' Tantawi continued, speaking through an interpreter. </P>
<P> ``After the (panel's) discussion of what Rushdie has written, I will be satisfied with their judgment,'' he added. </P>
<P> ``What Salman Rushdie has written is a collection of lies and a collection of insults and vices which cannot be uttered by a decent human being... </P>
<P> ``My judgment, therefore, is that Salman Rushdie is a religious-less person whose chief pursuit is the pursuit of wealth.'' </P>
<P> Tantawi, who was accompanied by the president of the Protestant churches in Egypt, Dr. Samuel Habib, said the intention of his visit was to ``demonstrate to the American people the tolerant face of Islam ... and that Islam and Moslems seek to extend the hand of friendship and of justice to anyone who wishes to reach out also in friendship and justice.'' </P>
<P> He declined to comment on the trial, which opened in New York earlier in the day, of a blind Egyptian cleric, Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, and 11 of his followers accused of plotting to bomb U.S. landmarks. </P>
<P> The matter was now before an American court and ``it is our custom and practice in Egypt that we do not address ourselves to a case that is in the hands of the legal system,'' he said. </P>
