<DATELINE>BUJUMBURA, Burundi (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Burundi, teetering on the edge of an ethnic bloodbath like the one that occurred this year in neighboring Rwanda, chose a new acting president Friday. </P>
<P> The national assembly elected Sylvestre Ntibantuganya, a member of the majority Hutu tribe, to replace the head of state killed in the multiple assassination in April that touched off the Rwandan massacres. </P>
<P> The choice was widely expected, but came after long negotiations among tribal and political factions. </P>
<P> Diplomats said Ntibantuganya, 38, was widely regarded as the best hope for tribal peace in Burundi, which has seen repeated clashes between Hutu extremists and the minority Tutsi-dominated armed forces. </P>
<P> Burundi has much the same ethnic mix as Rwanda, but in contrast with its northern neighbor, the minority Tutsi held the upper hand until a faltering transition to democracy began a few years ago. </P>
<P> The last two presidents in Burundi have both been Hutus and have both been murdered. </P>
<P> Ntibantuganya, a member of FRODEBU, the ruling Burundi Democratic Front, was selected from among six candidates nominated by pro-government and opposition parties. </P>
<P> A former agriculture minister, he was speaker of the National Assembly and became acting president when a rocket attack near Kigali on April 6 brought down the airplane of Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana and killed Burundi's head of state Cyprien Ntaryamira as well. </P>
<P> The deaths of the presidents -- on a peace mission to end Rwanda's civil war -- enflamed Rwanda's soldiers and militamen with fears that Hutu tribal domination was over. </P>
<P> The plane crash set off a mass slaughter of Tutsis and suspected Tutsi sympathizers, which was followed by a huge flight of Hutus to neighboring states in fear of Tutsi revenge. </P>
<P> Burundi's first freely-elected president, Melchoir Ndadaye, had been assassinated last October in an abortive coup by renegade Tutsi soldiers. At least 50,000 Hutus and Tutsis were butchered in tit-for-tat killings in the following weeks. </P>
