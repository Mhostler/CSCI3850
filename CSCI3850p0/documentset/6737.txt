<DATELINE>KARACHI, Pakistan, May 22 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  At least seven people were killed and 25 wounded in Karachi on Monday as the ethnic Mohajir National Movement (MQM) enforced a strike that virtually paralysed this southern Pakistani port city. </P>
<P> The ``black day'' declared by the MQM provided a baptism of fire for newly-appointed Sindh provincial governor Kamal Azfar, due to be sworn in at Karachi's Governor House later on Monday to replace Mahmoud Haroon after he quit on health grounds. </P>
<P> Witnesses said at least 20 buses were set ablaze and 50 buses and cars were damaged by stone-throwing. Traffic was thin. </P>
<P> Bursts of gunfire rang out in several districts and five explosions were heard in the Nazimabad district of central Karachi and Jacob Lines district in the south of the city. The cause of the blasts was not immediately clear. </P>
<P> Airline passengers could not reach the airport because of the lack of taxis. Thousands of children waited in vain for buses to take them to school. </P>
<P> Most shops were closed in central parts of the city and banks pulled down their shutters to avoid being attacked by bands of stone-throwing youths roaming the streets. </P>
<P> Ambulance workers said a young man was shot and killed in central Karachi, two bullet-riddled bodies were found in the central Nazimabad district and a third body with gunshot wounds was picked up from Korangi in eastern Karachi. </P>
<P> Three other people were reported killed on Monday in separate shootings in east, west and central Karachi. </P>
<P> The latest deaths brought to 86 the number of people killed in ethnic and sectarian strife in Karachi this month. More than 520 have been killed in the city this year. </P>
<P> Gunmen on a motorcycle wounded three people near a mosque at Firdous Colony in central Karachi, officials said. They were among 25 people wounded in various incidents across the city. </P>
<P> Police said MQM militants were forcing people to stay indoors at gun-point to enforce the strike, called in protest at what the MQM calls repression by the security forces. </P>
<P> An MQM spokesman said the strike was a day of mourning for five party workers it said had died under torture after being detained by police and paramilitary rangers on Thursday. </P>
<P> Karachi, a city of about 12 million people, has been tense since a new round of violence erupted on Thursday when police and paramilitary rangers launched raids in North Nazimabad. </P>
<P> The area is a stronghold of the MQM, which speaks for the majority Mohajir community of Urdu-speaking Moslems who fled to Pakistan from India after partition in 1947. </P>
