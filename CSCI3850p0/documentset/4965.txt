<DATELINE>TYRE, Lebanon (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Israeli gunboats fired machine guns at fishing boats off south Lebanon Thursday, hitting at least one, and fishermen said they feared a blockade of their southern ports will be reimposed. </P>
<P> One fisherman from Tyre, where Israel ended a one-month fishing blockade last Friday, said a gunboat fired machine-gun volleys at his boat about one mile off Adloun, nine miles north of Tyre. </P>
<P> ``I was fishing close to the coast of Adloun when one Israeli boat fired at me. My boat was hit,'' Shukrallah al-Jooni told Reuters at Tyre marina. ``I later saw the gunboat firing in the direction of five or six other boats.'' </P>
<P> No one was hurt during the incident before dawn. </P>
<P> ``We fear that this may be a reintroduction of the blockade on our shores,'' fisherman Abdullah al-Baraadi'i said in Tyre. </P>
<P> It was not immediately known if Israel had decided to reintroduce its blockade of south Lebanon's ports, which it lifted while Secretary of State Warren Christopher visited the region in a bid to restart stalled Middle East peace talks. </P>
<P> Israel imposed its blockade on Tyre Feb. 8 and extended it north to within 12 miles of Beirut. </P>
<P> Fishermen were barred from sailing more than half a mile out to sea. Those ignoring the ban or sailing at night risked drawing fire from gunboats that patrol off Lebanon to stop seaborne commando raids on Israel. </P>
