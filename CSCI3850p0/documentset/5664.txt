<P>  A woman who last fall told police her daughter had been kidnapped and made tearful televised pleas for her safe return was found guilty Tuesday of first-degree murder in the death of the child. </P>
<P> A nine-man, three-woman jury convicted Pauline Zile, 24, on one count of first-degree murder and three counts of aggravated child abuse in the beating death of 7-year-old Christina Holt. </P>
<P> Zile could face death in Florida's electric chair. </P>
<P> Police said John Zile, 32, Pauline's husband and the girl's stepfather, beat the child to death after she soiled her pants and Pauline did nothing to stop the beating. </P>
<P> Police said they were tipped off to the parents' involvement when Pauline Zile made the missing person's report and kept referring to the girl in the past tense. </P>
<P> Nonetheless, they launched a massive search, using tracking dogs, airplanes and a dive team to find the girl. </P>
<P> The killing bore parallels to the case of Susan Smith, who last October told police in Union, S.C., her children were kidnapped, then later confessed to killing them. </P>
<P> It was also last October when Pauline Zile told authorities her daughter was snatched from a Fort Lauderdale flea market. She then wept on Florida television and pleaded for her child's safe return. </P>
<P> But after Christina's battered body was dug from a grave behind a shopping mall, investigators said the girl had been dead for five weeks when Zile made her plea. </P>
<P> During the weeklong trial, prosecutors said Pauline Zile was guilty of first-degree murder even though she did not strike the child, saying she made no attempt to help the little girl while her stepfather killed her. </P>
<P> The stepfather faces the same charges as his wife and goes on trial Aug. 14. </P>
<P> Pauline Zile's lawyers did not mount a defense, saying simply that prosecutors had failed to prove their case. </P>
<P> A witness who lived in an apartment adjoining the Ziles' testified that she had heard what she believed to be the fatal beating, and heard voices pleading with the girl to wake up, followed by the father's lament: ``Oh my God, what did I do?'' </P>
<P> Five days after the start of the nationwide search, Pauline Zile failed a lie detector test. John Zile then led investigators to the girl's grave in Tequesta, Fla. </P>
<P> The jurors who convicted Zile will within a few weeks recommend whether she should be sentenced to life in prison or death in the electric chair. Florida judges generally follow jury recommendations. </P>
<P> In South Carolina, Susan Smith's murder trial is scheduled to begin July 10. The 23-year-old former secretary is imprisoned in Columbia, S.C., and being evaluated by state examiners to determine her competency to stand trial and her responsibility at the time of the crime. </P>
