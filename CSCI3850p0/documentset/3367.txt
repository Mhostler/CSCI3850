<P>  Hundreds of mourners packed the streets of the Brazilian city of Maceio Wednesday at the burial of Pedro Collor, whose 1992 accusations of government corruption helped topple his brother President Fernando Collor de Mello. </P>
<P> Pedro Collor's body arrived back to Brazil from New York where he died two days ago and where he had been receiving treatment for brain cancer. He was 42 years old. </P>
<P> Fernando Collor de Mello did not attend the funeral and newspapers said he was anxious to avoid a scene with Pedro's wife, Teresa Collor. </P>
<P> The two brothers remained estranged after Pedro went public with allegations that his brother's administration was riddled by corruption and influence peddling. Fernando Collor resigned the presidency in December 1992 to avoid impeachment by Congress. </P>
<P> However Brazil's Supreme Court last week threw out charges that Fernando Collor had benefitted from the corruption scheme and the former president has sworn to return to politics. </P>
<P> Only two of the four remaining Collor brothers attended the funeral in Maceio, the capital of Alagoas state where the Collor family controls a small media and television empire. </P>
<P> Leopoldo, the eldest of the three Collor brothers who had also broken with Pedro as a result of his accusations, said the family tragedy went beyond the clashes that separated them in the past. </P>
<P> ``Despite our differences ... the grief and the pain are greater than our feelings under previous circumstances,'' he said. </P>
