<P>  An international television crew will this month begin filming a tribe in a remote Chinese desert that has been isolated from the rest of the world since the 17th century, producer Helen Brew said. </P>
<P> She said London-based Third Eye Television had secured exclusive foreign rights to film the ``lost tribe'' that lives in the heart of the Tarim Basin in the Taklamakan desert of China's Xinjiang Uighur region. </P>
<P> The tribe of more than 200 people had been largely out of touch with the outside world for 350 years when a Chinese oil exploration team discovered the ethnic Uighurs in 1990. </P>
<P> Brew described the tribe as ``a gentle culture living a primitive life in extreme isolation in a microcosm of peace.'' </P>
<P> Information on the tribe is scarce, but they are believed to tell the time by the sun, to have no government, schools or markets and no form of writing. </P>
<P> Living around an oasis deep in a desert whose name means ``those who go in never come out,'' the tribe is reported to be Muslim, to subsist by animal husbandry, growing crops and food gathering. </P>
<P> ``They have clearly nothing in our terms, but have a communal interchange of energy, moral fibre and a motivating force of integrity of a spiritual kind, quite unknown in Western society,'' Brew said in a recent interview. </P>
<P> The 100-minute film will be directed by Italian director Paolo Brunatto and cost about $2.8 million. Filming is estimated to last three weeks. </P>
<P> Brew said the nine-member crew, which must travel for seven days by truck and camel through the Taklamakan Desert to reach the tribe, would try not to alter its way of life. </P>
<P> ``We must be sensitive and respectful not to invade in any way or upset their way of life,'' she said. </P>
<P> The crew would carry its food and sufficient water for five weeks. </P>
<P> ``We are told that we could not survive on water from their brackish oasis water-hole,'' she said. ``This is an extraordinary real life adventure film, travelling into the depths of the world's most dangerous desert.'' </P>
<P> The Taklamakan is an ocean of huge shifting sand dunes. </P>
<P> Among its most notorious features is a frequent windstorm, called the ``Black Hurricane,'' that appears without warning and can last several hours or days. Summer temperatures soar well over 100 degrees. </P>
