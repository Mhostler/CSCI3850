<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A U.S. Army reconnaissance plane crashed Wednesday in South Korea as the United States sought fresh talks with Pyongyang for the return of the crew of a U.S. helicopter downed in the communist North four days earlier. </P>
<P> Secretary of State Warren Christopher earlier warned North Korea that further delay in returning the helicopter pilot and the body of his fellow crew member would affect relations between the two countries. </P>
<P> The reconnaissance aircraft, an OV-1 Mohawk, crashed 40 miles south of Osan Airbase, spokesman Jim Coles said. ``The two crew members were believed to have escaped.'' </P>
<P> The crash of the OV-1 occurred as tight restrictions were in place on all U.S. helicopter flights near the Korean border. Broad investigations of training and navigation aids had also been ordered because of Saturday's helicopter crash. </P>
<P> Coles could not give further details about the OV-1 but South Korean news reports said the plane was engulfed in flames as it crashed. </P>
<P> The U.S. airbase base at Osan is just south of Seoul. </P>
<P> Four days ago, North Korea said it shot down a U.S. OH-58 helicopter a few miles north of the border, killing Chief Warrant Officer David Hilemon and capturing Chief Warrant Officer Bobby Hall, who was the pilot. </P>
<P> U.S. military officials said they could not confirm whether the helicopter was shot down or made an emergency landing. </P>
<P> A U.S. defense official said the South Korea-based reconnaissance helicopter had mistakenly sped low over the Korean border Saturday and the crew thought they were still in South Korea minutes before they went down. </P>
<P> At the border village of Panmumjom Tuesday, North Korean and U.S. military officers met to discuss the return of Hall, as well as Hilemon's body. </P>
<P> ``We have asked for another meeting but North Korea has not yet replied to our request,'' another U.S. military spokesman said. </P>
<P> ``Yesterday's meeting was meaningful in the sense that our side formally delivered a statement to the North Koreans requesting details about the condition of surviving helicopter crew member,'' he said. </P>
<P> North Korean officers, however, withheld any immediate response and only repeated its earlier position that information concerning the incident will be made available after an investigation is completed, he said. </P>
<P> Tuesday's border talks, attended by two middle-level officers from each side, were the first formal discussions of the downing between the military of the United States and North Korea, both signitories of the 1953 Korean Armistice that ended the three-year Korean War. </P>
<P> In Washington, Christopher warned North Korea Tuesday that further delay would affect relations, which had been warming since Pyongyang agreed in October on restructuring its nuclear program. </P>
<P> ``We have indicated that a further delay here in returning the pilot and the remains of the co-pilot would be of great concern to us and would affect the atmosphere in which we've been hoping to improve our relations with North Korea,'' Christopher told reporters. </P>
<P> The United States said Tuesday it had not apologized to Pyongyang over the ill-fated flight of the Army helicopter into North Korea, but continued to press for the return of the two crewmen and the helicopter. </P>
<P> State Department officials, who asked not to be identified, said the United States had contacted China and a number of other countries to try to intercede with North Korea, which so far has refused to cooperate with Washington. </P>
<P> China has had close military ties with North Korea. </P>
<P> Congressman Bill Richardson, a New Mexico Democrat on a previously scheduled visit to Pyongyang, has been negotiating for the release of the crewman on behalf of President Clinton. </P>
<P> Richardson met with senior North Korean officials Tuesday, but the outcome was not immediately known. </P>
