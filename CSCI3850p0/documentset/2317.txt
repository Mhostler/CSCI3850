<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng arrived in South Korea Monday for a five-day trip aimed at fostering growing trade ties between former Cold War enemies. </P>
<P> Seoul government officials said the North Korean nuclear dispute would also feature highly in Li's talks. </P>
<P> Monday's main function for Li, the most senior communist official ever to visit the South, was a courtesy call on President Kim Young-sam. </P>
<P> ``During their meeting, they are expected to discuss ways to promote dialogue between South and North Korea and also establish ways to promote peace on the Korean peninsula,'' said a senior Seoul Foreign Ministry official. </P>
<P> Another ministry official said the two leaders would discuss this month's Geneva agreement between North Korea and the United States. Washington agreed to provide Pyongyang with light-water reactors to replace graphite reactors that produce plutonium which can be diverted to make bombs. </P>
<P> North Korea agreed to halt construction of two nearly completed reactors and to forgo reprocessing of spent uranium fuel rods, from which the West suspected it was extracting weapons-grade plutonium. </P>
<P> ``President Kim will ask for Chinese support to ensure North Korea carries out its part of the deal,'' the official said. </P>
<P> China is communist North Korea's only remaining major ally and South Korea hopes for Chinese support in reducing tension. </P>
<P> South and North Korea are still technically at war since the 1950-53 Korean War, in which China fought alongside the Stalinist North against a U.S.-led United Nations force. </P>
<P> South Korea is also expected to approach China about its recent departure from the commission overseeing the 1953 Korean War armistice. Seoul had earlier said it regretted Beijing's decision to withdraw from the Military Armistice Commission. </P>
<P> Li Peng's visit is also expected to highlight economic ties. </P>
