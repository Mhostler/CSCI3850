<P>  American double world all-round champion Shannon Miller took two golds and two silvers in the Goodwill Games individual disciplines Monday to atone for losing the all-round event. </P>
<P> Miller, who lost narrowly to Russia's Dina Kochetkova Sunday in her first defeat in an all-round competition for two years, wrapped up her victory with a superb floor exercise to snatch gold from Kochetkova. </P>
<P> The American, who was first in the floor in both the team and all-round events, started her performance knowing she had to beat the Russian's score of 9.925. </P>
<P> It was no trouble for Miller, who flowed impeccably across the floor to win with a mark of 9.937. </P>
<P> But it was a poor night for Kochetkova, who fell flat on her back during a practice vault before the start of the event and had to be helped away by her coach. She ended with one silver and one bronze. </P>
<P> Miller took silver in the vault and uneven bars before winning her first gold on the beam. </P>
<P> The 17-year-old did not offer the most sophisticated routine but performed almost flawlessly to win with a score of 9.875, just ahead of Russia's Oksana Fabrichnova. </P>
<P> Poor landings in the vault and uneven bars cost Miller the all-round gold Sunday but she was unable to improve on her dismounts and finished second in both events Monday. </P>
<P> Liliya Podkopayeva of Ukraine, tied for first in the vault during the team event, performed two excellent jumps to take the event with 9.831, just ahead of Miller's 9.824. Svetlana Khorkina of Russia was third. </P>
<P> Yelena Piskun of Belarus, who won the vault in both the team and all-round events, paid the price for a terrible dismount from the second vault and finished sixth. </P>
<P> Khorkina, ninth overall in the world championships, performed a complex uneven bars routine to win in 9.862. </P>
<P> For the second night in a row, Miller slipped while dismounting from the bars and the mistake pushed her into second place with 9.850. </P>
