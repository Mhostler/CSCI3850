<P>  The choice of Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes as NATO's secretary-general crowns a career that won him respect both locally and abroad. </P>
<P> His diplomatic and persuasive skills stand him in good stead to steer the 16-nation alliance as it moves into a post Cold War chapter. </P>
<P> ``His one ambition was to be Belgium's prime minister, but this was a post which always eluded him. Getting the NATO job is a very good prize for him,'' said a member of his entourage. </P>
<P> A Flemish socialist, Claes has led Belgium's foreign policy since March 1992. </P>
<P> He came to prominence internationally last year during Belgium's much-praised, six-month stint as president of the European Union. </P>
<P> It was Claes, who chaired foreign ministers' meetings during the presidency, who with Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene oversaw the coming into effect of the EU's Maastricht treaty on political and economic union. </P>
<P> As foreign minister, he is committed to the European Union and has been deeply worried by the West's -- and especially the EU's -- inaction over the war in former Yugoslavia. </P>
<P> He has also faced many tricky diplomatic problems, especially in the former Belgian protectorates of Rwanda and Burundi and in the ex-Belgian colony of Zaire. </P>
<P> A native Dutch-speaker who also speaks fluent French and English, Claes has a moderate style that has won him trust and respect on both sides of Belgium's language divide. </P>
<P> Often named as a potential prime minister because of his diplomatic skills and moderate opinions, Claes was minister for economic affairs in the last center-left coalition government and has been deputy prime minister five times. </P>
<P> He has mastered the skills of compromise needed to survive in the complex and fragmented system that has produced 35 governments in Belgium since World War II. </P>
<P> His first cabinet post was as education minister in 1972. He held the economic affairs portfolio several times, with only mixed success in the latter role. </P>
<P> He has also been very close to the Belgian royal family. The Belgian media picked up on the fact that when the late King Baudouin's body was brought back from Spain last year, his widow Queen Fabiola chose to embrace Claes on the airport tarmac. </P>
<P> Claes emerged unscathed from a series of financial scandals that erupted this year. </P>
