<P> The announcement made official Smith's appointment, first reported in October by news agencies and the British press, when Rose was under fire by the Bosnian government to resign for his reluctance to call in NATO air strikes. </P>
<P> But Rose remained in his posting and Britain was permitted to appoint his successor. The press statement specifically noted that Smith would take over the command when Rose's term of appointment expired on January 24. </P>
<P> Smith generally shunned publicity until the Gulf War when he commanded the 1st Armored Division, headquartered in Saudi Arabia, and received the Distinguished Service Order after the 100-hour dash to Kuwait. </P>
<P> He then returned with his division to Germany, where he had served since 1985. In September 1992, he was appointed assistant chief of the defence staff for operations and security in the Ministry of Defence where, among other duties, he was involved in formulating British's policy in the Balkans. </P>
<P> Smith is a graduate of the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst and was commissioned in 1964 into the Parachute Regiment. Since then he has served in Kenya, British Guyana, Australia, Malta, Libya, Cyprus, Malaysia, Belize, Zimbabwe, Northern Ireland as well as the Gulf. </P>
<P> The U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) has more than 38,000 troops in the Balkans with about 23,000 in Bosnia. Britain has 3,400 troops with UNPROFOR, all of them in Bosnia. </P>
