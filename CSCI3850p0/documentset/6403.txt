<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Former first lady Imelda Marcos, headed for victory in congressional elections, won a legal battle Tuesday when the Philippines' poll body lifted its previous order disqualifying her from the race. </P>
<P> The Commission on Election (Comelec), reversing itself, said there were not enough grounds to block her proclamation if the current voting trend showing her as winning the race for the congressional seat of her home province of Leyte was maintained. </P>
<P> Partial, unofficial returns showed the widow of the late president Ferdinand Marcos leading incumbent Cirilo Montejo by 44,160 votes to 19,114. </P>
<P> Comelec had disqualified Marcos before Monday's polls, saying she failed to meet the requirement of one-year residence in Leyte, 370 miles south of Manila. </P>
<P> Marcos only listed seven months' residence in her candidacy papers. She later said it was an ``honest mistake'' by her secretary. </P>
<P> Marcos, 65, is also fighting an appeal against an 18-year jail sentence for corruption imposed on her by an anti-graft court in 1993. </P>
<P> She also faces dozens of other criminal cases for allegedly helping her husband loot the economy during his 20-year rule. </P>
<P> Ferdinand Marcos was ousted in a 1986 popular revolt and died three years later in exile in Hawaii. </P>
<P> The Marcoses' only son, Ferdinand Jr., also known as Bongbong, ran for the Senate in the elections but was in danger of losing, according to unofficial returns. </P>
