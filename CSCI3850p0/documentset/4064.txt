<P>  Central American nations will encourage dialogue between Cuba's Communist government and its opponents with the hope of bringing Cuba back into the fold of American nations, regional leaders say. </P>
<P> Honduran President Carlos Reina, speaking late Monday, said the initiative was proposed by his Guatemalan counterpart Ramiro de Len Carpio at a meeting of regional leaders with Canadian Primer Minister Jean Chretien in Costa Rica. </P>
<P> The proposal ``for the reinsertion of Cuba into the inter-American system'' would aim to set up meetings in Guatemala between Cuban leader Fidel Castro and his domestic and foreign opponents, Reina said. </P>
<P> ``At the invitation of the Central American nations, the parties in the Cuban process, that is, the emigres who are in Miami, the anti-Castroists who are in Cuba and the government of Cuba, will meet to open dialogue on how Cuba can return to the inter-American system.'' </P>
<P> ``There is no date yet'' for such talks, Reina added. </P>
<P> It was not clear whether the initiative was aimed at formally ending Cuba's 1962 suspension from the Organization of American States (OAS). </P>
<P> Most countries on the American continent broke off relations with Cuba in 1962, in keeping with an OAS resolution after the 1959 revolution that brought Castro to power. </P>
