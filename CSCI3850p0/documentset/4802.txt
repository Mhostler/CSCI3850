<P>  South Korean opposition lawmakers, who have been holding the parliamentary speaker in his home since Monday, clashed with his aides Thursday to block him from opening a debate on electoral reform. </P>
<P> A spokesman for National Assembly Speaker Hwang Nak-joo said one of his aides was badly injured during a scuffle with 15 deputies from the main opposition Democratic Party (DP). </P>
<P> ``A DP lawmaker kicked a secretary's groin during the clash and he was taken to hospital,'' he said. </P>
<P> Witnesses said the scuffles occurred when Hwang, surrounded by his aides, attempted to leave his residence to convene the parliamentary session. </P>
<P> The week-long special session was called by the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) after another session ended Tuesday without debating a DLP-proposed election bill. </P>
<P> DP lawmakers have brought proceeding to a standstill by occupying Hwang's residence and preventing him from leaving while demanding the ruling camp withdraw its proposed revision of the local election law. </P>
<P> The DP members say they are determined to block the ruling party from pushing through the bill and have vowed to continue to hold the parliamentary speaker and his deputy at their homes until next Wednesday, when the proposed special session is to end. </P>
<P> Both Hwang and Vice Speaker Lee Han-dong are DLP members. </P>
<P> The dispute was sparked Friday when the DLP proposed revising legislation to ban political parties from participating in lower-level administrative districts such as counties, wards and small cities in June 27 local elections. </P>
<P> The DP has strongly opposed the move as a plot to prevent an opposition victory in the elections and has vowed to stop the bill. </P>
<P> The ruling party says the electoral revision would help guarantee autonomy for local residents. </P>
<P> More than 5,000 posts are at stake in the elections to choose nine provincial governors, mayors of South Korea's six largest cities and other smaller cities, heads of counties and wards as well as 4,000 council members. </P>
