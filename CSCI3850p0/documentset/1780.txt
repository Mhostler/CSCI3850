<P>  American businesses have asked for permission to import 7.6 million Russian small arms and over 7 billion rounds of ammunition this year, but the State Department said Monday it wants to stem the influx. </P>
<P> Spokesman Mike McCurry said his department was asking the Treasury Department to deny approval to businesses seeking to bring $1 billion worth of Russian guns into the United States until studies are done to see what is spurring a massive increase in the market for these arms. </P>
<P> ``This is a huge increase in the volume of license applications that we've seen,'' McCurry said at a briefing, noting that only 1,000 weapons were imported from the former Soviet Union in 1992 and only 18,000 in 1993, compared with pending applications for 7.6 million this year. </P>
<P> He said the applications, filed with the Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms by some 250 U.S. companies, also seek to import over 7 billion rounds of ammunition. </P>
<P> The arms and ammunition together are worth more than $1 billion in potential sales, McCurry said, adding, ``We think it's a good idea to know a lot more about this before any of those applications are approved.'' </P>
