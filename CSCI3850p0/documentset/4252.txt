<P>  Ten tons of ivory, rhino horns and hippo teeth with a nominal street value of one million dollars went up in smoke Thursday at Kenya National Park. </P>
<P> The pile was primed with glue and doused with gasoline before being set alight in hopes of pressing other countries to destroy their stockpiles of wildlife products of endangered species. It was expected to burn for two to three days. </P>
<P> ``We are destroying our entire stock today to reaffirm our commitment to save the elephant,'' said Minister of Tourism and Wildlife Katana Ngala. ``The ivory ban, combined with stepped-up security, has led to a dramatic decrease in poaching and a slow recovery of Kenya's elephant population.'' </P>
<P> The stockpile was mostly elephant tusks but included rhino horns, hippo teeth, ivory figurines and other hunting trophies. Kenya's elephant population has increased to 24,000 from less than 19,000 in 1991 and is growing by 1,000 a year, David Western, director of the Kenya Wildlife Service, said. </P>
