<P>  Attorneys for Burt Reynolds said Tuesday they will file a civil damage lawsuit Wednesday against Loni Anderson, the actor's ex-wife, on the actor's behalf. </P>
<P> A spokeswoman for the attorneys said she could provide few details about the agreement, except to say it was connected to the two actors' divorce settlement, and concerned their adopted son. </P>
<P> ``It's coming out of the marital settlement agreement. It really has a lot to do with Quinton, their son, but that's all I can say right now,'' she said. </P>
<P> The two actors filed for divorce in June 1993 in Florida, where they owned a ranch near the community of Jupiter. </P>
