<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Indonesia's police chief in East Timor said Monday he expected more arrests of East Timorese youths suspected of involvement in hooded gangs which have terrorized the capital Dili and other towns. </P>
<P> Col. Andreas Sugianto told Reuters three more youths were arrested in a suburb in Dili Sunday on suspicion of being involved in gangs believed by locals to have military links. </P>
<P> ``We haven't finished our job and we will continue searching for other suspects,'' he said. </P>
<P> Residents said at least five youths had been arrested in eastern Dili, but denied they were members of the gangs. </P>
<P> Sugianto said police had already named 12 East Timorese as suspects in the attacks and would likely add to the list because of intensified raids. </P>
<P> ``We will continue the investigation. The attacks (by the gangs) occured in eight places in East Timor, but so far we've only uncovered cases in four areas,'' he said. </P>
<P> Residents have said the gangs were financed and operated by the military to quell renewed protests against Indonesia's occupation of the troubled territory. </P>
<P> Despite police raids, residents said they were still afraid to leave their homes after dusk. </P>
<P> Sugianto said the detainees were men who were either unemployed, laborers or civil servants, adding that it was too early to say if those detainees were East Timorese who were against the territory's integration with Indonesia. </P>
<P> ``It's a criminal case,'' he said. </P>
<P> Criticism against Indonesia and its occupation has intensified in the past month after troops shot dead six East Timorese in January in Liquiza, west of Dili. </P>
<P> Indonesia's national human rights commission returned from East Timor after conducting an investigation into the shooting. </P>
<P> The commission has yet to announce its findings. </P>
<P> Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it the following year in a move not recognized by the United Nations. </P>
<P> The United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva is this week due to debate a report by its rapporteur on torture which is critical of Indonesia's role in the territory. </P>
