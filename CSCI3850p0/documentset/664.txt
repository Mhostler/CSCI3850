<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Clinton warned his fellow Democrats Monday night not to let Republicans frighten them into running away from his record in November's mid-term elections, saying Democrats can win ``if we fight.'' </P>
<P> Speaking at a $5,000-a-plate fund-raising dinner sponsored by the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee, Clinton told his party: ``Let's just stand up and defend what we've done, defend what we believe in and fight for the American people.''  Thirty-five of the 100 Senate seats and all 435 seats in the House of Representatives are at stake in the Nomember 8 elections, along with more than half the 50 state governor's offices. </P>
<P> Historically, the party that wins the White House tends to lose seats in the next mid-term election, but Clinton said Democrats can buck that trend if ``we ... keep our eyes on doing things.'' </P>
<P> ``When we go into these fall elections, let us proudly say 'Yes, we're Democrats,'' he said. ``And when they (Republicans) attack us for being tax and spend, say 'We cut taxes on ten times as many people as we're raising them on. You guys had a bigger government than we're having -- we're just trying to solve the problems of the people of the country.''' </P>
<P> Clinton's advice differed, at least superficially, from that of his pollster, Stanley Greenberg. </P>
<P> In a controversial memo leaked to The New York Times last week, Greenberg said Democrats seeking re-election this fall should emphasize their own records rather than link themselves too closely to Clinton or even their own party. </P>
<P> ``All I know is, when we showed up here, the deficit was going up and the economy was going down. And with no help from them (the Republicans), we passed an economic program that cut spending by $255 billion, cut taxes on 15 million working Americans, made 90 percent of the small businesses eligible for a tax cut...,'' Clinton said. </P>
<P> He said the plan has resulted in three years of deficit reduction in a row, something the Republicans ``said they were for but couldn't or wouldn't do.'' </P>
<P> Clinton, speaking in a raspy voice that he said was due to Washington ragweed, also pointed out that 4.1 million new jobs had been created since he entered office. </P>
<P> Saying he was quoting Texas legal scholar Barbara Jordan, a former member of Congress who received the Medal of Freedom at a White House ceremony earlier Monday, Clinton declared: ``The Democrats have a wonderful record -- what they need to do is fight for it!'' </P>
