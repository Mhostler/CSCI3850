<P>  Chile will start work next month on an agreement to join NAFTA and hopes to complete a rough draft by the end of 1995, Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat said Friday. </P>
<P> Speaking on CNN's ``Moneyline'' program, he said he expects an official announcement Sunday that Chile will be given the opportunity to become the fourth member of the North American Free Trae Agreement that now groups the United States, Canada and Mexico. </P>
<P> He was in Miami for the 34-nation Summit of the Americas that aims to set a target date for establishing an even broader free trade zone stretching from Alaska to Argentina. </P>
<P> ``We hope to work on the agenda for NAFTA accession starting January 1995 and be able to have a rough draft of the whole agreement perhaps before year ends,'' Aninat said. </P>
<P> Laura Andrea Tyson, chairman of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, said Chile is the next NAFTA candidate because it has moved the fastest and farthest on reform. </P>
<P> ``As everyone knows, Chile has had a long record now of really getting its economic system functioning extremely well,'' she said on the same CNN program. </P>
<P> She noted that Chile's candidacy was discussed by the previous administration. </P>
<P> The Clinton team, ``in talking about how to move this process forward ... (agreed) there is a concept of readiness (evident in Chile) in terms of market liberalization reform,'' she added. </P>
