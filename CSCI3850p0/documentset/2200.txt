<P>  The prime ministers of Rwanda and Zaire Monday watered down proposals to set up two U.N-protected buffer zones inside Rwanda, opting instead for ``reception centers'' where returning refugees who had fled Rwanda's civil war could re-adjust to life. </P>
<P> The idea of buffer zones around Gisenyi and Cyangugu, Rwandan towns bordering Zaire, was made public Saturday by Zairean Premier Kengo Wa Dondo as he prepared to sign a repatriation agreement with his Rwandan counterpart Faustin Twagiramungu. </P>
<P> Both countries are keen to see the return of 1.2 million Rwandan Hutus who fled to eastern Zaire when the Rwandan Patriotic Front swept to power in July. </P>
<P> Many refugees have been persuaded by ex-ministers of the ousted Hutu government and their militiamen who fled with them that they face death if they return home. </P>
<P> Kengo, who said the buffer zone idea had been agreed upon at a bilateral meeting in Brussels, argued that refugees would gain confidence in U.N.-protected zones where they could re-acclimatize, collect information and realize they were in no real danger. </P>
<P> After initially appearing to support the idea, the Rwandans objected at talks behind closed doors. They said the term implied an area under U.N. jurisdiction, a challenge to the sovereignty of the new Kigali administration. </P>
<P> The Rwandans won the argument. The joint statement signed Saturday by the two countries refers only to ``reception centers'' to which the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and other U.N. agencies would be given access. </P>
<P> Both countries called on the international community to press on with plans to resettle former ministers and an estimated 30,000 former Rwandan soldiers away from their mutual border. </P>
