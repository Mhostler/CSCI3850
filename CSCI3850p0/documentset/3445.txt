<DATELINE>PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  At least two Haitian soldiers were killed in gunfire outside Haitian military headquarters Monday, the worst violence in Port-au-Prince since ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was restored to power, a military hospital spokesman said. </P>
<P> The shooting erupted during a demonstration by Haitian soldiers being retired under a plan to scale down the army, according to U.S. military officials. </P>
<P> Ray Kelly, the former New York City police commissioner who heads the international police monitors in Haiti, said five people, all members of the Haitian military, were wounded in the shooting. He said he was unaware if any of the wounded died. </P>
<P> It was unclear who had fired the shots that wounded the five, Kelly and U.S. military officials said. </P>
<P> A spokesman at the Haitian military hospital in the capital said two of the soldiers wounded in the shootout had died. A third wounded soldier brought from the scene was hospitalized. </P>
<P> The violence was the worst in the Haitian capital since American troops restored ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in October under a deal with the country's military rulers. </P>
<P> Under the U.S.-backed deal that restored Aristide, the army, blamed for many of the killings and other human rights abuses during three years of military rule, is to be restructured and sharply reduced. </P>
<P> ``A bunch of them were to be fired today, and apparently they didn't want to go without a fight,'' said one American soldier. </P>
<P> Kelly said when the shooting began, some of the protesters broke into a weapons locker at the military headquarters. </P>
<P> When they emerged from the building, they were confronted by U.S. soldiers, who ``fired back,'' he said. </P>
<P> More than 30 people were taken into custody, but it was uncertain how many would be charged, Kelly said. </P>
<P> ``I think we have to let the smoke settle to see what this means,'' he said. </P>
<P> One witness, Patrick Ajenor, said the unrest started when two of the protesting soldiers slapped Army Chief of Staff General Mondesir Beaubrun outside the military headquarters. </P>
<P> ``Two soldiers attacked General Beaubrun. They slapped him. He shot the two soldiers and they fell on the ground,'' Ajenor said. That account could not immediately be confirmed. </P>
<P> Haitian soldiers at the headquarters then opened fire with automatic weapons, according to Ajenor. Beaubrun's assistant was wounded as the general made his escape, he said. </P>
<P> An unidentified American soldier said some of the bullets flew across the plaza to the national palace, where American soldiers returned fire. </P>
<P> Members of the multinational peacekeeping force in Haiti responded to the shooting, taking an hour to secure the headquarters. U.S. military interpreters used loudspeakers to tell Haitian military personnel to come out. </P>
<P> ``If you don't we're going to come in the door and you could get killed. If you come out nothing will happen to you,'' the interpreters announced. </P>
<P> One of the wounded was airlifted in a U.S. army helicopter to a military hospital, said U.S. Army Major Regina Largent, head of the Joint Information Bureau. </P>
<P> No members of the multinational force were wounded, she said. </P>
<P> After the shootings, a crowd of about 2,000 gathered outside the military headquarters. Many expressed anger at mounting violence in the capital and blamed Haitian military personnel. </P>
<P> ``They killed my father,'' said one man. ``Kill them too.''  A Haitian-American soldier serving as a translator lamented the escalating violence in the wake of Aristide's peaceful return. </P>
<P> ``This is disorder. I thought things would work out in a friendly way,'' said Sergeant Wagner Charlot. ``My mother has two houses in Haiti and she can't live here because of the way the country has been.'' </P>
