<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Irish foreign minister Dick Spring welcomed British premier John Major's acceptance of the IRA cease-fire Friday as ``significant and very important.'' </P>
<P> The Irish minister, who is also deputy prime minister, said Major's ``working assumption'' that the Irish Republican Army (IRA) Sept. 1 truce was permanent would help peace efforts. </P>
<P> ``Obviously it is very timely because in the six and a half weeks since the IRA announcement there has not been any violence from that quarter. Every day that goes forward the peace process is more secure,'' Spring told Irish radio. </P>
<P> Major announced in Belfast that Britain was working on the basis the IRA truce was permanent and would open talks with its political wing, Sinn Fein, by the year's end. </P>
<P> ``Obviously I generally welcome what Mr Major has said. Hopefully we will see the fruits of today in our deliberations over the coming weeks,'' Spring, a key player in an Anglo-Irish peace drive, said. </P>
<P> Spring, like Major, linked progress in solving the 25-year Northern Ireland conflict to the surrender by the IRA and their Protestant Loyalist foes of large quantities of arms and bombs. </P>
<P> ``A very fundamental aspect of the resolution of this conflict is taking the arms out of circulation. That is understood. </P>
<P> ``It will be very much on the agenda, but it will not happen next week or tomorrow. The arms are not necessary any longer, because there is not going to be violence in Northern Ireland.'' </P>
<P> The Irish minister also welcomed London's announcement that closed border roads would be opened. </P>
<P> ``I greatly welcome the lifting of all closures on border roads. This will be particularly welcomed by those living in border areas who have endured widespread inconvenience over many years,'' he said in a statement. </P>
<P> The lifting of closure orders, and the speedy return of these roads to normal use, will be of enormous benefit in the process of economic reconstruction and development in border areas, he said. </P>
<P> People in border areas complain that sealed crossings have made life in remote agricultural areas even more difficult and have blocked legitimate cross-border trade. </P>
<P> Sinn Fein estimates that there are at least 100 sealed crossings, and one of its first acts after the IRA cease-fire was to stage symbolic marches to reopen them. They were quickly resealed by the British army using bulldozers. </P>
