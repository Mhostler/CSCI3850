<P>  Israel Friday rejected a Palestinian proposal to begin talks immediately on the future status of Jerusalem. </P>
<P> ``What must be done now is to carry out what we agreed,'' Foreign Minister Shimon Peres told Israel Radio. </P>
<P> Under the 1993 PLO-Israel interim peace deal, Jerusalem is to be negotiated at final settlement talks set to begin no later than May 1996. The two sides are currently negotiating expansion of Palestinian self-rule beyond Gaza and Jericho. </P>
<P> Palestinian officials, angry at Israel's confiscation of Arab lands in East Jerusalem, asked Israel Thursday for immediate talks on the future status of the holy city. </P>
<P> ``Maybe in one year I'll find no land to talk about,'' negotiator Faisal al-Husseini said Thursday. </P>
<P> Palestinians say Israeli land grabs are aimed at pre-empting talks on Jerusalem -- an idea given credence by Israeli Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer Friday. </P>
<P> ``The Palestinians and I understand this is the fight for Jerusalem and no one should be deluded. The fight is for control of the city,'' he was quoted as telling the newspaper Maariv. </P>
<P> Husseini demanded immediate talks on Jerusalem after Israel decided to confiscate 131 acres of land in East Jerusalem and the United States vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution to condemn the land grab. </P>
<P> ``Look how many difficulties we are encountering in carrying out the interim agreement,'' Peres said in response. </P>
<P> ``If we go to the permanent agreement, will the situation be better? The situation will be worse,'' Peres said. </P>
<P> Palestinians in the last half year have also protested at Israeli land confiscations in the occupied West Bank. Israel has said it must build bypass roads for settlers and soldiers around Arab areas ahead of expansion of self-rule. </P>
<P> PLO head Yasser Arafat, asked about the West Bank expropriations, told reporters in Gaza: ``This is continuing the crime of confiscation which expresses regretfully the Israeli flagrant violation of the international decisions.'' </P>
<P> Palestinians say they should be consulted if bypass roads need to be built for self-rule. </P>
<P> The future of Jerusalem is one of the toughest issues to be negotiated in talks launched by a breakthrough Israeli-PLO peace deal sealed with a handshake at the White House in 1993. </P>
<P> Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed it. It vows never to cede any part of the city. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as capital of a future state. </P>
<P> Jerusalem, refugees, settlements and borders, are what the sides agree to call ``permanent status'' issues. </P>
<P> Israel and the Palestinians have set a target date of July 1 this year for a plan on expanding self-rule beyond the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho -- handed over to Arafat's PLO a year ago -- to other parts of the West Bank. </P>
<P> The plan would clear the way for Israeli troops to redeploy away from Palestinian towns and cities in the West Bank and for Palestinians to hold elections. </P>
