<P>  Russia's lower house of parliament adopted a resolution Wednesday opposing plans to withdraw Russian troops from Moldova within three years. </P>
<P> Some 267 deputies in the State Duma backed the resolution, which said the scheduled withdrawal of the 14th Army from the former Soviet republic's Dnestr region could increase tensions there. Two abstained and none opposed. </P>
<P> The non-binding resolution urged President Boris Yeltsin and the government to ensure the troops could work effectively in the region, where hundreds of people died in clashes between Moldovan and Dnestr forces in 1992. </P>
<P> ``The 14th Army ... is carrying out an important function in stabilising the situation in the region, preventing interethnic conflicts and defending the peaceful life of the multi-ethnic population of Dnestr,'' the resolution said. </P>
<P> The Russian and Moldovan governments agreed last October that the army's 6,500 troops would leave the region within three years. </P>
<P> Moldova says it cannot be considered a truly independent state until the army has left. But a non-binding referendum in Dnestr last month showed wide support for the army to remain. </P>
<P> The 14th Army is headed by Lt. Gen. Alexander Lebed, who has criticized President Boris Yeltsin and is considered a potential presidential candidate. </P>
<P> Lebed said Tuesday Defense Minister Pavel Grachev had issued an instruction to cut the 14th army's headquarters in half and reduce it to an operations office in charge of a single division by July 1. </P>
<P> He threatened to quit and enter politics if the decision was carried out. </P>
