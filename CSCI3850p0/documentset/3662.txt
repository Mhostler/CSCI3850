<P>  U.S. Assistant Secretary of State George Moose said Monday aid to Africa would come under close scrutiny following calls for cuts in foreign aid from Republicans who have taken control of Congress. </P>
<P> But Moose, the senior State Department official responsible for Africa, said he believed a high level of assistance would be maintained, provided the government was able to convince Congress of its effectiveness. </P>
<P> ``I remain convinced that we will be able to convince ... the people in this country, broadly, that the actions and activities that we are engaged in represent a significant investment for the United States,'' he said. </P>
<P> Moose said the United States spent a total of roughly $3 billion in Africa in 1994, including aid, involvement in peacekeeping operations and democracy-building initiatives. This included a development fund of just over $800 million. </P>
<P> Several conservative Republicans, who swept to power in Congress for the first time in 40 years last November, have urged deep cuts in foreign aid as part of efforts to trim expenditure and balance the U.S. budget. </P>
<P> Among them was Jesse Helms, incoming chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee which has a major say in directing U.S. aid. He has said much U.S. aid has ``gone down foreign ratholes to countries that constantly oppose us.'' </P>
<P> Moose, who faces tough negotiations to maintain African aid at its current level, conceded that this was ``a time for resource restraints ... in every country around the world.'' </P>
<P> He warned African states there would be a rigorous check on the effectiveness of U.S. investment in the continent, which faces a raft of ethnic and political conflicts undermining efforts to develop and sustain democracies. </P>
<P> The debate with skeptical members of Congress would create an opportunity ``to examine precisely how well we are doing and to explain and justify that,'' he said. </P>
<P> The goal of U.S. involvement in the continent was to create a more secure international environment and more trading and investment opportunities for Americans, he said. </P>
<P> He also said there was a ``broad constituency of support in this country for internationalism'' and said Americans, proud of their country's role as a ``beacon of democracy and freedom,'' would respond generously to Africa's needs. </P>
<P> During 1994 there had been democratic progress in some cases, notably South Africa but also Mozambique, Malawi and the Central African Republic, he said, but there had been severe setbacks, as in Rwanda, Gambia and Sudan. </P>
<P> He said lessons from the year included the need to improve organizations coping with the continent's problems, including the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity, and for the United States to work more closely with European countries to avoid duplication in assistance programs. </P>
