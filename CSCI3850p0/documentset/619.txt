<P>  The Mercosur trade bloc, whose principal members are Argentina and Brazil, Friday wrapped up common market negotiations and opened the group to Chile. </P>
<P> At a presidential summit here, the leaders of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay signed an agreement on tariffs for imports from outside the zone, clearing up the main outstanding problem ahead of Mercosur's January 1 start-up. </P>
<P> They also signed a document with Chilean President Eduardo Frei declaring intent to start talks as soon as possible aimed at creating a free trade zone between Mercosur and Chile. </P>
<P> ``Whereas before Mercosur was Southern Cone's Atlantic trade zone, now it will be the Southern Cone, Atlantic and Pacific,'' Argentine Foreign Minister Guido di Tella said. </P>
<P> Mercosur countries hope Chile will be a cornerstone through which they will get access to markets in the northern half of South America and to the North American Free Trade Agreement. </P>
<P> Chile, the strongest economy in the region, has traditionally been skeptical of Mercosur, and Frei's visit was the icing on the cake after a week of ministerial haggling over the common external tariff. </P>
<P> The accord fixes tariffs at between zero and 20 percent for goods from outside the trade bloc. Each country is allowed a list of 300 exceptions, except Paraguay, which is allowed 399. </P>
<P> Argentina, most pro-free trade of the four countries, made several concessions, including agreeing to harmonization of tariffs on capital goods at 14 percent by 2001. Argentina currently has zero tariffs on capital goods. </P>
<P> The common tariff on computer products, another sticking point, will be 16 percent, far higher than the 4 percent proposed by Argentina. But implementation of that tariff is to be delayed until 2006. </P>
<P> ``What we have got is imperfect customs union. We will be working to perfect it over the next years,'' Argentine Foreign Minister Guido di Tella told reporters. </P>
<P> Argentina's Carlos Menem, Brazil's Itamar Franco, Paraguay's Juan Carlos Wasmosy and Uruguay's Luis Alberto Lacalle signed the pact at a one-day summit in Buenos Aires. </P>
