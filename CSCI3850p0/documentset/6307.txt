<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The unemployment rate jumped in April, the Labor Department said Friday, as the slower economic expansion produced a decline in non-farm payrolls for the first time in over two years. </P>
<P> The department said unemployment stood at 5.8 percent in the month, up from 5.5 percent in March, and 9,000 jobs were lost from non-farm payrolls.  March nonfarm payrolls also were revised lower to show an increase of 177,000 compared with a previously reported 203,000. </P>
<P> The April decline was the first since March, 1993, when 52,000 jobs were lost. </P>
<P> But the latest figure was under something of a cloud since the survey contained a statistical quirk, which the department and private economists believed underestimated figure. </P>
<P> ``There is a large range of uncertainty connected with our estimates,'' Katharine Abraham, Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said in a statement.  The estimate was well below the Wall Street forecast consensus figures, even though private economists in recent days had been cutting their forecasts as evidence continued to pile up that the economy was losing steam and there was doubt about the job outlook. </P>
<P> The report is the government's first indication of the economy's performan3ce in April and is anxiously awaited by financial markets for new clues on the course the economy is taking.  The slowing economy, combined with little hard evidence that inflation is becoming troubling and the recent retreat of the dollar has been good news for the bond and stock markets. </P>
<P> The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond continued its climb, jumping nearly a full point, and its yield slid to 7.10 percent from 7.16 percent Thursday. </P>
<P> The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates seven times to slow the economy to a more sustainable pace in order to keep inflation from breaking out of its relatively controlled path. </P>
<P> On the surface, at least, there was little reason to believe that the new data gives the Fed fresh reason to tighten again anytime soon. </P>
<P> The decline in job creation was demonstrated across the economy, with the goods-producing, construction and manufacturing sectors all showing a reduction. </P>
