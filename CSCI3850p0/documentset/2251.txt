<P>  Senators from Argentina's ruling Peronist party Wednesday thwarted a government bid to promote two Navy commanders accused of violating human rights in the so-called ``dirty war'' against leftists in the 1970s. </P>
<P> Commanders Juan Carlos Rolon and Antonio Pernias were named by several witnesses in a 1985 trial against the former military juntas in whose anti-guerrilla drive more than 9,000 people -- the ``desaparecidos'' -- were kidnapped and killed. </P>
<P> Summoned to the Senate last week, their chilling statements about the use of torture in the ``dirty war'' put the dark era back on the front page of local newspapers. </P>
<P> The government, foiled in its attempt to promote them last year, had put them up for review again and President Carlos Menem said Argentina could not wallow forever in its past. </P>
<P> But in a statement announcing they would not go along, the Peronist senators said, ``Reconciliation between Argentines requires further efforts to build a true internal peace.'' </P>
