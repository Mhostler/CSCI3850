<P>  Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel has been asked by World Jewish Congress President Edgar Bronfman to represent the organization at commemorations marking the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Nazi death camps, a spokesman said Thursday. </P>
<P> ``Mr. Bronfman has asked Professor Weisel to represent the World Jewish Congress at both the Jewish commemoration that's being held and the official (Polish) government one,'' the WJC spokesman said. </P>
<P> Wiesel, a survivor of Auschwitz, where more than one million Jews died, will attend a separate Jewish memorial at the death camp on January 26, the day before the official Polish ceremony. </P>
<P> The spokesman quoted a letter from Bronfman to the executive of the organization as saying ``my deep feeling is that this commemoration belongs to the survivors. Professor Wiesel, as the spokesperson of the survivors, will represent World Jewry and no one could be more eloquent or represent the Jewish people and the Holocaust survivors as well.'' </P>
<P> The WJC had objected to the Polish ceremony because it made no provision for saying the Jewish prayer for the dead, the Kaddish, until after the official delegations left. </P>
<P> However, the spokesman said Thursday that the WJC was demanding that the Polish government include the Kaddish. </P>
<P> ``If it is not part of the official ceremonies, and I believe it will be at this point, Professor Wiesel himself will recite Kaddish,'' he said. ``So one way or another Kaddish will be recited.'' </P>
