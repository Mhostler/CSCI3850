<P>  Even small increases in blood pressure can nearly double a man's chances of suffering kidney failure over a 15-year period, according to a new study released Wednesday by the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions. </P>
<P> The study, to be unveiled this week at the American Society of Nephrology meeting in Orlando, Florida, is the first to show that a rise in blood pressure is a strong risk factor for development of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). </P>
<P> Dr Michael Klag, associate professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins, found that men with a diastolic blood pressure of 120 millimeters of mercury or over, were 30 times more likely to develop ESRD than men with blood pressure under 70 mmHG. </P>
<P> Diastolic blood pressure is measured during the heart's resting phase. </P>
<P> Those with systolic blood pressure, when the heart is forcing blood into the arteries, of 200 or over, were 48 times more likely to develop the disease than men with blood pressure under 120 mmHg. </P>
<P> Normal blood pressure is 120/80. </P>
<P> Klag's group found that even differences as small as 11 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure or 16 mmHg in systolic blood pressure doubled a man's risk of developing ESRD. </P>
<P> His findings are based a study of 361,659 men for a mean follow-up time of 15.3 years, during which 924 men -- 1 in 391 -- developed ESRD. </P>
<P> Klag said the findings of increased risk were independent of age, race, number of cigarettes smoked, previous heart attack, diabetes, income and serum cholesterol. </P>
