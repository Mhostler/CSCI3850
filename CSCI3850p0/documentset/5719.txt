<P> Yousef is already accused of masterminding the bombing of the World Trade Center, which killed six people and injured 1,000 others in what officials said was the biggest terrorist attack ever staged on U.S. soil. </P>
<P> U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White told a news conference Thursday, when Murad was arraigned before a federal district judge, that Murad and Yousef were accused of ``crimes of international terrorism.'' She added, ``This case and the continuing terrorism investigations should serve to demonstrate this country's and the world's firm resolve to meet and prosecute acts and planned acts of terrorism wherever they occur.'' </P>
<P> If convicted, Yousef faces a maximum sentence of life in prison or death. Murad faces a maximum of 45 years in jail. </P>
