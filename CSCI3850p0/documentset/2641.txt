<P>  United Nations commanders asked NATO jets to fly over the northwest Bosnian enclave of Bihac after a surface-to-air missile landed near Bangladeshi peacekeepers Wednesday, a U.N. spokesman said. </P>
<P> ``One or two SA-2s impacted 500-1000 yards from the Bangladeshi camp near Cazin, and the Bihac U.N. headquarters requested a NATO air presence. For the moment it is quiet there again,'' said spokesman Major Herve Gourmelon. </P>
<P> Gourmelon said the U.N. did not consider the missiles to have been directly targeted at the Bangladeshi troops, but he said two 105mm artillery shells had earlier landed in the vicinity of the camp. </P>
<P> Serb forces last fired SA-2 missiles into the Bihac enclave Monday as part of their current fierce assault on the area. U.N. officials say the SA-2 cannot be properly directed when used against ground targets and call it a weapon of terror with little or no military significance. </P>
<P> Gourmelon could not say how many jets NATO had sent to answer the request for a show of air strength. U.N. commanders have the power to ask NATO to bomb military targets if they feel their troops have been targeted by hostile forces. </P>
