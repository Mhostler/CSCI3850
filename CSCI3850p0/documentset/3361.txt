<P>  Heavily-armed Mexican police and government troops began consolidating control of northern Chiapas Wednesday after indigenous Maya rebels who took over towns and highways melted back into the mountainside. </P>
<P> Members of a heavily-armed, 1,000-man police and military convoy which rolled peacefully through northern towns Tuesday took up positions in and around the town of Simojovel, which had been occupied by rebel supporters, while others fanned out to patrol adjacent highways. </P>
<P> The Mexican interior ministry said in a statement that of the 38 municipalities which self-styled Zapatista rebels claimed Monday to have taken over, ``no area is under rebel control.'' </P>
<P> In the town of Puerto Cate, about 25 miles northwest of this elegant colonial city, an army truck carrying about 50 troops set out on patrol while others guarded the town and warily scanned the rolling, mist-shrouded mountains. </P>
<P> ``We will be patrolling every day from now on, keeping all the highways clear,'' an officer from the federal Highways Police told Reuters. </P>
<P> ``These guys will probably stay around for a while,'' he added, indicating the army troops. </P>
<P> Residents of the towns above San Cristobal, the second largest city of Chiapas, watched police and troops come and go but said Zapatista rebels and their supporters were not far away. </P>
<P> ``There are a lot of spies watching all this, up there in the mountains,'' said Dona Belinda, a storeowner in her 40s in Puerto Cate. </P>
<P> Reporters returning from the village of Larrainzar, about 12 miles northwest of San Cristobal, said unarmed Zapatista supporters had again blocked the road nearby, suggesting a developing game of cat-and-mouse with security forces in the region. </P>
<P> In the strongest show of force since a cease-fire took hold nearly 12 months ago in this poor southern state's peasant rebellion, the police and army troops Tuesday tore down handpainted signs posted across northern Chiapas which proclaimed the area under control of the Zapatista National Liberation Army. They met no resistance. </P>
<P> The show of force failed to reassure Mexico's rattled financial markets, already hit by a devaluation of the peso Tuesday. Stock prices plummeted 10 percent Wednesday amid continuing uncertainty about how the Chiapas situation will develop. </P>
<P> The Zapatistas rocked Mexico in January by launching a New Year's Day rebellion for greater democracy and indigenous rights. At least 145 people died in the early days of the war. </P>
<P> President Ernesto Zedillo has taken a tough tone with the rebels since they announced Monday that many of their fighters had slipped through a military cordon around their jungle strongholds in the east of the country. </P>
<P> Zedillo has warned the Zapatistas against threats, blackmail or ``spectacular coups'' to try to force the government's hand. </P>
<P> But he repeated a promise that the army would maintain the Jan. 12 cease-fire and called again for dialogue. </P>
<P> The rebels take their name from famed Mexico revolutionary Emiliano Zapata, who led a peasant army during the country's 1910 revolution. </P>
