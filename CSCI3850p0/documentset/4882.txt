<P>  The United States, who are expected to sweep all before them at the Pan-American Games, got off to a spluttering start Sunday, finishing second in several events they had high hopes of winning. </P>
<P> Near the end of a day which saw four Pan-American swimming records sent tumbling, the United States were trailing Cuba, who picked up five golds in the weightlifting, by 10-7 in the gold medal count. </P>
<P> The biggest disappointment for the U.S. contingent came in the diving, where they had nurtured hopes of taking all six gold medals on offer. They won five out of six in 1991. </P>
<P> But their dreams were quickly shattered when Mexico's Fernando Platas claimed his country's first gold medal, finishing with 661.80 points, well ahead of U.S. veteran Mark Bradshaw who took the silver with 624.93. </P>
<P> The United States failed to win a single gold in any of the six canoeing and kayak races and their total of three out of five swimming golds was at best satisfactory for a team aiming to beat the 1991 haul of 24 swimming golds. </P>
<P> Angel Martino in the women's 100 meters freestyle and the women's 4x200 meters relay team both broke Games records on the way to winning gold. </P>
<P> The cycling time trials provided greener pickings with Clay Mosely overcoming painful cramps to win the 50-km race. ``The finish line just hung in the distance and I wasn't making any ground on it,'' he said. </P>
<P> Dede Demet comfortably won the women's 25-km time trial but then had to overcome a wobbly medals podium. ``The medal stand wasn't stabilized very well and when I stood on it, it kind of swayed,'' she said. </P>
<P> The host nation meanwhile had plenty to celebrate. </P>
<P> They followed up Saturday's baseball win over the United States, represented by the collegiate team from St. John's University, with an even more surprising win over Puerto Rico by 4-3 in group A. </P>
<P> Argentina, who had only previously taken part in Pan-Am baseball in the inaugural games in 1951, now appear to be heading for the final round. </P>
<P> They also celebrated two kayak gold medals while the women's field hockey team thrashed Paraguay 8-0 and the men beat Trinidad-Tobago 12-0. </P>
<P> Nora Vega, a native of Mar del Plata who lit the Olympic flame during Saturday's opening ceremony, won her fifth Pan-American speed roller skating gold medal at the age of 33, 16 years after her four golds in the 1979 Games in Puerto Rico. </P>
<P> Gustavo Borges, despite taking part in his less favored event, won Brazil's first gold medal in the men's 200 meters freestyle swimming, setting a new Pan-American Games record. </P>
<P> Canada's Joanne Malar did likewise as she won the women's 400 meters swimming medley. </P>
