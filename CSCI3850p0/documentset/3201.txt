<P>  South African President Nelson Mandela launched his autobiography Wednesday and said filmmakers were bidding for the rights to his story. </P>
<P> He also joked that sometimes he wished he were back in prison where he had more time to read. </P>
<P> ``Offers are being tendered. I would not say it is a bidding frenzy, although there are quite a number of them. But I won't be available for acting in it. I'm no actor,'' he told a news conference to launch ``Long Walk to Freedom.'' </P>
<P> Mandela said he would give profits from the book to the African National Congress as he had with all gifts of money. </P>
<P> He said he was considering updating the book to include his time as president since May this year. </P>
<P> Mandela was sentenced to life in jail in 1964 for treason and inciting sabotage but was released in February 1990 when the then president F.W. de Klerk began dismantling apartheid. </P>
<P> ``In some respects I feel I want to go back to prison because there I had the time to read everything I liked,'' Mandela said. </P>
<P> ``I also had time to think... Now it is very difficult to sit and think. But I am jotting down notes. I keep a diary. I find it very interesting to record my experiences.'' </P>
