<P>  Solidarity and friendship between China and Vietnam, rather than their disputes, were the keynotes for an official visit by Chinese leader Jiang Zemin Sunday. </P>
<P> ``It is a very important event in friendly Sino-Vietnamese relations,'' Vietnam's Communist Party general-secretary, Do Muoi, told Reuters after casting his vote in local elections. </P>
<P> ``With the visit of Jiang Zemin, the solidarity, friendship and multi-sided cooperation will be raised to a higher level for the sake of the two countries' development,'' Muoi said. </P>
<P> ``The two sides will discuss the issue of friendship, friendship and friendship, solidarity, solidarity and solidarity.'' </P>
<P> Authorities put up huge red placards expressing the same sentiments in gold letters at locations Jiang will visit during his three days in Hanoi, including the 1,000-year-old Temple of Literature, Vietnam's oldest university. </P>
<P> Jiang is the first Chinese Communist Party general-secretary and the second Chinese president to visit Vietnam, the world's second most populous communist state. </P>
<P> He arrived Saturday in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, Vietnam's second city. He was feted at a banquet hosted by local party secretary Vo Tran Chi in Reunification Hall, once the presidential palace of the ousted U.S.-backed South Vietnam government. </P>
<P> Xinhua news agency in Beijing quoted Chi as saying remarkable progress had been made in recent years in relations between the two countries and ruling parties. </P>
<P> ``We are determined to devote our major efforts to foster such relations and make them grow stronger with each passing day,'' Xinhua, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation, quoted him as saying. </P>
<P> Jiang praised the role of Ho Chi Minh City and of joint venture projects in developing cooperation, the report said. </P>
<P> Jiang is the most senior Chinese leader to visit Vietnam since the two countries normalized relations in 1991 after more than a decade of estrangement and hostility. </P>
<P> China seized the disputed Paracel islands in the South China Sea in 1974 and the two countries fought a border war in 1979. They were at odds over Vietnam's 1979-89 occupation of Cambodia and clashed in the disputed Spratly Islands in 1988. </P>
<P> They remain in dispute over parts of their land border, the undemarcated Gulf of Tonkin, the Spratlys and oil drilling rights in parts of the South China Sea, which Vietnam calls the Eastern Sea. </P>
<P> But both countries are devoting their energies to building market economies. </P>
<P> Vietnam's army newspaper Quan Doi Nhan Dan Sunday underscored Hanoi's wish to settle disputes peacefully. </P>
<P> ``Although the two sides have outstanding issues and disputes, both (seek) their solution through peaceful negotiations and are committed not to complicate the situation in bilateral relations,'' it said in an editorial. </P>
