<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The jury in the Heidi Fleiss trial began deliberations Tuesday to determine if the so-called ''Hollywood Madam'' is guilty of running a high-priced call girl ring catering to Hollywood's rich and famous. </P>
<P> Fleiss, 28, has pleaded not guilty to five charges of pandering -- recruiting prostitutes -- and one charge of possessing cocaine for sale. She faces up to 11 years in prison if convicted. </P>
<P> The seven-man, five-woman panel was given the case by Superior Court Judge Judith Champagne shortly after 9 a.m. (noon EST) after she had instructed them on the law for about 45 minutes. </P>
<P> The panel went home for the day about six-and-a-half hours later without reaching a verdict. They were due to resume their deliberations Wednesday morning. </P>
<P> In weighing the case against Fleiss, the daughter of a wealthy Beverly Hills pediatrician, the jury was considering seven days of testimony as well as videotapes of the June 1993, sting operation that led to her arrest. </P>
<P> Those tapes show Fleiss meeting with Beverly Hills Police Det. Sammy Lee and apparently boasting about her business skills. </P>
<P> Lee asks for four women and two ``eight-balls'' of cocaine, and Fleiss repeatedly assures him that such an arrangement is ''no problem.'' </P>
<P> The jury also heard testimony from two of the women who arrived at Lee's Beverly Hilton hotel suite on June 9, and who told of agreeing to sex and oral sex for $1,500 before they were taken into custody. They were eventually granted immunity. </P>
<P> Samantha Burdette said she was sent to the hotel by Fleiss, who was to receive 40 percent of the fee. </P>
<P> Lawyers for Fleiss maintained throughout the trial that their client was entrapped by the detectives, who they say wasted time and money targeting a ``victimless'' crime. </P>
<P> During closing arguments Monday, Fleiss attorney Anthony Brooklier cited legal Nevada brothels and the movie ``Pretty Woman,'' which painted a sympathetic portrait of prostitution, to show that it is largely tolerated in the United States. </P>
<P> ``Is anybody mad at Richard Gere? Is anybody mad at Julia Roberts? Doesn't this get a little silly after a while?'' Brooklier asked in a reference to the movie's stars. </P>
<P> The lawyer also reminded jurors that none of Fleiss' alleged customers had ever been prosecuted -- a sign, he said, that even the authorities didn't take prostitution seriously. </P>
<P> Fleiss and her father, Dr. Paul Fleiss, are scheduled to stand trial in federal court in January on charges that they laundered money from her alleged ring. Both have pleaded innocent. </P>
