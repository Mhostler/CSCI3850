<DATELINE>TIRANA, Albania (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Albanian human rights activists issued an appeal Tuesday urging President Sali Berisha to free jailed opposition Socialist leader Fatos Nano. </P>
<P> In a statement issued in the capital, the Albanian Helsinki Committee said freeing Nano would reduce political tensions. </P>
<P> The appeal followed a prison visit to Nano by delegates of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) earlier this month. </P>
<P> The IPU, grouping legislators from parliaments around the world, in September called for Nano's release, citing what it said were irregularities in his case. It has made no public comment on its latest visit. </P>
<P> The Helsinki Committee said there were doubts about the justice of Nano's April 1994 conviction for misappropriating state funds while he was prime minister in 1991. </P>
<P> Nano's Socialist party is the reformist heir to the communist party that ruled Albania for 45 years until March 1992. The Socialists say Berisha's ruling Democratic party perverted justice to eliminate political opponents. </P>
<P> Nano's appeal was rejected in July and he is now serving a 12-year sentence in Tepelena prison in southern Albania. </P>
<P> The Helsinki committee said an increasing number of Albanians considered his sentence ``unfair and unfounded.'' </P>
<P> ``Nano's release would be a message that would serve to lower tensions, narrowing the gap which now divides political forces and creating a more relaxed and constructive atmosphere,'' their statement said. </P>
