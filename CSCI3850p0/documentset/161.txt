<P>  North Korea's ruling Communist Party daily hailed Kim Jong-il Monday as the heir to his late father, President Kim Il-sung, in a further strong indication that his succession is assured. </P>
<P> The Rodong Sinmun newspaper ran a fulsome editorial amid reports that the body of the ``Great Leader,'' North Korea's Stalinist ruler for half a century, is to lie in state from Tuesday in the capital, Pyongyang. </P>
<P> Kim died Friday, aged 82. The funeral has been set for next Sunday. </P>
<P> Authorities appeared to be moving quickly to ensure a speedy, trouble-free succession. </P>
<P> Members of the Communist Party's central committee were reported to be converging on Pyongyang to name a new general secretary -- the country's top job. </P>
<P> South Korean intelligence reports said a meeting of the nation's rubber-stamp parliament had also been called, presumably to choose a new head of state. </P>
<P> For two decades, Kim Il-sung groomed his eldest son, now 52, to succeed him. During the past two years, Jong-il has been officially described as being in charge of North Korea's day-to-day affairs. </P>
<P> However, despite his son's increasing political role, the Great Leader never relinquished the three key posts of party chief, state president and chairman of the party's central military commission -- which gave him ultimate political control over the armed forces. </P>
<P> Now, signs are increasingly strong that Kim Jong-il is set finally to enter into his full inheritance. </P>
<P> Rodong Sinmun said of him Monday: ``His tested leadership definitely guarantees the successful inheritance and accomplishment through generations of the revolutionary cause of juche started and led by Comrade Kim Il-sung.'' </P>
<P> ``Juche'' was Kim's doctrine of national self-sufficiency. </P>
<P> ``Even if the world had changed hundreds of times and the earth had broken, our people would advance along the road hewn by Comrade Kim Il-sung and defend all his revolutionary feats like the apple of the eye,'' the party daily said. </P>
<P> ``We will entrust our destiny entirely to Comrade Kim Jong-il and remain loyal and devoted to him. </P>
<P> ``No matter what may happen, we must accomplish the cause of socialism and build on this land a communist paradise where the independence of the popular masses is fully achieved, thus realising what the great leader desired,'' the daily added. </P>
<P> Meanwhile, Japanese journalist Kaoru Nakamaru told NHK television in a telephone interview from Pyongyang she had heard from a high-ranking government official that Kim's body would be taken later in the day to the assembly hall where it was to lie in state. </P>
<P> She said the official had told her mourners were expected to begin filing past the body of the ``Great Leader'' on Tuesday. </P>
