<P>  The wife of a Guatemalan guerrilla leader sought U.S. government action Friday to determine the fate of her husband who has been missing, or perhaps dead, in the Central American country for more than two years. </P>
<P> Jennifer Harbury met for about an hour with the White House National Security Council official in charge of the region, Richard Feinberg, who informed her of the results of the U.S. review of Guatemala's human rights practices, administration officials said. </P>
<P> At the State Department, spokeswoman Christine Shelly said the Clinton administration would continue to press the Guatemalan government for a full accounting of what happened to Efrain Bamaca, whom Harbury married in 1991. </P>
<P> ``While we have no conclusive evidence, based on all of the information available to us, it is our considered assessment that her husband died in military custody in 1992 after a short, but indeterminate, period of captivity and interrogation,'' Shelly said. </P>
<P> Harbury was told by the Guatemalan government that Bamaca died during combat in 1992, but she says she has witnesses who saw him alive in military prisons. </P>
<P> Harbury, 43, a Harvard-educated lawyer, has threatened to begin a hunger strike Sunday outside the White House to demand that the United States press Guatemala to give a full accounting of what happened to her husband. </P>
<P> Harbury met Bamaca, known by his nom-de-guerre of Commander Everardo, when she spent a month with his unit in the Guatemalan mountains in 1990, while she was researching a book. </P>
<P> The State Department had raised the case ``at the highest levels of the Guatemalan government,'' including the solicitor and prosecutor generals, the defense minister and President Ramiro de Leon, she said. </P>
<P> More than 100,000 people have been killed and about 40,000 have ``disappeared'' in 34 years of civil war in Guatemala. </P>
