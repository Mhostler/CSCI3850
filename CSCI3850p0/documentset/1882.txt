<DATELINE>ST ANDREWS, Scotland (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Unseeded Canada, inspired by 42-year-old Dave Barr, reached golf's Dunhill Cup semifinals for the first time with a victory over Germany Saturday. </P>
<P> The defending champion U.S. team blanked New Zealand 3-0 to set up a semifinal match with England, which rolled over Australia 3-0. </P>
<P> Barr, playing in his eighth Dunhill Cup, nosed out Bernhard Langer in the key match of the Canada-Germany clash. </P>
<P> ``I have never been so nervous,'' said Barr. ``I was ready to have a heart attack. </P>
<P> ``It's our first time in the semifinals and that's great for the other guys, who are both here for the first time.'' </P>
<P> In the semifinals Canada will face third-seeded South Africa, which beat Scotland 2-1 to clinch a semifinal berth. </P>
<P> Canada nosed out second-seeded Zimbabwe for its spot in the semis. Both teams scored 2-1 victories in their final group ties and had identical match records. </P>
<P> But the Canadians advanced because of their victory over Zimbabwe on Friday when Barr beat world No. 1 Nick Price. </P>
<P> Barr's victory over world No. 4 Langer on Saturday hinged on the notorious ``Road Hole'' 17th on St Andrews' Old Course. </P>
<P> Tied after 16 holes, Langer hit his second shot over the green onto the grass verge and elected to putt up the bank from there instead of chipping. </P>
<P> But his putt was too strong and rolled over the green on the other side from where he chipped to eight feet and holed the putt. </P>
<P> Barr knocked a 65-foot putt to two feet and made a par 4. At the last Langer had a chance to birdie from 15 feet but it hit the cup and lipped out. </P>
<P> Explaining his decision to putt at the 17th, Langer said: ``It was a terrible lie, on hard ground and slightly downhill. So I took the putter. </P>
<P> ``I thought the bank would kill it but the ball jumped and ran over. Then I had to hope I could birdie the last and tie it.'' </P>
<P> Though Ray Stewart lost to Sven Struver on the first hole of a playoff, Rick Gibson, who had an 85 on the opening day, beat Alexander Cejka 69-73 as the Canadians squeezed into the last four. </P>
<P> Tom Kite sparked the triumph over New Zealand for the United States, which had to win 3-0 when Ireland, which had defeated the Americans on Friday, beat Japan 2-1. </P>
<P> Kite showed great composure down the stretch to beat Grant Waite by two strokes, his first victory in three attempts. </P>
<P> Price and Tony Johnstone won for Zimbabwe with rounds of 70, but Mark McNulty's 70 was three strokes too many against Jesper Parnevik's 67. Zimbabwe needed to win 3-0 to advance. </P>
<P> ``There was no way Mark could do anything the way Jesper played. That's the way it goes,'' Price said. </P>
<P> For Australia, world No. 2 Greg Norman's 72 was not enough to contain Mark Roe's 69 for fifth-seeded England. </P>
<P> A delighted Roe said, ``It's great to beat one of your heroes.'' </P>
<P> Norman, back after five weeks of illness, said: ``I just didn't make any putts. It was a flat day for me today. Mark did all the right things but I'm happy with how I played here.'' </P>
<P> Norman said he needed to sharpen his chipping and putting to regain his best form. </P>
<P> England completed a whitewash with Barry Lane's win over Robert Allenby and Howard Clark's over Steve Elkington. </P>
<P> Ireland lost its chance when Philip Walton ran into a red-hot Yoshinori Mizumaki of Japan, who fired an 8-under-par 64, the best round of the week, to beat him by six shots. </P>
<P> South Africa advanced when Scotland's top player Colin Montgomerie bogeyed four successive holes on the front nine agsinst David Frost and lost by three. </P>
<P> U.S. Open champion Ernie Els delivered the other point for South Africa with a 68 against Gordon Brand Jr, regaining his putting touch after two poor days on the greens. </P>
