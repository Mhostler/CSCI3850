<P>  Bad weather and a faulty radar altimeter and a pressure sensor threaten to delay the scheduled liftoff Thursday of space shuttle Endeavour's 10-day environmental research mission. </P>
<P> Engineers discovered the failed radar altimeter in Endeavour's cockpit and technicians struggled with a faulty pressure sensor in a system used to check for leaks in the shuttle's onboard liquid hydrogen and oxygen storage tanks. </P>
<P> Countdown director Bill Dowdell said it appeared both problems could be solved without further effect on Endeavour's launch countdown, now in its second day. </P>
<P> ``We're about two hours down, that's all,'' Dowdell told a Tuesday morning news conference at the Kennedy Space Center. </P>
<P> He said the altimeter could be replaced and ground crews already had improvised a ``workaround'' for a bad cable attached to the pressure sensor. </P>
<P> Endeavour is scheduled to lift off at 6:54 a.m. EDT Thursday with six astronauts who intend to spend 10 days in orbit surveying the environment with the Space Radar Laboratory. </P>
<P> Shuttle meteorologist Ed Priselac said Tuesday that the Atlantic coast launch site was ``in kind of an uncertain period right now'' weatherwise. </P>
<P> The odds of an on-time launch remained ``on the good side of 50 percent,'' Priselac told reporters. </P>
<P> But he said the remnants of Tropical Storm Beryl and a storm system approaching Florida from the Caribbean could combine to create clouds or thunderstorms and force a delay. Beryl drifted ashore near Panama City, Florida, late Monday. </P>
