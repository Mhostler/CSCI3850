<DATELINE>MINEOLA, N.Y. (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Colin Ferguson was found guilty Friday evening of murdering six people in a shooting spree on a crowded commuter train in that police said was a racially motivated attack by the black Jamaican immigrant. </P>
<P> As the verdicts were read out, Ferguson, dressed in a suit, stood impassively, occasionally licking his lips and rolling his eyes. </P>
<P> There was a cry of delight from survivors in the courtroom and from relatives of those slain in the rampage as Ferguson also was convicted of wounding 19 other passengers on the Long Island Rail Road train. </P>
<P> The 37-year-old defendant, who said he had been a victim himself in the December 1993 shootings, was found not guilty of a number of civil rights charges of aggravated assault. </P>
<P> The trial drew nationwide attention because of its racial overtones and Ferguson's insistence on defending himself rather than rely on a lawyer. But he never took the stand to testify in his own defense. </P>
<P> The jury, which had heard 15 witnesses identify Ferguson as the shooter, began its deliberations at 10 a.m. EST Friday and reached a verdict almost 12 hours later. </P>
<P> Families of the injured and the dead had spent a restless day in the courtroom waiting for the verdict in what had seemed an open-and-shut case. </P>
<P> Ferguson, in a bizarre turn as attorney, became a nightly fixture on nationwide television as he questioned many of those he had shot at, as well as those who ended the rampage by wrestling him to the ground . </P>
<P> Referring to himself in the third person as ``Mr. Ferguson'' during cross-examination, Ferguson on a number of occasions was corrected by witnesses who insisted he was the gunman. </P>
<P> In one exchange, a witness under cross-examination told Ferguson directly: ``You shot me.'' </P>
<P> His original lawyers, whom he dismissed, had wanted to enter a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, stressing that he was driven to his attack by ``black rage.'' But Ferguson refused that line of defense. </P>
<P> When he was arrested, police discovered a series of rambling notes in his pockets accusing people he said had tormented him of being racists. </P>
<P> In his summation to the jury, Ferguson denied he was the killer, saying a white man had stolen his gun from him while he slept aboard the train on Dec. 7, 1993. </P>
<P> But he was overpowered at the scene by passengers he had been shooting at and was quickly arrested by police, who recovered the gun used in the shootings. Fifteen witnesses identified him as the killer. </P>
<P> In his rambling, three-hour summation to the jury Thursday, Ferguson said he was himself a victim of the shooting and that all of the witnesses and victims who came into court were lying and part of a conspiracy against him. </P>
<P> He urged the jury to ``make a decision that is favorable to the defense. Do not worry what is going to happen to you because you will be protected. Vindicate Mr. Ferguson. Do not destroy his life more than it has already been destroyed. He has suffered.'' </P>
<P> After he finished his summation, his legal adviser, Alton Rose, told reporters that Ferguson confided in him that he wished he had not acted as his own lawyer. </P>
<P> Nassau County Assistant District Attorney George Peck told the jurors in his closing statement: ``The man hates the world and he asks you to give him sympathy? God, the suffering he caused. ... The fact of the matter is that he just likes to hear himself talk. It's his forum.'' </P>
