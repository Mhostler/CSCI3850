<P>  China's fight against AIDS should focus on its huge urban hotel industry, the source of a disproportionate number of AIDS cases, a Chinese expert was quoted on Tuesday as saying. </P>
<P> Wang Aixia, an acquired immune deficiency syndrome expert at Beijing's Capital Hospital, said China's thousands of hotel workers should undergo mandatory AIDS awareness training and screening for the AIDS virus, the Guangming Daily reported. </P>
<P> ``One can see from the way AIDS is spreading in China that hotel workers represent a relatively large proportion of urban AIDS sufferers and carriers of the virus,'' Wang said. ``What's more, most have been infected through sexual contact.'' </P>
<P> Of eight Chinese patients with full-blown AIDS at his hospital, Wang said five were hotel workers -- three men, all of whom have died, and two women, who were sexual partners with two of the three men. </P>
<P> The report did not say why Wang thought hotel workers were susceptible to AIDS. Prostitution, a key AIDS conduit in many countries, is conducted largely in hotels in China. </P>
<P> Experts also have expressed concern about well-travelled businessmen infected by sex-industry workers in southeast Asia and other AIDS-stricken regions who then transmit it to casual sexual partners in China during visits. </P>
<P> Although long-term foreign residents of China are required to submit to AIDS tests under a 1989 quarantine law, business travelers and other short-term visitors are exempt. </P>
<P> Wang proposed universal testing of hotel workers' knowledge of AIDS, issuing work certificates only to those with passing marks who also test negative for the AIDS virus. </P>
<P> China has diagnosed 1,774 people as infected with the AIDS-causing human immunodeficiency virus but experts, citing poor surveillance, inefficient reporting and misdiagnosis, say the actual number could be more than 10,000. </P>
<P> At the end of 1994, 65 of China's HIV carriers had developed AIDS and 45 had died. </P>
<P> Officials have warned that China's relatively tiny number of AIDS cases could quadruple in the next decade through HIV contamination of its largely unscreened blood supply. </P>
