<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The United States and Japan agreed Saturday to make a mid-week attempt to resolve their trade dispute but few expect breakthroughs until negotiators are closer to Friday's U.S. sanctions deadline. </P>
<P> ``We're not there yet, that's for sure. There's no question but that this will go all week,'' said a U.S. official. </P>
<P> The most probable outcome at week's end, according to U.S. sources, is a partial deal and partial sanctions. </P>
<P> On Saturday, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor and Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono met for a fourth straight day and tentatively agreed to reconvene Wednesday, either here or in New York. </P>
<P> Kono, who headed to New York for United Nations sessions, brushed off the sanctions threat and told reporters: ``It is necessary for the U.S. and Japan to make more effort.'' </P>
<P> The aim will be to turn 14 months of negotiations into written deals giving U.S. exporters greater access to Japanese markets, averting threatened punititive U.S. action. </P>
<P> Since the talks began last summer, no results have emerged despite efforts to cut Japan's $60 billion trade surplus with the United States and do away with a web of regulations and barriers that Washington says restrict free and fair trade. </P>
<P> ``Japan is becoming convinced, maybe for the first time, that we're serious about redefining our trade relationship,'' Commerce Secretary Ron Brown told Reuters in California. </P>
<P> ``I wouldn't say I'm confident, but I'd say I'm hopeful that we can reach a breakthrough.'' </P>
<P> Brown, nonetheless, said Washington would not shrink from hitting Tokyo with sanctions should the negotiations fail. </P>
<P> Japan's trade minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, also sounded a defiant note, saying Tokyo was trying hard but would not be cowed into submission because of the U.S. threat. </P>
<P> ``It is not us that stated a deadline,'' Hashimoto said on a trip to Thailand. ``Are you asking the Japanese government to compromise on our basic principles in order to make the deadline of the 30th of September?'' </P>
<P> ``These negotiations have to be a two-way exercise.'' </P>
<P> But neither side is predicting rapid breakthroughs. </P>
<P> One U.S. negotiator said he expected the posturing to last until the final hour, noting that the Japanese delegation had booked hotel rooms right through Friday's deadline. </P>
<P> ``And it's too soon to tell if we get anywhere by then.'' </P>
<P> A Japanese official was equally gloomy, predicting the deadline may come and go without any major steps forward. </P>
<P> ``There is a general spread of a feeling of resignation. They (the Americans) are asking too much,'' he said. </P>
<P> In February -- the previous deadline for a deal -- days of talk yielded no results, roiling foreign exchange markets as currency trades dumped dollars and snapped up yen. </P>
<P> Neither side wants a replay of that scenario, but the Japanese aide conceded ``we may just go to the end of the month and see a repeat of February 11.'' </P>
<P> The best hope, therefore, may be for both sides to settle for a less-than-perfect deal accompanied by some sanctions. </P>
<P> Such a package is shaping up, though it is far from assured given all the complex tradeoffs under negotiation. </P>
<P> Both sides say a deal on insurance is nearly certain. </P>
<P> Yet some say that the pledge by Tokyo to deregulate its industry is being held hostage to a parallel pact on procurement, which is edging forward but is not sealed. </P>
<P> Without a procurement sector deal, sanctions seem assured. </P>
<P> Officials say the two sides are far apart on auto trade, which leaves two-thirds of the trade imbalance totally untouched. Hence the need, Washington says, for sanctions. </P>
<P> Top of the list: Japanese flat glass, which would affect a relatively minor industry and in which the United States feels it can detail a textbook case of Japanese cartelization. </P>
<P> Secondly, replacement car parts could also come under sanctions action, which would drastically raise the stakes given the high profile of the Japanese auto industry. </P>
