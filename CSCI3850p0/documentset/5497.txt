<P>  Attorneys for a British-born man scheduled to die in Georgia's electric chair, faced a series of setbacks Wednesday as they sought to save him with a flurry of last-minute legal appeals. </P>
<P> A state judge and the U.S. Supreme Court both refused to halt the execution, and a federal district judge denied Nicholas Ingram's request to have a ``spiritual advisor'' with him in prison until the time of his execution, set for 7 p.m. EDT Thursday. </P>
<P> U.S. District Judge Horace Ward ruled that Ingram ``has not indicated how face-to-face contact is essential to the practice of his religion during the hours prior to his death.'' </P>
<P> The Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles heard from Ingram's attorneys during an hour-long closed-door meeting Wednesday afternoon. The board said it would issue a decision Thursday morning on whether to stay the execution of Ingram, 31, who has dual U.S. and British citizenship. </P>
<P> In an unprecedented action, board chairman Wayne Garner said he would go to the Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Center to meet with Ingram. ``Before this board's going to make a decision, I have some questions to ask the young man,'' Garner said. </P>
<P> After a two-hour hearing in Butts County, where the prison housing the electric chair is located, Superior Court Judge Hal Craig refused to halt the execution. He also rejected a request by Ingram's lawyers that his conviction be set aside because Ingram was taking the mind-altering drug Thorazine during his 1983 trial. </P>
<P> The judge ruled that Ingram's attorneys had offered no evidence that could not have been presented during previous appeals. His decision was immediately appealed to the Georgia Supreme Court. </P>
<P> Ingram was convicted in 1983 of murdering J.C. Sawyer, 55, after forcing his way into the Sawyer home, tying the man and his wife to a tree behind the house, robbing them of $60 and shooting both in the head. Mrs. Sawyer survived the shooting and identified Ingram as her assailant during the trial. </P>
<P> The Supreme Court Wednesday denied a separate request to stay the execution. A clerk said the court did not issue an opinion in the case. </P>
<P> Prison officials, for security reasons, will not allow Ingram to have any visitors during the three hours preceding the execution. They will allow him to speak with his attorney by telephone. </P>
<P> Ingram originally was scheduled to die in 1984 but has been able to avoid execution three times through appeals. </P>
