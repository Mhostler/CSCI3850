<P>  Peruvian presidential candidate Javier Perez de Cuellar said Saturday that if he were to win next year's elections, his government would take a leading role in regional integration and the creation of a hemispheric free trade zone. </P>
<P> Perez de Cuellar, in a policy speech at the Annual Conference of Business Executives (CADE '94), proposed the union of two regional trade groups -- the Andean Pact and MERCOSUR -- ``so that we can negotiate the creation of hemispheric free trade zone.'' </P>
<P> The Andean Pact is comprised of Venezuela, Ecuador, Columbia and Bolivia, with Peru participating only as an observer. MERCOSUR is a regional group comprised of Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Brazil. </P>
<P> Perez de Cuellar, a former secretary general of the United Nations, said his government would take a ``firm and coherent negotiating stance'' in the five-nation Andean Pact to achieve Peru's full reentry into the body. </P>
<P> This stance, he said, would be aimed at turning around ``a zig-zagging and weak position'' by President Alberto Fujimori's government. </P>
<P> Peru has been participating since August 1992 only as an observer in the Andean Pact trade body because of policy differences with the other four nations over the level of import tariffs. </P>
<P> With Peru's return to the Andean Pact, ``We will integrate MERCOSUR and the Andean Pact into a solid unit of South American free trade,'' Perez de Cuellar told some 800 participants of the conference in the coastal city 175 miles south of Lima. </P>
<P> In order to be a leader in regional trade, Peru must turn around ``the enormous deficit in the trade balance,'' Perez de Cuellar said. Peru projects it will have a trade deficit of some $700 million this year. </P>
<P> Perez de Cuellar said that Peru will also seek ``an effective negotiating position'' to join the Asia Pacific Economic Forum (APEC). But the former UN chief said that Peru's role in trade integration could only be consolidated with a democratic government. </P>
<P> Marking a difference with his opponent Fujimori, who according to at least one poll could win the April election in the first round with more than 50 percent of the vote, Perez de Cuellar said that if elected he would not ``throw up the chess board if I do not obtain a majority in Congress.'' </P>
<P> That was a reference to Fujimori's decision in April 1992 to suspend constitutional rule. Fujimori called new congressional elections and a new constitution was approved in 1993 that allows for his reelection. </P>
<P> Perez de Cuellar was the first of three presidential candidates, including Fujimori, who will speak at CADE, Peru's most important conference of private sector and government officials. </P>
<P> Answering questions put to him on the creation of employment, which is the theme of this year's conference, Perez de Cuellar said Peru would need to create 2 million jobs between 1995 and 2000. </P>
<P> ``In the next five years it will be necessary to reorient our strategy of national development,'' he said, adding that special emphasis should be placed on providing credit for small businesses, promoting agriculture and strengthening Peru's educational system. </P>
