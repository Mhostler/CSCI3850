<P>  The Israeli government Sunday approved the import of 19,000 foreign workers to replace some of the Palestinian agriculture and construction laborers barred from Israel after a bomb in Tel Aviv killed 22 people. </P>
<P> A cabinet statement said the decision would provide 4,000 more foreign workers to the farming sector and 15,000 to Israel's building industry. </P>
<P> Some ministers hailed the move as a step toward ending Israel's dependence on Palestinian workers. </P>
<P> Other ministers warned that the whittling down of the Palestinian work force in Israel would strain the Palestinian Authority running self-rule in Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho under the year-old PLO-Israel peace deal. </P>
<P> Israel sealed off the Gaza Strip and the West Bank indefinitely after a Muslim militant suicide bomber blew up a Tel Aviv bus last Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``Our efforts at the moment are strategic, to arrange things so that we can operate from the economy's point of view for a longer period on the basis of separation (between Israel and Palestinians),'' said Economics Minister Shimon Shetreet. </P>
<P> Absorption Minister Yair Tsaban expressed concern: ``There is no doubt this closure puts very serious stress on the residents of the territories... We must take into account the difficulties of our (peace) partner and not only our own difficulties.'' </P>
<P> Unemployment in the Gaza Strip according to U.N. estimates is running at 40 percent. </P>
<P> The new workers, to include a group from China, would be in addition to 34,200 workers from Romania and Thailand brought to Israel during previous closures. </P>
<P> Since March 1993 the Palestinian work force in Israel has been reduced to 60,000 from 90,000. Wednesday's closure brought the number to zero for the indefinite future. </P>
<P> Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said after imposing it that Israel faced ``a big decision'' on separating Israelis from Palestinians permanently. </P>
