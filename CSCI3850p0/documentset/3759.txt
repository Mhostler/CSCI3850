<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter)</DATELINE>
<P>  Republicans are considering drastic measures to keep their campaign promises of cutting taxes, increasing defense spending and balancing the federal budget, CBS News reported Friday evening. </P>
<P> CBS said a report it has obtained includes a ``working draft of potential areas for savings'' that amounts to an overhaul of vitually every government entitlement program except social security. </P>
<P> It said that New Hampshire Sen. Judd Gregg, chairman of the Senate working group, has asked colleagues to ``help find dramatic spending reductions'' ... and offers hundreds of suggestions. </P>
<P> CBS said the report considers massive cuts in welfare, including trimming the preschool educational program Head Start by 50 percent. It also suggests deep cuts in government medical coverage for the old and poor and changes in retirement benefits, as well as a one-month waiting period for unemployment benefits. </P>
<P> Sen. Gregg refused to release the report, CBS said, but when he learned the news program had gotten hold of it, stressed that the proposed drastic cuts were only options under consideration. </P>
<P> ``I guess my concern would be that if people said because it is in here you are going to do this,'' Gregg told CBS, referring to the draft report. ``Well, we might,'' he said, ``but then again we might not.'' </P>
