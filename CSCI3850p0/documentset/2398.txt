<P>  The Walt Disney Co and the Arapaho Nation, a Native American tribe, said Thursday they joined hands to teach the tribe's dying language to its children by translating the film ``Bambi'' into Arapaho. </P>
<P> Disney and the Arapaho Nation worked together to record ''Bambi'' in Arapaho and distribute it throughout the tribe. The film premier of the Arapaho version was to be shown in Lander, Wyoming, Thursday night. </P>
<P> ``Our language is fading and with it, a part of American history,'' said Stephen Greymorning, director of the Arapaho Language and Culture Enrichment Program. ``The youngest Arapaho fluent in the language is 43 years old.'' </P>
<P> ``We think that by offering (children) 'Bambi' in our native language, (it) will help inject some of our language back into our culture and provide a resource for learning the language,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``Bambi,'' which was originally released in 1942 and has been translated into 20 languages -- including Cantonese, Danish, Hebrew and Hindu -- fits well with the Arapaho environment and culture, Greymorning said. </P>
<P> Greymorning originally approached Roy Disney, vice chairman of the Walt Disney Co. and the head of its animation division, about translating ``Bambi'' into Arapaho. A total of 30 Arapaho ``actors,'' including 18 children, were chosen to do the recording. </P>
<P> Few were fluent in Arapaho and none had ever received voice or acting lessons. The troupe traveled 180 miles from their homes in Ethete, in central Wyoming, to the nearest sound studio in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, to record their voices. </P>
<P> The Arapaho Nation has a population of 13,200, spread out across the central plains and Rocky Mountain regions. </P>
<P> About 2,000 copies of the Arapaho video have been made. </P>
