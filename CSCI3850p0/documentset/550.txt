<P>  President Clinton Tuesday declared major disasters to the salmon fishing industries in Oregon and Washington state to assist those who lose their jobs because of restrictions on catching salmon. </P>
<P> Clinton declared eight Oregon counties and five counties in Washington eligible for disaster unemployment assistance because of limits imposed on salmon fishing. </P>

<P> The unemployment assistance is available for those who have lost their jobs because of the emergency steps, which remain in effect until next March 31. </P>
