<P>  Scientists trying to figure out how nicotine affects the brain reported Thursday that the drug appeared to make some mice think more quickly. </P>
<P> But mice that had a mutation making them unable to respond to nicotine were slowed down by the drug. </P>
<P> The researchers, working at the Institut Pasteur in Paris and at the Glaxo Institute for Molecular Biology in Geneva, found that nicotine enhanced the performance of normal mice trained to avoid an electric shock. </P>
<P> This seems consistent with other findings, and with claims by smokers, that nicotine helps them to concentrate and think more clearly. </P>
<P> But in a report in the science journal Nature, the scientists said mice resistant to the effects of nicotine showed the opposite effect -- nicotine slowed them down, and in the absence of nicotine they responded more quickly than the ``normal'' mice. </P>
<P> ``The enhanced performance of mutant mice versus wild-type mice is quite surprising... and further experiments using these mutant mice will help elucidate the mechanism underlying this behavioural difference,'' the researchers wrote. </P>
<P> ``These mice provide a model system for studying the pharmacological effects of nicotine in the central nervous system,'' they added. </P>
<P> Research has shown that nicotine locks on to areas in the brain that release acetylcholine, a chemical transmitter that helps neurons communicate. </P>
<P> There is some evidence that nicotine has a physical effect on the sites in the brain that release these transmitters. Many researchers suspect this is the cause of nicotine addiction, although tobacco companies say nicotine is not truly addictive. </P>
