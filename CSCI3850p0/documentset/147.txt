<DATELINE>KIEV, Ukraine (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Voting began Sunday in the run-off round of Ukraine's presidential election, pitting the incumbent Leonid Kravchuk against his former Prime Minister, Leonid Kuchma. </P>
<P> Only a handful of elderly voters were in one central Kiev polling station, swept by steady rain, by mid-morning. Polls were open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. (12 midnite to 1 p.m. EDT). </P>
<P> Kravchuk had a seven-point edge over Kuchma in a seven-man field in the first round, but opinion polls put the two men virtually even in the run-off. </P>
<P> Kravchuk has strong support in the national west, while Kuchma did well in the Russian-speaking, industrial east. </P>
<P> Results were expected some time Monday. </P>
<P> Voters were also electing a number of local councils. </P>
