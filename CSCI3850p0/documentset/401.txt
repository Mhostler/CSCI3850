<P>  Germany's high court Tuesday upheld the convictions of former East German defense minister Heinz Kessler and two other men for ordering the killing of people trying to flee through the Cold War border to the West. </P>
<P> Kessler is the most senior official from the defunct communist government to have been convicted of crimes committed while in office. </P>
<P> Dismissing the defendants' appeals against their conviction last September, the court confirmed the 7 3/8 year jail sentence imposed on Kessler and the 5 3/8 year term which his former deputy Fritz Streletz was ordered to serve. </P>
<P> It increased the jail sentence on former Suhl district Communist Party boss Hans Albrecht to five years and one month from the 4 3/8 years that had been imposed by the trial court. </P>
<P> The high court ruled that, as members of the hardline communist state's National Defense Council, all three men were guilty of the killing of East Germans shot while trying to break through the Berlin Wall or other border fortifications. </P>
<P> It was the Defense Council, chaired by East German leader Erich Honecker, which ordered border guards to shoot to kill. </P>
<P> Honecker was initially put on trial but was released in January 1993 because he was suffering from terminal liver cancer. He died in May this year in Chile. </P>
