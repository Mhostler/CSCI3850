<P>  U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor Wednesday signaled an end to a long-running trade spat with Singapore that erupted after a caning furor set the two nations sharply at odds. </P>
<P> In an interview with Reuters, Kantor said he would bless Singapore's bid to hold a global trade meeting -- but that he would still deny its wish to host the prestigious inaugural summit of the so-called World Trade Organization. </P>
<P> The dispute began when Singapore defied U.S. entreaties and caned an American teenager convicted of vandalism. </P>
<P> Kantor subsequently said he would block Singapore's bid to host the first ministerial meeting of the WTO, due to take over next year from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. </P>
<P> Revealing a compromise to break the impasse, Kantor said the first WTO ministerial session was now set to take place in Geneva and that the second meeting could then go to Singapore. </P>
<P> ``None of this has been determined,'' Kantor said. ``But obviously I think it would be a reasonable solution.'' </P>
