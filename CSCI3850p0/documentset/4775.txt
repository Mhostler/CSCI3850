<DATELINE>CARTERET, N.J. (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  An explosive fire at an Amoco terminal Tuesday forced the evacuation of a nearby shopping center, an elementary school and some residences, but the fire was quelled within 90 minutes without serious injury. </P>
<P> Two mostly empty fuel tanks were involved in the noon blaze. A contractor replacing a pump on pipes connecting the two allowed some fuel vapors to escape, according to a spokeswoman for the State Department of Environmental Protection. </P>
<P> Only one tank caught fire, and firefighters controlled it quickly with foam. Other nearby tanks were kept cool with firefighters' spray. </P>
<P> Traffic on the nearby New Jersey Turnpike was not affected, although officials closed neighboring access roads and Exit 12. </P>
