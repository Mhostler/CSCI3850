<P>  A Manila court erupted in cheers Tuesday as a Philipine town mayor and six aides were convicted of savagely raping and killing a female student and murdering her male companion. </P>
<P> Calauan Mayor Antonio Sanchez and the six others were each sentenced to life in prison for the killings, which shocked the nation in 1993. They denied the charges. </P>
<P> ``I am innocent... even if lightning strikes me now,'' Sanchez screamed as he was led from the packed courtroom at the end of the closely watched 18-month trial. </P>
<P> The seven were convicted of plotting the rape and murder of Eileen Sarmenta, 21, and the murder of Alan Gomez, 19, both students at the University of the Philippines in Los Banos, south of Manila. </P>
<P> Sanchez, mayor of nearby Calauan, will not be eligible for parole for 30 years. </P>
<P> There was bedlam at Pasig court even before the sentence was read out, with relatives of the accused wailing, sobbing and hurling abuse at the court. </P>
<P> Outside, spectators cheered as Sanchez was led out. Some threw missiles at him and shouted: ``That serves you right.'' </P>
