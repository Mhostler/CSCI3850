<P>  The government is set to unveil sweeping new government standards for inspecting chickens and turkeys to try to reduce disease-causing bacteria, Agriculture Department officials said Tuesday. </P>
<P> The new rules possibly to be announced this week will impose a key regulation that prohibits any visible fecal matter on the seven billion chickens and 300 million turkeys processed annually in the United States. </P>
<P> The regulation is already in place for the red meat industry. The Clinton administration has come under recent criticism for not moving faster to also impose the regulation on the multibillion-dollar poultry industry. </P>
<P> The new regulations will add an extra inspection point on poultry processing lines, require reinspection of all chickens found to be contaminated instead of just a sample, and require poultry processors to use bacteria-killing rinses, an Agriculture Department official said. </P>
<P> The rules are being reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget, where an official said the review is at ``mid-stage.'' The rules would go into effect after public comment. </P>
<P> The stricter new inspection rules will hopefully cut down on sicknesses caused by salmonella, a bacteria that raw poultry is often contaminated with, and other digestive disorders and illnesses caused by bacteria found on poultry. </P>
<P> Now every bird is inspected once. Under the new system, every bird will be inspected twice, said an official. </P>
<P> Most poultry processors already use a chlorine rinse to kill any salmonella and other bacteria when the birds are placed in a cold-water bath. The new rules will requre the processors to rinse the birds before the bath. </P>
<P> The administration has been criticized by the red meat industry for implementing stricter rules on the meat industry than on poultry, in large part because of Clinton's personal ties to Tyson Foods, the nation's largest poultry processor. </P>
<P> An Agriculture Department official said those criticisms are inaccurate and unfair. </P>
