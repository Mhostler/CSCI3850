<DATELINE>FORT IRWIN, Calif.(Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A disgruntled former National Guard soldier took two officers hostage at gunpoint at a military base Thursday, but they created a diversion and escaped several hours later, authorities said. </P>
<P> The suspect, William Carson, a 40-year-old ex-sergeant who was dishonorably discharged from the California National Guard in 1992, fired shots at the two men as they fled, said officials at the Army's Fort Irwin National Training Center. </P>
<P> Carson, who had threatened to harm the captain and lieutenant colonel he held hostage if they failed to meet his demands, remained barricaded inside a radio maintenance building. </P>
<P> An elite Army response unit, agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and a special weapons team from the San Bernardino County Sheriff's office, surrounded the building as negotiators tried to convince the man to surrender. </P>
<P> The gunman entered the building at about 8:45 a.m. PDT (11:45 a.m. EDT) and took the two men hostage, said sheriff's department spokesman Jim Bryant. </P>
<P> ``Carson gave his victims a three-hour time limit to meet certain demands and threatened violence to the victims if his demands were not met,'' according to a statement from the base's public affairs office. </P>
<P> ``Just prior to the three-hour limit, the victims created a diversion and were able to escape. The suspect fired shots at the victims, but both escaped unharmed,'' it said. </P>
<P> The men were identified as Capt. Jim Webster and Lt. Col. John Monies. </P>
<P> Carson had worked as a radio maintenance sergeant at Fort Irwin -- a sprawling Army post in the Mojave Desert about 190 miles northeast of Los Angeles. </P>
<P> He was discharged for ``conduct unbecoming'' a soldier in May 1992, but officials declined to elaborate. </P>
