<P>  Putting aside decisions on defense strategy and jury selection, football legend O.J. Simpson faced the same question Tuesday that occupied tens of millions of other Americans -- who to vote for? </P>
<P> During an Election Day court hearing, Simpson's lead attorney Robert Shapiro asked Judge Lance Ito for a written summary of candidates and issues so his client could cast an absentee ballot. </P>
<P> Simpson, who is facing trial on charges of murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman, was filling out his ballot while being held in the courthouse lockup during breaks in jury selection for his sensational trial. </P>
<P> Ito agreed to give Simpson the same package of printed material his clerks had compiled for jurors and potential jurors who been ordered to avoid television, radio, newspapers and even bookstores to keep from being tainted by publicity surrounding the case. </P>
<P> It was probably not the first time Simpson has voted by absentee ballot -- many celebrities do so to avoid being hounded for autographs when they go to the polling booths. </P>
<P> The judge Tuesday relaxed portions of his media blackout, telling the 12 sworn-in jurors and potential alternatives that could go back to watching their favorite television shows but to stay away from news and tabloid TV programs. </P>
<P> He also ordered them not to watch televised election returns -- which might be laced with news about the case -- and instead told them to get their voting results by phone from a member of the court staff. </P>
<P> Simpson has pleaded not guilty to charges of murdering his ex-wife and her aspiring model friend, who were found stabbed to death June 12. </P>
