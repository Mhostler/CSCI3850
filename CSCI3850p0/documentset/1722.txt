<P>  A gunman charged with killing an NBC television stagehand in front of the network's ``Today'' show studio window in Manhattan's Rockefeller Center last month has been found unfit to stand trial, prosecutors said Friday. </P>
<P> A court-appointed psychiatrist has determined that William Manny Tager, 46, a yarn and dye worker from Charlotte, North Carolina, is not fit to stand trial, Jennifer English, a spokeswoman for Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, said Friday. </P>
<P> Tager is charged in the second degree murder of Theron Campbell Montgomery, 33, who was killed August 31 on a crowded sidewalk outside the studio. </P>
<P> Tager returns to Manhattan Supreme Court October 21 when the full psychriatric report will be reviewed. </P>
<P> Prosecutors have the option of seeking another opinion, the spokeswoman said. </P>
<P> Tager told police he believed the U.S. television stations were shooting rays at him through his television set.  The shooting took place at 49th Street in Rockefeller Center, a popular site for tourists where thousands daily watch the televised production of the ``Today'' show. At the sound of gunfire, hundreds of pedestrians fell to the ground, hiding behind parked cars. </P>
<P> Ten days ago, Montgomery's widow filed a $100 million lawsuit against Rockefeller Center, the owner of the property, also naming the security firm that guards the complex. </P>
<P> The lawsuit also names the Chinese gun company Norinco, maker of the assault rifle used in the shooting of Montgomery. </P>
