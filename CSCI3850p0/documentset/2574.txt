<P>  Commerce Secretary Ron Brown said Sunday he was anxious to strike a car deal with Japan and voiced optimism the basics were now in place for progress. </P>
<P> Brown spoke after an hour-long meeting with Japanese Trade Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, who declined all comment. </P>
<P> ``Obviously I'm anxious to make substantial progress in the autos and auto-parts areas,'' Brown told reporters. ``I'm hopeful we've laid the groundwork for that.'' </P>
<P> Brown and Hashimoto, in town for Asia-Pacific trade talks, have engaged in a long and elaborate back and forth over car trade, which makes up 60 percent of the $60 billion bilateral trade imbalance. </P>
<P> This past month, the two sides have become avid penpals, trying to find some common ground by mail in a negotiating sector that has proven impossible to crack at the table. </P>
<P> As for progress right now, it is more a question of both men learning how to crawl rather than walk. </P>
<P> Last week, the two sides agreed with some hoopla to resume the car talks, which have logjammed even as other talks picked up pace. That said, they set no date for their next stab. </P>
<P> Nor did Brown and Hashimoto come up with a start date, despite dealing ``almost exclusively'' with autos, said the U.S. commerce chief. </P>
<P> But Brown swiftly noted: ``Any time you're involved in dialog and discussion, it's a good sign.'' </P>
<P> Indeed, his tone was in keeping with the kinder, gentler new face of U.S.-Japan trade relations, which have careened on and off boiling point these past two years, inflicting no small measure of damage on skittish currency and debt markets. </P>
<P> An auto deal is seen as key to reducing the imbalance and deflating tensions between the economic powerhouses. </P>
<P> The United States has long accused Japan of playing by its own rules when it comes to cars, be it locking foreign rivals out of dealerships, tinkering with prices to make its exports more competitive or operating quasi cartels that leave U.S. parts producers out in the cold. </P>
<P> For its part, Tokyo concedes there are problems in the sector but in large part blames the Big Three U.S. producers for failing to make cars that suit the Japanese way of life. </P>
<P> Either way, there has been nothing to show for 15 months of tortuous negotiation, leaving the trade imbalance stubbornly high. </P>
<P> While Brown said no formal date had been set for new talks, he said the top car negotiators from each side would soon meet to discuss ``the timing and the agenda. Having that initial meeting is a good sign of our desire to move forward.'' </P>
<P> Last month, the two sides agreed on a modest market-opening deal, covering insurance and procurement. </P>
<P> The deal broke a 15-month stalemate but senior U.S. officials said the Japanese ``never even got serious'' about car trade. To reflect that fact, the United States initiated a unilateral probe of Japan's spare car parts sector that could lead to sanctions in another 11 months. Brown said there was no ``specific'' discussion of the sanctions action in his meeting. </P>
