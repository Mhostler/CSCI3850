<P>  All 14 gray wolves brought from the Canadian Rockies and released in Yellowstone National Park are now roaming free, a park spokeswoman said Thursday. </P>
<P> ``There have been wolf tracks seen in a 300-yard circumference around one of the pens,'' Stacy Churchwell said. </P>
<P> The wolves, caught in Canada in January, are part of a controversial plan to re-establish the great predator in the U.S. Rocky Mountain region. Ranchers have challenged the plan in federal court, arguing that the wolves present a threat to livestock. </P>
<P> The wolves were initially transported to one-acre penned sites in the park in a so-called soft release program to give them time to acclimate to the new surroundings and form relationships in their new packs. When the gates were opened last week, the wolves were in no hurry to leave, but wildlife biologists said the animals would venture out of their pens on their own schedule. </P>
<P> Biologists will continue to monitor the wolves but from now on they are on their own in the park. Visitors to the park this summer may hear the wolves but they should not expect to see the carnivores, which go to great lengths to avoid humans, scientists say. </P>
