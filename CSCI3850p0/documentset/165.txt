<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A tearful Kim Jong-il, son and heir of the late North Korean President Kim Il-sung, received ambassadors paying respects to the only leader the Stalinist state has ever known, South Korean television showed early Tuesday. </P>
<P> Seoul's Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation showed the first pictures of reclusive ``Dear Leader'' Kim Jong-il since his father's death at 82 was announced Saturday. </P>
<P> It showed Kim weeping before a crystal sarcophagus containing his father's body as it lay in state at Pyongyang's presidential palace. </P>
<P> The video also showed Defense Minister O Jin-u and Prime Minister Kang Song-san at the ceremony, a sign the North Korean political and military elite was firmly behind Kim Jong-il's succession. </P>
<P> But the man who is taking up the reins of power in the communist world's first dynastic succession did not speak a word to the envoys who bowed to the sarcophagus. </P>
<P> One of the diplomats, contacted by telephone, said ambassadors, military attaches and a few others were summoned to the presidential palace and waited for four hours before being allowed in to view the coffin and shake the hands of the most important leaders present. </P>
<P> ``Kim Jong-il was present as the first person, the number one,'' the diplomat said. ``He was very serious and in deep sorrow, very concentrated, I would say.'' </P>
<P> Mourning music played throughout the brief ceremony. </P>
<P> Kim Jong-il was dressed in a dark-gray high-necked tunic with a black armband. He was not wearing traditional Korean mourning robes. </P>
<P> In striking contrast to the restrained ceremony inside the palace, tens of thousands of ordinary citizens in the capital mourned with barely controlled hysteria. </P>
<P> North Korean state TV showed beribboned military leaders wailing and tearing at their uniforms at the foot of a statue of Kim while others tearfully prostrated themselves before the flower-strewn effigy, beating the ground with their foreheads. </P>
<P> Kim Jong-il has long been his father's designated successor, but little is known of his personality, which has been the subject of fawning propaganda at home and wild rumors abroad. </P>
<P> South Korea and the United States, fearing for the future of a diplomatic initiative launched by Kim Il-sung in the weeks before he died, have acted to fan the flames of detente. </P>
<P> Seoul offered an olive branch to Pyongyang, saying it wanted cooperation once the crisis over North Korea's secret nuclear program had been resolved. </P>
<P> ``We want to talk, we want to cooperate and we want to work together (with North Korea) for security, for prosperity, for stability and for ultimate unification (of the Korean peninsula),'' South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-joo said. </P>
<P> ``We sincerely hope that the new leadership in Pyongyang will keep alive the recently created momentum for dialogue, resolve the nuclear issue and pursue peaceful co-existence and co-prosperity between North and South Korea,'' he said. </P>
<P> He said South Korea would seek economic cooperation with North Korea but added: ``The first order of business is to resolve the nuclear issue.'' </P>
<P> North Korea Monday postponed an unprecedented summit meeting with South Korea aimed at defusing Cold War tension. Talks in Geneva on the nuclear question between the United States and North Korea were postponed Sunday. </P>
<P> Members of the all-powerful Communist Party central committee and parliament gathered in Pyongyang, which South Korean officials said was a further sign Pyongyang was acting swiftly to fill the vacuum left by Kim Il-sung's death. </P>
<P> ``The South Korean government would recognize a Kim Jong-il system of North Korea as its dialogue partner if and when it comes into being,'' South Korean Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hong-koo said in parliament. </P>
<P> Han said Kim Jong-il was expected to continue his father's policy because he had been involved in recent years in ``policy making and implementation.'' </P>
<P> Kim Il-sung, who ruled with an iron fist for nearly half a century, carefully orchestrated the planned hereditary transfer of power to Kim Jong-il over two decades. </P>
<P> Han suggested Kim Jong-il might be more willing to compromise with the West to stop his country's ailing economy from sliding further. </P>
<P> ``With his charisma and his stature, the late president could probably make up for some of the serious economic difficulties, but with the new leadership, they will probably be even more vulnerable to further deterioration of the economic situation.'' </P>
