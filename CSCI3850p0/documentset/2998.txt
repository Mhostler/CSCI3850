<P>  Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres held ``good and important'' talks with his Egyptian counterpart that ranged from Syrian-Israeli negotiations to nuclear non-proliferation and Sinai peacekeeping, Peres' spokeswoman said. </P>
<P> Behira Bardugo said Peres and Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa met alone over dinner for more than two hours Sunday ahead of Monday's European security summit in the Hungarian capital. </P>
<P> Bardugo said Moussa had briefed Peres on Syria's attitude to peace overtures based on talks in Damascus last week between Eguptian President Hosni Mubarak and Syria's Hafez al-Assad. </P>
<P> Syria, she said, rejected any ``land for land'' peace deal. </P>
<P> Moussa and Peres also discussed the makeup of peacekeeping forces in the Sinai, signing the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the Palestinian peace process and Israel joining the Mediterranean Forum, which groups European and Middle Eastern states. </P>
<P> Egyptian officials could not be contacted for comment. </P>
<P> On Syria, Bardugo said, Peres asked Egypt to persuade Assad to open peace negotiations. </P>
<P> She said Moussa had told Peres that, contrary to reports in the Israeli media, Egypt was not demanding the withdrawal of any of the multi-national peacekeeping force in the Sinai who oversee the peace between Israel and Egypt. </P>
<P> ``They (Egypt) said there is no problem and they will keep it as it is without any change,'' Bardugo said. </P>
<P> ``About the NPT he (Moussa) told Mr Peres that we have some differences about this issue and they hope to deal with it in a quiet manner,'' she said without elaborating. </P>
<P> On the troubled peace process between Israel and the Palestinians, she said Moussa told Peres it would be ``catastrophic'' for Israel to back away from terms agreed with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in Oslo. </P>
<P> The two will be together again Monday at a meeting with other foreign ministers including Algeria's Mohamed Salah Dembri on the fringes of the 53-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe summit, she said. </P>
