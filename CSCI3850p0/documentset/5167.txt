<P>  Britain's Queen Elizabeth, adding to her new reputation as the ``Rain Queen,'' was greeted by a heavy storm in the South African sunshine resort of Durban Friday. </P>
<P> The queen and her husband, Prince Philip, were met at the city's airport by KwaZulu-Natal's Premier Frank Mdlalose and his cabinet on a sodden red carpet. </P>
<P> The Durban Light Infantry and the Natal Carbineers, who celebrate their 140th anniversary this year, braved the heavy rain to form a dripping guard of honor as the queen, clutching an umbrella, squelched her way down the red carpet. </P>
<P> At a Pretoria reception before flying to the Indian Ocean port, South Africa's Deputy President Thabo Mbeki bestowed on the queen the name ``Motlalepule'' -- meaning ``She who brings rain'' in the Sotho language. </P>
<P> ``I trust you will not mind if I bestow on you a happy African name, Motlalepule,'' he told the queen under leaden skies. ``You have brought us that great gift of rain, which in our culture portends wealth, happiness and good fortune.'' </P>
<P> The queen was greeted by a violent thunderstorm on her arrival in Pretoria Wednesday. Prince Philip was accompanied by rain in the arid Northern Cape and Northwest province. </P>
<P> Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, praying at a luncheon midway between Johannesburg and Pretoria Thursday, told the royal couple they had brought the blessing of rain to the country, which has had poor rains in the November-April season. </P>
<P> Tokyo Sexwale, premier of Gauteng province around Johannesburg, also thanked the queen ``for bringing English weather.'' </P>
<P> The queen was visiting a school in Durban's Umlazi township and was later to host President Nelson Mandela at a banquet aboard the royal yacht Britannia in Durban harbor. </P>
<P> Following the banquet, the band of the Royal Marines on the yacht was scheduled to perform the colorful ceremony of beating the retreat on the dockside. </P>
<P> The state visit, the first by the queen since she accompanied her parents King George VI and Queen Elizabeth and sister Princess Margaret to pre-apartheid southern Africa in 1947, winds up Saturday night when she will fly home. </P>
<P> Before leaving, she was due to attend the horse races and present cups at the Durban Turf Club -- weather permitting. </P>
