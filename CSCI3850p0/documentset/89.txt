<DATELINE>PAMPLONA, Spain (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Spain's wildest fiesta, San Fermin, exploded into being at noon Wednesday with the traditional firing of a rocket over the heads of thousands of cheering people crammed into Pamplona's tiny central plaza. </P>
<P> Thrill-seeking tourists come to this northern town each year to risk injury and even death by running along the narrow streets in front of six rampaging bulls. The first bull run or ``encierro'' takes place Thursday morning and the event is repeated over the next seven days. </P>
<P> Participants, dressed in white shirts and trousers with red scarves tied around their necks, scramble in front of the bulls as they run through the streets to the bullring. </P>
<P> ``There haven't been that many deaths. This century only 12 have been killed despite the fact a bull is a very dangerous animal which can kill simply by moving its head,'' Santiago Gomez, town hall press officer, said. </P>
