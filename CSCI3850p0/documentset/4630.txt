<P> The existence of the missiles -- aging ``Hawk'' anti-aircraft weapons sold to Iran by the United States itself in bygone years -- was disclosed earlier Tuesday by General John Shalikashvili, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, in a talk with reporters. </P>
<P> Shalikashvili said the missiles had been placed on unidentified islands in the Strait of Hormuz at the opening of the 550-mile waterway, one of the world's most strategic oil-shipping routes. The general said fact that Iran had actually placed the missiles on launchers in forward artillery positions had raised concerns in the United States and elsewhere about Iran's motives. </P>
<P> Clinton said: ``I can tell you that basically what General Shalikashvili said is accurate and it's a situation we're monitoring very closely. The missiles are rather old, as you know. They've been there for some time in the possession of the Iranians.'' </P>
