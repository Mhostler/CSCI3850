<P>  British child killer Myra Hindley, who was told last week that she will die behind bars, Sunday said she deserved another chance -- even if most people thought she should have been hanged 30 years ago. </P>
<P> ``I think it would have solved a lot of problems for everybody if I'd hung for what I did,'' she told the Sunday Times in a prison interview. </P>
<P> ``But I did not and now I cling to life and I believe I deserve another chance at it,'' said the 52-year-old woman dubbed by tabloids ``The Most Evil Woman in Britain.'' </P>
<P> Hindley was convicted over the killing of five children 28 years ago. She watched her sadistic lover Ian Brady assault, torture and murder the children, who were buried in unmarked graves on Britain's bleak northern moors. </P>
<P> They taped their victims being tortured in a case that still stirs strong passions 30 years later. </P>
<P> Hindley, admitting the hold Brady had on her, said: ``Thank God the police got us when they did or it would have gone on and on -- at least until Brady killed me, which I'm sure he would have done.'' </P>
<P> She has admitted to procuring the children for Brady and helping to gag one -- 10-year-old Lesley Ann Downey -- but insists that otherwise she did not touch any of them. She was, however, convicted of murder. </P>
<P> Interviewed just hours before before she was told by the government that she will spend the rest of her life in prison, Hindley said: ``You have to hope to go on and after the decision it is very hard to find a way to keep going. </P>
<P> ``I don't know but I have to find that ray of hope, that way forward or else it is impossible.'' </P>
<P> Hindley said she had written to the mothers of the children she helped kill, adding ``How many times can I say sorry and mean it.'' </P>
<P> ``It's because I am a woman and it makes me the double devil. A woman is supposed to be the protector of children,'' she said. </P>
