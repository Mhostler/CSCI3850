<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A U.S. government human rights report Wednesday targeted friend and foe alike in the Middle East, accusing a range of Arab countries of systematic abuses and criticizing Israel. </P>
<P> The State Department's annual review of human rights around the globe slammed long-standing enemies like Iraq and Iran but found that allies such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia used violence and torture against political opponents. </P>
<P> In a first report on the new Palestinian Authority, it accused Palestinians of the same abuses they once accused Israel of since they took control of some functions in Gaza and Jericho last May. </P>
<P> The report's harshest language was reserved for Iraq, where it said the government's ``abysmal record on human rights did not improve in 1994, and worsened in several areas. </P>
<P> ``Systematic violations continued in all categories, including mass executions of political opponents, widespread use of torture, extreme repression of ethnic groups, disappearances, denial of due process, and arbitrary detention,'' it said. </P>
<P> The report found the situation little better in Iran, whose government, it said, continued to be a ``major abuser'' of human rights with no evidence of improvement last year. </P>
<P> ``Systematic abuses include arbitrary arrests and detentions, widespread use of torture, lack of fair trials, summary executions, and repressions of the freedoms of speech, press and association,'' the department said. </P>
<P> The report found continuing widespread rights violations in Egypt -- recipient of billions of dollars of U.S. aid -- as the Cairo government struggled against Muslim guerrilla groups. </P>
<P> ``The security services and terrorist groups remained locked in a cycle of violence,'' it said. ``Security forces committed human rights abuses in their campaign against terrorist groups, but frequently victimized noncombatants as well.'' </P>
<P> In Saudi Arabia, the report found torture of prisoners, incommunicado detention, curbs on freedom of speech, press and religion, systematic discrimination against women and suppression of rights of workers and religious minorities. </P>
<P> It picked out for criticism the Mutawwain, a volunteer religious police which, it said, ``continued to confront and abuse citizens and foreigners of both sexes.'' Riyadh reacted angrily to U.S. criticism of its rights record last year. </P>
<P> Reporting on the Palestinian Authority, the department said the six-month-old Palestinian police force mistreated detainees, reportedly committed at least one extrajudicial killing and also ``has used excessive force on occasion.'' </P>
<P> But it noted that the Palestinian Authority only assumed authority for Gaza and Jericho in May, making it difficult to assess its human rights record fully. </P>
<P> The report concluded that despite such problems there were ''clear improvements in the human rights situation in the occupied territories in 1994,'' including no deportations by Israel of Palestinians for the second straight year. </P>
<P> But it also said ``there were credible reports that during 1994 Israel mistreated, and in some cases tortured, Palestinians during arrest and interrogation.'' </P>
<P> The department accused Syria of ``serious abuses'' including torture, arbitrary arrest, prolonged detention, unfair trials and denial of freedoms of speech, press and association. </P>
<P> But it found some positive developments including the issuance of travel permits to all Jews requesting them, greater responsiveness to inquiries about political prisoners, and imprisonment of some policemen who abused prisoners. </P>
<P> In Algeria, where up to 30,000 people have died in a conflict between the government and Muslim guerrillas, the report said respect for human rights and the rule of law continued to deteriorate and ``abuses by all sides multiplied.'' </P>
<P> Death sentences were handed down in unfair trials and there was convincing evidence that the security forces carried out hundreds of extrajudicial killings, it said. </P>
