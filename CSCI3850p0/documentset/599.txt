<P>  The Canadian and Slovak defense ministers signed a memorandum of understanding Thursday to broaden military cooperation between the two countries. </P>
<P> David Collenette, Canada's defense minister, said at a press conference that the memorandum would lay the groundwork for a more comprehensive military cooperation agreement expected to be signed ``very soon.'' </P>
<P> ``This is only the beginning,'' Collenette said. </P>
<P> The memorandum includes provisions for joint training sessions and a technical assistance program, he added. </P>
<P> Slovakia, which split from former federation partner the Czech Republic in January 1993, is a member of the U.S-sponsored Partnership for Peace program designed to form closer links between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization members and former Soviet bloc countries. </P>
<P> ``We are eager to sign more agreements like this with other countries,'' Slovak Minister of Defense Pavol Kanis said after the memorandum was signed. </P>
