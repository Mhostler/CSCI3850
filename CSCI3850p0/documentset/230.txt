<P>  The 25th anniversary Woodstock concert, expected to attract 250,000 fans to an upstate New York town, has been expanded to include a third day, a spokeswoman for the organizers said. </P>
<P> The spokeswoman for Woodstock '94 said that in addition to the planned appearances Saturday and Sunday, some bands, yet to be determined, would be playing on the 930-acre site Friday night. </P>
<P> The concert, in Saugerties, 100 miles north of New York City, will cover a wide range of musical tastes ranging from Johnny Cash to the heavy metal group Metallica. </P>
<P> But the event has drawn heavy criticism over its high-powered financing and commercialization that will be a far cry from the easy-going atmosphere at the original, which took place in Bethel, New York, 50 miles away. </P>
<P> The producers say that the alcohol-free event with a host of corporate sponsors and ticket prices of $135 a person is the only way to conduct the affair given the realities of contemporary laws and the need for thorough planning. </P>
