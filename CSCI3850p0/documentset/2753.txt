<P>  Charles Upham, a sheep farmer who won two of Britain's highest military decorations during World War II, died Tuesday, the New Zealand Press Association reported. He was 86. </P>
<P> Upham, a New Zealand native, was a reluctant hero who always insisted that the medals belonged to the men he fought alongside. </P>
<P> He won the Victoria Cross in 1941 for his bravery during the unsuccessful Allied defense of Crete against German troops. After being promoted to captain, he won the Bar to the Victoria Cross for his bravery during the North African campaign, fighting on Ruweisat Ridge in the western desert. </P>
<P> According to Who's Who, Upham was the only fighting soldier ever to win both the Victoria Cross and Bar. </P>
<P> At Maleme in Crete, then 32-year-old Upham was responsible for the destruction of four enemy machine-gun nests and brought out a wounded man under heavy fire. He then went deep into enemy territory to lead out an isolated company. </P>
<P> Upham was wounded three times in the next two days but remained in action, leading successful attacks on German positions. </P>
<P> Later severely wounded again and taken prisoner, Upham spent three years as a prisoner-of-war in Germany and Italy, but after escaping more than once was finally sent to the infamous Colditz castle prison. </P>
<P> Many years later, when a local New Zealand military museum asked for a memento, Upham handed over a German paperweight pinched from the Colditz Commandant's desk. </P>
<P> Upham, who held a degree in agriculture and worked at sheep farming before the war, returned to make his living on a farm at Parnassus on South Island. </P>
