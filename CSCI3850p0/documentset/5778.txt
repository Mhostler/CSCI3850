<P>  Iran's National Petrochemical Company (NPC) has threatened to end contracts with three U.S. firms to supply $240 million worth of petrochemicals, NPC managing director was quoted on Sunday as saying. </P>
<P> ``We have verbally informed these companies that they would be excluded from NPC's selling roster and over the last four months it has refused to supply petrochemical products to these companies which is a great loss to them,'' Ahmad Rahgozar told the English language daily Iran News. </P>
<P> He said NPC had a contract to deliver $300 million worth of petrochemical products to these three companies, adding that so far it has delivered $60 million worth of goods. </P>
<P> ``Of course, we strictly abide by our commitments, but the reason for this exclusion is to respond to the mischievous attitude of the United States and to let them know that their subversive measures will encounter retaliation in a similar manner,'' Rahgozar said. </P>
<P> Rahgozar did not say who the three U.S. companies were. </P>
<P> Iran is the second largest petrochemical producer in the Middle East, only behind Saudi Arabia. Current Iranian petrochemical output is around eight million tonnes a year but 15 million tonnes is planned by 1999. </P>
<P> The White House is considering options aimed at extending trade restrictions between U.S. companies and Iran. Last month it issued an order barring U.S. firms from working to develop Iran's oil and gas industry. </P>
