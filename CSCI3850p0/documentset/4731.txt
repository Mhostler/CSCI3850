<P>  Four Muslim fundamentalists shot dead a local leader of Algeria's main trade union and ran over and killed a schoolboy as they fled by car, security force officers said Sunday. </P>
<P> The officers said the gunmen ambushed Saadane Salah, 51, outside his home in Baraki, just south of the capital Algiers, Saturday. He was the UGTA general workers' union leader in El Harrach suburb of the capital Algiers. </P>
<P> In their haste to escape pursuing security forces, the killers ran over a 16-year-old boy, the officers said in a statement carried on Algeria's official news agency APS. </P>
<P> Security forces killed one of the fundamentalists; the others escaped after abandoning their getaway vehicle. </P>
<P> The dead man was armed with a Belgian-made automatic, the authorities said. Last week, Belgium police raided a Muslim fundamentalist support network in their country, seizing arms and forged documents, and arresting several Algerians. </P>
<P> The Algerian newspaper Le Matin said Sunday that an army officer was killed last Thursday in the east Algerian town of Annaba by Muslim militants, and a police station attacked in another area of the town. </P>
<P> It gave no other details on either incident, but security forces Saturday reported killing two Islamists in Annaba, among 28 fundamentalists shot dead between Tuesday and Friday, in various areas. </P>
<P> Algeria only rarely reports casualties among members of the security forces. </P>
