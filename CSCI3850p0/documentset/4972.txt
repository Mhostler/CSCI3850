<DATELINE>MONTICELLO, Fla.(Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Four days before it was to begin, the re-trial of the last youth charged in the 1993 slaying of a British tourist at a Florida rest stop was moved Thursday from the rural county where the murder occurred. </P>
<P> The trial of John ``Billy Joe'' Crumitie was moved from Monticello to Gainesville, a university town 2 3/8 hours southeast of the spot where the 18-year-old is accused of killing British tourist Gary Colley in September 1993. </P>
<P> The change in the trial's location was requested by both defense counsel and prosecutors, who said the first trial's notoriety would make it impossible to find an unbiased jury. </P>
<P> The trial is scheduled to begin Monday at 9 a.m. EST . If convicted, Crumitie could face the death penalty. </P>
<P> Crumitie is the last to face trial in the murder of 34-year-old Colley, who was shot and killed during a botched robbery attempt at an isolated highway rest stop 30 miles east of Tallahassee, the state capital. </P>
<P> Margaret Jagger, Colley's longtime companion, also was wounded in the attack -- one of a series of attacks on tourists in the state two years ago. </P>
<P> Crumitie has already been tried once. The first case was dismissed in November after the jury could not reach a verdict. Dwight Wells, Crumitie's attorney, said news of the mistrial and the jury's 11-1 deadlock vote will further prejudice a potential jury in a rural county where few people are strangers. </P>
<P> ``It would be difficult for people in this community not to have known, number one, that there was a first trial and, number two, what the jury vote was,'' Wells said. ``That would further prejudice Mr. Crumitie.'' </P>
<P> In February, Aundra Akins, 16, pleaded guilty to second degree murder and agreed to testify against Crumitie in the upcoming trial. Akins was the triggerman. </P>
<P> Two other youths, Deron Spear, 18 and his half-brother, Cedrick Green, 14, have also pleaded guilty to lesser charges. Spear, the driver of the car, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit armed robbery and accessory after the fact. </P>
<P> Judge F. E. Steinmeyer also told Wells Thursday that it would be the last day on which he would allow Crumitie to reach a plea agreement. So far, Crumitie has resisted such an agreement, Wells said after the hearing. </P>
