<DATELINE>JAKARTA, April 26 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Indonesia, still fearful of communist influence three decades after it was outlawed, has seized Nintendo video-game cassettes it says contain the hammer and sickle symbol, the Jakarta Post said on Wednesday. </P>
<P> It quoted police in the central Java city of Semarang as saying the US$25 cassettes had been seized at several outlets. </P>
<P> Police were quoted as saying the communist symbol was hard to find as it appeared only in the 20th frame of the 1,200-frame video game. The daily did not name the game. </P>
<P> Since the mid-1960s Indonesia has banned or confiscated books, records, films and other products it says contain communist teachings or symbols. Officials periodically warn of the lingering threat of communist subversion. </P>
