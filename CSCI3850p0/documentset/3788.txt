<P>  The controllers of a joint German-Japanese unmanned space capsule launched early Monday have lost track of it, Australian officials said. </P>
<P> ``It became lost after three orbits and the operations center in Germany is now looking for it,'' Australian Space Office deputy director John Boyd told Reuters. </P>
<P> The 1,650-pound EXPRESS (Experimental Re-entry Space System) was launched by a Japanese rocket from the Kagoshima space center on the island of Kyushu early Monday Australian time. </P>
<P> It was due to be guided to a parachute landing at the Woomera rocket range in South Australia on Saturday after five days of experiments involving microgravity and the high temperatures and pressures experienced during re-entry. </P>
<P> Boyd said it was still unclear whether the capsule could be recovered and redirected to the Woomera range because it had to be found first. </P>
<P> Woomera, a desert area about the size of Britain, was used in the development of British ballistic missiles in the 1950s and 1960s. </P>
<P> Nevil Byrne, director of the Australian Space Office's Launch Services section, said the office was awaiting further information from the German Space Operations Center just outside Munich. </P>
