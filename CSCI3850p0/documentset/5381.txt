<P>  Second seed Conchita Martinez of Spain won an embarrassingly easy semifinal Saturday to earn the right to defend her Family Circle Magazine Cup title against fifth seed Magdalena Maleeva of Bulgaria. </P>
<P> In the other semifinal, the 10th-ranked Maleeva, celebrating her 20th birthday, took a 6-4, 7-6 (7-5) win over 51st-ranked Silvia Farina of Italy in their first career meeting. </P>
<P> Martinez was boss during the entire match, which lasted exactly one hour. The Spaniard used effective topspin shots while Zvereva continually went for broke, gambling and losing. </P>
<P> ``I think against me she has to do that,'' Martinez said. ''She doesn't have patience. The thing is, I didn't get nervous. I just kept playing my game.'' </P>
<P> Zvereva is a player who always takes risks, which means there are times her shots are breathtaking and times she looks like a weekend hacker. </P>
<P> On Saturday, she looked like the latter, making error after error. Her efforts to come to the net and hit winners failed as did her attempts to grease the lines with every shot. </P>
<P> ``For me to play safer, I would have to have a lot more patience,'' Zvereva said. ``She wears an opponent down and goes for the kill. If I tried to play safer, I think I would just die out there.'' </P>
<P> Maleeva started strongly in both sets of her one hour, 45 minute match with Farina, hitting very deep, utilizing her versatile backhand and approaching the net whenever possible. </P>
<P> The Bulgarian took a 4-1 lead in the first set. She won the first three games of the second set and also held a 4-1 lead in that set. </P>
<P> Although Farina found her confidence at the latter part of both sets, Maleeva had the edge. </P>
<P> ``I guess it was pretty obvious I was kind of nervous,'' Maleeva said. ``I knew I had to be aggressive and make her run. I made some mistakes on some important points, but in the end I did what I had to do.'' </P>
<P> When Farina started to attack Maleeva's more vulnerable forehand and to drop-shot Maleeva at key moments, she became more of a factor in the match. </P>
<P> At 4-2 in Maleeva's favor, Farina forced her opponent into three forehand errors and then won that seventh game at 0-40 with a winning forehand drop shot. </P>
<P> Maleeva played a tentative game when serving for the match at 5-3, which opened the door for Farina to head for a tiebreaker. </P>
<P> It looked like the match would go into a third set when Maleeva made four mistakes to lose the first four points of the tiebreaker. </P>
<P> But Farina got nervous at 5-1 in the breaker and played her shots too short, which gave Maleeva opportunities to approach and win the final six points. </P>
