<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Israeli planes rocketed a Palestinian guerrilla base near the Lebanese capital Sunday, forcing Beirut's international airport to close because of the danger to air traffic. </P>
<P> Airport authorities said they shut the airport and diverted incoming flights after Israeli planes attacked targets in the hills only three miles south of Beirut. </P>
<P> The airport was closed for about one hour. Airport authorities said three incoming international flights were diverted to Larnaca Airport in Cyprus, they said. </P>
<P> It was the first time Beirut airport has had to close since the end of Lebanon's 1975-90 civil war. It was often closed by shelling during the war. </P>
<P> Israeli jets could be seen flying over the airport and turning above it after diving low to fire rockets into the hills where the Palestinian base is situated, Hizbollah (Party of God) radio said. </P>
<P> Palestinian sources said four civilians were hurt in the raid, aimed at a base of the radical Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command in the hills above Na'ameh, about 10 miles south of Beirut. </P>
<P> The four people were injured when their car crashed as they and other people enjoying Sunday afternoon outings in the hills tried to flee from the raid, the source said. </P>
<P> Witnesses said four planes carried out the attack -- Israel's third on targets in Lebanon this year. </P>
<P> Two circled high above while the other two dived two or three times each to fire rockets. </P>
<P> A helicopter later swooped in from the coast to fire more rockets and Hizbollah radio said the planes came back to fire more rockets less than an hour later. </P>
