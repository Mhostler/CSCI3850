<P> Earlier in the day, Dominican electoral authorities proclaimed Balaguer, the incumbent seeking his seventh non-consecutive term, the winner by a narrow 22,000-vote margin over his nearest rival. </P>
<P> It said the incumbent received 42.4 percent of votes cast, compared with 41.4 percent for his closest competitor in the May 16 contest. </P>
<P> Balaguer, 87, has been the dominant figure in Dominican politics since the 1960s. He is blind, has difficulty hearing and can not walk without assistance but has maintained a firm hold on power. </P>
<P> Though preliminary results issued by the junta shortly after the voting gave Balaguer, the victory by a slim margin, no final result had been declared to date because of widespread allegations of scandal. </P>
