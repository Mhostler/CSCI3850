<P>  Snoop Doggy Dogg landed in another legal doghouse Wednesday when sheriff's deputies smelled marijuana while serving the gangster rapper with civil suit papers, authorities said. </P>
<P> The rapper, otherwise known as Calvin Broadus, and three of his band members were arrested for possession of small amounts of marijuana and drug paraphernalia, Calcasieu Parish Sheriff's Office Chief of Detectives John Fryar told Reuters. </P>
<P> Broadus, 23; Ricardo Brown, 22; Delmar Arnaude, 21, and Darryl Daniel, 26, were released from the parish jail after posting $2,000 bond each, Fryar said. </P>
<P> Deputies serving Broadus with two sets of civil papers smelled marijuana the second time they went to the rapper's room at Players Casino Motel, he said. A narcotics dog called to the scene indicated drugs were inside and the four were arrested. </P>
<P> Snoop Doggy Dogg, who is out on bond in connection with a Los Angeles homicide, had planned to go on with a scheduled performance in Lake Charles, but only 36 tickets had been sold by noon so the event was canceled, Fryar said. </P>
