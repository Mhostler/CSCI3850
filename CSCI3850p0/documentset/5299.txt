<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The lawyer for a former mistress of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros denied a published report Wednesday that he is about to propose a settlement of his client's lawsuit against Cisneros. </P>
<P> ``I am ready to settle. It's a true statement, but it's not news. We offered to settle for $200,000 ... at least a couple of months ago. We haven't made any other offer since our original offer,'' said Floyd Holder, attorney for Linda Medlar of Lubbock, Texas. </P>
<P> Holder was responding to a story in the San Antonio Express-News that he was ``on the verge of surrender'' and ready to settle Medlar's claims against Cisneros ``for a fraction of the $264,000 she is seeking in a breach of contract lawsuit.'' </P>
<P> Medlar's lawsuit alleges that Cisneros paid her $215,000 between 1990 and July 1993 after the end of their extramarital affair and that he agreed by verbal contract to pay her $4,000 a month until her daughter by a former marriage graduated from college in 1999. </P>
<P> Cisneros, publicly and in legal documents, has denied any such agreement was made. Both were married at the time of the affair, when Medlar was the former San Antonio mayor's campaign fund-raiser. </P>
<P> Seagal Wheatley, a San Antonio lawyer for Cisneros, told Reuters that no formal settlement offer had been made. He added that the issue only came up informally in the past in ``what I'd characterize as talk generated by their side and unresponded to by us.'' </P>
<P> Wheatley said he will ask for a dismissal of the case against Cisneros at a Lubbock hearing on April 14. </P>
<P> Asked about the possibility of a settlement, he said: ''Frankly, that's not very appealing to me at this late stage.'' </P>
<P> No trial date has been set. </P>
<P> In Washington, an independent investigator is looking into allegations that Cisneros misled the FBI before his nomination to the HUD post about payments he made to Medlar. </P>
<P> The probe stems from Medlar's release of tape recordings of telephone conversations she had with Cisneros. Cisneros has denied he misled the FBI. </P>
