<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Clinton administration is considering a new policy which could ease restrictions on U.S. foreign arms sales by weighing the financial health of the nation's defense industry, defense officials said Tuesday. </P>
<P> Such a step could be a major boon to the struggling U.S. arms industry, which has been hit hard by Pentagon budget cuts and declining overseas military sales. </P>
<P> The defense officials, who asked not to be identified, said President Clinton has not given final approval to the plan. And they stressed that U.S. national security interests would remain the chief factor in deciding whether to sell arms to other countries. </P>
<P> ``This (the proposal) would make the nation's industrial base and defense industry one of the factors considered in arms sales. But only one of the factors,'' said one of the officials. </P>
<P> The Los Angeles Times reported Tuesday that the U.S. defense industry had won a major victory and that the administration was preparing to adopt the new policy. </P>
<P> The newspaper said the policy would now give weight to the U.S. industrial base and the national economy in considering overseas arms sales. </P>
<P> The defense officials declined to speculate on whether the new policy, which was sent to the White House by the State Department following a government study, would open the way for sales to countries such as Pakistan which have been prohibited from buying U.S. arms for foreign policy reasons. </P>
<P> The policy would be controversial because the United States has in recent years pressed other major arms suppliers to cut down their sales to such volatile areas as the Middle East. </P>
<P> But it could also benefit U.S. aerospace giants such as Lockheed Corp. and McDonnell Douglas Corp., makers of military jets, who are looking more and more to foreign sales as the United States slashes military spending. </P>
<P> It could, for example, open way to lucrative sales of Lockheed F-16s to Pakistan despite its nuclear policy and perhaps other countries now prohibited from buying U.S. arms. </P>
<P> The Pentagon reported last week that U.S. foreign military sales, which are made on a country-by-country basis and only without objection from Congress, dropped drastically to $12.9 billion in fiscal 1993 from $33.2 billion in fiscal 1993. </P>
<P> That Defense Security Assistance Agency announcement said the steep one-year drop was mainly because foreign military sales were so high to Mideast countries in 1993 in the wake of the 1991 Gulf War. </P>
<P> But the agency also predicted that U.S. arms sales overseas would drop to an average of between $9 billion and $10.5 billion through fiscal 1997. It gave no reasons, but some U.S. arms customers such as Saudi Arabia are either suffering short-term economic woes or slashing their defense budgets following the Cold War. </P>
