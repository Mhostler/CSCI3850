<P>  Tour agents from outside the United States are being asked to pay exorbitant hotel room rates for the 1996 Summer Olympic Games, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Friday. </P>
<P> The newspaper said one local real estate company was asking $350 a night for a room that normally costs $79. An economy motel near the Atlanta airport, ordinarily $49 a night, was offering rooms for $212. </P>
<P> The Georgia legislature last year outlawed price gouging during the games and hotel owners and tour operators are now allowed to charge a maximum of 5.7 percent more than their published 1994 room rates. But the newspaper quoted visiting tour agents from the Olympic committees of the Bahamas, Britain, Estonia, Argentina and other countries as saying rates being quoted have already exceeded that margin. </P>
<P> If found to be in violation of the law, hotels can be fined up to $1,000 per room, per night for the duration of the games. Officials with the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games, the local organizing group, welcomed the report, saying the issue needed to be looked into. </P>
