<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak opened talks with U.S. officials Monday on a Washington visit expected to be dominated by disagreements over the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). </P>
<P> Mubarak met Secretary of State Warren Christopher and had meetings scheduled with Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, Deputy Defense Secretary John Deutch, Commerce Secretary Ron Brown and members of Congress. He is to see President Clinton Wednesday. </P>
<P> State Department spokeswoman Christine Shelly said Mubarak and Christopher had a ``good discussion'' on the Middle East peace process, economic issues and the NPT. </P>
<P> Egypt has been in good standing with the United States ever since it became the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel, in 1979. But the NPT dispute has clouded relations in recent months. </P>
<P> Washington wants the 25-year-old treaty extended indefinitely at an international conference opening in New York April 17. But Egypt says it cannot agree unless Israel, which has long been ambiguous about whether it has nuclear weapons, signs the NPT. </P>
<P> Worse, from the U.S. point of view, Egypt has tried to persuade other Arab states to follow its line. With a simple majority of the 174 signatory states needed for indefinite extension, Egypt's position in itself makes little difference, but the defection of all 22 Arab League members could dent U.S. hopes of a sizable majority. </P>
<P> The United States gives Cairo $1.3 billion annually in military aid, but as Egypt now holds $17 billion in foreign reserves the leverage this provides is less than it was. </P>
<P> Shelly said that ``the administration will continue to very strongly press the case for aid for Egypt with the Congress.'' But Mubarak has said he does not see the aid lasting forever. </P>
<P> Vice President Al Gore, on a visit to Cairo last month, seemed to be trying to wean Egypt off the heavy aid diet by offering a vague ``partnership for growth'' aimed at boosting the private sector and creating jobs. </P>
<P> The United States pays lip-service to Egypt's role in continuing Middle East peace efforts. But here too, Cairo has proved less accommodating recently, supporting Syria's refusal to accept Israeli proposals for a Golan Heights agreement. </P>
