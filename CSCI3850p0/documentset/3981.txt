<P>  The judge in the O.J. Simpson trial delayed the resumption of opening statements until at least Thursday afternoon after prosecutors asked for time to review a list of surprise witnesses and a member of their team was rushed to the hospital. </P>
<P> After an angry courtroom clash, Judge Lance Ito gave prosecutors until 1:30 p.m. PST (4:30 p.m EST) to review a stack of statements from defense witnesses that were only given to them Wednesday. </P>
<P> Ito is then expected to decide whether to go ahead with the defense opening statement or to delay the proceedings. </P>
<P> Complicating the timetable for the sensational double-murder trial, veteran prosecutor William Hodgman remained in a hospital Thursday after being rushed there over night suffering from chest pains. He was listed in good condition. </P>
<P> District Attorney Gil Garcetti said earlier that prosecutors would probably ask Ito to delay the trial, in part because of Hodgman's illness. </P>
<P> It was Hodgman who angrily jumped to his feet several times Wednesday to object during the first part of the defense opening statement in which attorney Johnnie Cochran accused investigators of ignoring key witness and missing evidence that would have proved Simpson innocent. </P>
<P> Hodgman had expressed outrage when Cochran told the jury about new witnesses that the prosecution had never been told about. </P>
<P> Accusing the defense of misconduct, Deputy District Attorney Marcia Clark said Thursday that the prosecution would ask that some of the new defense witnesses be barred from testifying and would also seek to reopen the prosecution's opening statement, which was delivered Wednesday. </P>
<P> Cochran made an impassioned plea to the judge to allow him to finish his opening statement ``as soon as possible.'' </P>
<P> He angrily denied the prosecution's claims and accused them of ``stall tactics.'' ``They have the unmitigated gall to come in here and complain that somehow they've been victimized,'' he said. </P>
<P> Simpson is charged in the murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman, who were stabbed to death June 12 outside her luxury Brentwood townhouse. </P>
