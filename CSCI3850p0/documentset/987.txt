<P>  Argentina's Supreme Court Thursday dropped accusations against Iranian officials who were named in an anti-Jewish bombing here last month that killed nearly 100 people. </P>
<P> The court decided there was insufficient evidence against the officials and voted to pass the case back to investigating judge Juan Jose Galeano, members of the court told reporters afterwards. </P>
<P> In his report on the bombing, Galeano named four Iranian officials as wanted in connection with the July 18 bombing that razed Argentina's main Jewish community center. </P>
<P> Under Argentine law, the Supreme Court would take on the case if foreign diplomats or officials were involved. </P>
<P> Iran's official news agency, IRNA, said late Wednesday that Iran wanted Argentina to make up for the accusations, but did not specify how. </P>
