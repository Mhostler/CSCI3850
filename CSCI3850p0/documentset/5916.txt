<DATELINE>SEOUL, April 21 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  South Korea said on Friday it had agreed to take $450 million worth of arms, raw materials and civilian helicopters from Russia by 1998 as repayment of Moscow's debts to Seoul. </P>
<P> The two countries would formally sign the agreement early next month in Seoul, a spokesman of Seoul's Finance and Economy Ministry said. </P>
<P> He said $171.5 million in raw materials and defence equipment would be shipped this year. </P>
<P> South Korea promised a $3 billion loan in aid to the former Soviet Union just before the two countries established diplomatic relations in September, 1990. </P>
<P> Only $1.47 billion was handed over before the programme was suspended after the collapse of the Soviet Union. </P>
<P> Russia assumed responsibility for the loan but at the end of 1993 had fallen behind its repayments to the tune of $391.8 million in accrued interest and principal, the ministry said. </P>
<P> The sum outstanding would grow to $450.7 million with interest between 1994 and 1998, when repayment is due to be completed, the ministry spokesman said. </P>
<P> The Defence Ministry said Russian arms to be brought in would include T-80U tanks and MBP-3 military vehicles and small arms. </P>
<P> The ministry said the Russian arms would not be deployed militarily but used to work out strategies against North Korea, which uses weaponry mostly supplied by the former Soviet Union or based Soviet designs. </P>
