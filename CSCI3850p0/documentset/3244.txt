<P>  Cuba will need to take more steps next year to stimulate badly depressed production, an official said Thursday. </P>
<P> Osvaldo Martinez, president of parliament's economic affairs commission, was quoted by the Prensa Latina news agency as saying the country had achieved modest but important advances over the past year in reviving the economy. </P>
<P> But there was need to take new steps to boost production, Martinez said, without giving details. </P>
<P> The year 1994 was a year of accelerated change for Cuba, mired in economic crisis since the collapse of communism in the former Soviet Union and the old East Bloc. </P>
<P> Reforms included efforts to reduce a bulging budget deficit and squeeze excess money in circulation, and the partial liberalization of trade in farm produce and consumer goods. </P>
<P> Prensa Latina quoted Finance Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez as saying the country would end 1994 with a budget deficit of 3.2 billion pesos, down from 5.05 billion pesos at the end of last year. </P>
<P> The peso is officially worth $1, although it currently changes hands for around 50 times less than that on the black market. </P>
<P> Rodriguez also said industrial production would have risen 4.7 percent in 1994, although he cautioned that this did not constitute a recovery given the extremely poor results of 1993. He did not give figures for industrial production other than the percentage rise. </P>
