<DATELINE>KARACHI, Pakistan (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Gunmen Thursday killed eight people including a policeman and his son in Pakistan's southern city of Karachi, where 104 people have died in ethnic and sectarian violence this month, police and hospital sources said. </P>
<P> Witnesses said a police sub-inspector and his son were shot dead in District Central on their way home from a shopping trip. </P>
<P> Two bodies with bullet wounds, one of them a woman, were brought to a hospital from the same district, police said. </P>
<P> Hospital sources said two more people had been shot dead in District Central and two in District South, but had no details. </P>
<P> The deaths followed Wednesday night's drive-by shooting near the headquarters of the ethnic Mohajir National Movement (MQM) in which three MQM activists were killed and three wounded. </P>
<P> Witnesses said the activists had been sitting in a park a few yards from the MQM's headquarters and residence of its leader Altaf Hussain, who lives in self-exile in London. </P>
<P> Two cars pulled up and four gunmen stepped out spraying bullets at the MQM workers. They drove off, but attackers in a third car drove up and fired at the wounded men. </P>
<P> The MQM is fighting to redress the grievances of Karachi's majority Mohajir community, made up of Muslims who fled from India at partition in 1947 and their descendants. </P>
