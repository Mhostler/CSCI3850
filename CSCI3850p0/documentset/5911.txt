<P>  Princess Diana's brother Charles Spencer is to separate from his wife Victoria who is in a clinic battling the eating disorder bulimia, the tabloid Sun newspaper reported on Friday. </P>
<P> ``Lord and Lady Spencer will live separately for the foreseeable future. They have no current plans for divorce,'' a spokesman for the 30-year-old earl told the paper. </P>
<P> It said Spencer would provide a house on his Althorp estate for his wife and they had agreed to give each other open access to their three young daughters and baby son. </P>
<P> Spencer said earlier this month that his 29-year-old wife, a former model, was receiving treatment at an exclusive clinic. </P>
<P> ``My wife would be happy for me to tell you that she has had a problem with addictions and eating disorders for 10 years now, and this has been the first chance I have had to persuade her to have proper treatment,'' he said. </P>
<P> He said Lady Spencer had ``serious psychological problems.'' </P>
<P> ``My main concern is to keep her there because that is where she is going to get the best treatment that she can.'' </P>
<P> Spencer complained to Britain's media watchdog, the Press Complaints Commission, saying intrusive tabloids had ``ripped the heart out of the story'' and set back his wife's treatment. </P>
<P> The news broke as Princess Diana, estranged wife of heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles, flew to Hong Kong for a three-day visit. </P>
