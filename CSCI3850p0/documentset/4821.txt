<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The grandfather of teen-age skinhead brothers accused of killing their parents and a brother in Pennsylvania told a television talk show that society shared the blame for their crimes. </P>
<P> Nelson Birdwell, grandfather of Bryan and David Freeman, also said on the Montel Williams Show to be broadcast Friday that he hoped the boys would be rehabilitated and returned to society. </P>
<P> ``Young people have a lot of problems that society can't deal with,'' Birdwell said. ``A lot of them need help that we're ignoring. They're making a call that we can't answer.'' </P>
<P> Bryan Freeman, 17, and his brother David, 16, are charged with three counts each of homicide and conspiracy to commit homicide. They are accused of bludgeoning and stabbing their parents, Brenda, 48, and Dennis, 54, and their 11-year-old brother Erik to death in their Salisbury Township, Pa., home last week. </P>
<P> Birdwell said his two grandsons had a difficult relationship with their mother, but he did not believe this was the cause of the murders. </P>
<P> ``I know those boys. I know their hearts and there is actually two people inside of each person. One of them was poisoned by this neo-Nazi organization, and the other was a lovable kid. I think that was a poison injected into them worse than any drug that you could give them.'' </P>
<P> The Freeman brothers fled Pennsylvania and were later arrested in Michigan, where they are being held in jail without bail. </P>
