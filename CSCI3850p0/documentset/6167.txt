<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla.(Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The proud Boston Celtics organization does not take kindly to playoff humiliation and they responed Sunday with a stunning victory over Orlando in the Magic Kingdom. </P>
<P> A fired up Dominique Wilkins scored 24 points and Dee Brown added 21 as the Celtics rebounded from a crushing 47-point defeat in Game One with a 99-92 win Orlando to even the best-of-five first-round Eastern Conference series. </P>
<P> ``We were embarrassed Friday night,'' Wilkins said of the 124-77 loss that was Boston's worst playoff defeat ever. ``We were determined to come back.'' </P>
<P> The victory was especially surprising in light of Orlando's near invincible record at home this season. The top-seeded Magic went 39-2 at home and had not lost to an Eastern Conference opponent in Orlando all season. </P>
<P> ``We knew they'd play with a lot of pride,'' said Orlando's All-Star center Shaquille O'Neal, who had 22 points. ``They made all the shots they needed and played great defense and we didn't respond to it.'' </P>
<P> Orlando made only four of 23 field goal attempts in the fourth quarter despite grabbing 10 offensive rebounds. </P>
<P> Anfernee Hardaway led Orlando with 26 points and Sherman Douglas chipped in with 20 points and 15 assists for Boston. </P>
<P> The series now moves to Boston for the next two games. </P>
<P> In Charlotte, the Hornets dominated the Bulls in the second half to even their Eastern Conference first-round series at one game each with a 106-89 victory over Chicago. </P>
<P> Larry Johnson scored 25 points -- 16 after intermission -- and Alonzo Mourning had 23 points and 20 rebounds to lead the Hornets, who outscored the Bulls 54-35 in the second half. </P>
<P> ``There's no question when Larry's ready we are an awfully hard team to beat,'' said Hornets coach Allan Bristow. ``Zo (Mourning) was just dominating the boards in the second half.'' </P>
<P> Michael Jordan, who made his post-season return Friday with a remarkable 48-point performance in Chicago's Game One overtime win, led the Bulls with 32 points. </P>
<P> Jordan scored 19 points in the first half, hitting 8-of-12 shots, to help the Bulls take a 54-52 halftime advantage. But he was just 5-of-13 from the field in the second half. </P>
<P> Scottie Pippen added 18 for Chicago, but was held to just four points in the second half. </P>
<P> ``Our defensive pressure changed the momentum of the ballgame. That was a total team victory,'' said Mourning. ``We need to carry the intensity level into Chicago.'' </P>
<P> In Phoenix, the Suns continued their season-long domination of the Portland Trail Blazers to take a commanding 2-0 lead in their best-of-five Western Conference series. </P>
<P> Kevin Johnson scored 28 points and Charles Barkley had 25 points and 13 rebounds to lead the Suns to a 103-94 victory. </P>
<P> Phoenix has won all seven meetings with Portland this season. </P>
<P> ``It was a real disturbing trend of the home team losing the second game, so we obviously did not want that to happen to us,'' said Suns coach Paul Westphal, in reference to Orlando, New York and Utah losing home playoff games. </P>
<P> Rod Strickland led Portland with 26 points and Harvey Grant added 21. </P>
<P> Johnson scored 11 of his points in the third quarter when Phoenix outscored Portland 27-17 to take an 80-74 lead. </P>
<P> ``The crowd got us pumped after a slow start in the second half,'' said Barkley. ``We got energized and everybody chipped in. We played a great game in the second half for the second game in a row.'' </P>
<P> Two free throws by Strickland cut the Suns' advantage to 97-89 with 2:55 left, but Johnson scored the next six points with a basket and four free throws to open a 103-89 lead. </P>
<P> The Suns can wrap up the series in Portland on Tuesday. </P>
<P> In San Antonio, Dennis Rodman scored a season-high 19 points and grabbed 16 rebounds to lead the Spurs to a 122-96 rout of the Denver Nuggets and a two games to none lead in their best-of-five Western Conference playoff series. </P>
<P> The 19 points is Rodman's best in his two years with San Antonio. Rodman scored 15 of his points in the first half when the Spurs opened a 60-39 halftime lead. </P>
<P> David Robinson also scored 19 points and Sean Elliott added 18 for San Antonio. </P>
<P> Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf led the Nuggets with 21 points. </P>
<P> The Spur put the game away early as they opened the second quarter with a 14-5 run and closed it on a 20-9 spurt to build a commanding 60-39 halftime lead. </P>
<P> The closest Denver got the rest of the way was 15 points at 77-62. But San Antonio more than doubled that advantage late in the game when they led by 34 points, 115-81, with four minutes left. </P>
<P> The top-seeded Spurs, who closed out the regular season by winning 21 of their last 23 games, can advance to the second round with a victory in Denver Tuesday night. </P>
