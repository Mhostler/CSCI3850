<DATELINE>MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A Lebanese guerrilla was killed Tuesday when resistance fighters attacked three fortified posts in occupied south Lebanon manned by Israeli troops and their militia allies, security sources said. </P>
<P> In another attack, guerrillas fired rockets at an Israeli-manned crossing point into Israel's south Lebanon occupation zone but there were no reports of casualties. </P>
<P> Despite the flareup there was no sign of a major Israeli attack feared by Lebanon since Israeli and U.S. officials blamed the pro-Iranian Hizbollah (Party of God) for bombing Jewish and Israeli targets in Buenos Aires and London. </P>
<P> The sources said the guerrilla died attacking a post manned by Israeli troops and South Lebanon Army militiamen at Braachit, a village in Israel's occupation zone a few miles north of the Israeli border, the sources said. </P>
<P> They said the Israelis and SLA forces responded by pounding nearby areas with machinegun and artillery fire. </P>
<P> Lebanon's mainstream pro-Syrian Shi'ite Muslim group Amal (Hope) issued a statement claiming responsibility for attacks on SLA positions at Saidon and Kfar Falous villages. </P>
<P> There were no reports of casualties. </P>
<P> The Israelis and SLA responded by pounding the Iklim al-Toufah (Apple Hills) to the north with artillery fire, the sources said. </P>
<P> The hills are used by the radical pro-Iranian Shi'ite Hizbollah -- the most active resistance group in south Lebanon. </P>
