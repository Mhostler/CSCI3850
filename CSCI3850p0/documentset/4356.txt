<P>  Palestinian police detained a human rights lawyer who criticized PLO chairman Yasser Arafat for setting up a military court in the self-rule Gaza Strip, the lawyer's office said Wednesday. </P>
<P> Palestinian police arrested lawyer Raji al-Sourani at his home Tuesday night without giving any reasons, his family said. </P>
<P> But Sourani, 42, head of the Gaza Center for Rights and Law, wrote in a note to his office from prison that he was being held in connection with a document he published a few days ago criticizing Arafat's order to establish a state security court. </P>
<P> Arafat last week signed an order setting up a state security court to be headed by a military judge, following Israel's demands that he put on trial militants involved in military attacks against Israelis. The court is yet to established. </P>
<P> Several Palestinian human rights groups have also criticized Arafat's decision. </P>
<P> Sourani's group, an affiliate of the Geneva-based International Commission of Jurists, had asked Arafat in a report released on February 12 to repeal the order, describing it as ``the most serious violation of human rights since the Palestinian National Authority took charge of the self-rule areas in May 1994.'' </P>
<P> Sourani wrote in the note that police had told him he would be brought before the attorney general Thursday morning. </P>
<P> Arafat spokesman Nabil Abu Rdaineh confirmed Sourani was detained but gave no reasons for the arrest. </P>
<P> Sourani's office is representing Islamic Jihad spokesman Abdallah al-Shami in an appeal against Shami's detention three weeks ago. </P>
