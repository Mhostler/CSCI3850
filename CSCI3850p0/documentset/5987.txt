<P>  PLO officials said Monday they were close to an agreement with the militant Islamic Jihad group on limiting attacks against Israelis but reported obstacles in talks with the much larger Hamas movement. </P>
<P> The Palestinian Authority (PA), in charge of the self-ruled Gaza Strip and Jericho, began separate talks with Hamas and the Islamic Jihad last week, following a crackdown on Islamic groups responsible for suicide bombings against Israel. </P>
<P> ``The dialogue with the Islamic Jihad has made more progress than that with Hamas, and we hope to reach an agreement with them soon,'' said authority official Tayeb Abdel Rahim. </P>
<P> Abdel Rahim, the authority's chief negotiator with Islamic opposition groups, was speaking after a meeting Islamic Jihad officials. </P>
<P> The Palestinians Authority later announced it would release Mohammad al-Hindi, an Islamic Jihad leader and a main negotiator with the PLO arrested in the recent PLO crackdown. </P>
<P> ``He will be taking part in our ongoing dialog with the Islamic Jihad,'' a PLO official said. </P>
<P> The Islamic groups said the PLO was demanding they refrain from planning and carrying out attacks against Israelis from and in Palestinian-ruled areas. The agreement would not apply in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Israel. </P>
<P> Islamic Jihad leader Nafez Azzam said some progress had been made, ``but some pending issues need more time and more meetings to iron out.'' </P>
<P> Hamas said it was not ready to halt attacks. </P>
<P> ``The authority wants us to freeze attacks, but in internal debates, the majority in Hamas rejected a total freeze of attacks and voted for controlling attacks, only responding and reacting to certain aggressions,'' said one Hamas official. </P>
<P> ``This issue is the main problem blocking...an understanding with the authority,'' he said. </P>
<P> Another Hamas official said the group's political wing was considering sending a delegation from Gaza to Egypt and Jordan to consult with its leadership on discussions with PLO chief Yasser Arafat. </P>
<P> He said one factor delaying an accord was the rivalry and distrust between the PLO and Hamas. </P>
<P> ``There is also the lack of a coherent position due to internal differences between moderates and hardliners within Hamas, which prevented the success of previous dialogues with the PLO,'' he said. </P>
<P> Arafat has repeatedly said that Hamas receives orders from its leadership abroad, which the PLO believed was more militant. </P>
<P> Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Sunday Israel would reject any agreement between the authority and Islamic groups opposed to the Israel-PLO peace deal that did not include a total end to attacks on Israel. </P>
<P> Hamas and PLO officials, who confirmed they had met twice with Egypt's representative in self-ruled Gaza, Mahmoud Krayem, refused to comment on reports Egypt was mediating between the two sides. </P>
