<P>  The World Health Organization (WHO) said Friday it was giving the go-ahead for the first large-scale trials of potential vaccines against the virus that causes AIDS. </P>
<P> The WHO statement followed a two-day meeting of experts in Geneva which decided that some genetically-engineered vaccines had proved in preliminary trials to be safe and to help create immunity against HIV. </P>
<P> ``It's an important step on the long road towards a vaccine for AIDS,'' one WHO official said. </P>
<P> Of the 14 or 15 vaccines currently being developed around the world, only a handful will be tested when the trials get under way in 1996. </P>
<P> The statement did not mention which vaccines had been chosen and officials declined to name them. </P>
<P> Three countries, Brazil, Uganda and Tanzania, have agreed to hold the trials. </P>
<P> The WHO had been planning to stage trials in Rwanda but was forced to ditch the idea after the central African country's recent ethnic bloodshed. </P>
<P> According to latest WHO figures, 17 million people in the world have been infected with HIV since the virus appeared in the early 1980s. Four million of them have gone on to contract full-blown AIDS. </P>
<P> About 90 percent of new infections are in the developing world, especially in Africa and parts of Asia. </P>
<P> The Geneva meeting was attended by AIDS researchers and experts, drug company representatives and health officials from the countries that will run the trials. </P>
