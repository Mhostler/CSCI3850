<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  National Hockey League Commissioner Gary Bettman and union head Bob Goodenow kept talking into the wee hours Tuesday morning in a last-ditch attempt to save the season ahead of a noon Tuesday deadline. </P>
<P> Various reports, citing unspecified sources, said the negotiations had made progress and there were only a few stumbling blocks remaining, with free agency the main issue. </P>
<P> Bettman and Goodenow began their marathon contract negotiating session on Monday morning in an effort to hammer out an agreement before a Tuesday noon EST deadline set by the owners to cancel the entire 1994-95 season. </P>
<P> The deadline was set so the league could play a shortened 50-game schedule and a full set of playoffs ending by July. The original schedule was to be 84 regular-season games. </P>
<P> The ESPN sports network reported that all but two of the issues had apparently been settled. </P>
<P> The age for unrestricted free agency appeared to be the main issue that had not been agreed upon, ESPN said. The owners' last proposal set unrestricted free agency for players at 32. The players wanted unrestricted free agency at age 30. </P>
<P> ESPN said the issue of back pay also had not been settled. </P>
<P> The Canadian Press also said the main issue remaining was free agency, and said the two sides were looking at a combination of a player's age and length of NHL service to determine eligibility. </P>
<P> The Canadian Press said the age at which a player could enter the draft was also unsettled, though less contentious. It said the owners wanted the age to be 20, with 18- and 19-year-olds able to choose to enter the draft, while the union wanted it to remain at 18. </P>
<P> The Canadian Press also said back pay was unresolved. </P>
<P> The talks marked the first face-to-face negotiation between Bettman and Goodenow since December 6. </P>
<P> On Sunday, NHL players unanimously rejected what owners described as their last proposal aimed at ending the current lockout. Goodenow said Sunday's vote came after a telephone conference call involving 125 players. </P>
<P> That rejection came less than 24 hours after the NHL Board of Governors presented its proposal and set the noon deadline. </P>
<P> The owners' proposal did move away from a salary cap or tax, a curb on escalating payrolls that the players had said they could not accept. </P>
<P> The season was scheduled to begin Oct. 1, but was postponed until Oct. 15, then postponed further. </P>
<P> The lockout is the longest work stoppage in NHL history, easily surpassing the 10-day players' strike in 1992. </P>
