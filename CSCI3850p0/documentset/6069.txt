<DATELINE>PRETORIA (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Armed South African police Wednesday raided a right-wing radio station outside Pretoria in a bid to shut it down but left after talks with radio staff. </P>
<P> Police spokesman Capt. David Harrington told reporters police had accompanied post office employees who had warrants to seize the transmitters of Radio Donkerhoek because it was broadcasting without a license. </P>
<P> The head of the station, former special forces soldier Willem Ratte, locked himself into a cellar at the station with his four-year-old daughter and three other adults including station manager Edwin Clarke. </P>
<P> ``Police negotiated with Ratte and it was agreed that a docket will be presented to the attorney-general in connection with illegal broadcasting,'' Harrington said. ``No arrests were made.'' </P>
<P> About 50 rightwingers, many of them armed, gathered at the radio station after it broadcast an appeal for support during the raid. The group hurled abuse at the police but no clashes were reported. </P>
<P> Clarke told Reuters earlier that the station refused to accept licensing conditions which would limit the power of its transmitters and prevent it broadcasting political opinions. </P>
<P> ``There's no way you can accept an atheist government .... The current government came into power in fraudulent elections. They are suppressing our freedom of speech,'' he said. </P>
<P> The police raid took place on the eve of the first anniversary of South Africa's historic democratic election in which President Nelson Mandela's African National Congress came to power. </P>
<P> It was not clear if the police had agreed to allow the radio station to continue broadcasting. </P>
