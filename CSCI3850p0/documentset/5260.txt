<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, March 28 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Indian government decided on Tuesday to impose direct rule in Bihar as the last round of voting began in the violent eastern state, the United News of India (UNI) news agency said. </P>
<P> The Press Trust of India (PTI) reported that at least one person was killed in a clash between armed supporters of rival parties in the state, where assembly polls have been postponed several times because of violence. More than 50 people have been killed in the campaign. </P>
<P> In New Delhi, the lower house of parliament, the Lok Sabha, was adjourned three times as angry left-wingers protested against government plans to impose direct rule in the state. </P>
<P> The five-year mandate of Bihar Chief Minister Laloo Prasad Yadav of the leftist Janata Dal was officially due to have expired on March 15, but Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao asked him to continue in a caretaker role. </P>
<P> Politicians from India's ruling Congress party said Rao was worried Yadav would exploit any move to impose direct rule from New Delhi in the state. </P>
<P> But with the final round of voting finally under way, there was little Yadav could now do to affect the result. </P>
<P> UNI said a formal proclamation imposing president's rule in Bihar would be issued later. It said the move was inescapable as there was no assembly to approve public sector salaries and other urgent state government spending after the end of the month. </P>
<P> PTI reported that by midday, some 30 percent of the 8.3 million voters had cast ballots in the 47 constitutencies being polled on the fifth and final round of the assembly election in the state. </P>
<P> It said a woman was injured when explosives were hurled at a polling station in the Raghopur constituency, which Yadav was contesting. </P>
<P> India's Chief Election Commissioner T.N. Seshan has delayed and rescheduled the vote several times in Bihar, the last in the current round of state assembly elections. More than 100,000 paramilitary police have been deployed in the state to supervise the vote. </P>
<P> Police have arrested scores of people for looting ballot boxes and generally disrupting the election. </P>
<P> Yadav has accused Seshan of conspiring with Rao and the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) against the poor and lower castes he maintains he represents in the state. </P>
<P> Janata Dal members of parliament accused the Indian government of creating a constitutional crisis by imposing direct rule while polling was still going on in Bihar. </P>
<P> They shouted slogans accusing the government of trying to kill democracy in Bihar and left their seats to protest in the well of the house, forcing repeated adjournments. </P>
<P> The ruling Congress party captured Orissa, the neighbouring state to Bihar, from the Janata Dal in assembly elections this month, its only major victory in the current round of state voting, and it is expected to improve its standing in Bihar. </P>
<P> It lost control of two major industrialised states in the west, Maharashtra and Gujarat, to Hindu nationalists. </P>
