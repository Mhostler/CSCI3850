<P>  Opposition candidates will apparently not get another chance to go head to head in a televised debate with the standard-bearer of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). </P>
<P> A top PRI official said Friday it was unlikely there would be another debate ahead of the August 21 national election. Opposition candidates had pushed for a repeat of the first-ever presidential debate in May in hopes of gaining ground against PRI candidate Ernesto Zedillo. </P>
<P> Jose Angel Gurria, the PRI's head of international affairs, told reporters it had proven difficult to organize a debate and that now candidates were too busy making campaign appearances to find the time. </P>
<P> ``I don't think they're going to have a debate,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``Effectively it would be very difficult at this point because everybody's in the home stretch. Everybody's going to as many cities as possible in the closing days of the campaign,'' Gurria said in a news conference at PRI headquarters. </P>
<P> The first debate, which attracted a national television audience estimated at 50 million people, was widely viewed as a major victory for National Action Party candidate Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, whose withering attacks on Zedillo and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the leftist Democratic Revolution Party propelled him into first place in some polls. </P>
<P> Zedillo proposed another debate on economic issues but appeared to lose interest as recent polls showed him surging ahead of his two opponents.  Fernandez has been the most vocal proponent of a second debate and told reporters a second shot at Zedillo was a major part of his campaign strategy. </P>
<P> The cigar-chomping lawyer appears to have lost the momentum he gained following his performance in the May debate and is now running a distant second in most polls. </P>
