<DATELINE>PARIS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Fundamentalist Muslim guerrillas killed two people after hijacking a French airliner at Algiers airport Christmas Eve, their most spectacular attack on a foreign target. </P>
<P> Algerian Interior Minister Abderrahmane Meziane Cherif said Saturday that the four ``terrorists'' -- the term Algerian authorities use for fundamentalist guerrillas -- killed the two in seizing the plane, ``probably to display their determination.'' They then demanded to take off for an undisclosed destination. </P>
<P> One of the dead was a plainclothes Algerian policeman passenger who confronted the gunmen. The other had not been identified. </P>
<P> French television quoted an unconfirmed agency report as saying up to seven people had been killed. It said more shots were heard just before midnight, apparently inside the Air France Airbus 300. </P>
<P> Cherif said the guerrillas had released 57 Algerians among the 232 people on board. Those still on the plane included two French diplomats, 12 French crew, two or three Tunisians and a Vietnamese. </P>
<P> Other reports said there were 287 people on board, including about 22 French nationals. </P>
<P> Hooded elite ``Ninja'' Algerian security forces surrounded the plane, which was parked with all its lights out a few hundred yards from the terminal. </P>
<P> The guerrillas were reported to be armed with sub-machineguns and hand grenades. </P>
<P> Cherif said the authorities were not removing the gangway in order to prevent the airliner from taking off. He said he hoped to ``bring (the gunmen) back to reason through dialogue ... in the next hours.'' </P>
<P> One report said witnesses saw two wounded passengers being dumped into the open cargo hold and gesturing for help as the hijackers fired to keep police at bay. </P>
<P> One released woman passenger was quoted as saying the hijackers were fanatics who terrorized passengers, prayed and handed scarves to women passengers to cover their heads. </P>
<P> Algiers airport was closed and French airlines canceled their flights to Algeria Sunday. </P>
<P> French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur said he would do his utmost to help the hostages. Defense Minister Francois Leotard said France was ready to help free them if the Algerian government requested it. </P>
<P> The airliner had been scheduled to leave Algiers at 11.15 a.m. (5:15 a.m. EST) Saturday for Paris. At Orly airport in Paris, the flight was listed as ``delayed.'' </P>
<P> Airport authorities assembled tearful relatives of Algerian passengers in a special hall but later advised them to go home and wait for news from the airline by telephone. </P>
<P> Civil strife in Algeria between fundamentalists and security forces has killed 10,000 to 20,000 people since authorities canceled a general election which the Islamic Salvation Front had been poised to win nearly three years ago. </P>
<P> Seventy foreigners, including 22 French nationals, have been killed by Muslim guerrillas in the conflict. The guerrillas, who want to turn Algeria into an Islamist Republic, have accused France of supporting the Algerian government. </P>
<P> The fundamentalists target security forces, government officials, intellectuals, journalists and teachers. </P>
<P> Diplomats say security forces have been responding with increasing violence, dropping napalm to flush out the guerrillas from the mountainous hinterland. The official Algerian news agency APS said 40 armed fundamentalists were killed during the past week. </P>
<P> The most violent guerrilla organization, the Islamic Armed Group, last year ordered foreigners to leave or face death. </P>
<P> Two consulate workers and three gendarmes were shot dead in an attack on a French housing complex in Algiers last August, and 12 Croats were killed last Christmas. </P>
<P> But Saturday's hijacking was the most spectacular action by Algerian guerrillas on a foreign target. </P>
<P> Two Algerian planes were hijacked to Spain this year, one by militants who demanded the release of political prisoners and the other by a policeman who wanted to flee his country. </P>
<P> Claude Pierre, former head of the French community in Algeria, said the guerrillas had deliberately chosen Christmas Eve for their latest attack to get maximum publicity. </P>
<P> Pierre said the Algerian government was unlikely to give in, but he added the hijackers were fanatics who were probably prepared to die. </P>
<P> ``They will almost certainly die, but they may kill many others,'' he said. ``It is worrying for the passengers, especially for the French who are a prime target.'' </P>
