<DATELINE>PARIS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  France said Wednesday it had asked Washington to recall several U.S. citizens, including diplomats, for spying but expressed the hope that the request would not damage relations between the two allies. </P>
<P> The Interior and Foreign Ministries said their recall was being requested for ``activities incompatible with their status'' -- the usual diplomatic term for spying -- and had not been intended to become public. </P>
<P> The rare joint statement did not say how many people were involved and if they had already left. It was published hours after the newspaper Le Monde said Paris wanted Washington to recall five of its nationals, including four diplomats. </P>
<P> Le Monde said the French counter-intelligence agency DST believed the five were CIA agents, including the Paris station chief, and had tried to recruit aides of French Cabinet ministers for political and economic espionage. </P>
<P> ``The U.S. Embassy has been told several times in recent weeks that U.S. citizens, among them diplomats, were taking part in activities incompatible with the status under which they are living in France,'' the ministries' statement said. </P>
<P> ``The French government wants to underline that such a move could not affect the solid and long-lasting friendly relations between France and the United States.'' </P>
<P> U.S. Ambassador Pamela Harriman met French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur at his office a few hours after Le Monde hit the newsstands. She emerged about 30 minutes later, looking stony-faced, and told reporters in French: ``No comment.'' </P>
<P> The newspaper said Interior Minister Charles Pasqua had summoned Harriman Jan. 26 and Feb. 3 to ``strongly invite'' the recall of the agents, saying their activities meant they could no longer stay in France. </P>
<P> In Washington, White House spokesman Mike McCurry acknowledged that there had been ``some private discussions'' with the French government. </P>
<P> Another U.S. official said he did not believe a decision had been made about possible retaliation and he sensed an interest in Washington in trying to resolve the matter privately. </P>
<P> Balladur played down speculation of a rift with Washington, a close ally despite frictions over trade and French fears that their culture is being swamped by Hollywood and hamburgers. </P>
<P> ``The French people are friends of the American people and the French government is a friend of the American government,'' Balladur told reporters. ``Events like that occur regularly on both sides of the Atlantic.'' </P>
<P> Le Monde, in its front-page story, said French officials had given three examples of CIA activity including the alleged recruitment of a member of Balladur's personal staff who was detected and dismissed within two weeks. </P>
<P> It said the names of three of the four ``diplomats,'' two men and one woman, were still on the embassy's telephone list late Tuesday. </P>
<P> Among other officials the U.S. agents had sought to recruit were a Communications Ministry aide in charge of cable and satellite issues and a technician in the French telephone services who sold documents to the CIA, Le Monde said. </P>
<P> Their missions were largely connected to Franco-American business rivalries and differences between the two countries in negotiations within the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. </P>
<P> All three people recruited had agreed to assist France's DST in ``double-crossing'' their CIA contacts, Le Monde said. </P>
<P> It quoted unnamed French officials as saying there were 80 U.S. agents, 30 of them clandestine, in France and the United States had now supplanted the former Soviet Union as the main source of spying on France. </P>
<P> Expulsions from France in recent years have involved Iraqis, Iranians, South Africans and Russians. </P>
