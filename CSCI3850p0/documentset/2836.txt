<P>  A USAir jet with 39 people on board made an emergency landing in Boston Friday after the pilot shut down one of the plane's two engines as a precautionary measure, an airline spokesman said Saturday. </P>
<P> The crew of the MD-80 cut the right engine because of an indication in the cockpit of low oil quantity, spokesman John Bronson said. </P>
<P> The crew of Flight 484, which originated in Philadelphia, asked for crash fire units to be standing by at Logan Airport. The jet landed without incident at about 5 p.m., Bronson said by telephone from Virginia, where USAir is based. </P>
<P> USAir's safety record has been under scrutiny since one of its planes crashed Sept. 8 outside Pittsburgh, killing 132 people. Including that accident, the airline has experienced five fatal crashes in five years. </P>
<P> Last Wendesday night a USAir Express commuter plane with 25 people on board made an emergency landing in Binghamton, N.Y., after the pilot shut down one of the propeller plane's two engines as a precautionary measure, an airline spokesman said. </P>
<P> CBS News said another another USAir MD-80 made an emergency landing at Raleigh-Durham airport in North Carolina Wednesday. The pilot there also mentioned a problem in the plane's right engine, it said. </P>
