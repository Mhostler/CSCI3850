<P>  Australia annnounced a series of new defense programs Wednesday, saying that the peaceful strategic environment in Asia might not last. </P>
<P> The end of the Cold War meant strategic affairs in Asia would be determined by Asian countries themselves and especially China, the government said in its 15-year defense outlook. </P>
<P> ``Over the next decade, China is likely to be the most powerful new influence on the strategic affairs of our wider region,'' the policy statement said. </P>
<P> ``The relative peace in Asia may not last.'' </P>
<P> Defense Minister Robert Ray told parliament: ``The key judgement in this white paper is that fundamental changes in strategic affairs, both globally and within our region, will make Australia's strategic environment more demanding over the next 15 years.'' </P>
<P> While emphasiZing that present circumstances were benign, Ray said Australia would field a fifth infantry battalion, buy new ships and aircraft and upgrade present equipment. </P>
<P> Airborne-early-warning aircraft, a longstanding requirement, would be bought before the end of the decade. </P>
<P> Australia would also look at buying surveillance satellites and creating seabed sonar arrays, like those which NATO laid in the Atlantic and Pacific to monitor Soviet submarines. </P>
<P> A newspaper reported last week that the sonar arrays would be laid between Australian and Indonesia. </P>
<P> Australia already has strong surveillance capabilities. Its Jindalee over-the-horizon radar system, based in the middle of the continent, can watch targets thousands of miles from Australia's coast. </P>
<P> The review said the force of 70 McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet fighters would be upgraded with new radar and electronic countermeasures while the navy got new helicopters and will investigate improved anti-air and anti-surface missiles. </P>
<P> The air force, operating 24 Lockheed C-130 Hercules, would buy at least 12 new ones to replace half of the fleet and might buy another 12. </P>
<P> The review said the present plan to build six of the big Collins Class submarines was sufficient but Ray said only a lack of money had prevented him from ordering an extra two. </P>
<P> ``I'm running a raffle to raise Australian $1.2 billion ($920 million),'' he joked. The question would be reviewed in fiscal 1996/97. </P>
<P> Apart from new programs announced in the review, Australia is already strengthening its armed forces. </P>
<P> The navy's destroyer-frigate force is being enlarged from 12 to 17, two second-hand U.S. assault ships were bought this year and 15 small patrol boats are to be replaced by 12 much larger patrol ships. </P>
<P> The air force has just added 15 second-hand aircraft to its powerful and controversial fleet of F-111 strike bombers, taking the force to 36. Its Lockheed P-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft will also be upgraded. </P>
