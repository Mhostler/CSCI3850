<P>  Naga separatists killed at least 22 members of the rival Kuki tribe in India's northeastern state of Manipur Thursday, the Press Trust of India said. </P>
<P> The news agency quoted officials as saying 18 Kukis were gunned down and four hacked to death when their trucks were intercepted by Nagas in Senapati district, near the Burmese border. The attack appeared to be linked to the killing of four Nagas by Kukis in Ukhrul district last week, PTI said. </P>
<P> Indian customs officials believe the two mainly Christian tribes are fighting over a lucrative heroin route from the neighboring Golden Triangle across the border. </P>
<P> More than 300 people have been killed in the long-running feud between the two ethnic groups in two years. </P>
<P> Kukis form 20 percent and Nagas 25 per cent of Manipur's population of 1.8 million. Nagas and Kukis, who engaged in head-hunting until 60 years ago, live on both sides of the India-Burma border. </P>
