<DATELINE>MOSCOW (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin announced Tuesday he was forming a bloc of parliamentary candidates ``who want to see Russia stable, powerful and sure of itself.'' </P>
<P> President Boris Yeltsin praised Chernomyrdin's decision, making clear it was part of a coordinated strategy aimed at preventing the Kremlin's opponents from winning a majority in December's elections to the State Duma. </P>
<P> ``I am sure he (Chernomyrdin) will unite serious people in his movement for a serious task,'' Yeltsin said in a written answer to the RIA news agency which his press service published. </P>
<P> ``And I definitely know there are other people in Russia than the various irresponsible extremists who sneak into politics just to show themselves off.'' </P>
<P> Yeltsin said another big election bloc would be headed by Ivan Rybkin, the chairman of the Duma. </P>
<P> ``They will spread their activity across Russia and force all extremists out of the political arena,'' he told the Interfax news agency. </P>
<P> Chernomyrdin told reporters: ``Russia has had enough shocks and revolutions. It should not be turned into a testing ground. Russia is our home, where accord and stability should reign and we should ensure this.'' </P>
<P> ``We will take part in elections. A bloc, or a movement, will be formed. Worthy people should be elected to the State Duma -- people who want to see Russia stable, powerful and sure of itself.'' </P>
<P> Chernomyrdin, prime minister since December 1992, made his career in the Soviet energy sector. </P>
<P> He has proved loyal to the president and to market reforms and is likely to be backed by centrist, moderate reformers as well as many influential financial and industrial groups which see him as a guarantor of stability. </P>
<P> It is clear that both Chernomyrdin and Yeltsin want to avoid a repetition of the 1993 elections to the Duma. </P>
<P> Both men did not at that time side with any party. Despite wide expectations of a victory for reformers, the big winner was ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky. </P>
<P> Democrats remain split and many of them are hostile to the Kremlin over its bloody campaign in breakaway Chechnya. In these conditions the current ``party of power'' is seeking a new base. </P>
<P> Many political commentators say Chernomyrdin is on the rise, even though his standing in the corridors of power was shaky as recently as last fall. </P>
<P> Chernomyrdin's popularity is high, the economy is showing signs of recovery and he is largely untainted in the public eye by the Kremlin's intervention in Chechnya. </P>
<P> On Tuesday, he said Yeltsin would order a halt to military operations in Chechnya for next month's official celebrations in Moscow marking Victory Day over Nazi Germany in World War II. </P>
<P> Both announcements were clearly timed to impress some 50 world leaders expected to attend the ceremony in Moscow. </P>
