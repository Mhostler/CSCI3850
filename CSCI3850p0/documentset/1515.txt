<P>  The German parliament's lower house approved an anti-crime bill Wednesday which includes a provision making the denial of the Holocaust a criminal offense punishable with up to five years in prison. </P>
<P> The bill, agreed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition and the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) after months of wrangling, also includes a controversial provision allowing police and prosecutors to use information gathered by the German espionage agency BND. </P>
<P> The anti-crime package, intended partly to stop voters drifting to right-wing parties in October's general election, gives police and prosecutors more powers to crack down on small-time criminals, organized crime and street violence. </P>
<P> Apart from jail sentences for the so-called ``Auschwitz lie'' -- denying that the Holocaust happened -- the bill extends an existing ban on the use of Nazi symbols in Germany to slogans and signs that simply resemble Nazi symbols. </P>
<P> The SPD had originally opposed the BND clause and blocked the bill with its majority in the smaller upper house mainly on the grounds that it undermined Germany's traditionally strict barrier between intelligence services and police work. </P>
<P> As a compromise, the bill now puts limits on how the BND gathers covert intelligence and confines its role to suspected severe cases of terrorism, drugs and arms trading, money laundering and nuclear smuggling. </P>
<P> Both Kohl's coalition of Christian Democrats (CDU) and the liberal Free Democrats as well as the SPD have made anti-crime measures a key plank in their election campaigns. </P>
<P> Parliament's upper house will vote on the bill Friday and, if approved, it will become law on December 1. </P>
