<P>  Three French towns have taken down posters for ``Disclosure,'' a movie about sexual harassment starring Michael Douglas and Demi Moore, after a flood of protests that they were too steamy. </P>
<P> Aix-en-Provence, Versailles and Arcachon all banned the posters, showing Moore from behind smothering Douglas with her skirt riding up her thighs. The film is about a woman boss who harasses a male subordinate at work. </P>
<P> Family groups and others say the posters, with the subtitle ``Sex is Power,'' are too sexually explicit. Film critics say the film is tame by continental standards and the poster is misleading. </P>
<P> France's advertising watchdog body said it wanted the Culture Ministry to set clearer guidelines on outlawing posters. </P>
<P> ``We've had about 50 letters of protest, many from associations. This is an exceptional number for a film poster,'' Lucien Bouis, head of the Bureau of Advertising Verification, told Reuters. </P>
<P> He said he would contact Culture Minister Jacques Toubon, whose office checks posters before publication. </P>
