<P>  Quebec's most popular political leader softened his position Sunday on the province's secession from Canada, calling for close economic ties between Canada and a sovereign Quebec similar to those in the European Union. </P>
<P> At the national convention of the Bloc Quebecois, a separatist party that sits as the official opposition in Canada's national Parliament, leader Lucien Bouchard invoked the European Union as a model of the ideal economic relationship between Canada and a separate Quebec. </P>
<P> The convention delegates adopted a resolution calling for the study of the establishment of a ``common parliamentary conference'' should Quebec leave Canada. </P>
<P> Bouchard described it as a ``meeting place,'' a body of delegates or ministers from Canada and Quebec that could be fashioned after the European Union. </P>
<P> ``It could be a good thing. We see it as a possibility,'' Bouchard said in a speech to delegates Sunday. </P>
<P> The resolution was at odds with the strategy of Jacques Parizeau, Quebec premier and leader of the separatist alliance, who has never proposed such close ties between Canada and a sovereign Quebec. </P>
<P> ``I have a lot of skepticism about English Canada accepting things of that kind,'' Parizeau told reporters in Quebec City on Sunday. ``If Canada were to offer us the Maastricht Treaty, we would jump on it and say yes.'' </P>
<P> Bouchard acknowledged that his proposal was a departure from the separatists' common strategy, but he said that with his own party's national convention underway he could not wait for the Quebec premier to produce a revised plan of action. </P>
<P> Since early this year, public opinion polls have shown that only 40 to 45 percent of Quebecers would support Quebec's separation from Canada. </P>
<P> Last week, Parizeau said a promised referendum on Quebec separation would be held this autumn rather than this spring, a gambit that the separatists hope will give them more time to bolster public support for their cause. </P>
<P> Bouchard's economic union proposal was aimed at assuaging Quebecers' fears that an independent Quebec would be isolated economically from the rest of Canada. </P>
<P> ``What was done by this convention was done to improve the chances of holding a winning referendum that would make Quebec a sovereign country,'' Bouchard said at a press conference Sunday. </P>
<P> Delegates to the Bloc Quebecois convention hotly debated the economic union proposal, with some telling party leaders they were opposed to such a change in the separatist platform. Political analysts said the proposal could signal a widening gap between Parizeau and Bouchard, who polls show is Quebec's favorite politician. </P>
<P> On Sunday, Bouchard played down any suggestion that his new strategy would cause a rift in Quebec's separatist forces. </P>
<P> ``If I thought there was such a risk, I never would have proposed this at the convention,'' Bouchard said. </P>
<P> Parizeau also scoffed at the idea the two men were divided on referendum strategy, but when asked who was the leader of the separatist alliance, he replied: ``I know there is only one premier of Quebec.'' </P>
