<P>  A rare public clash between Mexico's ruling party and the country's justice system showed no sign of abating Wednesday as a probe into the assassination of party secretary-general Francisco Ruiz Massieu ground on. </P>
<P> Deputy Attorney General Mario Ruiz Massieu, the dead man's brother who is heading the probe, renewed his assault on top officials of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), whom he has accused of obstructing the investigation. </P>
<P> In a telephone call to Mexico's most widely watched news program late Tuesday, Ruiz said he would be happy to provide proof of his allegations and told PRI party president Ignacio Pichardo Pagaza he should ``get his party in order''. </P>
<P> Pichardo had earlier asked Ruiz to prove his allegations of a cover-up by the ruling party or retract them. </P>
<P> Ruiz called Pichardo's protestations of innocence ``verging on the ridiculous,'' and ``archaic and illogical''. </P>
<P> Ruiz's charges and the tone of his attack on the PRI have fallen like a political bombshell in Mexico, where authorities rarely air accusations against ruling party officials. </P>
<P> Ruiz said earlier this week that Pichardo and Maria de los Angeles Moreno, who took over from his slain brother as PRI secretary general, had tried to impede his investigation of the Sept. 28 killing. </P>
<P> They ``were more concerned with defending criminals'' within the ruling party and reducing the political ramifications of the crime than with helping the probe advance, he said, adding that Moreno had ``conspired with a top official at the Attorney General's office'' to impede the investigation. </P>
<P> Moreno has also denied the charges. </P>
<P> About a dozen people have been arrested in the case so far, and former PRI deputy Manuel Munoz Rocha, the alleged planner of the killing, is a fugitive from justice. </P>
<P> Ruiz has said he believes more important PRI politicians than Munoz were involved in the killing, as part of a conspiracy by old-guard ruling party members known as ``dinosaurs'' to sabotage democratic reform in Mexico. </P>
<P> Sources close to Ruiz have told Reuters that investigators believe the killing of Francisco Ruiz Massieu and the March 23 assassination of PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio are linked. </P>
