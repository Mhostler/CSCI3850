<P>  U.N. mediator Thorvald Stoltenberg said Tuesday lifting the arms embargo against the Bosnian Muslims ``could be helpful'' provided it was done as a result of a Security Council decision and not unilaterally. </P>
<P> He also had no doubt that a border closing recently ordered by Belgrade to pressure the Bosnian Serbs to accept the latest Bosnia peace plan would be effective, though Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic had rejected the idea of international monitors. </P>
<P> Stoltenberg was speaking to reporters after briefing Security Council members on a recent visit to Belgrade and the Bosnian Serb stronghold at Pale in an unsuccessful bid to secure Bosnian Serb acceptance of the peace plan and accompanying map. They were drafted by the United States, Russia, Britain, France and Germany. </P>
<P></P>
<P> ``I suppose this will be in the context of the Security Council. And on the basis of the Security Council resolution, I think it can be helpful, but I think it's important that it's not unilateral.'' </P>
<P> The Bosnian Serbs were not worried, however, about any lifting of the embargo. He quoted them as saying: ``This will be no problem for us, because we get the same arms as they (the Bosnian Muslims) get.'' </P>
<P> The Security Council imposed an arms ban on all parts of the former Yugoslavia in September 1991. This placed the Bosnian Muslims at a disadvantage against the Bosnian Serbs, who acquired large weapons stocks from the former Yugoslav federal army. </P>
<P> Asked about moves to tighten existing sanctions against the Yugoslav state of Serbia and Montenegro, to make it pressure the Bosnian Serbs, he said if the border closure ordered by Belgrade were effective, ``it would be very strange to hit a country...'' </P>
<P> Citing a cut-off even of telephone links between Serbia and Pale, in addition to the absence of cross-border traffic and travel, he added: ``I have no reason, as of today, to doubt that this will be effective.'' </P>
<P> Milosevic was unwilling to accept international monitors, even though Stoltenberg told him that would lend credibility to his actions. But the Serbian president said any diplomat or journalist was free to visit any of the border crossings. </P>
<P> Milosevic said the effects of the border sealing would become apparent fairly soon, while noting his policy was strongly opposed by Serbia's Orthodox Church. </P>
<P> Stoltenberg said he would continue his contacts and believed and hoped ``we shall have some agreement on some sort of international monitoring.'' </P>
<P> He also said the Bosnian Serbs told him they ``would even take less'' than the 49 percent share of Bosnian territory offered them under the peace plan, ``provided that they got the necessary security and economic viability.'' </P>
<P> ``I still hope that the Bosnian Serbs will be realistic enough to accept the present peace plan,'' the U.N. mediator said. ``Because after all, the rest of the world, including FRY (the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia), feels now that this is fair and balanced map.'' </P>
