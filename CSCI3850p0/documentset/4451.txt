<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  U.N. special envoy to Afghanistan Mahmoud Mestiri said Monday that the country's warring factions were using sweeping gains by the militant Taleban student movement as a pretext to delay a peace agreement. </P>
<P> ``The factions are not ready to make peace, and they take advantage of the presence of the Taleban to adjourn the process of peace,'' Mestiri said in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp. </P>
<P> ``Of course, they have a big problem because they still are opposed to each other and all of them are opposed to the Taleban, and this makes them in a rather weak position in front of the Taleban,'' he added. </P>
<P> The Islamic student movement drove main opposition leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-i-Islami group last week from the town of Charasyab, nine miles south of Kabul, in a swift push through eastern Afghanistan. </P>
<P> Witnesses said Monday that forces loyal to Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani were reinforcing positions between Charasyab and the capital with bunkers, trenches and tanks. </P>
<P> Taleban set three conditions Monday for joining a U.N.-proposed interim authority, clouding chances for an early transfer of power. </P>
<P> Taleban regional commander and spokesman Mullah Boorjan told reporters the movement wanted a neutral security force created for Kabul. He added that all interim council members must be good Muslims and that any future government must be Islamic. </P>
<P> In his BBC interview, Mestiri was asked what were the prospects for peace in the future. </P>
<P> ``In the near future, maybe not,'' he responded. </P>
