<P>  A division of Russian paratroopers was moving toward Grozny Friday from the army's main headquarters just outside Chechnya, a Russian parliamentarian was quoted as saying. </P>
<P> Aivars Lezdinsh told Interfax news agency from Ingushetia, west of Chechnya, that the troops were on the move from their headquarters in the town of Mozdok. A division generally consists of several thousand soldiers. </P>
<P> The vice-president of Ingushetia, Boris Agapov, told Reuters by telephone that large numbers of troops were slowly on the move about three to five miles outside Grozny. </P>
<P> ``It looks like the Russian troops are now acting according to the rules from a military standpoint,'' he said from the Ingush capital Narzan. </P>
<P> Russia sent troops into Chechnya Dec. 11 to end the region's bid for independence. But Kremlin leaders have been heavily criticized for a New Year's Eve tank-led push on the city which incurred heavy losses. </P>
