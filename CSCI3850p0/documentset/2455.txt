<P>  The head of South Africa's secretive arms agency gave evidence Monday at the start of a public inquiry into military contracts that could embarrass countries that violated the apartheid-era U.N. weapons embargo. </P>
<P> The inquiry, conducted by Judge Edwin Cameron, is probing the Armscor agency's sale of AK-47 combat rifles and ammunition worth $700,000 through Middle Eastern arms dealer Eli Wazan in August. </P>
<P> Defense Minister Joe Modise ordered the inquiry after press reports that Wazan had duped Armscor into believing the arms were destined for Lebanon when they were really headed for Yemen. </P>
<P> Under South African law, arms cannot be sold to Yemen because of this year's fighting between north and south. </P>
<P> Wazan presented the South Africans with an end-user certificate giving Lebanon as the destination for the weapons but the Beirut government denied knowledge of the contract. </P>
<P> The ship carrying the weapons returned to South Africa in September after being turned away from a port in Yemen. Ownership of the shipment is now in dispute. </P>
<P> Armscor chief executive Tielman de Waal told the inquiry that he had been on vacation at the time of the Wazan deal and had no personal knowledge of it because it was a relatively small transaction. </P>
