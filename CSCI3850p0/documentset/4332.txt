<P> Public criticism of a central bank-led scheme to bail out the two debt-ridden credit firms, Tokyo Kyowa Credit Association and Anzen Credit Bank, has mounted since the Bank of Japan (BOJ) announced the unprecedented plan in December. </P>
<P> The BOJ, private banks and the Tokyo Metropolitan government, which supervised the credit firms, are taking part in the special bank set up to take over the two firms' business until their bad debt, estimated at over 100 billion yen ($1 billion), can be written off. </P>
<P> Mass circulation daily Yomiuri Shimbun said Tuesday that eight companies closely connected with Yamaguchi were among those said by the Tokyo Metropolitan government to have received loans from the two credit firms in excess of regulations capping loans to single borrowers. </P>
<P> The paper also said that Yamaguchi's office had issued a statement through his legal adviser Monday saying Yamaguchi had never peddled his influence as an executive or shareholder of any corporation or private company. </P>
