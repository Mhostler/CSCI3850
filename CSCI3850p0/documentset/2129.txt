<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The U.S. defense secretary and South Korean leaders are to consider scrapping joint military exercises which North Korea fiercely opposes following the agreement on the North's nuclear program, Seoul government officials said Thursday. </P>
<P> South Korean news reports said William Perry, due Thursday night, would also bring a message from President Clinton assuring South Korean President Kim Young-sam the United States would honor its security commitment to its long-time ally. </P>
<P> A Defense Ministry spokesman said Perry would discuss cancellation of this year's joint ``Team Spirit'' war games between Seoul and Washington. </P>
<P> The United States and South Korea suspended the exercises, which the North considers a rehearsal for invasion, earlier this year but said at the time they would go ahead in November unless Pyongyang agreed to full nuclear inspection. </P>
<P> The spokesman said Seoul and Washington had not studied the possibility of replacing Team Spirit. ``But the issue of resuming this year's Team Spirit exercises will be discussed during the visit of the U.S. Defense Secretary.'' </P>
<P> South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-joo added Thursday that the status of U.S. forces in the country would remain the same despite a Geneva agreement to defuse the nuclear threat in North Korea. </P>
<P> ``Just because a nuclear agreement was reached, it doesn't mean there is no threat from North Korea,'' Han told the domestic Yonhap news agency. </P>
<P> ``In the past year, U.S. forces on the Korean peninsula have been greatly reinforced. Regardless of the nuclear agreement, the capability of U.S. forces in the country should if anything be strengthened, not weakened,'' he said. </P>
<P> The United States scaled down its South Korean-based forces after inter-Korean tensions eased in December 1991 with the signing of a North-South de-nuclearization pact. </P>
<P> Nearly 7,000 troops were removed up to 1993. But a plan to pull out a further 6,500 was put on hold last year because of Pyongyang's alleged nuclear ambitions. </P>
<P> Currently more than 36,000 U.S. troops bolster 655,000 South Korean soldiers confronting the one million-strong North Korean army across a strongly-defended de-militarized zone. </P>
<P> The U.S.-North Korean pact, struck on Monday and due to be signed on Friday, states that Pyongyang will freeze its current graphite-moderated nuclear building program and close an experimental reactor. </P>
<P> In return, Washington will form a multinational consortium, including South Korea and Japan, to provide Pyongyang with light-water reactors, which produce little of the plutonium it has been accused of diverting to make nuclear arms. </P>
<P> Han said he expected Washington to lift trade and financial restrictions imposed on Pyongyang after the initial stages of rapprochement. </P>
<P> ``Washington will not immediately normalize relations with Pyongyang considering the fact an exchange of liaison offices is closely related to such factors as inter-Korean talks,'' Han said. </P>
<P> The two Koreas have remained technically still at war since the 1950-53 Korean War ended with the signing of an armistice. </P>
