<P>  When a serial killer was at large the communist system was incapable of hunting him for both ideological and professional reasons. </P>
<P> The bodies mounted up. The public was not informed and years later, American actor Jeffrey DeMunn was left with a major problem. </P>
<P> In the film version about the Soviet Union's most deadly manhunt, the hunt for Andrei Chikatilo, he had only a few short scenes to convey the essense of an insane killer who in eight years murdered 52 young men and women in Rostov-on-Don from 1982 to his capture in 1990. </P>
<P> DeMunn's secret formula for playing a serial killer sounds almost simple -- clear your mind, make no judgments on the character and keep all of his turmoil raging inside you. </P>
<P> His portrayal in the cable television network HBO film 'Citizen X'' makes its debut on Saturday night and will be repeated several times. </P>
<P> DeMunn's chilling no-ranting, no-raving portrait of Chikatilo is of a man closed off from the world, a man whose madness is not glimpsed by his workmates who treat him as a buffoon or his wife who treats him with contempt. </P>
<P> The tall, thin 47-year-old professional character actor plays Chikatilo as a face in the crowd, an unshaven one with uncombed hair and a gait so stiff that his upper body appears to be made of steel, unbending, inflexible. </P>
<P> It is a character role in a film that stars Irish actor Stephen Rea as the Russian detective Viktor Burakov, who spent eight years fighting the Soviet bureaucracy to catch Chikatilo with Donald Sutherland playing Burakov's boss. </P>
<P> The two are allied against a Communist party that denies the existence of a serial killer because no such thing could happen in workers' state. </P>
<P> Partly because Soviet authorities refused to publicize the case, it took years to catch Chikatilo who lured young people from train stations with promises of vodka and stabbed them to death after sexually molesting them. </P>
<P> ``I suspended any judgment of him whatsoever. I watched video tapes of him at his trial and his interrogations. The Russians videotaped everything starting when he was first handcuffed. </P>
<P> ``I watched a lot to get a sense of him but if I let a single bit of judgment in, it would have blown the whole thing up. Chris Gerelmo, the director of the film, did meet Chikatilo and detested him so much that he told me, he would have pulled the switch on him himself if he could. The man was full of excuses and had no remorse.'' </P>
<P> ``He was an utterly isolated human being sealed off from the world from within. If I started thinking about how I should have played him, I'd still be doing it now. The only way to play him was to clear my mind and let him in.'' </P>
<P> DeMunn says that one effect of playing the character that way was that he became fairly unsocialable on the set, keeping mostly to himself and not joking around with the other actors, even though some were old friends. </P>
<P> But when he finished his last scene, the cast and crew in Budapest, where the film was made, applauded him and brought out a cake and then cut it with the knife the Chikatilo character uses in the film. </P>
