<P>  Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole said in an interview broadcast Sunday that he was in good health and hoped to serve two full four-year terms as president if elected next year at the age of 73. </P>
<P> ``I'm in good health. I have a lot of stamina, a lot of energy,'' Dole said on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press.'' The program was taped Saturday in Dole's home town of Russell, Kan. </P>
<P> Dole earlier this year said he might consider offering to serve just one term as president because of his age. But he said he had reconsidered and decided it would be a bad idea: ``You might be a lame duck from day one if you did that.'' </P>
<P> Dole, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, said he had the experience to be a good national leader and shared the views of most Americans. </P>
<P> ``I know how to lead and I know the way,'' Dole said. </P>
<P> ``The American people want stability. The American people don't want an extremist in the White House. Bob Dole is not an extremist,'' he said. </P>
<P> He refused to label any of the other Republican candidates as extremist although some, including Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, have said they are more conservative than Dole. </P>
<P> But he said Gramm's pledge to balance the federal budget in a single four-year term was impractical. Dole has promised to balance the budget by the year 2002. </P>
<P> ``I have a lot of respect for Phil Gramm, but we have to be realistic,'' he said. </P>
<P> Dole said he was opposed to abortions and wanted a pro-life position in the 1996 Republican platform. But he said he probably would not push for a constitutional amendment to ban abortions as many conservative Republicans want. </P>
<P> ``I have a pro-life record. It's a very divisive issue. I'm not one to try to split our party. I want to make our party grow and attract Democrats and independents and not drive Republicans away from our party,'' he said. </P>
<P> Dole said he was backing legislation to repeal the ban on 19 semi-automatic assault weapons included in last year's crime bill because gun control laws were ineffective. President Clinton has promised to veto any bill that repeals the ban. </P>
<P> ``Law-abiding citizens don't hurt people. The assault weapons (ban) sounds good, but in reality it doesn't work,'' he said. Dole said he wanted a nationwide instant background check for all gun sales to keep criminals from getting guns. </P>
