<P>  A paraplegic Hong Kong man, robbed of money he had saved to buy an electric wheelchair, got the cash back from a government-administered charitable fund Friday. </P>
<P> Civil servants at Hong Kong's Social Welfare Department also held a collection for the victim, a government spokesman said. </P>
<P> Law Ka-man, 40, was robbed at knifepoint of $3,850 as he emerged from the lift of his block of apartments Thursday, the final day of the Chinese New Year holiday. </P>
<P> He had insisted on carrying the cash around with him because he feared burglars would rob his home when he was out. </P>
<P> Law had already made $2,500 as a deposit on the electric wheelchair. </P>
<P> ``Now it's all gone and I guess I'll lose the deposit money as well,'' a despondent Law had told reporters after the attack. </P>
