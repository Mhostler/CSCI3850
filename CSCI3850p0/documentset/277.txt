<P>  A powerful explosion, believed to be a bomb, ripped through a building in central Buenos Aires housing Jewish offices, injuring several people, radio and television reports said Monday. </P>
<P> In Jerusalem, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said the explosion in a building that houses offices of the Israeli-Argentine Mutual Association was a ``terrorist'' attack. </P>
<P> ``We are shocked to the depth of our soul from the collapse of the building ... which contained the offices of the Jewish community in Buenos Aires,'' Peres told reporters. </P>
<P> ``We are worried about what happened. It appears that there was an anti-Semitic and anti-Israeli hand in this event but we still do not have details or proof,'' he said. </P>
<P> Asked if he was certain the explosion was a ``terrorist attack,'' Peres replied: ``Yes, definitely.'' </P>
<P> Two years ago 30 people were killed when a bomb exploded in the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires. Monday's blast coincided with the start of peace talks between Israel and Jordan on their desert border. </P>
<P> But Deputy Foreign Minister Yossi Beilin told Army Radio, ``Those who think these actions can hurt or stop the peace process are mistaken.'' </P>
<P> The explosion Monday morning blew out several floors of the building, reducing it to a shell. Television pictures showed rescue workers pulling several people who appeared to be seriously injured from the wreckage. </P>
<P> ``This is barbarous, it's terrible,'' Carlos Corach, an aide to President Carlos Menem, told a local radio station. </P>
<P> A representative in Argentina of the Palestine Liberation Organization, interviewed by Radio America, also condemned the explosion. </P>
