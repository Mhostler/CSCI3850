<P> By Randall Mikkelsen  The grieving surrogate mother of an infant boy allegedly killed by his father charged Thursday that the father's background was insufficiently checked. </P>
<P> The mother, Phyllis Huddleston, also urged that women considering serving as a surrogate mother ensure that the child's adoptive family is thoroughly investigated. </P>
<P> ``I am having a very difficult time handling this situation and coping with the fact that my child was (allegedly) beaten to death by his father,'' Huddleston, of Lafayette, Ind., said in a statement released by her lawyer. </P>
<P> It was her first public statement since the Jan. 17 death of the 5-week-old boy named Jonathan at a Philadelphia hospital. The case has drawn several calls for greater regulation of the commerical surrogate parenting business. </P>
<P> ``I am very angry that my son was put into the hands of a man who, after more in-depth study, might have proven he was unstable and not ready to handle the responsibilities of a child,'' Huddleston said. </P>
<P> ``To all other surrogate mothers out there, present and future, make sure you get an attorney to protect your rights; and get counseling before, during and after, and make sure there is a complete check of the adopting family, especially psychologically,'' she said. </P>
<P> The boy's father, 26-year-old James Austin of Bethlehem, Pa., pleaded innocent Monday to a charge of criminal homicide in the the boy's death. A medical examiner ruled the boy's death was a murder and that the cause was severe head injuries. </P>
<P> Austin, who is unmarried, had paid $30,000 to the Indianapolis-based Infertility Center of America to arrange for a surrogate mother to bear the child. Huddleston was artificially inseminated with Austin's sperm. </P>
<P> Austin said in a taped statement to police played at a preliminary hearing this week that he had repeatedly struck and shaken the child to stop him from crying. </P>
<P> Huddleston said in her statement that she had become a surrogate mother ``with the best intentions of giving a childless family a child to love.'' </P>
<P> She said she had assumed the infertility center would take steps to ensure the child would be well-cared for much as an adoption agency would. </P>
<P> The Infertility Center of America did not return a call seeking comment, continuing its long silence on the case. </P>
