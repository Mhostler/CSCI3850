<P>  The Philippines Wednesday accused China of breaking international law by stationing armed vessels and detaining Filipino fishermen in an area in the disputed Spratly Islands claimed by Manila. </P>
<P> Philippine President Fidel Ramos said his defense department had photographs proving the Chinese intrusion and said he had ordered the strengthening of Filipino forces in the area. </P>
<P> The accusation heightened a six-nation territorial dispute over the islands in the South China Sea, long regarded as a potential Asian flashpoint. </P>
<P> Ramos told a news conference the aerial photographs showed apparent armaments on the decks of the Chinese ships and ``steel-supported structures'' built on a small coral reef called Mischief Shoal. </P>
<P> The reef is in the small Kalayaan (Freedomland) group which Manila regards as Philippine territory. </P>
<P> The Department of Foreign Affairs sent a ``very firm aide memoire'' -- short of a formal protest -- to the Chinese Embassy expressing serious concern, Ramos said. </P>
<P> A Chinese Embassy spokesman in Manila, quoting what he said were Chinese military sources, denied that the Chinese Navy had set up a base or detained Filipinos in the disputed area. </P>
<P> Spokesman Deng Xijun said a ``shelter structure'' had been put up in the area by a Chinese fisheries administrative department but this was ``to guarantee the lives of fishermen working in the waters of Nansha islands,'' as Beijing refers to the Spratlys. </P>
<P> The Spratlys are a cluster of low-lying isles, reefs and shoals in the South China Sea believed to be rich in oil and minerals. </P>
<P> They are claimed wholly or in part by China, Vietnam, Taiwan, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei. </P>
<P> Ramos' announcement followed renewed appeals from the Philippines and Vietnam for rival claimants in the Spratlys not to take any action that would disturb the tenuous peace in the area. </P>
<P> ``The Philippines views these actions taken by elements identified with the People's Republic of China as inconsistent with international law and the spirit and intent of the 1992 Manila ASEAN Declaration to which both the Philippines and the People's Republic of China are parties,'' Ramos said. </P>
<P> ``This is not just a bilateral concern of the Philippines but a multilateral concern of all claimants and parties interested in the stability of the South China Sea and the east Asia region as a whole,'' Ramos said. </P>
<P> He said he had briefed congressional leaders about the Chinese action and called a National Security Council meeting on February 15 to assess the situation. </P>
<P> The 1992 declaration by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) calls for a negotiated solution to the rival claims over the Spratlys. </P>
<P> Three of the Spratlys claimants -- the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei -- are members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which also includes Indonesia, Thailand and Singapore. </P>
<P> The Spratlys row erupted into a shooting war between the navies of China and Vietnam in 1988. Three Vietnamese boats were sunk and 72 Vietnamese sailors were killed in the clashes. </P>
