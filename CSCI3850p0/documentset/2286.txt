<P>  The family of a British couple sentenced to 28 months in jail for trying to smuggle a baby out of Romania expressed relief Friday that President Ion Iliescu would probably pardon them. </P>
<P> ``We are very grateful to President Iliescu for making this gesture and we are all very, very happy,'' said Eunice Chimes, mother of Adrian Mooney, 42 who was convicted with his wife Bernadette, 40, on Oct. 14 under tough adoption laws. </P>
<P> Iliescu's spokesman Traian Chebeleu said earlier the president was considering a pardon for the Mooneys once their appeal had been heard on Nov. 9. </P>
<P> ``After the final sentence the Romanian president is ready to intervene using his constitutional prerogatives to consider a pardon for the Mooneys,'' Chebeleu said. </P>
<P> The Mooneys were the first foreigners prosecuted under adoption laws introduced in 1992 to end baby-trafficking after the fall of communism in 1989 revealed that tens of thousands of abandoned children were living in filthy orphanages. </P>
<P> The couple were arrested at the Hungarian border July 6 with Monica, a five-month-old gypsy girl, hidden in their car. They are now on bail awaiting their appeal. </P>
<P> The court was told that they paid a middleman $6,000 to find the baby. Monicas birth parents say they got $500. In Britain authorities had ruled that the Mooneys were to old to adopt. </P>
