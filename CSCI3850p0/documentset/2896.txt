<DATELINE>RUTSHURU, Zaire (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Hundreds of sullen Hutu refugees from Rwanda, forced out of scattered settlements, trudged Tuesday toward official camps where the Zairean army has vowed to keep them. </P>
<P> At a former unofficial camp near Rutshuru, all that was left Tuesday were the charred frames of huts and straw mats and cooking pots abandoned on the wet grass. </P>
<P> ``This may seem a cruel exercise but it's the only way to control these people. We are going to get all of them into established centers,'' a Zairean army captain told Reuters. </P>
<P> The Zairean crackdown -- described as ``brutal'' by aid workers in the area -- was spurred by clashes last week between the army and refugees that left 26 Rwandans and a Zairean soldier dead.. </P>
<P> Relief workers and U.N. troops are meanwhile scouring the filthy warrens of the refugee camps for a missing British aid worker and four Zairean staff. </P>
<P> And the Zaireans are also hunting down refugee political and militia leaders they blame for crime in the area and for bloodshed at Katale camp Thursday and Saturday -- the worst since a flood of Hutu refugees crossed the frontier from Rwanda in July. </P>
<P> If they can be found among the 600,000 refugees in the area, the Hutu leaders will be sent back to Rwanda, where the victors of this year's civil war hold them accountable for the massacre of up to a million people, mostly members of the Tutsi minority. </P>
<P> Thirty-seven Rwandans suspected of crime and violence were sent back Sunday, drawing protests from U.N. refugee officials who said they should not be forced to return to a country where they fear for their lives. </P>
<P> Some aid workers in the area say privately that measures taken by Zaire are harsh but are the only way. </P>
<P> Hardened Hutu leaders maintain effective control over the refugees and have little to fear but the threat of being sent back to face Rwanda's new, Tutsi-dominated government. </P>
<P> ``They brought this on themselves and since the crackdown we've seen them behave properly,'' an aid worker told Reuters. </P>
