<P>  Adolph Coors Co, the nation's third largest brewer, Wednesday announced severe restrictions on workers drinking at the brewery but said the change was not a direct result of a fatal accident last April. </P>
<P> Effective Monday, employees will be allowed to drink for 30 minutes after the end of their shift and be limited to two 12-ounce bottles, said company spokesman Joe Fuentes. </P>
<P> Previously, workers at the Golden, Colorado-based brewer, did not have a limit and could drink during their lunch break as well. </P>
<P> ``We're the last major brewer that allows drinking on the premises,'' he said. ``What did not change is that the key is still individual responsibility,'' he said. </P>
<P> In April, a Coors employee was killed when his car rammed into a tree on Coors property after he was seen drinking at the end of his shift. </P>
<P> Fuentes said before April that employees had recommended the beer drinking policy be reviewed. A task force examined the issue during the summer. </P>
