<P>  Ecuadorean President Sixto Duran Ballen, whose government is highly unpopular, faces a newly hostile Congress as he seeks to push through ambitious economic reforms. </P>
<P> Analysts told Reuters the progress of Ecuador's free market reforms might be jeopardized by the incoming opposition-dominated Congress. </P>
<P> The new legislature is to be sworn in Wednesday, at the halfway mark of Duran's four-year presidential term. </P>
<P> Duran, 73, will now only be to rely on support from 10 of the 77 members of the one-chamber Congress following last Nay's parliamentary election which crushed government backers. </P>
<P> As a result, Duran's privatization program and a number other economic bills run the risk of being tossed aside by the legislature, said economic analyst Walter Spurrier. </P>
<P> At stake are the telecommunications and the electric sector bills, which contemplate the privatization of the state-run local telephone company EMETEL and the opening of the electricity industry to foreign investors. </P>
<P> Also, the new Congress must vote on the reform of the health and pensions social security system of this oil exporting country, which left OPEC in December 1992 after failing to pay membership fees. </P>
<P> One Andean diplomat added the new Congress will approve very few government bills. </P>
<P> ``Due to the low popularity of the administration, there will not be too many legislators willing to link themselves with the reform program,'' the diplomat said. </P>
<P> On taking office in 1992, Duran launched a though economic reform program that included a dramatic rise in gasoline prices to hike tax revenues and severe budget cutbacks. </P>
<P> The measures have begun to bear fruit and the economy is showing signs of recovery, with a halving of the annual inflation rate to about 31 percent. </P>
<P> And Ecuador, which suspended debt payments in 1992, is expected to reach in October an accord with creditor banks to restructure $7.58 billion of its foreign commercial debt. </P>
<P> The administration's woes are by aggravated by Duran's unpopularity, one of the highest such levels of a president since Ecuador returned to democracy 15 yearws ago. </P>
<P> Recent polls say about 80 percent of the population rejects Duran's handling of the administration and feels he is too old for the job. </P>
<P> ``He is seen by the public as the grandfather that doesn't know what he is doing and with whom you get angry, but can't do anything to hurt him,'' said a spokesman for the private polling firm Informe Confidencial. </P>
<P> ``People reject the handling of the economy, but don't think that Duran is responsible. People tend to think that those who surround the president manipulate him and do whatever they want,'' he said. </P>
