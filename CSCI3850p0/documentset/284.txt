<DATELINE>PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  U.S. officials said Monday they were working to maintain an escape route for Haitian political refugees, as the grisly discovery of three severed heads intensified fears of political murders. </P>
<P> Meanwhile, Haiti's army-backed government says it has launched diplomatic moves to try to end the 33-month-old political crisis and head off the threat of a military invasion. </P>
<P> ``We have opened several channels,'' Charles David, Haiti's de facto foreign minister, told a small group of reporters. ``I hope that this week will be a decisive week.'' </P>
<P> David refused to give details of the initiatives but said the moves involve international players. Sources close to the army-backed regime said he could be referring to plans by the regime to seek an audience at the United Nations. </P>
<P> Three rotting human heads were found in an open sewer in the popular neighborhood of Cite St Marten, residents told independent Radio Tropic FM. </P>
<P> People in the area near the center of Port-au-Prince said they could not identify the heads, Tropic FM said. There was no sign of any other body parts. </P>
<P> The gruesome discovery marked the first known instance where heads were cut from bodies and dumped separately. It was not known if the murders were political but it among the most macabre incidents since March when pro-military gunmen began cutting the faces of their political opponents after killing them. </P>
<P> Embassy spokesman Stan Schrager said the United States intends to keep flying approved political refugees out of Haiti following the impending cutoff of commercial travel to and from Haiti. ``We'll probably have to turn to charters,'' Schrager told Reuters. </P>
<P> Air France announced last week that it would halt service to Haiti at the end of July. This would complete the internationally imposed isolation aimed at forcing Haiti's military-backed leadership to leave office and restoring power to President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, ousted in a 1991 coup. </P>
<P> Schrager said about 400 Haitians have been granted final travel clearance by U.S. immigration officials. Many of them can be accommodated on the remaining Air France flights, including one Wednesday that will take 156 political refugees out of Haiti. </P>
<P> But another 600 Haitians who have been granted political refugee status are awaiting final travel clearance. In the lobby of an old movie theater here and at two other sites, new applications continue at a rate of about 85-90 per day. </P>
<P> ``We have no intention of closing the program,'' said a U.S. embassy official working on refugee affairs. </P>
<P> The United States has stopped granting asylum to those who flee the country by boat. It now offers to take boat people to a safe haven in a third country or repatriate them to Haiti, and will consider political refugee status only for those who apply in Haiti. </P>
<P> Officials last week reported declines in the numbers of Haitians attempting the dangerous escape by boat. </P>
<P> ``It (a charter flight program) would be very important, since they have been telling (Haitians) not to get on a boat and telling them they have a better chance with in-country processing,'' said Emily Hall, a U.S. attorney who advises Haitians seeking asylum. </P>
<P> Schrager said it would be necessary to obtain permission to operate the charter flights from the military-backed government, which the United States refuses to recognize. </P>
<P> But he said there have been no indications that such clearance would be rejected, and said he was confident the United Nations would also grant needed permission to operate the charter flights. </P>
<P> The Jonassaint administration also underwent its first reshuffle since it was installed by the army on May 11 with ministerial changes at interior and defense and planning. </P>
<P> The government announced Monday that Carl Nicolas would replace Willio Nouailles as Minister of Defense and Interior and that Wilfred Saint-Julien would take over from Emmanuel Ford at the head of the Planning Ministry. Officials disclosed no reason for the reshuffle. </P>
<P> Nicolas is a former general who served in uniform under the Duvalier regime and Saint-Julien is a civil engineer. </P>
<P> The de facto government has come under increasing pressure during the past month, with U.S. warships cruising nearby waters and U.S. military airplanes flying overhead to broadcast pro-democracy messages. </P>
<P> Throughout the capital, signs of the army's tight control remained evident. </P>
<P> At parliament, civilian workers began constructing a concrete block wall to surround the building to provide greater security. The wall could be seen above an existing eight-foot wall that already rings the parliament. </P>
<P> Uniformed police and soldiers patrolled downtown streets while others guarded the front doors of some schools, as students began a week-long series of final exams. </P>
