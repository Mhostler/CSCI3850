<P>  A former Mexican prosecutor who faced accusations this week of a cover-up in the investigation he headed into the murder of his brother, a top Mexican politician, was arrested Friday in the United States for violating U.S. Customs laws. </P>
<P> ``He was arrested for failure to declare currency,'' U.S. Customs Service spokesman Steve Duschesne said Saturday. ``Mr. Mario Ruiz Massieu declared $18,000 but a customs inspection found that he possessed $46,000 worth of U.S. and Mexican currency.'' </P>
<P> Ruiz Massieu was arrested at N.J.'s Newark International Airport following a search of his carry-on bags as he prepared to board a flight to Madrid, said a statement from the office of the U.S. Attorney, District of New Jersey. </P>
<P> Under U.S. law, people entering or leaving the country must declare currency in excess of $10,000. </P>
<P> Duschesne said Riuz Massieu is being held by U.S. Customs in New Jersey and will be arraigned Monday. If convicted, he could receive up to five years in prison, a fine of up to $250,000 or both. </P>
<P> Ruiz Massieu left Mexico Thursday after a six-hour grilling in the attorney general's office, where he defended himself from accusations he had covered up the alleged role of former president Carlos Salinas de Gortari's brother, Raul, in the murder of his own brother, Francisco. </P>
<P> Raul Salinas was arrested Tuesday on charges he masterminded the killing of Francisco Ruiz Massieu, secretary-general of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party. Francisco Ruiz Massieu was shot outside a Mexico City hotel last September. </P>
<P> In a statement Friday, Mario Ruiz Massieu denied newspaper reports he fled his country and said he left Mexico for speaking engagements at U.S. universities. </P>
