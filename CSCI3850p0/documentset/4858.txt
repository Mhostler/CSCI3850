<P>  Algerian security forces have killed 20,000 Muslim militants over the past two and a half years, Junior Interior Minister Noureddine Kasdalli was quoted as saying Saturday. </P>
<P> Algeria's main Arab-language newspaper Al Khabar also quoted the minister as saying that armed militant groups mustered between 3,000 and 4,000 men. </P>
<P> It was believed to be the first time a government official had given a figure for the number of militants killed in the three-year-old war. Last week the government said more than 6,000 civilians had been killed in 1994, giving credence to estimates by opposition politicians of a total of 40,000 dead since 1992. </P>
<P> In line with recent government policy, the minister did not say how many casualties had been inflicted on the security forces. </P>
<P> Western diplomats estimated late last year that 30,000 people had been killed in the conflict, which exploded after the military-backed government cancelled elections in January 1992 that Islamic fundamentalists had been poised to win. </P>
<P> Giving the latest militant death toll, the official Algerian news agency APS said security forces shot dead 44 rebels between Tuesday and Thursday in operations in 11 towns. </P>
<P> Four men were killed in the Algiers suburb of Benzerga where an 18-year-old Palestinian student had his throat cut a week ago in an attack by about 15 armed men. </P>
<P> A car bomb exploded in a suburb of Algiers Friday wounding at least 60 people and causing heavy damage. Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi said most of the injured were policemen's families, women and children. </P>
<P> The bomb, in the Muslim fundamentalist bastion of Kouba on the heights of the Algerian capital, was the second in less than six weeks. The previous bomb killed at least 42 people and wounded nearly 300. </P>
