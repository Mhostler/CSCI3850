<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The U.S. Justice Department Saturday denied a newspaper report that federal authorities foiled an apparent ``terrorist'' plan for a Japanese-style gas attack on Disneyland amusement park over Easter.  The Baltimore Sun in its Saturday editions quoted unnamed federal officials as saying the suspected attack was interrupted when two Japanese travelers were picked up at Los Angeles International Airport. </P>
<P> The Sun said the two Japanese men were picked up shortly before Easter after Tokyo police alerted the FBI that they were flying in. The paper said it did not know the current status of the two men. </P>
<P> According to the newspaper, the two were associated with the cult Aum Shinri Kyo which is suspected of releasing Sarin nerve gas into the Tokyo subway last month killing 12 people. The sect has denied any links to the attack. </P>
<P> In Washington, a Justice Department spokesman denied the report, but said it was not unusual for Disneyland to receive anonymous threats of such attacks. </P>
<P> The Sun story said federal officials had not denied the information but said they could not discuss that sort of case or any current investigation. An FBI spokesman, Paul Bresson said there would be ``no official comment at this time.'' </P>
