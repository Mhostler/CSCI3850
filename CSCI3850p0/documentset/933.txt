<P>  Steve Lowery had gone seven years without winning, so it was only fitting he had to go one extra playoff hole to win for the first time in his pro career by beating Rick Fehr in sudden death to win the International Sunday. </P>
<P> After finishing regulation play tied with 35 points in the tournament's unique Stableford scoring system, Lowery held his nerves together to win with a par-4 on the ninth play-off of his career. </P>
<P> ``The most nervous I was all day was during the playoff, but I told myself to embrace the pressure and trust my golf swing,'' said Lowery, who won $252,000 of the $1.4 million purse. ``It is such a feeling of accomplishment to win at last, to mentally overcome that barrier. Physically, I've known for a long time that I had the game to do it.'' </P>
<P> While Lowery kept his composure, U.S. Open champion Ernie Els surprisingly lost his as the third-round leader had a double bogey on the 10th hole and a bogey on the 14th as he fell into fourth place with 33 points.  The South African still could have joined the playoff with a birdie on the final hole, but missed the 15-foot putt. Nevertheless his finish was his fourth in the top 10 on the U.S. PGA Tour this year. </P>
<P> The Stableford system awards +5 points for eagles, +2 for birdies, and no points for par. One point is deducted for bogey, three points for double bogey or higher. </P>
