<P>  French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's attempt to impose a cease-fire on his feuding conservative coalition was in shambles Wednesday, just 24 hours after he called it. </P>
<P> Balladur read the riot act to ministers Tuesday, saying their public squabbling was damaging the government's image and urging them to wait until January to start campaigning for the 1995 presidential election. </P>
<P> The riposte was swift. The newsletter of his presidential rival, Gaullist RPR party leader Jacques Chirac, accused Balladur's supporters Wednesday of launching a disinformation campaign aimed at forcing Chirac to drop out of the race. </P>
<P> Sniping between their rival supporters broke out anew in the corridors of parliament. </P>
<P> RPR deputy general secretary Eric Raoult, a Chirac loyalist, accused the prime minister of double-talk, saying he was trying to gag Chirac supporters while giving free rein to his own. </P>
<P> ``Yesterday, ministers were told to shut up. Yet one of them (Defense Minister Francois Leotard) went on television right afterwards and said Balladur was his choice,'' he told reporters. </P>
<P> ``If it's the end of playtime, then it must be the end of playtime for everyone. You can't talk double,'' Raoult said. </P>
<P> The prime minister's office took the unusual step of publishing a letter he sent to Chirac and ex-president Valery Giscard d'Estaing, leader of the center-right Union for French Democracy (UDF), complaining about disputes in the coalition. </P>
<P> Issued before either leader had had a chance to reply, the text said: ``I am sure you agree with me that things cannot go on as they have been for the last few weeks without discrediting the coalition.'' </P>
<P> But Giscard d'Estaing batted the ball back into the Gaullist court with a curt statement saying there was no reason to blame the UDF for political agitation in which it had no part. And Chirac's aides said they were in no hurry to respond. </P>
<P> Government spokesman Nicolas Sarkozy and leading Balladur supporters have issued repeated warnings that the coalition's public squabbling was triggering what they call ``the losing machine'' which led the Right to lose the last two presidential elections. </P>
