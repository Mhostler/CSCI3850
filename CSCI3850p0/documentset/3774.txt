<P>  Cambodian First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh said Sunday his government would still welcome Khmer Rouge defectors despite the expiry today of a rebel amnesty. </P>
<P> ``I think that we still encourage them to defect but they will not benefit from the full amnesty like the one provided by the law. It's up to the National Assembly to decide about it,'' Ranariddh told reporters. </P>
<P> Information Minister Ieng Mouly said in a statement that rebels defecting after the amnesty deadline which expired on Sunday would not be entitled to material assistance, nor given the option of joining the government armed forces. </P>
<P> After the deadline passed, Khmer Rouge rebels captured by the government would be automatically charged under a law providing for prison terms of up to 30 years for acts of secession and incitement to take up arms, Mouly said in the statement. </P>
<P> Cambodia's parliament last July overwhelmingly voted to outlaw the Khmer Rouge faction, but offered a six-month amnesty as an inducement to waverers. </P>
<P> According to government figures more than 5,000 Khmer Rouge fighters and an equal number of civilian supporters have defected to the government side since Jan. 1. </P>
<P> There has been no independent confirmation of the claim. </P>
<P> The amnesty did not include senior Khmer Rouge leaders such as Pol Pot, Ieng Sary, defense chief Son Sen, and the northern zone commander, Ta Mok, also known as the ``Butcher.'' </P>
<P> The Khmer Rouge were responsible for the deaths of one million Cambodians during their reign of terror from 1975 to 1978. They boycotted U.N.-sponsored elections in May 1993 and have continued to wage a low-level guerrilla war in support of their own ``provisional government.'' </P>
