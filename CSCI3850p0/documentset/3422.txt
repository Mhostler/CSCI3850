<P>  Guns fell silent overnight in the Chechen capital Grozny where officials said Russian forces had been unable to surround the city after a day of fierce battles on the outskirts. </P>
<P> Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, vice-president of breakaway Chechnya, was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying Grozny was calm during the night and there were no Russian air raids. </P>
<P> But he said he feared there had been many casualties from a series of air raids on the city Saturday. </P>
<P> Chechen officials, quoted by a local journalist, said at least 25 people were killed. </P>
<P> Saturday's air raids plunged Grozny deeper into chaos, disrupting telephone lines and damaging electricity and water supplies. </P>
<P> Moscow telephone operators said lines to Chechnya were cut. </P>
<P> Interfax said 80 percent of Chechnya was without electricity and that gas supplies to nearly half of the mountainous north Caucasus republic had been disrupted. </P>
