<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Clinton has approved a secret contingency plan that authorizes unspecified political activities to neutralize the opponents of exile Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the New York Times reported in its Wednesday editions. </P>
<P> Quoting senior administration officials, the newspaper said the $5 million plan authorizes the CIA to spend $1 million on propaganda activities to help ease Aristide's return and to use covert means to protect American forces there from hostile military groups, the officials added. </P>
<P> Clinton administration officials briefed key U.S. legislators last Wednesday about Clinton's order as required by law. </P>
<P> Since then, the CIA has begun to use some of the $1 million marked for propaganda for covert radio broadcasts and to penetrate military groups that might seek to harm American troops. </P>
<P> The administration officials briefing Congress told lawmakers one goal was to ``create a political climate'' that would help put into effect the agreement that former U.S. President Jimmy Carter reached with Lieutenant General Raoul Cedras, Haiti's military leader, on September 18. </P>
<P> Under the agreement, General Cedras and other military leaders must relinquish power after the parliament approves a general amnesty or by October 15, whichever comes earlier. </P>
<P> A number of lawmakers said they were convinced that under the covert operation pro-military legislators elected under disputed circumstances could be paid off to step aside, and the CIA had the authority to pay expenses, provide security or give other incentives to parliamentarians who do not want to vote for the amnesty. </P>
<P> But senior administration officials familiar told the New York Times the order did not authorize the CIA to bribe officials or try influence the vote on amnesty. </P>
