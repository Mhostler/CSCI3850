<P>  Because of widespread misuse of child safety seats in cars, federal officials Monday announced the formation of a committee to find ways the seats can be made easier to install and use. </P>
<P> National Highway Traffic Safety Administrator Ricardo Martinez said his office has had numerous complaints of safety seats being hard to install and use, adding ``It's time for real solutions for real people.'' </P>
<P> ``Routine safety equipment -- something that is required by law in all 50 states -- something that gives kids their best chance of surviving a crash -- should be unequivocally easy to install and convenient to use,'' he said. </P>
<P> A panel that included safety seat makers, a pediatric physician and parents would try to find ways to resolve the problems now faced in using child safety seats. </P>
<P> Martinez said federal officials would not attend the meetings so the regulated industries involved could candidly discuss and agree on solutions. </P>
<P> The panel is to come up with recommendations by June 1. </P>
<P> NHTSA estimated that 40 percent of children ride without restraints and at least 25 percent ride in safety seats that are seriously misused. </P>
<P> It said that of the 615 child passengers who died in 1993, 362 were unrestrained and that more than half could have been saved if they been in a correctly used child safety seat. </P>
