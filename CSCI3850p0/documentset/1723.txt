<P>  Despite strong U.S. objections, the Security Council Friday renewed for one month the mandate of U.N. troops in Somalia. </P>
<P> The vote was 14-0 with the United States abstaining because the resolution did not set a date to shut down the entire 18,000-strong operation. </P>
<P> Instead, the resolution asks Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to continue contingency arrangements for a possible withdrawal, and promised to evaluate the situation again within a month. </P>
<P> It also said the council was considering sending a delegation to Somalia to warn factions one last time to move toward political reconciliation before plans to withdraw were made final. </P>
<P> Many council members and U.N. officials have been in anguish over the demise of the Somalia mission which started in April 1992 and has failed to bring peace among feuding clans or establish any kind of a functioning government. </P>
<P> Bakuramutsa Manzi, Rwanda's new ambassador, warned the council to be careful about any precipitate action. </P>
<P> ``We request the Security Council and the secretary-general avoid another Rwanda -- from which we have not recovered,'' he said, referring to a pullout of peacekeepers as massacres increased in his country. </P>
<P> But U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright said ``the time has come to bring this U.N. mission to a conclusion.'' </P>
<P> ``UNOSOM is draining away scarce human and financial resources that would be better used by the international community elsewhere. </P>
<P> ``In the face of Somali intransigence and unwillingness to reach political agreement UNOSOM cannot continue to maintain 15,000 troops in Somalia and spent over $2.5 million a day,'' she said. </P>
<P> Unfortunately, Albright said, there had been two constants in Somalia: continuing deterioration of the security situation and lack of progress on political position. </P>
<P> She said the United States was ready to help UNOSOM withdraw safely. </P>
<P> Albright objected to council members who hoped another conference in October would bring political reconciliation. </P>
<P> ``Looking at the train of broken promises left by the Somali factions, my government will not listen to another assurance of just one more month, just one more conference.'' </P>
<P> Efforts by U.S. and U.N. officials to convince General Mohamed Farah Aideed, one of the strongest factional leaders, to make peace with the other 12 clans or factions have failed, particularly in Mogadishu. </P>
<P> More than 100 peacekeepkers, including 36 Americans, have been killed in Somalia since April, 1992. The deaths of 12 Americans nearly a year ago prompted a pullout of U.S. troops, with fighting escalating again after their departure. </P>
