<DATELINE>PARIS, March 20 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev attacked NATO plans to take in former Soviet satellite states as dangerous on Monday, three days before he meets U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher for talks on the issue. </P>
<P> Kozyrev told a conference on stability in Europe that individual nations had the right to decide whether to join the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). </P>
<P> But he said a rush to extend NATO, rather than building wider security structures to include all European states, would recreate Cold War divisions and a confrontation mentality. </P>
<P> ``Why rush things if we run the risk of creating new lines of division?'' he asked, repeating earlier criticisms. </P>
<P> ``Whatever one may think of NATO, it's still a military alliance which was created when Europe was divided. It should be replaced by a new model based on comprehensive security.'' </P>
<P> Kozyrev is due to meet Christopher in Geneva on Thursday and Russia's troubled relations with NATO, as well as the crisis in former Yugoslavia, will top the agenda. </P>
<P> Alarmed at the prospect of NATO soon admitting countries like Poland and Hungary, Moscow refused last December to sign a partnership deal with the alliance and has repeatedly criticised the plans for enlargement. </P>
<P> ``The gap between NATO's very active moves to studying potential enlargement and its passive attitude in developing this new model of comprehensive security is a very wide one and it could be dangerous,'' Kozyrev said. </P>
<P> But Kozyrev said he hoped to find ``responses to some of the challenges of today's world'' with Christopher. Both the United States and Russia were committed to strengthening their partnership. </P>
<P> He said the stability pact on borders and the protection of ethnic minorities, approved by more than 50 nations in Paris on Monday, had ``disproved the notion of Central and Eastern Europe as a kind of grey zone where a security vacuum exists.'' </P>
<P> European Union foreign ministers have offered Russia a long-term special relationship with the West if it overcomes problems in Chechnya and drops its objections to NATO expansion. </P>
<P> At talks in the southern French town of Carcassonne on Sunday, they said NATO should negotiate a deal with Moscow that would create a consultation mechanism in crises, regular political dialogue and a mutual non-aggression pledge. </P>
<P> ``I think it's possible to enlarge NATO in a way that would be reassuring to Russia...that may take an extended period of time,'' British Foreign Office minister Douglas Hogg told reporters at the Paris conference on Monday. </P>
<P> ``Russia clearly has no veto (over NATO expansion) but we need to take account of their interests.'' </P>
