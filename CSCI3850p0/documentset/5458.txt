<DATELINE>CHICAGO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Former two-sport star Bo Jackson announced his retirement from baseball, saying he wished to spend more time with his family and pursue an acting career. </P>
<P> ``It's official,'' said Susann McKee, Jackson's business manager. ``He has officially retired from baseball as of yesterday (Monday). </P>
<P> ``He has been pursuing his acting career since the start of the strike. He also has other business interests he's pursuing and obligations to his family.'' </P>
<P> The 32-year-old Jackson told USA Today that during the nearly eight-month baseball strike, ``I got to know my family ... that looks better to me than any $10 million contract.'' </P>
<P> Jackson, who played for the California Angels last season, said he had received calls ``from five or six clubs''. </P>
<P> ``Enough is enough, I'm retiring. It was great while it lasted. But it's over now. As of April 3, I'm retired from pro sports,'' said Jackson, who became famous with a series of commercials featuring his versatile athletic ability and the catch phrase ``Bo Knows.'' </P>
<P> Jackson retired from football after suffering a serious hip injury during the 1991 playoffs with the Los Angeles Raiders. </P>
<P> The former Heisman Trophy-winning running back from Auburn began his baseball career with the Kansas City Royals, underwent hip replacement surgery after his football injury and returned to baseball with the Chicago White Sox. </P>
<P> Jackson, who earned millions from his ads for Nike and Pepsi, enjoyed his best season in 1989 with Kansas City when he had career highs with 32 homers, 105 runs batted in, 132 hits and 86 runs. </P>
<P> Jackson also had his best NFL season in 1989 with the Raiders, rushing for 950 yards and four touchdowns in 11 games. He spent four years with the Raiders from 1987-91. </P>
<P> Jackson missed the entire 1992 season after undergoing reconstructive hip surgery that forced his retirement from football. He returned to the White Sox in 1993 and hit .232 with 16 homers and 45 RBI in 85 games. </P>
<P> He signed with California as a free agent in 1994 and batted .279 with 13 homers and 43 RBI. </P>
<P> Jackson, who homered in four consecutive at-bats in 1990, has hit 141 homers and driven in 415 runs in 694 major league games. </P>
