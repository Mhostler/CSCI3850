<DATELINE>KIKWIT, Zaire (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  At first sight, it's just another sprawling African town, half-hidden by palm trees on the fringe of a tropical rain forest. </P>
<P> The streets are bustling, the markets packed with people shopping for food. </P>
<P> Yet this Zairean town of 500,000 people is where one of the most lethal diseases known to man, infection with the Ebola virus, resurfaced in March. The anxiety and fear here lie just beneath the surface. </P>
<P> Zaire's top virologist, Jacques Muyembe, who has been in Kikwit since the start of May, says more deaths than the 48 already recorded out of 65 cases in Kikwit and three other towns -- Mosango, Vanga and Kenge -- are inevitable. </P>
<P> But so far there are no signs of the apocalyptic vision portrayed in the film ``Outbreak,'' Hollywood's latest offering on a doomsday virus outbreak in, yes, Zaire. </P>
<P> The thriller, which stars Dustin Hoffman and Donald Sutherland and which hit cinema screens around the world this year, opens with shots of the ravages of a mystery virus, men in hooded protective suits and the annihilation of an entire village. </P>
<P> In Kikwit, which is about 300 miles by road from the capital Kinshasa, the reality is more mundane. </P>
<P> The virus, experts say, spreads through contact with blood or bodily secretions and not in the air -- as was the case with the highly contagious pneumonic plague that ravaged parts of India last year. </P>
<P> The World Health Organization, which has experts in Zaire tracking the progress of the disease, is confident simple sanitary precautions can stop the spread of the virus -- tactics that stemmed outbreaks in Zaire in 1976 and 1979. </P>
<P> Many of the 42 dead in Kikwit were health workers in the town's 350-bed hospital. </P>
<P> Muyembe was at the center of efforts to contain the 1976 epidemic, which killed several hundred people, and heads a national task force dealing with the current scourge. </P>
<P> He says the latest outbreak is more serious than that in the village of Yambuku in 1976. </P>
<P> ``It is much more frightening, more serious in the sense that (Kikwit) is a town of more than 400,000 people,'' he said. </P>
<P> Muyembe said there were several stages of the epidemic. </P>
<P> ``We are now in the second phase and it is the second phase that will carry off many people. What we fear is the third phase. If there is a third phase it will be terrible.'' </P>
<P> The virus, which takes its name from a river in northern Zaire, kills up to nine out of every 10 victims. </P>
<P> ``People are panicking but what do you expect? People are dying every day,'' said Eric Medi, another Kikwit resident. ``People won't even shake hands.'' </P>
<P> ``It's very, very serious. In almost every quarter and almost every day people are dying,'' added Atanasse Yakala, expressing the fears of people in the town. </P>
<P> The deadly Ebola virus, which induces uncontrollable bleeding and is one of the most lethal diseases known to man, resurfaced here in March. </P>
<P> The first victim, a laboratory technician, died in April. </P>
<P> Anxious residents surged toward the airport's perimeter fence when an aging DC-3 aircraft arrived carrying reporters and a team of foreign experts. </P>
<P> The foreign experts, wearing protective clothing, are spearheading efforts to distribute surgical gloves and other protective clothing to contain the virus, for which there is no vaccine and no known cure. </P>
<P> The team of experts from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, the Institut Pasteur in France and South Africa's National Institute of Virology had no idea how long they would be in Zaire. </P>
<P> ``We'll see what happens,'' said Nigerian virologist Oyewale Tomori, coordinating the group's activity on behalf of WHO. ``Our mission is to prevent the disease spreading.'' </P>
<P> But their fight to stop the spread of the disease is a far cry from the scenario that unfolds in ``Outbreak.'' </P>
<P> Outside the Kikwit hospital, a nondescript single-story building, there is little evidence of the drama that has unfolded inside. </P>
<P> Members of the victims' families, some of them weeping, shuffle around in the dusty street, expecting the worst. </P>
<P> Despite the reassuring noises from Geneva and elsewhere fear and suspicion are rife. ``It's a serious problem. People who are not affected are scared,'' Medi commented. </P>
