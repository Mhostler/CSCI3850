<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  At least two people were killed and 46 injured Wednesday after an underground gas explosion turned a teeming business and residential district of central Seoul into an inferno, police and witnesses said. </P>
<P> Witnesses said a chain of blasts rocked the Ahyon area after gas leaked from a storage tank near a subway construction site and caught fire. The blaze ripped through the area, destroying dozens of homes and commercial buildings. </P>
<P> Panicked residents fled as flames reached up to 100 feet into the air, the heat making it difficult for fire fighters to approach. </P>
<P> ``We believe we have accounted for all the injured. We don't know now exactly how many might have died or may have been hurt,'' a police officer said at the scene. </P>
<P> He said the exact cause of the explosion was still unknown. </P>
<P> State-run Korea Broadcasting System (KBS) radio said one man and one woman had been confirmed dead, with four people still missing. </P>
<P> Witnesses said the fierce wall of flames burned everything in its path. </P>
<P> Hundreds of local residents were evacuated as clouds of black smoke shrouded the district. </P>
<P> The blast also shattered hundreds of windows in surrounding high-rise buildings. </P>
