<P>  Peru's first lady Susana Higuchi, stripped of her official duties by President Alberto Fujimori, said Wednesday she had no plans to abandon Government Palace. </P>
<P> Reporters who arrived at the presidential palace in central Lima for a midday press conference called by Higuchi a day earlier were not allowed to enter. </P>
<P> ``Under no circumstances'' would she abandon Government Palace, Higuchi said outside the palace, responding to reporters' questions as she passed out a written statement in which she called Fujimori's speech the night before ``totally false.'' </P>
<P> Higuchi, a 44-year-old construction engineer, is charged with running the Foundation for the Children of Peru. But the title of first lady is honorary and is not sanctioned by any law. </P>
<P> Living apart from her husband since early August after making public her opposition to a law banning her from running for office in next April's elections, Higuchi said she had no plans to separate from her husband. </P>
<P> She also rejected Fujimori's claim that she had delayed denouncing irregularities by government officials that became known to her and that when she finally did she failed to follow appropriate procedures. </P>
<P> ``(When they occurred), I communicated them directly to my husband, President of the Republic, so that he in turn would channel the accusations to the proper authorities,'' Higuchi said in her statement. </P>
<P> Higuchi, in a series of media interviews, has said government ministers and other officials appeared to be involved in cases of corruption. Over the past week, she has given testimony on the charges to an investigating prosecutor. </P>
<P> Higuchi also denied Fujimori's statements that she was surrounded by what he called ``unscrupulous'' advisers who had ''skillfully fed her political ambition'' to mount a campaign aimed at discrediting him. </P>
<P> ``I categorically reject these statements ... because he knows I have not surrounded myself with rare characters,'' she said. </P>
<P> The president, who for the last two weeks has been staying in Peru's army headquarters known as the ``Little Pentagon'' with three of their four children, made no reference in his speech to the presidential couple's marital status. </P>
<P> But Higuchi said: ``I should add I have not separated from my husband and I still remain Susana Higuchi de Fujimori.'' </P>
<P> A journalist for a local news magazine told Reuters that Higuchi told her after the speech that if Fujimori wanted to separate or seek a divorce he should do so formally and not announce it on the television. </P>
<P> The presidential couple reportedly has been experiencing marital problems for some time. </P>
