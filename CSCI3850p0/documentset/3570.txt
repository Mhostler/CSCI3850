<P>  The Vatican newspaper condemned as ''monstrous' the execution Wednesday of American Jesse Dewayne Jacobs and criticised the U.S. Supreme Court for not allowing the convicted murderer a new trial. </P>
<P> Jacobs, 44, was executed in Texas Wednesday by lethal injection for a 1986 murder which the prosecutor in the case subsequently said he may not have committed. </P>
<P> ``The execution (was)...not only incredible, but monstrous and absurd,'' Gino Concetti, a moral theologian whose views are close to those of Pope John Paul, said in an editorial about the controversial case in the semi-official Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano. </P>
<P> The execution, the first in Texas in 1995 and the 86th in the state since 1982, came hours after Jacobs' final bids for a reprieve were denied by the U.S. Supreme Court and outgoing Texas Governor Ann Richards. </P>
<P> Concetti compared the court's decision with that of Pontius Pilate, the Roman ruler under whom Jesus Christ was tried and who condemned Christ to death. </P>
<P> ``(The court) preferred the way of Pilate, by just washing its hands of the matter, just as the appeal court did,'' Concetti said in the editorial, headlined ``A Grave Defeat of Justice.'' </P>
<P> The Supreme Court argued in its decision that it could not overturn a jury's error. Concetti said such reasoning was pedantic and inhumane when a human life was involved. </P>
<P> Jacobs was condemned to death for the abduction and killing of Etta Ann Urdiales, the former wife of his sister's boyfriend. </P>
<P> At the time of the murder, Jacobs was on parole from a 50-year prison sentence for a 1973 murder conviction in Illinois. </P>
<P> Jacobs initially confessed to the Urdiales murder, saying his sister, Bobbie Jean Hogan, offered him $500 and a place to stay if he would kill Urdiales, who was supposedly in a child custody dispute with her ex-husband. </P>
<P> He later recanted, saying he was at the scene of the crime but that his sister shot Urdiales dead. </P>
<P> In his final statement, Jacobs proclaimed his innocence, calling his death premeditated murder by the state of Texas. </P>
