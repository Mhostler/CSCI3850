<P>  The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said that any Iraqi military reinforcements near the Kuwaiti border could trigger a preemptive U.S. strike, according to The Washington Post. </P>
<P> Gen. John Shalikashvili said that ``any kind of reinforcement'' in equipment or troops near the Kuwaiti border ''would be considered threatening to us'' and could trigger a U.S. pre-emptive strike, the paper reported in Sunday editions.. </P>
<P> The Post said Shalikashvili made his remarks in an interview in Manila, where he is attending ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary of Gen. Douglas MacArthur's invasion of the Japanese-occupied Philippines during World War II. </P>
<P> Iraq said Saturday it would uphold its right to deploy troops in the country's south, calling U.S. warnings to restrict such movements an interference in Iraq's internal affairs. </P>
<P> Any attempt to reinforce the Iraqi army's 3rd and 4th corps ``will be viewed as a threat to the stability of the region,'' Shalikashvili said. ``We would then reserve the right ... to take appropriate action, including military action, to ensure that such reinforcements do not occur.'' </P>
