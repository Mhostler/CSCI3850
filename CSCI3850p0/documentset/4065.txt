<P>  Wackenhut Corp., a company that provides security for foreign embassies, private prisons and even nuclear power plants, is moving its headquarters out of suburban Miami in part because of the city's violence. </P>
<P> Wackenhut said it will relocate 75 miles north to Palm Beach County and away from Miami's high crime rate. Congestion and high operating costs were also factors. </P>
<P> And while company officials downplayed crime in Miami as the main reason for the move, they acknowledged that the overall quality of life would be better for employees in Palm Beach County. </P>
<P> ``The economics of it pushed us in this direction, with the $1 million or so in interest that we pay each year on debt service on our own building,'' said Pat Cannon, a spokesman for the company. ``A lease arrangement makes more business sense.'' </P>
<P> President Richard Wackenhut said that recruiting senior executives has become more difficult because of Miami's worsening reputation for crime. His own wife was shot in the arm in her driveway five years ago, the victim of an apparent robbery. </P>
<P> Company officials said the move would save an estimated $1.5 million annually. </P>
<P> The worldwide security company was founded 40 years ago by former FBI special agent George Wackenhut, who continues to head the company. In 1993, the publicly traded company had revenues of $664 million and a profit of $2.2 million. </P>
