<P>  Prime Minister Eugenia Charles said the tiny island of Dominica would accept up to 2,000 Haitian refugees, confirming a U.S. announcement one week ago that the island would offer safe haven, the Caribbean News Agency (CANA) reported Sunday. </P>
<P> The Clinton administration has approached several Caribbean states in an effort to create safe havens for the tens of thousands of boat people pouring out of Haiti. </P>
<P> Panama, which had initially agreed to take up to 10,000 Haitians, withdrew the offer late last week. </P>
<P> Charles, in her first public remarks on the safe haven proposal, told reporters that U.S. and United Nations officials would visit Dominica to finalize an agreement on the temporary refugee proposal, CANA said. </P>
<P> She played down speculation that the U.S. government would offer financial or trade incentives to persuade various Caribbean states to offer safe haven to Haitian boat people. </P>
<P> ``I believe that they (the United States) will show their gratitude in concrete terms, but there is no payment,'' Charles said. ``I am not sending them a bill to say I've had a thousand refugees for so many nights, you owe me so many million dollars.'' </P>
<P> The Dominica leader said a ``well-secured'' refugee camp would probably be established in the northern Pointe Rounde area. As many as 2,000 asylum-seeking Haitians would be allowed to remain there for up to one year, she said. </P>
<P> Dominica, Panama, Grenada and Antigua have encountered sharp criticism from local opposition political parties for their willingness to accept Haitians. </P>
<P> U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros Ghali and acting Secretary-General of the Organization of American States Christopher Thomas are to meet in New York Monday to discuss the latest developments in Haiti's political crisis. </P>
<P> Strict economic sanctions aimed at dislodging Haiti's military-backed government have instead sent thousands of poor Haitians fleeing. More than 14,000 Haitians have been rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard so far this month, a record. </P>
<P> The pace of boat people slowed over the weekend, with the Coast Guard rescuing a total of 644, compared to a daily average of more than 1,000 for the first eight days of July. </P>
<P> Last week, the Clinton administration announced that any Haitians fleeing their homeland by boat would not qualify for resettlement on U.S. soil, and would instead be taken to safe havens in other countries. </P>
<P> Dominica, a former British colony, has 84,000 residents on its 305 square miles. The tiny island depends mostly on tourism and exports of bananas, coconuts and citrus for its foreign exchange earnings. </P>
