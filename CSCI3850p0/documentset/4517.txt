<P> Doctors said the bleeding was the result of irritation caused by an anti-inflammatory medicine he was taking for arthritis. </P>
<P> ``The secretary of state is stable, he is in no danger,'' Dr. Chris Carruthers told a press conference at Civic Hospital. </P>
<P> ``We're keeping him overnight as a precaution,'' Carruthers said. </P>
<P> Other doctors said Christopher had been diagnosed with a small bleeding ulcer in his stomach. The bleeding had been stopped, they said, adding that Christopher would probably have to take medication for about six to 12 weeks. </P>
<P> Christopher, 69, went to the hospital in Ottawa, where he was attending a U.S.-Canada summit, late Thursday afternoon complaining of not feeling well. </P>
<P> David Johnson, a spokesman at the U.S. State Department traveling with Christopher, said he would probably be able to return to work in a few days, but might have to stay another day in the hospital when he returned to Washington Friday. </P>
