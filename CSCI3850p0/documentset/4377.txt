<P>  A German news magazine which quoted one of Deng Xiaoping's doctors as saying the Chinese patriarch's health could face a ``rapid change'' at any time said Thursday its news release on the interview had been misleading. </P>
<P> Heinz Lohfeldt, head of Der Spiegel magazine's publicity department, said a summary of its interview faxed to news organizations ahead of publication last weekend did not make clear that the doctor had not mentioned Deng by name. </P>
<P> ``It is certainly misleadingly formulated,'' Lohfeldt told Reuters, referring to the summary issued by the Hamburg-based magazine. </P>
<P> The Spiegel summary, received by news organizations last Saturday, read: ``One of the doctors treating the Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping has officially announced for the first time that the aging Communist Party patriarch is suffering from circulation problems and can die at any time.'' </P>
<P> ``Wu Jieping, who belongs to the team of doctors taking care of the 91-year-old, told the news magazine Der Spiegel that, given the condition of Deng's health, a 'rapid change' could occur at any time.'' </P>
<P> The complete interview in this week's Spiegel, which hit newsstands Monday, made clear Wu had not directly attributed his remarks to Deng's health but had spoken in general terms about the condition of elderly people. </P>
<P> Wu has since denied reports that he told Spiegel the 90-year-old Deng was suffering from inadequate circulation of blood to his brain and Parkinson's Disease. </P>
<P> Wu told the Hong Kong daily Ta Kung Pao, which is financed by the Chinese government, he ``absolutely had not had concrete discussions about Deng Xiaoping's health'' with the Spiegel reporter. </P>
<P> Lohfeldt said the magazine did not doubt that Wu was referring to Deng's health. </P>
<P> Recent accounts attributed to Wu and others close to Deng, including his daughter Deng Rong, have indicated the health of the retired ``chief architect'' of China's market reforms has declined, fanning speculation that he may be near death. </P>
<P> Earlier this month Deng broke a seven-year tradition of appearing on state television on the eve of China's biggest holiday, the Lunar New Year or Spring Festival, deepening concern about his health. </P>
<P> An influential Chinese internal newspaper, Reference News, fuelled speculation last Friday by printing the long-taboo words ``after Deng Xiaoping'' in a front-page story. </P>
