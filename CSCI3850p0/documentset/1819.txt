<P> Democratic leaders planned to meet with their Republican counterparts later Wednesday to assess the situation. </P>
<P> A hearing is also scheduled later Wednesday on a controversial telecommunications provision of the GATT measure. </P>
<P> The Senate has already been forced to delay on a vote on GATT, one of President Clinton's main priorities, until December 1 due to opposition by South Carolina Democrat Ernest Hollings. </P>
