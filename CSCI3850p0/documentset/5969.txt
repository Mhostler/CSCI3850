<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, April 24 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Polling in Malaysia's ninth general elections started on Monday in Malaysia's north Borneo states of Sabah and Sarawak as the intense 10-day campaigning period draws to a close in west Malaysia. </P>
<P> A total of 192 seats for the national parliament and 498 state assembly seats are up for grabs, with more than 1,000 candidates from 21 political parties. </P>
<P> Poll workers will travel by helicopters and boats to reach remote regions of Sarawak and Sabah, Malaysia's two huge, under-populated states. In Sabah, parliamentary elections will pit tribal chief Joseph Pairin Kitingan's Sabah Unity Party against Prime Minister Mahathir Mohahamd's powerful National Front coalition. </P>
<P> The two-day staggered voting period will see Malaysians in the other 11 west Malaysian states casting their votes on Tuesday which has been declared a national holiday. </P>
<P> There are 9.01 million eligible voters on the electoral roll compared with 7.96 million in the last elections in 1990. </P>
<P> Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's ruling National Front coalition is widely expected to be returned to power with a more than two-thirds majority. </P>
<P> Mahathir's multi-racial National Front had a two-thirds majority in the outgoing parliament and the largest opposition party, the Chinese-based Democratic Action Party, had 20 seats. </P>
