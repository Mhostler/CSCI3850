<P>  Costa Rican authorities suspended four directors of state bank Banco Nacional on Saturday to investigate a suspicious loan, a government spokesman said. </P>
<P> The Government Council of President Jose Maria Figueres debated the suspension of the four officials for six hours Friday night before reaching its decision. </P>
<P> Government spokesman Elias Soley named the four directors as Alban Ugarte, Jose Jimenez, Oscar Avila and Oscar Cadet. He said they allegedly granted a $9 million loan to the private rice-growing firm La Gilda between 1991 and 1992 when it was already heavily in debt. </P>
<P> The suspensions follow the closing of Costa Rica's Banco Anglo on Sept. 15 after it lost about $100 million, mostly because of bad bets on Venezuelan bonds. </P>
<P> Banco Nacional is Costa Rica's largest state-owned bank. </P>
