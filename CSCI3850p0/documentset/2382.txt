<P>  Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who last week narrowly survived a vote of no-confidence in parliament, said Thursday the government should radically improve cooperation with the legislature. </P>
<P> Itar-Tass news agency said Chernomyrdin told a Cabinet meeting that he had ordered each ministry to appoint a special official who would explain policy to parliament. </P>
<P> ``We cannot hope government policy can be not only well understood but supported by legislators if they do not have first-hand information,'' Tass quoted Chernomyrdin as saying. </P>
<P> The largely hostile State Duma lower house of parliament came within 32 votes of passing a no-confidence motion in the government last week in the wake of a ruble crash. </P>
<P> Chernomyrdin's speech to ministers is further evidence that the Cabinet, now trying to push an austere 1995 budget through parliament, has opted for conciliation rather than confrontation. </P>
<P> The premier said he would meet representatives of parliamentary factions at least once every two or three months. Ministers' priorities would remain the budget, privatization, a new bankruptcy law and a law on government. </P>
