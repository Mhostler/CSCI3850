<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Two Americans imprisoned in Iraq have been taken to hospitals with chest pains, the State Department said on Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``We just now in the last half hour found out that both men were hospitalized overnight for chest pains,'' spokesman Nicholas Burns said, referring to William Barloon and David Daliberti. </P>
<P> ``We don't know much about their condition... Barloon should be released back to prison tomorrow, but we don't know about Daliberti,'' Burns said. </P>
<P> Barloon, 39, and Daliberti, 41, were arrested in Iraq on March 13 after crossing the border from Kuwait. </P>
<P> They were tried and sentenced to eight years in jail for illegally entering Iraq. Their wives, Linda Barloon and Kathy Daliberti, are in Iraq visiting their husbands and said on Monday the men are hoping for an early release. </P>
<P> The latest developments seemed at odds with the reports given by the wives on Sunday after they visited their husbands in Abu Ghraib prison outside Baghdad. </P>
<P> At that time, Daliberti said of her husband in a joint CNN-NBC interview: ``Considering the circumstances, he looked okay.'' </P>
<P> Barloon said her husband ``lost a lot of weight'' and was ``a little bit pale, but I think that this would be expected under the circumstances...Overall, their health seemed fairly good.'' </P>
<P> Burns said the State Department learned about situation from relatives of the two men living in the United States. </P>
<P> ``Obviously, we are extremely concerned and hope they get better. This is why Ryszard Krystosik (the Polish diplomat representing U.S. interests in Iraq) should get to see them in the hospital and why they should be sent back to the United States on medical grounds alone,'' he said. </P>
<P> Earlier he told reporters the two wives were permitted to visit their husbands for the second time, on Monday, in a visit that lasted five hours. Iraqi authorities indicated a third visit might be permitted on Tuesday, but Burns did not know if that had actually taken place. </P>
<P> ``While we're very much encouraged that Mrs Daliberti and Mrs Barloon have had a chance to see their husbands twice now, we remain very much concerned that Mr Krystosik continues to be denied access to them,'' he said. </P>
<P> Burns criticized the fact that letters and packages from family members were held for two weeks and only given to the prisoners on Sunday. </P>
<P> Washington hopes the women are permitted to also meet Iraqi authorities so they can put forward ``their personal, humanitarian cases,'' he added. </P>
<P> In past instances involving Westerners jailed for similar offences, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein granted clemency after pleas from Western government officials. </P>
