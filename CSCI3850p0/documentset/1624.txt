<P>  Disgruntled former government security agents peacefully ended their occupation of the Venezuelan embassy in Managua Tuesday, agreeing to discuss their grievances with the Nicaraguan government, officials said. </P>
<P> Some 17 former agents of the Ministry of the Interior, masked but unarmed, had seized the diplomatic post Monday to press their demands for severance pay from the government. </P>
<P> They came out of the embassy late Monday for overnight talks with government officials and agreed early Tuesday to settle their grievances through negotiation with the Nicaraguan government. </P>
<P> ``Negotiations (between the government and the occupants) ended at 5:40 a.m.,'' ministry spokesman Fernando Quarezma told Reuters. ``They agreed to continue the negotiations tomorrow.'' </P>
<P> The talks would be held in the offices of an Organization of American States mission, Quarezma said. </P>
<P> Ambassador Juan Jose Monsant and three other embassy officials stayed in the building throughout the nearly 12 hours of the takeover. The four left unharmed. </P>
<P> The same group, who are among 11,000 workers laid off by the Interior Ministry since 1990, occupied the same embassy in June. They claim they have not received severance payments. </P>
<P> The government said Monday that only 14 people on a list of 103 presented by the protesters were eligible for benefits. </P>
<P> The occupation of the Venezuelan embassy was the latest in a series of so-called ``peaceful takeovers'' of diplomatic missions, government buildings and cathedrals in Nicaragua by political activists and protesters. </P>
