<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  African foreign ministers pledged Monday to set their own agenda to break out of a vicious circle of poverty and under-investment, but said crippling foreign debts remained the biggest obstacle to growth. </P>
<P> Ministers, gathered in Cairo for a two-day meeting under the banner ``Relaunching Africa's Economic and Social Development,'' also discussed ways of expanding trade and investment in the world's poorest continent. </P>
<P> ``This document recognizes our destiny is in our own hands and we are not looking for charity from developed nations,'' Ghana's Foreign Minister Obed Asamoah said in reference to the draft declaration put before the ministers. </P>
<P> Africa attracts only two percent of direct foreign investment in the developing world. </P>
<P> The text stresses African development is ``first and foremost the responsibility of our governments and peoples.'' </P>
<P> But Salim Ahmed Salim, Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity which called the conference, said wealthy countries should not shirk their responsibilities to Africa. </P>
<P> ``Social development in Africa is the responsibility of its people and governments. (But) that does not absolve the international community,'' he said. ``The single most important impediment to African development is its debt burden.'' </P>
<P> Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak, opening the conference, said ``the $300 billion of African debts is a terrifying number, putting in consideration all the deteriorating economic conditions among the continent's countries.'' </P>
<P> The draft declaration under discussion says creditors should go beyond simple debt rescheduling to actually canceling debt. </P>
<P> Mubarak said African countries must also confront negative effects of the GATT agreement, and enhance inter-African trade, standing at just five percent of the continent's total trade. </P>
<P> It urges African countries to set aside at least one percent of GDP to develop science and technology. It also calls on them to modernize their rudimentary industrial base and redouble efforts to explore and develop energy resources. </P>
