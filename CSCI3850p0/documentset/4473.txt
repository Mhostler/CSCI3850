<P>  U.S. scientists are unable to obtain new supplies of RU-486, the controversial abortion drug, hampering research into its potential as a treatment for some types of cancer, scientists said Tuesday. </P>
<P> Several doctors and scientists at a medical conference here, including the inventor of RU-486, Etienne Baulieu, said U.S. researchers were experiencing difficulties in obtaining the drug for cancer studies. </P>
<P> Baulieu, speaking at a news conference at the annual meeting of the Society of Gynecologic Oncologists (SGO), said he knew of scientists planning to study RU-486's effect on cancer ``who finally couldn't get the drug.'' </P>
<P> RU-486 is in use in several European countries as an ''abortion pill.'' Its use has not yet been approved in the United States, where it is opposed by anti-abortion groups. </P>
<P> More than a dozen clinics around the United States are taking part in medical trials of the pill. </P>
<P> But scientists are also excited about RU-486's potential as a cancer treatment. In laboratory tests, RU-486 has shown promise as a treatment for brain tumors, ovarian and breast cancer, although scientists caution that few tests have so far been carried out in humans. </P>
<P> Sandra Waldman, spokeswoman for the Population Council, a New York-based non-profit group which has the U.S. rights to RU-486, confirmed that American scientists faced supply difficulties. </P>
<P> Until last year, U.S. scientists wishing to study the drug dealt directly with Roussel Uclaf, the French company which developed RU-486, she said. </P>
<P> But after Roussel Uclaf, a subsidiary of Hoechst AG of Germany, donated the U.S. rights to the Population Council last May, Roussel Uclaf stopped supplying the drug for new U.S. studies, Waldman said. </P>
<P> But the Population Council does not have RU-486 to give to scientists because no company is yet making it for the U.S. market. </P>
<P> ``There's a 'Catch 22' to this. We do not have a manufacturer of the drug yet so there will be a period of time where the drug will not be available in the U.S. for new studies,'' Waldman said, adding that the council was in negotiations for manufacture and U.S. distribution of RU-486. </P>
<P> ``We feel badly for the scientists,'' she said, adding that they would ``have to be patient for a while longer.'' </P>
<P> Roussel Uclaf's donation of the rights was seen as a way of getting the drug quickly into U.S. trials while sparing the company from having to defend itself against attacks from anti-abortion groups. </P>
<P> A number of scientific studies on RU-486 have been carried out in the United States, and others are being conducted by researchers who obtained the drug before last May, scientists said. </P>
<P> While the supply problem is technical, Baulieu and other scientists at the conference indicated they believed that controversy over the drug's role as an abortion pill was the root cause. </P>
<P> Baulieu said research into RU-486's effects on cancer ''should be ongoing.'' But he said it was ``relatively difficult at the present time because of controversies about other applications of RU-486, particularly the abortion issue.'' </P>
<P> ``We would hope that the political issue will not overcloud the potential use of an agent like that to cancer patients that need it,'' said SGO President Rodrigue Mortel. </P>
