<DATELINE>BEIJING, April 17 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Chinese revolutionary veteran Chen Yun was cremated on Monday after a subdued ceremony in which top Communist Party leaders bowed before the body of the country's most powerful man after paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. </P>
<P> China's leaders respected Chen's request, contained in his will, that he did not want an elaborate state funeral. </P>
<P> The report on the ceremony by the official Xinhua news agency did not mention the 90-year-old Deng, indicating he did not attend the Beijing Hospital ceremony or the cremation of Chen, a long-time comrade-in-arms. </P>
<P> The huge national flags flying above Tiananmen Square and the ornate gate of the Zhongnanhai leadership compound were lowered to half-mast to honour the final passing of the man who guided China's economy for four decades. </P>
<P> All but one of the Communist Party politburo's seven elite standing committee members paid their last respects at a private ceremony in the Beijing Hospital before a flower-bedecked motorcade whisked Chen's body through Tiananmen Square to the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery in the western suburbs of the capital. </P>
<P> Standing committee member Number Three, Qiao Shi, head of the communist-dominated parliament, was on an overseas trip. </P>
<P> Premier Li Peng and other leaders attended Chen's cremation along with his widow and other relatives, Xinhua said. </P>
<P> Part of the ashes of the self-trained economist and central planner, who often took issue with Deng's embrace of markets, were to be buried under a pine tree at Babaoshan, the favoured final resting place of the majority of China's revolutionary elite. </P>
<P> The rest were to be shipped to his adopted hometown of Shanghai for burial, a plan that Xinhua said accorded with the wishes of Chen's family. </P>
<P> It was in Shanghai that Chen joined the Communist Party in 1925. In the vibrant metropolis he spent most of his final years, using it as a base from which he kept a close and sometimes critical watch over Deng, his only senior in China's pantheon of retired revolutionaries. </P>
<P> Cremation has been preferred by China's communist revolutionaries, and reportedly was requested by Chairman Mao Tse-tung. Mao's embalmed body has lain in state since his death in 1976, on view in a crystal sarcophagus in a vast mausoleum in central Tiananmen Square. </P>
<P> China reportedly altered rules and protocol for state funerals after a grand April 1989 funeral in the Great Hall of the People for former Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang became a rallying point for student pro-democracy protesters. </P>
<P> The protests centred on Tiananmen Square were crushed by the army with heavy loss of life in June 1989. </P>
