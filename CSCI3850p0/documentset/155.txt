<P>  Cuba is to invite the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ecuadorean Jose Ayala Lazo, to visit the island, Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said Sunday. </P>
<P> Amorim, winding up a three-day visit to the communist-ruled Caribbean island, said at a news conference he had been told of Cuba's willingness to invite the commisisoner by Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina. </P>
<P> Amorim said that he viewed the news as ``very positive.'' </P>
<P> Deputy Foreign Minister Isabel Allende, speaking to reporters after the news conference, confirmed Havana's intention of inviting Ayala to visit, adding that Cuba ``has nothing to hide'' on human rights. </P>
<P> She said Cuba had never objected to discussions on the theme of human rights and Ayala could visit in the same way as he visited many other countries. The timing of the trip was up to Ayala, she said. </P>
<P> Allende noted, however, that Cuba remained opposed to the notion of a special U.N. investigator on human rights in Cuba visiting the island. </P>
<P> Cuba denies charges it is guilty of human rights abuses, maintaining it is picked on by the United States for political reasons. It rejects the idea of a special investigator as being part of a policy of singling it out unfairly. </P>
