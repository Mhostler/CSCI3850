<P>  Another stalemate in efforts to end the Major League baseball strike left respresentatives of the owners and players frustrated and pessimistic on Thurday. </P>
<P> Bitter feelings over a lack of progress in Wednesday night meetings carried over to Thursday's abbreviated negotiations, making the opening of the regular season with replacement players an ever increasing possibility. </P>
<P> Acting commissioner Bud Selig and Colorado Rockies owner Jerry McMorris, members of the owners' negotiating team, both expressed dismay at the turn for the worse the negotiations have taken. </P>
<P> ``It is the same as yesterday. We put a lot of time in this process and as we come down to really trying to get a deal, we have gone backwards,'' said McMorris, considered a moderate among the owners. </P>
<P> ``I'm going home because I'm tired, for the moment, of going nowhere,'' complained Selig, a hardliner and owner of the Milwaukee Brewers. </P>
<P> ``We have got to find a way to make a deal and quit nitpicking everything we do,'' Selig said. ``I can't turn my back on clubs losing a lot of money and those that are in financial jeopardy.'' </P>
<P> Donald Fehr, head of the Players Association, said he had no idea when the strike, which began last August, would end. </P>
<P> ``This is not easy stuff,'' Fehr said. ``I cannot predict and am unwilling to try and predict what will happen over the next several days.'' </P>
<P> Both sides have agreed to meet again Friday, although neither side seems particularly optimistic that the talks will be any more fruitful. </P>
<P> If an agreement is not reached by Sunday, the season is almost sure to start with replacement players. The replacements are already playing exhibition games. </P>
<P> Unlike Selig, McMorris said he will remain in Scottsdale and be part of a six-person negotiating team for the owners. </P>
<P> ``Where I come from in negotiating and reaching compromise, you try to establish the other side's position,'' McMorris said. </P>
<P> ``We can't get to the position where we know what the union's position is. That's the question that was never anwswered and still remains on the table. I hope we can get to that point (Friday).'' </P>
<P> Said Fehr: ``These are very difficult issues. </P>
<P> ``I'm morally certain if all of the clubs felt about this process the way Jerry McMorris does, this process would have been over.'' </P>
