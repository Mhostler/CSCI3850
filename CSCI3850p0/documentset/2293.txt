<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Immigration authorities have launched an investigation into whether Republican Senate candidate Michael Huffington broke the law when he employed an illegal immigrant as his daughter's nanny, officials said Friday. </P>
<P> Huffington, a Republican congressman who made a tough stand on illegal immigration a cornerstone of his campaign against incumbent Democrat Dianne Feinstein, admitted Thursday that he ''made a mistake'' but compared the offense to running a stop sign. </P>
<P> In an effort to defuse a controversy that has been called ''Nannygate'' California-style, Huffington -- who has crept to within a few points of Feinstein in the polls -- blamed his wife Arianna for hiring the Mexican woman but accepted personal responsibility for it. </P>
<P> Huffington said that even after learning of her illegal status, he kept 31-year-old Marisella Garcia on the payroll from 1989 to 1993 at his Santa Barbara mansion because his children grew fond of her. </P>
<P> Huffington, an oil and gas heir who has has spent $24.8 million of his own money to bankroll the most expensive campaign in congressional history, also acknowledged that he failed to pay taxes on the woman's salary for about a year. </P>
<P> Huffington's embarrassing admission gave a new twist to the heated immigration debate that has dominated California politics this year, and Feinstein's campaign was reported to be preparing a television advertisement to attack him on the issue. </P>
<P> Virginia Kice, a spokeswoman for the western regional office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, said investigators were ``looking into the matter at this point.'' </P>
<P> ``We're handling this situation in the same way we would handle any situation where we become aware that an immigration law may have been violated,'' she said. </P>
<P> Since 1986, federal law has made it a crime for employers to hire illegal immigrants, with violators subject to thousands of dollars in fines. </P>
<P> But employment of undocumented domestic help has become an entrenched part of life in southern California, where an army of poor Mexican and Central American women care for children, cook and clean in middle- and upper-class homes. </P>
<P> The latest bombshell in the hard-fought Senate race was reminiscent of last year's ``Nannygate'' scandal in which two of President Clinton's attorney-general nominees, Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood, dropped out following disclosures they had hired illegal immigrants as domestic help. </P>
<P> With his campaign reeling, Huffington returned to the stump Friday but refused to answer questions on the subject. </P>
<P> Huffington, a transplanted Texan, has catapulted himself from political obscurity by financing a barrage of television ''attack'' advertisements. But the potential damage to his election chances center on his own get-tough position on illegal immigration. </P>
<P> Last week, Huffington announced his support for the ``Save Our State'' ballot measure, a sweeping proposal that would cut off most basic public services to illegal immigrants. Feinstein took a stand against Proposition 187 a day later. </P>
<P> The measure would kick the children of undocumented residents out of public schools and require teachers, police and doctors to report those they suspect of being illegal. Polls show it is supported by a majority of voters. </P>
<P> Huffington downplayed the seriousness of his own offense, asking reporters, ``Who among us has not broken the law?'' But he also went on the attack, accusing Feinstein of hiring illegal immigrants at her home. Feinstein flatly denied the charge. </P>
