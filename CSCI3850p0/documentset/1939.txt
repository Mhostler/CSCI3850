<DATELINE>BOURNEMOUTH, England (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Bitter divisions within Britain's ruling Conservative Party burst into the open Tuesday with a fierce onslaught by right-wingers on Prime Minister John Major's policy towards Europe. </P>
<P> Norman Lamont, fired as finance minister in May 1993, stunned the first day of the Conservatives' annual conference, saying Britain was losing the fight against closer integration and might one day have to pull out of the European Union. </P>
<P> Lamont's attack capped a difficult day for Major whose party, in power since 1979, is stuck more than 20 points behind a revived Labor Party in opinion polls. </P>
<P> The four-day gathering began under a cloud of allegations of influence-peddling against Margaret Thatcher's son Mark in connection with a huge arms deal his mother signed with Saudi Arabia when she was prime minister in the mid-1980s. </P>
<P> Thatcher, upset by the controversy, looked pale and drawn when she took her place on the podium to muted applause from Conservative delegates who once cheered her every word. </P>
<P> Party Chairman Jeremy Hanley tried to rally the troops with his speech promising a political revival that would sweep the Conservatives to a fifth consecutive election victory. But it was Lamont, clearly bitter towards Major ever since his dismissal, who provided the main action. </P>
<P> With momentum gathering for a single European currency that could lead to a European super-state, Lamont told a meeting on the fringe of the conference that anti-federalist Britain was on a collision course with its partners. </P>
<P> ``That means looking at all the options, ranging from membership of an outer tier to participating solely in the European Economic Area. One day it may mean contemplating withdrawal,'' he said. </P>
<P> He said continued membership in Europe meant Britain was participating, albeit reluctantly, in a process leading to a political goal that Britons did not share. ``Unless this central reality is acknowledged, the issue of Europe will continue to dominate our politics and poison the Conservative Party for many years to come,'' he said. </P>
<P> Former foreign secretary Lord Geoffrey Howe said he was astonished by Lamont's speech, which he called ``the utmost folly.'' But Lamont was backed by other leading ``Eurosceptics.'' </P>
<P> ``We must do more to raise the alarm at the extent and the speed of the destruction of our system of law, our parliament and our conventions of government, which have stood us in such good stead over the centuries,'' said Lord Norman Tebbitt, a former cabinet minister who is close to Thatcher. </P>
<P> Member of parliament Bill Cash was even blunter: ``We are locked in a struggle for the survival of our democracy to prevent German domination of Europe.'' </P>
