<P>  Javier Perez de Cuellar, who lost to President Alberto Fujimori this month, said he will remain a ''rigorous observer'' of Fujimori's government as head of Peru's largest opposition group. </P>
<P> In a letter congratulating the president released Tuesday, former U.N. chief Perez de Cuellar said Fujimori had won a clear mandate in the April 9 elections. ``I trust you will receive this new mandate with the firm determination to provide well-being to our country in which millions live in poverty, illness and ignorance,'' he wrote. </P>
<P> Perez de Cuellar also called on Fujimori to establish an authentic state of law through the respect of Peru's institutions, apparently referring to his action closing Congress and seizing broad powers for nine months in 1992. </P>
<P> In a reference to a recent border conflict with Ecuador, the retired diplomat called on the president to preserve Peru's ''sovereignty and territorial integrity.'' </P>
<P> He added, ``I will be a serene and rigorous observer of your government. This is the mandate I believe I received on April 9.'' The final official results showed Fujimori won 64.4 percent of the vote and Perez de Cuellar 21.8 percent. </P>
