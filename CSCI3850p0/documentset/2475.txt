<P>  Four suspected gangsters went on trial Tuesday accused of the 1992 assassination of judge Paolo Borsellino, a national hero for his fight against the Mafia. </P>
<P> Borsellino and five bodyguards were killed in a car bomb explosion in the Sicilian capital of Palermo in July 1992, two months after a crusading colleague, judge Giovanni Falcone, was killed in a similar attack. </P>
<P> Last March, a court in the Sicilian city of Caltanisetta ordered alleged Palermo Mafia boss Salvatore Profeta, his brother-in-law Vincenzo Scarantino, Pietro Scotto and Giuseppe Orofino to stand trial for the Borsellino attack. </P>
<P> Profeta and Scarantino are accused of ordering the theft of the car used in the attack, packing it with explosives and parking it in front of the judge's mother's house, where it was detonated. </P>
<P> Scotto, a telephone engineer, has been charged with tapping phone lines to monitor the magistrates's movements prior to the attack. Orofino, a car mechanic, is accused of providing false number plates for the vehicle. </P>
<P> Scarantino, who turned state's evidence last June, was absent from court on Tuesday. </P>
<P> Judicial sources said his testimony had implicated 16 other alleged Mafiosi in the Borsellino attack, including ``Godfather'' Salvatore ``Toto'' Riina, who was arrested in January 1993 after 23 years on the run. </P>
