<P>  Peruvians go to the polls on Sunday to choose a president, two vice-presidents and a one-chamber, 120- member Congress. Here are key facts about the vote. </P>
<P> Presidential candidates - Fourteen hopefuls are running for the top post, though the election is centered around two candidates: President Alberto Fujimori, who is standing for a second term and is far ahead in the polls, and former United Nations Chief Javier Perez de Cuellar, who is running as the candidate of the Union for Peru party. </P>
<P> For Congress, 2,400 candidates from 20 parties or movements are vying for 120 seats. </P>
<P> Number of voters - 12.4 million voters, about one million of whom are illiterate or semi-literate. </P>
<P> Polls open at 8 a.m. (9 a.m. EDT) Sunday and close at 3 p.m. (4 p.m. EDT). </P>
<P> Election officials will allow exit polling but exit poll results are prohibited from being announced until two hours after the polls close. </P>
<P> The National Elections Board said it will provide a result of some 50 percent of the presidential vote by about 9 p.m. (10 p.m. EDT) on the night of the vote. Partial official results are expected within five days. Full official results are expected to take a few weeks. </P>
<P> Run-offs - If one candidate fails to obtain 50 percent of the valid vote, there will be a second round on June 7. </P>
