<P>  Following is the text of a written statement issued Tuesday by exiled Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in response to the agreement reached late Sunday by the United States and Haiti's military leaders. </P>
<P> The December 16, 1990, election was an expression of the sovereign will of the people of Haiti to choose democracy; a first step toward dignity and self determination. </P>
<P> During the 36 months since the coup d'etat we have travelled with the people of Haiti back toward this democracy -- choosing a path that will not add to the 5,000 murders already suffered, a path that will not lead toward greater violence. </P>
<P> We must build a state of law so that there will be neither violence nor vengeance in our nation. That is why today we must remain committed to the agreements that we have signed, notably, the Governor's Island Agreement. Consistent with our Constitution and approved United Nations and Organization of American States resolutions, that Agreement will lead us back to democracy. </P>
<P> We remain vigilant to the declaration of democracy expressed by the people of Haiti, as together with the people of Haiti, we move toward a new beginning. </P>
