<DATELINE>CAP HAITIEN, Haiti (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Eight Haitians were shot dead during a confrontation with U.S. Marines at a police station in this northern coastal city, a U.S. military offical said Saturday. </P>
<P> ``There are eight dead people on the street, all Haitian,'' said Colonel Steve Hartley. </P>
<P> In Port au Prince, a U.S. official said one American military man was also believed to have been wounded. A journalist at the scene said the U.S. casualty was a Marine translator and CNN reported he was hit in the leg. </P>
<P> U.S. military officials said the incident began when five shots were fired from an automatic weapon in the vicinity of a Cap Haitien police station and Marines responded to the gunfire. </P>
<P> Journalists at the scene said the details of the episode were still sketchy, but that it had apparently begun when one Haitian pointed a gun at a Marine responding to the shots. </P>
<P> The gunman was shot dead, and in the ensuing firefight seven other men were killed as they emerged from the station. </P>
<P> It was unclear whether the dead men were police. </P>
<P> Marines were holding a number of Haitians overnight at the police station until daylight, U,S. official said. </P>
<P> One U.S. corporal quoted by CNN said the Haitains who emerged from the police station were ``spooked and lit up their weapons.'' </P>
<P> Marines returned fire immediately and civilians scurried for cover. </P>
<P> CNN said a U.S. battalion commander said words were exchanged between the Marine translator and a group of Haitians. </P>
<P> A reaction force has sealed off the entire area and armored personnel carrier was brought in, the network said, calling the episode ``serious, the first shot fired in anger by U.S. forces.'' </P>
