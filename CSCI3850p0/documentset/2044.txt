<P>  President Jean-Bertrand Aristide said his mother phoned him hours before his return to Haiti Saturday after three years in exile to give him some advice: be sweet and cool - and celebrate. </P>
<P> ``It went straight to my heart,'' he said in a news conference aboard the U.S. Air Force plane taking him home. </P>
<P> Asked if he did anything special to prepare for his return, Aristide said, ``I was working until half past four in the morning. Then I went to bed. </P>
<P> ``After five, I got a call from my mother. She wanted to tell me to be sweet, very cool, celebrate your reconciliation.'' </P>
<P> Asked how he felt, Aristide said, ``Very happy ... very emotional'' and he was unafraid. </P>
<P> ``I am hopeful we will succeed through reconciliation, peace, respect for every single citizen,'' he said after being asked whether he felt he could overcome the hatreds and suspicions of the past and build Haiti into a democracy. </P>
<P> Haiti's first democratically elected president expressed confidence that he could meet the great expectations that have built up for what he and his government can do. </P>
<P> ``During our seven months in office we were moving slowly but surely from misery to poverty with dignity. Once we can create the political stability, once we share this peaceful reconciliation we have ... open(ed) the door of (the economy),'' Aristide said. </P>
<P> Asked whether opponents to his policies would be able to reconcile themselves, he replied, ``This is a democracy. That means you cannot avoid opposition. I am the president of every single citizen...'' </P>
<P> Later, during a picture-taking session aboard the plane with Secretary of State Warren Christopher and others, Christopher pointed out to Aristide that the aircraft was over the Caribbean country. </P>
<P> Aristide got up from his seat, leaned over and smiled. </P>
<P> ``What a day, what a day,'' said Christopher. </P>
<P> Aristide was silent. </P>
