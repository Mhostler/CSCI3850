<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The U.N. official in charge of disarming Iraq said Sunday he was trying to shun politics in his talks with the Iraqis to close the remaining gap in Baghdad's weapons file. </P>
<P> Rolf Ekeus, head of the U.N. Special Commission on Iraq, said the focus of his current discussions with senior Iraqi officials was on how to solve technical issues related to the annihilation of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. </P>
<P> ``This time we are focusing strictly on technical aspects to solve them. They are the problem,'' Ekeus told reporters. </P>
<P> He arrived in Baghdad Friday and has so far had five rounds of talks with his Iraqi counterpart, General Amer Rasheed, head of the military industrialization commission. </P>
<P> The visit is his second within a month and is his last to the Iraqi capital before making a report to the Security Council on April 10 that is key to the possible lifting or easing of the U.N. trade and oil embargo imposed on Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in August 1990. </P>
<P> The U.N. Security Council voted March 13 to extend sanctions against Iraq for a further two months, but renewed efforts to ease or lift the sanctions are expected later this spring. </P>
<P> Ekeus' report is expected to declare that a long-term monitoring system to ensure Iraq complies with the 1991 Gulf War resolutions is finally operational. </P>
<P> U.N. arms inspectors say Iraq has not accounted for 20-30 tonnes of so-called complex ``growth media'' that could be used to produce two to three metric tons of bacterial material for biological weapons. The commission says Iraq imported in 1988-89 millions of dollars-worth of growth media, in which germs can grow. </P>
<P> The U.N. team says it could not declare Iraq had fully complied with the 1991 Gulf War cease-fire terms on disarmament without full knowledge of what happened to the material. </P>
<P> Sunday, Ekeus, a former Swedish diplomat, said he was trying to steer his talks away from the political atmosphere surrounding Iraq and stick to his disarmament mandate. </P>
<P> ``The talks have so far been technical. We try to work together...to make them as concrete and practical as possible and as little political as possible.'' </P>
<P> He described the talks as ``very business like, very sincere and very substantive.'' </P>
<P> But he declined to say whether Iraq will provide him with the missing data on past biological warfare research the U.N. has failed to account for. </P>
<P> ``We are in the middle of the talks. It is too difficult to characterize them at this stage,'' he said. </P>
