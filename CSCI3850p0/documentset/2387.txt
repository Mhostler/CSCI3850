<P> Atlantis thundered into a clear sky at 11:59 a.m. EST (1659 GMT), taking aloft a cargo bay observatory and a small satellite that were to study the composition of the atmosphere and the sun's effect on ozone, a thin gas that envelops the planet in a natural radiation shield. </P>
<P> Along for the ride were 10 pregnant rats that will be used in a study of fetal development away from gravity. </P>
<P> Despite a bevy of technical problems that put the shuttle fueling team well behind schedule in the final hours of the countdown, the launch appeared to go off without a hitch. </P>
<P> Atlantis was emerging from a two-year, $74 million overhaul to fly its 13th mission in nine years -- the U.S. space agency's 66th overall and the seventh of 1994. Crew members are Don McMonagle, commander; Curt Brown, copilot; Ellen Ochoa, payload commander; NASA mission specialists Scott Parazynksi and Joe Tanner; and French mission specialist Jean- Francois Clervoy. </P>
