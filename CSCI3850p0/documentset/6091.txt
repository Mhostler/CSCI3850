<P>  Singapore Friday will hang three Malaysian laborers who have been on death row since 1989, lawyers for two of the men said Thursday. </P>
<P> The men were convicted after a gang clash outside an ice factory in which a Singapore man was killed. If the execution takes place Friday it will fall on the 10th anniversary of the murder. </P>
<P> ``I was told quite definitely they are going to be hanged Friday,'' one lawyer said. Home Ministry and Prison Department officials could not be immediately reached for comment. </P>
<P> The three men, the city-state's longest serving death-row inmates, were twice given a last-minute reprieve before previously scheduled executions June 17 and Nov. 11 of last year. </P>
<P> On April 12, the court of appeal dismissed an appeal by one of the prisoners who argued it was unconstitutional to hang him because he had been on death row for more than five years. </P>
<P> Jabar bin Kadermasten said it would be cruel and inhuman to carry out the execution in view of the prolonged delay. </P>
<P> The high court had earlier said he could not take advantage of the time lapse because the delay was his doing and not the state's. </P>
<P> The lawyer for Jabar, S.K. Kumar, told Reuters he wrote to Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad asking him to intercede. He said he received a fax signed by Mahathir on Thursday saying, ``I regret that after studying the case, I find no grounds for interceding.'' </P>
<P> Murder carries a mandatory death penalty in Singapore. </P>
