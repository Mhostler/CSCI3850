<P>  American and British movies, sidelined at recent Cannes Film Festivals in the midst of a U.S.-European cultural war, return with a vengeance next month. </P>
<P> The two countries account for 10 of the 24 films entered for the Golden Palm award at the May 17-28 competition on the French Riviera. </P>
<P> ``If there is a culture war... we have never had so many offers,'' festival director Gilles Jacob said in reference to a U.S.-European trade tussle over national film quotas. </P>
<P> ``The Americans wanted us to show 109 films. We're ready to show half that,'' said Jacob, who trawled a total of 409 films in the last three months, told a news conference. </P>
<P> ``The major studios this year showed us a great deal. Disney, Columbia and Fox each have a film in competition,'' Jacob said. </P>
<P> Hollywood's leading studios had in past years been noticeably absent, partly because the event takes place between spring and fall when most U.S. films are released. Cannes juries also tend to prefer small budget movies to U.S. blockbusters. </P>
<P> The six American movies in competition include Jim Jarmusch's ``Dead Man,'' a Western with Johnny Depp and Robert Mitchum, John Boorman's ``Beyond Rangoon'' on 1980s riots in Burma, and Larry Clark's ``Kids.'' </P>
<P> The four British films are Nicholas Hytner's ``The Madness of King George,'' Ken Loach's ``Land and Freedom,'' Christopher Hampton's ``Carrington'' and Terence Davies' ``The Neon Bible.'' </P>
<P> Hollywood screen stars attending the festival are expected to include Sharon Stone, Diane Keaton, Andie MacDowell, Harvey Keitel and Matt Dillon. French actress and director Jeanne Moreau will head the jury. </P>
<P> Many of the entries focus on the violence and disarray of urban societies. </P>
<P> ``Kids'' portrays the verbal crudity and sexual cynicism of young New Yorkers who catch the AIDS virus. Zhang Yimou from China has ``Shanghai Triad'' starring his former partner Gong Li. </P>
<P> Two of the French films entered for the Palm focus on suburbs racked by unemployment and drugs. </P>
<P> Light relief will come from Hytner's offering and ``The City of Lost Children'' by Jean-Pierre Jeuent and Marc Carot, authors of the oddball hit ``Delicatessen.'' </P>
<P> Historical films include Loach on Spain during the 1930s civil war and Hampton on a female painter and a homosexual critic in 1920s England. </P>
<P> The Palm line-up also includes films from Italy, Spain, Belgium, Romania, Portugal, Japan and Mali. </P>
<P> Still with an American flavor, this year's retrospective will honor John Ford and his westerns. Even the poster for the festival, a ray of sunlight bursting out of clouds to illuminate a sea of famous shots, was designed by a New Yorker, Ryszard Horowitz. </P>
