<P>  Jamaica's air traffic controllers walked off the job Thursday, causing the delay or cancellation of most scheduled flights to and from the island's two international airports. </P>
<P> The 47 controllers stopped work to protest government delays in finalizing a plan to give the civil aviation department more autonomy by making it a self-supporting corporation that would still have to adhere to some government regulations. The plan was part of a negotiated settlement with the controllers that ended a similar strike two years ago. </P>
<P> All American Airlines flights to the Kingston and Montego Bay airports were cancelled due to the job action. A spokesman for the Jamaica tourist board said a number of other flights were also delayed or cancelled. </P>
<P> Transport Minister Robert Pickersgill called an emergency meeting with the air traffic controllers to try to resolve the dispute, which left some travelers stranded at a time when Jamaica's tourism arrivals have slipped by about 2 percent from 1994 figures. </P>
