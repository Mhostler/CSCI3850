<P>  An international aid worker Monday said ``many, many bodies'' were still lying in the streets of Samashki, a small rebel bastion in separatist Chechnya which Russian forces captured Saturday. </P>
<P> ``Many, many bodies are still littering the town,'' said Jean-Paul Corboz of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) who visited Samashki Monday. He also told reporters that Russian forces had violated humanitarian norms during the storming of the town. </P>
<P> ``If you want to take control of a town, there are many ways to do it. Unfortunately, in this case, I would say that humanitarian norms were not completely observed,'' Corboz said. </P>
<P> Russian troops blocked humanitarian aid to Samashki for four days and only let an ICRC convoy through late Monday while barring access to a Russian convoy. </P>
<P> Many refugees fleeing Samashki said Russian troops had killed civilians when they entered the town and had also looted houses. The reports could not be independently confirmed. </P>
