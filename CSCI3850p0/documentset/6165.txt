<DATELINE>HOUSTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Colorado Rockies and Chicago Cubs each got their first taste of defeat in the young 1995 baseball season Sunday. </P>
<P> James Mouton's two-out double capped a three-run seventh inning rally as the Houston Astros downed the Rockies 3-1. </P>
<P> Colorado was off to the best start in its short existence with four consecutive victories prior to Sunday's loss. </P>
<P> Tony Eusebio and pinch-hitter Luis Gonzalez also had RBI singles in Houston's big inning. </P>
<P> Doug Brocail pitched a scoreless inning to earn the victory and John Hudek got the final four outs to notch his first save of the season. </P>
<P> Astros starter Greg Swindell allowed four hits and one run, striking out seven in six innings. Loser Curt Leskanic pitched two innings, allowing four hits and three runs. </P>
<P> In Chicago, Wil Cordero hit a two-run homer in the first inning to lead the Montreal Expos to a 4-2 victory over the Cubs, who had won their first four games of the season for the first time since 1969. </P>
<P> The Expos struck quick when Tony Tarasco singled off loser Frank Castillo to open the game and Cordero followed with his first homer of the year. </P>
<P> ``It's always important in this ballpark to jump on any pitcher,'' said Cordero. ``It makes everybody on the team, especially your pitching staff, a little more comfortable.'' </P>
<P> The Expos made it 3-0 in the third when Tarasco scored on an error by catcher Rick Wilkins after a Cordero double moved him to third. Both players had three hits. </P>
<P> The Cubs scored a run off winner Gil Heredia in the fourth on an RBI single by Mark Grace. Kevin Roberson's eighth-inning homer off Tim Scott accounted for Chicago's other run. </P>
<P> In San Francisco, Jeff Conine hit two homers and drove in four runs and John Burkett pitched six shutout innings in his first start against his former teammates as the Florida Marlins rolled to a 10-3 victory over the Giants. </P>
<P> Conine hit a three-run homer in the first inning and added a solo blast in the third off San Francisco starter and loser Salomon Torres. </P>
<P> Burkett, a former 20-game winner with the Giants, allowed just three hits in six innings to earn the win. </P>
<P> In New York, Danny Sheaffer smashed a three-run home run and that's all three St Louis pitchers needed to blank the Mets 3-0. </P>
<P> Sheaffer's home run off New York starter Bobby Jones in the sixth inning, scored Scott Cooper and Brian Jordan as the Cardinals avoided a three-game sweep to New York. </P>
<P> Starter Tom Urbani allowed three hits and three walks, while striking out three before giving way to Rich DeLucia for two inning of one-hit relief. Tom Henke pitched a perfect ninth to notch his first National League save. </P>
<P> In Los Angeles, Chipper Jones picked up two RBI on two hits to pace the Atlanta Braves to a 6-3 win over the Dodgers. </P>
<P> Jones stroked an RBI single in the fourth inning and drove in another run with a double in the seventh as the Braves won for the fourth time in five starts this season. </P>
<P> Starter John Smoltz got the win. He went five innings, giving up one run on a first inning home run to Raul Mondesi, one of only three hits he allowed. </P>
<P> Ramon Martinez, who surrendered four hits and three runs in six innings, took the loss. </P>
<P> In San Diego, the Padres edged the winless Cincinnati Reds 7-6 with a run in the ninth inning on Steve Finley's sacrifice fly. </P>
<P> The Reds had tied the game with three runs in the ninth before Finley scored Andujar Cedeno with the bases loaded for the winning run. </P>
<P> Cincinnati tied the game when Reggie Sanders doubled in a run and then scored on Barry Larkin's two-run home run. </P>
