<P>  A leading medical charity active in the world's trouble spots accused Western governments Tuesday of having a fundamentally wrong approach to crises around the globe. </P>
<P> ``From Bosnia to Rwanda the emergency ethic has rebounded on the victims,'' said the secretary-general of Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF -- Doctors Without Borders), Alain Destexhe, in the introduction to an MSF report. </P>
<P> Destexhe said in the report, titled ``Populations in Danger,'' the United Nations and Western governments failed miserably in war-torn countries such as Rwanda and Bosnia because of their inability to address political problems. </P>
<P> Humanitarian action was noble, he said, when coupled with political action, but doomed to failure when used on its own. </P>
<P> ``A purely humanitarian approach acts as a blindfold which allows us to bask permanently in the warmth of our own generosity. A perverse concept of humanitarian action is triumphing in the absence of policy and justice,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``We believe more and more that humanitarian aid without political elements and justice is useless,'' he said. </P>
<P> The 168-page report, which looked at crises in Bosnia, Rwanda, Haiti, Burundi and Zaire, was harshly critical of the world's efforts to stop the genocide in Rwanda. </P>
<P> As many as 1 million people were killed in an orgy of massacres sparked by the assassination of Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana last April. </P>
<P> ``During the massacres the international community's decision-makers sat back and did next to nothing, while reflecting on the inherent problems of military intervention,'' the MSF report said. </P>
<P> ``All Western countries were slow to intervene because of experiences in Bosnia. And yet, this was an incomparable situation. This was genocide,'' it added. </P>
