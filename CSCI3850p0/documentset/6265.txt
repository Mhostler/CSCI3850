<DATELINE>ATHENS, May 4 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Athens on Thursday condemned as provocative the behaviour of a visiting Turkish government spokesman who stirred a violent protest with comments on Greece's Moslem minority. </P>
<P> Yildirim Aktuna, the Turkish spokesman and a minister of state, provoked anger in Greece by televised comments during his visit to Greece's Moslem minority in the northeastern corner of the country. </P>
<P> ``Mr Aktuna's behaviour was provocative from the moment he arrived,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Costas Bikas told reporters. ``He showed that the purpose of his visit was not to improve the climate between the two countries.'' </P>
<P> Several Greek parliamentary deputies requested that he be declared persona non grata and a crowd attacked him and his entourage in Salonika on Wednesday. </P>
<P> Aktuna prompted heated protests from officials and was denounced on the front pages of most newspapers for referring to the 120,000-strong Moslem minority as fellow Turks. </P>
<P> ``The purpose of my visit is to meet my fellow countrymen in Thrace because Turkish democracy is sensitive to the issue of Turks here,'' he told reporters after his arrival. </P>
<P> On Wednesday one Turk and one Greek policeman were injured when about 400 demonstrators -- Greeks, Armenians, Kurds and Cypriots -- attacked the bus carrying Aktuna and a group of some 30 Turkish journalists and others outside the Turkish consulate. </P>
<P> The demonstrators shattered the front window of the bus and pelted the delegation with objects as police hurried the group into the building. Turkish consulate officials told Reuters Aktuna was slightly injured in the arm. </P>
<P> One teenaged demonstrator was arrested. </P>
<P> Aktuna arrived in northern Greece on Tuesday for private talks with the Moslem minority. He leaves on Thursday after visiting the birthplace of the founder of modern Turkey, Kemal Ataturk, in Salonika. </P>
<P> Greece says the Moslems are Greeks from a mixed ethnic background with no ties to any other state. </P>
<P> But Aktuna was adamant on the sensitive point. </P>
<P> ``Everywhere I go these people tell me they are Turks. That they feel Turkish. I don't understand why you want to deny this,'' he told one reporter. </P>
<P> The Moslems are remnants of the Ottoman empire, which ruled western and eastern Thrace straddling the Greek-Turkish border, from the 15th century until 1913. </P>
<P> The Moslem minority's rights have been an issue of friction between Athens and Ankara, adding to other problems such as the divided island of Cyprus and mineral rights in the Aegean Sea. </P>
<P> Athens stresses that the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, which determines the status of the Moslem and Christian minorities in Greece and Turkey, recognises a Moslem minority in Thrace, not a Turkish one. </P>
<P> Bikas said that while Aktuna was able to freely visit the Moslem minority and see how their rights were respected, the Greek minority in Turkey had been persecuted to near extinction. </P>
<P> ``It has shrunk to a tiny size after the Turkish persecutions,'' Bikas said. </P>
