<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Representatives of striking Major League Baseball players and club owners ended two days of meetings Wednesday agreeing on little more than to resume full negotiations next week in the six-month-old labor dispute. </P>
<P> Union chief Donald Fehr said the two sides would reconvene Monday, probably in Phoenix. </P>
<P> ``We will see if we can find a way through this,'' he told reporters. ``There was no discussion today of substantive issues or proposals.'' </P>
<P> He said the next session might involve more than one set of meetings, one on core economic issues and a second on other matters. </P>
<P></P>
<P> ``I am an optimist ... I feel better at least about the dialogue. I don't want to mislead you, I don't know where this will lead us. The issues are so complex, the feelings are so deep, intense. </P>
<P> ``I don't want to exude any false optimism, but I do think it was a very constructive period. Where it leads, I don't know.'' </P>
<P> He said the two-day session in Milwaukee met their goal of setting up a process to get serious talks going again in the six-month-old dispute. </P>
<P> The meetings were the first between the two sides since Feb. </P>
<P> Earlier Colorado Rockies owner Jerry McMorris said he was concerned about Tuesday's announcement from the Teamsters Union that its members will not deliver, beer, soda and other refreshments to ball parks if it means they have to cross the players' picket lines when the season opens April 2. </P>
<P> The owners have said they plan to start the season using replacement players if necessary. The players went on strike Aug. 12 over the owners' plans to instal a salary cap, and the owners subsequently canceled the playoffs and World Series. </P>
<P> Fehr said he was not surprised at the Teamsters decision. </P>
<P> ``Its been a very big, nasty public dispute and no one thought organized labor was going to sit on its hands,'' he said. </P>
