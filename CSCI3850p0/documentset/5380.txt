<P>  Canada complained Saturday that Spanish trawlers continue to fish in disputed waters off its Atlantic Coast as negotiations with the European Union are set to resume in Brussels, Belgium. </P>
<P> ``The situation today ... is that about 10 vessels are in the disputed zone and they are fishing,'' said a spokesman for the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. ``We are continuing to monitor the situation.'' </P>
<P> The Canadian spokesman said he had no information about reports that Spain was sending a warship to the area to protect its trawlers from Canadian Coast Guard vessels. </P>
<P> Talks between the European Union and Canada to end the fishing dispute were to restart later Saturday amid pessimism over the prospects for a settlement after Spain said Ottawa had made fresh demands Friday. </P>
<P> ``We are scheduled to have a meeting this evening,'' a Canadian official told Reuters. EU officials were not immediately available for comment. </P>
<P> ``I am very pessimistic about reaching agreement because Canada put new demands on the table,'' a Spanish spokesman quoted Spain's ambassador to the European Union, Javier Elorza, as saying. </P>
<P> Elorza said Canada wanted to put fisheries inspectors on every vessel authorized to impose on-the-spot fines and had offered the EU only 32 percent of the 1995 total allowable catch for Greenland halibut or turbot. </P>
<P> Canadian Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin, however, denied Ottawa was making fresh demands. </P>
<P> ``There are no new demands being made,'' he said Friday. ''The issues that are on the table are the issues that we raised at meetings in Brussels and Vancouver on conservation and enforcement.'' </P>
<P> Earlier, officials at the European Commission, which negotiates for the 15-nation EU, said the EU was edging toward an agreement with Canada over fishing off the coast of Newfoundland. </P>
<P> Ottawa charges that Spanish and Portuguese fishermen are endangering stocks of Greenland halibut, the last major commercial species in the region, and has imposed a unilateral moratorium on fishing for turbot on the nose and tail of the Grand Banks just outside its 200-nautical mile jurisdiction. </P>
<P> Spanish fishermen say they have a right to fish in international waters and accuse Canada of stopping them illegally. Canada has seized one Spanish trawler and cut the nets of another to deter them from fishing. </P>
<P> The evironmental group Greenpeace said that Spanish vessels had been staying around the nose of the Grand Banks, making ''occasional forays'' into the disputed zone. </P>
<P> ``But they are still fishing the same stock and now that there is a warship on the way as well as an additional patrol vessel, the fishermen are feeling more secure and more determined than ever not to be driven out of the area,'' said Greenpeace activist Catherine Stewart. </P>
<P> A sister ship of the Spanish patrol vessel Vigia is due to arrive in the area to protect Spanish trawlers. </P>
