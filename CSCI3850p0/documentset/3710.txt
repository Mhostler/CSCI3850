<P>  Pope John Paul has said he is open to President Clinton's idea of closer ties between the Vatican and the United States to promote humanitarian aid, the U.S. embassy to the Vatican said Wednesday. </P>
<P> Ambassador Raymond Flynn, in a letter to Clinton released by his office, said the Pope was pleased to receive Clinton's proposal and ``told me that he hoped there would be important opportunities to coordinate our efforts to better serve victims of disease, war and natural disasters around the world.'' </P>
<P> Clinton wrote to the Pope last month to suggest that U.S. aid organizations and the Roman Catholic Church share information about crisis-hit areas in order to channel aid more effectively to its recipents. </P>
<P> Clinton said he thought closer U.S.-Vatican ties on humanitarian aid decisions could ``significantly alleviate the suffering.'' </P>
<P></P>
<P> ``The Holy See is deeply committed to drawing the attention of Catholics and all people of good will to the unity of the entire human family and to the urgent need for practical solidarity with our many disadvantaged brothers and sisters.'' </P>
<P> Flynn said the Pope had invited him to work with Cardinal Roger Etchegaray, chairman of the Vatican's Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, toward closer cooperation. </P>
<P> Clinton's move comes at a time of growing debate in the U.S. over how much humanitarian aid the country should pay out. </P>
<P> Flynn, in his letter to Clinton, said the U.S. should not scale back its aid funding. ``I firmly believe it is in America's strategic interest to remain engaged in the poorest countries and prevent their disintegration. </P>
