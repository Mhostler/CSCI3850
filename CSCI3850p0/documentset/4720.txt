<P>  Portuguese fishing boat owners Saturday dismissed as illegal Canadian threats to take action in a North Atlantic fishing dispute and said their fleet would continue to work in the area. </P>
<P> ``We have a right to work in international waters ... They can't do this. Our captains are going to keep fishing,'' the president of the Association of Industrial Fishing Boat Owners Franca Morte told national TSF radio. </P>
<P> Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Andre Ouellet said Thursday Canada would have to act if the European Union increased its catch of dwindling stocks of Greenland halibut, otherwise known as turbot, off Canada's east coast. </P>
<P> In a statement released after an emergency meeting, the Portuguese fishing boat owners condemned Canada's position. </P>
<P> ``(These) measures would be totally illegal in view of current maritime law,'' it said. </P>
<P> The association said it was confident the Portuguese government and the European Union would act to protect the ships and crews working in the international fisheries management group, the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization. </P>
<P> The group also called for Canadian fisheries officials to visit Portugal to clarify the situation and for a support vessel to be sent to protect Portuguese fishing boats off the Canadian coast. </P>
<P> The European Commission, which negotiates on fisheries for the European Union, warned Canada Friday not to take unilateral action in the dispute. </P>
