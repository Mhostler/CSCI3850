<DATELINE>CAIRO, April 26 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The PLO and Israel began a second day of talks on Palestinian elections on Wednesday and the role of Arab East Jerusalem residents was high on the agenda. </P>
<P> The delegations have not spoken to reporters since the talks began on Tuesday. </P>
<P> Saeb Erekat, head of the Palestinian team, told Reuters beforehand that this round would focus on allowing residents of Arab East Jerusalem not only to vote but to stand as candidates. </P>
<P> Israel says Palestinians in Jerusalem can elect candidates from outside their constituency but does not want them to stand. </P>
<P> This is the 15th round of talks on the elections, which were supposed to have been held last July. </P>
<P> It is also the last round before a meeting in Cairo on May 7 between Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and Nabil Shaath, in charge of planning in the Palestinian self-rule Authority, to discuss the stalled expansion of self-rule in the West Bank. </P>
<P> Palestinans refuse to hold elections in the presence of Israeli forces while Israel is reluctant to pull out its troops while radicals opposed to peace continue to attack Israelis. </P>
<P> The withdrawal of Israeli troops and Palestinian elections are part of the second phase of the 1993 accord on Palestinian self-rule. </P>
