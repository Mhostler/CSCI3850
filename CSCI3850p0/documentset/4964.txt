<P>  A troupe of Russian skaters stranded in Oklahoma since September after financing for a U.S. tour fell through are getting a $50,000 interest-free loan from a cable company. </P>
<P> Evangelist Pat Robertson's The Family Channel, through its parent company International Family Entertainment, will loan the troupe the money to promote five shows in Oklahoma City, the company's spokeswoman said late Wednesday. </P>
<P> The Family Channel's involvement came after Robertson, who is chairman of International Family, watched news of the plight of the skaters on a CBS broadcast recently. </P>
<P> The skaters were tossed out of the hotel they were staying in Thanksgiving Day for nonpayment and have since moved seven times, each time depending on local good will for food and shelter. </P>
<P> Most recently, they have been living in an Oklahoma City YMCA which let them move into an unused seventh floor where they have been sleeping on mattresses on the floor. </P>
<P> The troupe's production manager C.C. Haley told Reuters late Wednesday the generosity of Oklahomans has been an eye-opener for the Russians. </P>
<P> ``They don't have this kind of giving tradition. Help in Russia is mainly limited to sharing among family members, but total strangers coming to the rescue without expecting anything is an American thing,'' he said. </P>
