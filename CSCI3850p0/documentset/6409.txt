<DATELINE>TALLINN, Estonia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Baltic nations Tuesday remembered victory over Nazi Germany but, in contrast to other former Soviet republics, they viewed the events of 50 years ago as the start of a further occupation, not liberation. </P>
<P> The presidents of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania declined invitations to join other world leaders in Moscow for elaborate ceremonies. Instead, they commemorated the 50th anniversary of the end of the war Monday, like most of the rest of Europe. </P>
<P> ``Estonia does not fight against the dead, but against ideological systems which preach totalitarianism,'' Estonian President Lennert Meri said Tuesday after returning from commemorations in London and Paris. </P>
<P> In the run-up to the war anniversary events, Baltic leaders waited in vain for Russian President Boris Yeltsin to apologize for the Soviet occupation of their countries in 1940 under secret protocols of the Nazi-Soviet pact. </P>
<P> ``I would still hope that President Yeltsin will distance himself unambiguously from Stalin's aggressive foreign policy, which victimized the Baltic states and Poland,'' Meri said. </P>
<P> In Lithuania, President Algirdas Brazausakas said at ceremonies Monday that both Stalinism and Nazism were guilty for Lithuania's loss of statehood. </P>
<P> ``By 1941, Lithuanians understood the essence of Stalinism. They understood that the return of Soviet troops (after the war) would not mean liberation, but a new occupation.'' </P>
<P> Brazauskas also accused the Western allies of allowing the Soviet Union to legitimize its annexation of the Baltic states after the war. </P>
<P> ``The policy of the allies is not beyond reproach either. Blame for the fact that on May 8, 1945, the hour of freedom did not ring in the Baltic states falls not on the ruling regime of the Soviet Union alone.'' </P>
<P> Brazauskas laid a wreath at Pirciupiai village near the capital Vilnius where 119 people were burned to death by Nazis in June 1944. About 250,000 people in Lithuania were killed during the war, 80 percent of them Jews. </P>
<P> Many in the Baltic states saw the Nazis as potential liberators from Soviet control and domestic Nazi SS units were formed in both Estonia and Latvia. Others fought in the Soviet army or in partisan groups against both sides. </P>
<P> ``Many Latvians were involved with the Soviet army, others with the Germany army. The nation was split,'' said Latvian Foreign Ministry spokesman Rihards Mucins. </P>
<P> ``We cannot celebrate this as a victory of one side over the other. As far as we are concerned, the consequences of the war ended only last year,'' he said, referring to the final pullout of Russian troops following the breakup of the Soviet Union. </P>
<P> The issue remains deeply divisive, especially among the large ethnic Russian communities in Latvia and Estonia. </P>
<P> In Estonia, a Russian organization issued a statement protesting against the lack of official celebrations Tuesday. </P>
<P> Russian television showed large crowds of veterans marching with red Soviet flags in the Latvian capital, Riga. </P>
