<DATELINE>PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A U.S. soldier died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound outside a Port-au-Prince villa Tuesday, the first American fatality in Haiti since U.S. troops went into the Caribbean country eight days ago to help restore democracy. </P>
<P> U.S. defense officials called the death an apparent suicide, but U.S. officials here said it was unclear if the shooting was intentional. </P>
<P> In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Dennis Boxx said it appeared as though the death was an apparent suicide. </P>
<P> But Colonel Barry Willey, a military official in Port-au-Prince, said an investigation was continuing. </P>
<P> ``It appears to have been a self-inflicted wound and not the result of a sniper,'' Willey said. </P>
<P> He said the soldier's rifle and an M-16 bullet casing were found beside the body. </P>
<P> The shooting occurred early Tuesday while the soldier was on duty near a Haitian government-owned hotel that is to house several members of parliament. </P>
<P> A defense official, who spoke on condition he not be identified, said the soldier appeared to have died of gunshot fired by his own rifle and said the soldier had apparently been distressed over a domestic problem. </P>
<P> When asked if he was married, the official said ``Well, I think that is part of what the issue was.'' </P>
