<P>  Germany plans to become the first country to introduce an extensive program of random blood tests during training in a bid to catch athletes who cheat with performance-enhancing drugs. </P>
<P> German sports federation (DSB) vice-president Ulrich Feldhoff said Tuesday that the federation planned around 20,000 annual tests on athletes from all major sports. </P>
<P> The program, the first of its kind, is expected to be introduced in the last quarter of the year. International, national and junior German athletes will now have to undergo random urine and blood tests in the run-up to next year's Olympic Games in Atlanta. </P>
<P> ``Following (scientific) reports, the DSB's anti-doping commission has put forward the proposal to the federation's board that the tests be introduced this autumn,'' Feldhoff told Reuters. ``I expect the board to back the proposal.'' </P>
<P> ``The credibility of top-class sport is on the line at the moment. Some people have not understood that yet. If this problem of doping is not solved, the whole future of top-class sport is in danger. The situation is critical.'' </P>
<P> Germany was one of the first countries to introduce random urine tests during training following the Ben Johnson drugs scandal at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. </P>
<P> The present move comes at a time when the country has another major doping scandal looming on the horizon. </P>
<P> Last week the DSB announced an investigation into allegations that athletes are involved in serious drug abuse at one of the country's elite Olympic training centres. </P>
<P> Ulrich Eicke, the head of the Cologne and Leverkusen Olympic training center, who informed the DSB of his concern about the cheating, faces a key DSB hearing Friday. </P>
<P> Many countries test the urine of athletes during training and competition. But scientists believe blood tests are often more efficient because a banned substance can be detected for a longer period in blood than in urine. </P>
<P> They are not believed to be foolproof, however, since some experts suspect they are not always better than urine testing in every case, depending on the banned substance the athletes are taking. </P>
