<P>  Immigration officers in Hong Kong and the United States broke up a human smuggling ring Thursday in coordinated raids in the British colony and New York. </P>
<P> A Hong Kong immigration department spokesman said an early morning raid on three apartments in Kowloon district caught three ``snakeheads'' -- the nickname for smugglers who specialize in spiriting people out of China -- and 10 mainland Chinese holding false papers supplied by the snakeheads for entry to the United States. </P>
<P> New York police picked up 14 people, the Hong Kong immigration officer said, but would not elaborate. </P>
<P> The mainland Chinese entered Hong Kong on visitors' visas and obtained false papers and flights to the United States from members of the syndicate in Hong Kong. </P>
<P> Ordinary Chinese promise to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy their way into the United States. Many disappear into Chinatowns to work as semi-indentured laborers in restaurants or factory sweatshops to repay the debt. </P>
