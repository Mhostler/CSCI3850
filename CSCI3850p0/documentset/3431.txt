<P>  Burmese military authorities have imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew in a western town after a violent clash between Muslims and Buddhists which left at least three dead, an Islamic opponent of the Burmese regime said Monday. </P>
<P> The violent clash broke out two weeks ago in Sittwe in western Burma's Arakan state when hundreds of angry Buddhists burned down three mosques. </P>
<P> The attack on the mosques was apparently sparked by a private dispute between a Buddhist and a Muslim. Three Muslims were killed and a number of others injured in subsequent clashes, a member of the insurgent Arakan Rohingya Islamic Front told Reuters. </P>
<P> Government soldiers fired into the air to disperse the crowds and military authorities imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew, the source said. The situation had since calmed down but the curfew remained in force, he said. </P>
<P> Arakan is the only state in predominantly Buddhist Burma with a large Muslim population. </P>
<P> More than 250,000 Arakanese Muslims, known as Rohingya, fled to neighboring Bangladesh in 1992 citing persecution by the Burmese military. </P>
<P> Half of them have now returned home under a repatriation program supervised by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. </P>
