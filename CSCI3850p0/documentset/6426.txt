<P>  Cambodia, one of the world's most mine-infested countries, will draft legislation banning the use of land mines, Information Minister Ieng Mouly said on Wednesday. </P>
<P> If the legislation is passed, Cambodia would become the first Asian country to formally outlaw the use of land mines in its military arsenal. </P>
<P> ``We are also working out now a draft law in cooperation with some NGOs (Non Government Organisations) to legislate this banning of anti-personnel land-mines and also the destruction of stockpile of land mines,'' Mouly told a news conference. </P>
<P> Mouly is also Director of the Cambodian Mine Action Centre (CMAC), an umbrella body which oversees mine clearing operations in the country. </P>
<P> He said some elements of the military were opposed to a total ban on land mines while the government army was still fighting a low-level guerrilla war against Khmer Rouge guerrillas. </P>
<P> ``In some areas, there is resistance to de-mining. I can say frankly, from the military,'' Mouly said. </P>
<P> A ban on land mines would act as a valuable inducement to foreign aid donors to provide cash for continued mine clearing operations and help guarantee CMAC's viability, he said. </P>
<P> The CMAC chief said latest estimates of uncleared mines were between six and 10 million. </P>
<P> Mouly said the main problem in clearing mines was the cost. </P>
<P> ``One mine costs five to seven dollars. But once the mine is planted we need $1,000 to remove it,'' he said. </P>
<P> CMAC's annual budget was about six million dollars a year, said Mouly. </P>
<P> Earlier this year at an international donors meeting in Paris, only Australia and Britain pledged money for mine clearing, Mouly said. </P>
<P> Cambodia now had more than 2,000 trained mine clearers, including 1,558 employed by CMAC. </P>
<P> Mouly said clearing the mines by hand was the only effective method of ridding Cambodia of its mine menace, a by-product of more than 25 years of war. </P>
