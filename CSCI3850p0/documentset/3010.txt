<P>  People on Medicare will have more rights to appeal medical and payment decisions made by managed care plans under a regulation announced Monday. </P>
<P> Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said the rule will give managed care patients appeal rights similar to patients in traditional fee-for-service medical arrangements. </P>
<P> Medicare covers people over 65. About 2.8 million Medicare recipients are enrolled in 227 managed care plans, such as health maintenance organizations. </P>
<P> The rule announced by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) require immediate reviews when patients believe they have been discharged from hospitals too early. It requires responses within 60 days when patients ask their health plans to reconsider decisions about payments or about medical services covered by Medicare. </P>
<P> HCFA administrator said the new regulation fills a gap but he said that most managed-care organizations ``are already responsive to their enrollees and conduct requested reconsiderations in a timely manner.'' </P>
