<P>  Several environmental groups sued the United States Thursday in an effort to force the imposition of sanctions on Italy for driftnet fishing. </P>
<P> A lawyer for the Defenders of Wildlife said about 600 Italian vessels had continued driftnet fishing despite a 1991 United Nations ban and a 1992 U.S. law that threatens sanctions against violators. </P>
<P> ``All of Europe knows they have been violating the ban. It's common knowledge,'' said attorney Bill Snape. He said the State Department had been ``dragging its feet'' because it hoped to avoid imposing trade sanctions on an ally. </P>
<P> The lawsuit filed in the U.S. Court of International Trade said Italy's alleged fishing practices force the United States to impose sanctions on fish product imports within 90 days if negotiations do not resolve the driftnet fishing issue. </P>
<P> The U.S. 1992 High-Seas Driftnet Enforcement Act, which would prohibit Italy's annual $2 million of fish product exports to the United States and $1 billion of coral product exports, was the only mechanism to enforce the ban, he said. </P>
<P> The State Department and the Commerce Department, both named in the lawsuit, and the Italian Embassy could not immediately be reached for comment on the lawsuit. </P>
<P> Attorney Patti Goldman for the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund said the group has been presenting evidence for about two years to the State Department on the violations. She said continued driftnet fishing of the Mediterranean Sea kills sea turtles, sea birds, sharks and about 2,000 to 3,000 whales and dolphins annually and has driven down populations of Striped Dolphins and swordfish. </P>
<P> ``It's basically strip-mining of the sea,'' Snape said. </P>
<P> He said the groups are also monitoring the practices of Spain, France and Taiwan and would consider similar actions against them if successful against Italy. </P>
<P> Goldman said she hoped the lawsuit would spur efforts of the European Union to ban driftnets altogether and of groups in Italy proposing a buy-back program for the nets. </P>
<P> The Humane Society of the United States, the Humane Society International, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society and the Earth Island Institute are also among the plaintiffs. </P>
