<P>  The United Nations said Wednesday that northern and southern Yemeni officials will meet in Paris next week to begin reconciliation talks after their two-month civil war. </P>
<P> Spokesman Ahmed Fawzi said special U.N. envoy Lakhdar Brahimi would arrive in Paris July 28 and remain there for three days to mediate a ``resumption of the national dialogue.'' </P>
<P> Yemen's war ended July 7 with the northern capture of southern cities and military sites, crushing a southern bid to break away from four years of unity with the north. </P>
<P> Brahimi, a former Algerian foreign minister, is currently in London for South Africa's return to the Commonwealth after a 33-year absence. He served as the head of U.N. operations during South Africa's recent elections. </P>
