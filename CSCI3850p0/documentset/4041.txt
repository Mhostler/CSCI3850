<P>  As Jerry Rice basked in the afterglow of his team's Super Bowl victory Sunday, the batch of records he set along the way were the furthest thing from his mind. </P>
<P> Rice, playing in his third Super Bowl, caught 10 passes for 149 yards and three touchdowns, setting new career Super Bowl records for touchdowns (7), points scored (42), total receptions (28) and receiving yardage (512). He also tied the record for most touchdowns in one game. </P>
<P> ``It's not about records,'' Rice said after the 49ers' 49-26 rout of the San Diego Chargers Sunday. ``Records don't mean that much.'' </P>
<P> Standing on the sideline with four minutes left in the game, Rice fought back the tears as his thoughts turned to his team and their collective achievement. </P>
<P> ``I'm an emotional guy,'' he said. ``I don't mind shedding tears.'' </P>
<P> Rice was nearly forced from the game after suffering a separated left shoulder in the second quarter. </P>
<P> He said sheer determination kept him going, playing through the pain with the searing intensity he has shown throughout his brilliant career. </P>
<P> ``There was no way anything was going to keep me out of the game,'' Rice said afterward, his shoulder wrapped in ice. </P>
<P> ``I didn't want to go out that way. I just had to block it out. I couldn't let my team down. I felt as long as I was on the field, I was a threat.'' </P>
<P> Rice was more than a threat. He caught his first touchdown pass barely 90 seconds into the game. He scored his second late in the third quarter, and tacked on another early in the fourth quarter. </P>
<P> ``The mark of a great receiver is when he can play hurt,'' Rice said, adding: ``Anybody can go out there healthy and make the plays.'' </P>
<P> And as if the injury were not enough adversity, Rice also reported that he began to feel ill Friday and received intravenous treatment Saturday night and Sunday afternoon. </P>
<P> ``In warm-ups I felt good, but then the legs felt weak and I got a little scared,'' he explained. </P>
<P> Rice deflected the superlatives aimed at him after the game, preferring to keep the spotlight where he said it belonged: on his teammates. </P>
<P> But he could not stop his teammates from turning the spotlight back his way. </P>
<P> ``Jerry Rice is the best, simply the best,'' said 49er linebacker Ken Norton, Jr. ``The records he's put up, the numbers, and the fact that he keeps going and going.'' </P>
