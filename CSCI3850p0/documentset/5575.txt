<P> Americans will be able to sleep a little better at night and wake up feeling less anxious about their futures. I represent the people who work at the Ford plant in Hapeville, Georgia. The Ford Motor Company, like all the domestic auto industry, faced the need to change in order to keep up with tougher competition. Today they produce twice as many cars per employee at three times the quality. And General Motors and Chrysler are doing the very same thing. So are America's small businesses. They're all rethinking the way they operate. Should government be any different? Of course not. </P>
<P> We sincerely believe we can reduce spending and at the same time make government better. You know, virtually every institution in America except government has re-engineered itself to become more efficient over the last decade. They cut spending, provided better products, better education and better service for less. But I believe we must remake government for reasons much larger than saving money or improving services. </P>
<P> The fact is, no civilization can survive with 12-year-olds having babies, with 15-year-olds killing each other, with 17-year-olds dying of AIDS, with 18-year-olds getting diplomas they can't even read. Every night on every local news we see the human tragedies that have grown out of the current welfare state. As a father of two daughters, I can't ignore the terror and worry parents in our inner cities must feel for their children. Within a half-mile of this Capitol, your Capitol, drugs, violence and despair threaten the lives of our citizens. </P>
<P> We cannot ignore our fellow Americans in such desperate straits by thinking that huge amounts of tax dollars release us from our moral responsibility to help these parents and their children. There is no reason the federal government must keep an allegiance to failure. You know, with good will, with common sense, with the courage to change, we can do better for all Americans. </P>
<P> Another fact we cannot turn our head away from is this: No truly moral civilization would burden its children with the economic excesses of the parents and grandparents. Now, this talk of burdening future generations is not just rhetoric. We're talking about hard economic consequences that will limit our children and grandchildren's standard of living. Yet that is what we are doing for the children trapped in poverty, for the children whose futures are trapped by a government debt they're going to have to pay. </P>
<P> We have an obligation tonight to talk about the legacy we are leaving our children and our grandchildren, an obligation to talk about the deliberate remaking of our government. This change will not be accomplished in the next 100 days. But we must start by recognizing the moral and economic failure of the current methods of government. </P>
<P> In these last 100 days, we have begun to change those failed methods. We outlined 10 major proposals in the Contract that begin to break the logjam of the past. The House passed nine out of 10. First, we passed the Shays Act, which makes the Congress obey all the laws that other Americans have to obey. The House passed it, the Senate passed it and the president signed it. So that's one law signed, sealed and delivered. </P>
<P> We passed the balanced budget amendment in the House with bipartisan support. It has been temporarily defeated in the Senate by one vote. Although constitutional amendments are harder to get through Congress because they require a two-thirds vote rather than a simple majority, don't be discouraged. Senator Dole has said he will call it up for another vote. The momentum is with us. And with your help and your voice, I believe it is possible this amendment will pass later in this Congress. </P>
<P> As promised, we introduced a constitutional amendment on term limits, but we failed, even though 85 percent of House Republicans voted for it; again, that two-thirds vote. There have been 180 bills introduced to limit congressional terms over America's history, but not one of them ever made it to the House floor until last week, when we brought term limits to a vote. I pledge to you that term limits will be the first vote of the next Congress. So keep the pressure on. Keep your hopes up. </P>
<P> In both the House and the Senate, we passed the line-item veto, just as you asked. It's remarkable that a Republican House and a Republican Senate are giving such a strong tool to the president of the other party. I believe it shows our good-faith determination to cut spending. </P>
<P> Other Contract proposals have passed the House and are being worked on in the Senate. We passed regulatory reform, legal reform and welfare reform. We passed a $500 tax credit per child. We passed an increase in the earning limit for senior citizens so they won't have their Social Security checks cut if they earn extra money. We passed a capital gains tax cut and indexed those gains to spur the savings and investment that creates jobs. </P>
