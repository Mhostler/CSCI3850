<P>  The special United Nations envoy to Burundi said Thursday he was taking seriously a local newspaper's threats against him and the U.S. ambassador. </P>
<P> Ahmedou Ould Abdallah said the newspaper, La Nation, was owned by Burundi's former military president, Jean-Baptiste Bagaza. </P>
<P> ``Two diplomats to combat or to kill?'' asked La Nation's front-page article in this week's issue. </P>
<P> ``I am taking this very seriously but I am not intimidated and I am not impressed,'' Abdallah, who is at the center of international efforts to avert ethnic war between Burundi's Hutus and Tutsis, told Reuters. </P>
<P> ``Bagaza owns this newspaper,'' he said in a telephone interview with Reuters in Nairobi. </P>
<P> La Nation made what were tantamount to death threats against Abdallah and U.S. ambassador Robert Krueger. </P>
<P> ``Those who write such articles by their own admission are enemies of democracy,'' Krueger, who took up his posting in June last year, told Reuters. </P>
<P> La Nation accused the two envoys of siding with the majority Frodebu (Burundi Front for Democracy) party which draws most of its support from the country's Hutus. </P>
<P> ``Sometimes diplomatic immunity has no meaning, particularly in time of war. Well, we are at war...'' La Nation said. </P>
<P> It justified the 1961 death of then U.N. Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold in an unexplained air crash in what is now Zambia and the killing of the French ambassador in Kinshasa in 1993 on grounds that both had interfered in Zaire's affairs. Hammarskjold was on a mission to Zaire at the time. </P>
<P> La Nation, whose circulation is unknown, advised the two diplomats to leave Burundi as soon as possible. </P>
