<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Sinn Fein head Gerry Adams said Friday it was vital that Ireland quickly form a government to keep up the momentum of Northern Ireland peace. </P>
<P> ``The sooner they form a government the better so that politicians can concentrate on the peace process,'' the leader of the IRA's political wing told reporters in Dublin. </P>
<P> He was speaking as Ireland's political parties continued to try to form a coalition after the government collapsed last week when prime minister Albert Reynolds was forced to resign. </P>
<P> Political sources said it seemed likely Reynolds' party, Fianna Fail, would eventually strike a bargain with its former coalition ally, the Labor party of Dick Spring, but they believed it could take at least another week. </P>
<P> The parties have given themselves until parliament reconvenes Wednesday to work out a new government, but the house could resume work and adjourn again for more talks to avoid having to call early elections, the sources said. </P>
<P> All parties have said the Northern Ireland peace drive co-launched by Reynolds is top of their agenda and that the formation of a government is urgently needed to keep the momentum going. </P>
<P> The commitment was underlined Friday when caretaker premier Reynolds attended a Forum set up to discuss the shape of a new ``agreed Ireland'' to heal divisions between North and South, Catholic and Protestant. </P>
<P> He was accompanied by Bertie Ahern, acting finance minister and the man who replaced him as Fianna Fail leader when the prime minister was forced to step down in a dispute over the Attorney-General's handling of a child sex abuse case. </P>
<P> Also present was John Bruton, head of the main opposiiton party Fine Gael, which is trying to lure the Labor party into forming a so-called ``rainbow coalition'' government. </P>
<P> The sources said Fine Gael was considering a suggestion by Labor that the premiership rotate between the two parties, a proposal Labor tried in vain to put to Fianna Fail in 1992. </P>
<P> Labor holds the balance of power with 32 seats in the 165- seat assembly. </P>
<P> Adams' Sinn Fein is worried that the momentum of Northern Ireland peace efforts is slowing because of the Irish government crisis and has put at risk the second phase of an Anglo-Irish initiative due to be unveiled next month. </P>
<P> Adams also said Thursday he had written to British Prime Minister John Major urging him to speed up arrangements for promised pre-Christmas talks with Sinn Fein. </P>
<P> ``Almost three months after the historic IRA announcement, the British government continues to stall,'' Adams said. He accused London of foot-dragging in stark contrast to Dublin. </P>
<P> Britain and Ireland were planning a summit at which a so-called framework document setting out proposals for new all-party talks was due to be unveiled. It is not known whether the summit will now go ahead. </P>
<P> Adams told the national Forum for Peace and Reconciliation on Friday that the province's Unionist parties should stop clinging to their British status. </P>
<P> He said the Unionists, who want to maintain their links to Britain, had nothing to fear from Sinn Fein, which is committed to ending the seven decades-old partition of Ireland. </P>
<P> ``What nationalists can do is to assure Unionists that we have no wish to coerce them into anything and we have no wish to dominate them. As victims of coercion and domination, we know that these inspire hostility...'' he said. </P>
