<P>  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Wednesday he believed Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat was much stronger than many people thought in his battle to guide the future of Palestinian self-rule. </P>
<P> ``I believe he is stronger than people think,'' Rabin told a news conference shortly before leaving Tokyo for Seoul at the end of a three-day visit. </P>
<P> Since returning to Gaza in July, Arafat has faced challenges from groups regarded by many people as extreme in their demands for greater scope and a faster pace for self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. </P>
<P> Rabin has faced strong criticism in Israel over last year's Middle East peace agreement, with critics arguing that he conceded too much to Arafat. </P>
<P> Wednesday, Rabin said he remained committed to the pact. </P>
<P> ``As long as I have my majority of one I will continue the policy of peace, and parallel with this I will fight terrorism with every means that I am allowed by the law,'' he said. </P>
<P> In meetings with top Japanese government leaders, Rabin repeatedly warned against the rise of radical Islamic fundamentalists as a destabilizing force in the Middle East. </P>
<P> In the news conference, Rabin singled out Iran as the Middle East country giving most support to radical elements and Syria as the nation that could do the most to push peace in the region. </P>
<P> He also expressed fears that North Korea had exported nuclear technology and military equipment to Iran. The comment was an indirect plea to Japan to think hard about its policy of giving aid to Tehran. </P>
<P> Rabin urged Japan to provide financial assistance to end poverty in the area, saying that poverty breeds terrorism. </P>
<P> Tokyo has already pledged nearly $200 million toward the start-up costs of Palestinian self-rule, of which roughly half has already been provided. </P>
<P> Tokyo offered its help in repairing the Allenby Bridge, the crossing point between the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Jordan. Monday, Rabin asked for Japan's assistance in building a dam on Jordan's leg of the Yarmuk River in a meeting with Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama. </P>
