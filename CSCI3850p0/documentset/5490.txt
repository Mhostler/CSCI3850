<P>  Tiger Woods, the sensational 19-year-old amateur making his Masters debut, left the course early in his practice round Wednesday to receive treatment for back spasms but returned later to play again. </P>
<P> Woods, who qualified for the elite, 87-player Masters field by becoming the youngest player to win the U.S. Amateur title, hurt his back swinging from the tee of the par-4 fifth hole and left his practice partners Nick Price and Greg Norman to seek treatment at the medical trailer. </P>
<P> His father, Earl, came out of the trailer and said the Stanford freshman still expected to make his 1:03 p.m. opening round tee time Thursday with defending champion Jose Maria Olazabal of Spain as scheduled. </P>
<P> Earl Woods said Tiger has been troubled in the past with spasms in his lower back and that the rising star was getting electrical stimulation treatment for the injury. </P>
<P> Woods, showing the resilience of youth, left the medical trailer saying he still intended to play in Wednesday afternoon's traditional par-three tournament. </P>
<P> ``I just had a little twinge in my back. I'm fine,'' said Woods, who quit his practice round after hitting his second shot on the fifth hole. ``I've done it before. </P>
<P> ``I have no pain and I'm ready to go,'' said Woods, who also stopped off for a few minutes work at the practice putting green. </P>
<P> Woods was true to his word and participated in the par-3 contest. </P>
<P> The lanky American, perhaps mindful of the hex in which no par-3 tournament winner ever claimed the Masters title, finished comfortably off the pace at 2-over-par 29. </P>
