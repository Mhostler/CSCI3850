<DATELINE>PONTIAC, Mich.(Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Dave Krieg overshadowed his star runningback Barry Sanders and outdueled Buffalo's Jim Kelly Thursday when he passed for 351 yards and three touchdowns to lead the Lions to a 35-21 victory over the Bills in Detroit's traditional Thanksgiving Day game. </P>
<P> Krieg completed 20-of-25 passes, including seven to Herman Moore for 169 yards and did not thow an interception to help the Lions (6-6) stay in the playoff hunt in the NFC. </P>
<P> Kelly threw two touchdown passes and ran for another score for the Bills (6-6), losers of three of their last four games. </P>
<P> He completed 29-of-35 passes for 273 yards, but threw two costly interceptions to Willie Clay, who returned the second one 28 yards for the clinching touchdown with 1:07 left. </P>
<P> The expected battle between outstanding running backs did not develop as the quarterbacks took over the show. </P>
<P> Sanders ran 19 times for 45 yards to raise his league-leading total to 1,406, while Buffalo's Thurman Thomas had 58 yards on 17 carries. </P>
<P> ``Dave Krieg had the game of his life,'' Kelly said. </P>
<P> ``I was telling everybody all during the course of the week that you can't just key on Barry (Sanders), you've got to worry about Dave Krieg. I don't think they took me seriously.'' </P>
<P> At Dallas, third-string quarterback Jason Garrett directed the offense to 36 second-half points as the Super Bowl champion Cowboys rallied for a 42-31 victory over the Green Bay Packers. </P>
<P> Garrett, forced to start when Troy Aikman and Rodney Peete were injured last weekend, was 15-of-26 for 311 yards, throwing touchdown passes of 45 yards to Alvin Harper and 35 yards to Michael Irvin. </P>
<P> Emmitt Smith rushed for 133 yards and two touchdowns for the league-leading Cowboys (10-2), who overcame a 24-13 third-quarter deficit and improved to 18-8-1 all-time on Thanksgiving. Smith also caught six passes for 95 yards. </P>
<P> Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre was 27-of-40 for 257 yards and connected on four touchdown strikes to All-Pro wide receiver Sterling Sharpe. </P>
<P> The Packers, who led 17-6 at halftime, dropped to 6-6 with their second consecutive defeat. </P>
<P> Sharpe caught nine passes for 122 yards and tied a team record for touchdown catches in one game established by himself and Don Hutson. </P>
