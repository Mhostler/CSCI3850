<P>  President Clinton had several skin growths removed from his forehead and behind his ear but they were not cancerous, the White House said Monday. </P>
<P> Spokesman Mike McCurry said the growths, called actinic keratoses, resulted from many years of exposure to the sun and were burned off by touching them with liquid nitrogen during Clinton's physical examination last Friday. </P>
<P> ``They are not cancerous,'' McCurry said. ``They can be under some circumstances, they can develop'' into cancerous growths if left untreated for a long time. </P>
<P> Although the ailment and the procedure to treat it are fairly common, the White House did not mention it when Clinton had his annual physical exam at Bethesda Naval Hospital. </P>
<P> Reporters were told only after asking about a red blotch on Clinton's forehead they noticed when the president spoke at an event in Washington. </P>
<P> A Washington dermatologist, Edward Stolar, said actinic keratoses are ``pre-cancerous growths'' that are induced by the sun over a lifetime of exposure. </P>
<P> ``They're not cancerous but if left untreated a certain percentage of them can develop into cancer over a long period of time. It's a very common thing, especially in fair-skinned individuals who've had a lot of exposure to the sun over a lifetime,'' he said in a telephone interview. </P>
<P> A White House spokeswoman, Mary Ellen Glynn, said the growths were not mentioned Friday in the description of Clinton's physical exam because they were considered insignificant. ``They're very, very common,'' she said. </P>
<P> Asked how many had been removed, McCurry would say only ''several places on his forehead and behind his ear.'' He said the fair-skinned Clinton developed them from many years of overexposure to the sun and that the president, a frequent golfer, was now routinely using sunscreen. </P>
<P> Glynn said Clinton had had similar growths removed ``many times'' over the past 10 years. She had no other details. </P>
<P> The American Academy of Dermatologists said actinic keratoses are the most common pre-malignant skin condition, occurring in more than 5 million Americans, most of them older. </P>
<P> If left untreated, they may grow in diameter and can occasionally develop into squamous cell carcinoma, a form of skin cancer, the academy said in a statement. </P>
<P> Former president Ronald Reagan suffered from bouts with the sun as well. Reagan had three small skin cancers cut off his nose in 1985 and 1987. </P>
