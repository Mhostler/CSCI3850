<P>  Tickets for the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta are tentatively set to go on sale next May 1, officials said Thursday. </P>
<P> Billy Payne, president of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG), disclosed the date to reporters at the 1994 U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC) Congress here. </P>
<P> ``From the best we can tell and calculate, we have approximately the same number of tickets available as Barcelona, Los Angeles and Lillehammer combined,'' Payne later said in a speech at the USOC conference. </P>
<P> ``That's the good news. There are tickets for everybody. To some degree, of course, I must confess the bad news and that is some of the events will be immediately oversubscribed.'' </P>
<P> Payne said tickets for some of the 560 sporting events scheduled to take place during 17 days in July 1996 will be subjected to a lottery system similar to the one employed during the 1984 Games in Los Angeles. </P>
<P> ``There will be some disappointed folks. However, every single event has a ticket available for as little as $25. No event is priced out of the capablility of the average American family,'' he added. </P>
<P> Olympic organizers will offer nearly 12 million tickets in hopes of raising proceeds equal to 11 percent of the $1.95 billion in total revenues sought by ACOG and the USOC for the Games. </P>
<P> Ticket prices, which include the cost of transportation between venues, will range as high as $250 for athletic events. Tickets for the opening and closing ceremonies have been set at $200, $400 and $600. </P>
<P> ACOG plans to make tickets available initially by direct mail and later by telephone. All tickets will be shipped to buyers in mid-1996. </P>
