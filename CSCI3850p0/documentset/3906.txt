<DATELINE>MELBOURNE, Australia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Michael Chang reached the semifinals of the Australian Open with a 7-6, 7-5, 6-3, victory over Ukrainian Andrei Medvedev on Center Court Monday. </P>
<P> He once again proved his physical and mental stamina in a dour baseline battle with Medvedev of two hours and 23 minutes. </P>
<P> The fifth-seeded Chang will face either top seed Pete Sampras or Jim Courier, seeded ninth, who were scheduled to meet later in the day. </P>
<P> Largely ignored in the media frenzy that has surrounded top seeds Sampras and Andre Agassi, Chang has moved through the draw with an ominous ease, dropping only one set in five matches in Melbourne. </P>
<P> ``I feel I am in great shape, which is important in the latter stages of the tournament,'' said Chang, whose only concern could be a minor leg injury, which he refused to detail. </P>
<P> ``It is nothing too serious but we will leave it at that because Jim and Pete read the papers, but it is definitely not cramp,'' Chang said. </P>
<P> It will be 22-year-old Chang's first semifinal appearance at a Grand Slam since his defeat to eventual champion Stefan Edberg of Sweden at the U.S. Open three years ago. </P>
<P> The 1989 French Open champion methodically probed Medvedev from the back of the court and gradually wore down the 13th seed's resolve. </P>
<P> Medvedev, however, was hampered by a painful injury to his left wrist when he fell heavily at a critical moment during the first-set tie-break. </P>
<P> Trailing 3-4, Medvedev lost his footing as he lunged to his left for a volley, with his wrists taking the full impact of his fall on the hard Rebound Ace surface. </P>
<P> After calling for an injury time-out, Medvedev played in obvious pain throughout the remainder of the tie-break, which Chang eventually won 9-7. </P>
<P> ``It was painful but I could play... They think it's just bruising, but it may be ligaments and I might need X-rays,'' said Medvedev, who declined to blame the injury for his demise. </P>
<P> Medvedev, who received further treatment during the next three service breaks, lost his serve four times during the second set. </P>
<P> His frustration boiled over when he received a code violation warning for smashing the net with his racket. </P>
<P> Medvedev said Chang had the ability to ``go all the way,'' adding: ``Michael played very good counter-attacking tennis.'' </P>
