<P>  Three convicted drug traffickers were hanged Friday morning at Singapore's Changi Prison, the Central Narcotics Bureau said in a statement. </P>
<P> The death sentence is mandatory in Singapore for anyone found guilty of trafficking in more than half an ounce of heroin, an ounce of morphine or 18 ounces of marijuana. </P>
<P> Last Friday Singapore executed a 59-year-old Dutch engineer for drug trafficking. Johannes van Damme, arrested at Singapore Changi Airport in September 1991, was the first Westerner to hang here for a drug offense. </P>
<P> Those executed Friday were Malaysians Abdul Rashid Mohamed, 39, and Abdullah Abdul Rahman, 40, who were convicted of transporting 2.7 ounces of heroin, and Singaporean Goh Lai Wak, 39, who was convicted of possessing 4.4 pounds of heroin. </P>
<P> Law Minister Shanmugam Jayakumar said after van Damme was executed that 76 people, half of them foreigners, had been hanged in Singapore since the death penalty for drug offenses was imposed in the 1970s. </P>
