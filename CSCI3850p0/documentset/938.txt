<DATELINE>LAGOS, Nigeria (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Nigeria's crisis pitting a southern multimillionaire businessman against entrenched northern generals threatens to ignite a wider ethnic conflict. </P>
<P> While businessman and opposition leader Moshood Abiola bides his time in jail on treason charges and military ruler General Sani Abacha shows no sign of compromise, Africa's most populous country is paralyzed by strikes and sporadic riots. </P>
<P> Militant oil unions demanding Abiola's release and installation as president have been on strike since July 4 and brought Nigeria's oil-dependent economy to its knees. </P>
<P> ``Abacha's greatest advantage is that people underestimate him. They think he is a pushover,'' said one Western diplomat. </P>
<P> Abacha shocked leaders of the striking oil unions last week when he dismissed them and ordered the strikers back to work without giving in to any of their 10-point demands. </P>
<P> Abacha, 51, is Nigeria's eighth military ruler and is as uncompromising as he is inscrutable. </P>
<P> He seized power in November during the anarchy unleashed by the annulment of last year's presidential election, which Abiola -- one of the few candidates allowed by the generals to run -- is widely believed to have won. Until then the generals and Abiola were known to be friends. </P>
<P> Abiola owed his candidacy to then military President Ibrahim Babangida who saw Abiola as an acceptable opposition figure unlikely to beat the generals' preferred northern candidate. </P>
<P> Abiola, 56, has transformed his image from that of a lackey of Western imperialism to a champioic airline and newspaper group, rose from extremely poor beginnings to become a philanthropic patron of communities and individuals throughout Africa and its diaspora, earning widespread popularity. </P>
<P> Aides say his panacea for Nigeria's ailing economy is the introduction of Singapore-style paternalistic authoritarianism with an emphasis on big business. </P>
<P> Abiola's main constituency is the Yoruba-speaking southwest of Nigeria whose people are anxious to see northeraid democracy will be restored only through the constitutional conference he inaugurated in June. </P>
<P> A wealthy officer with a keen business mind, Abacha is a short dapper man in dark glasses. He says little in public and sometimes appe the northern state of Kano. He fought in Nigeria's 1967-70 civil war when the southeast region of Biafra fought for secession. An estimated one million people died of war and famine. </P>
<P> Abacha attended the former Mons officer cadet college in England in 1964 and rose swiftly through the ranks to colonel in 1975. He was promoted to brigadier in 1980. </P>
<P> Up to 100 people have been killed in riots since Abiola was arrested in June after proclaiming himself president on the anniversary of the annulled election. </P>
<P> Most of the violence was in the southwest, Abiola's stronghold which includes the commercial capital Lagos but not the political capital, which army rulers had moved to the inland city of Abuja. </P>
<P> Many of the sacked oil union leaders come from the south where Nigeria's oil is pumped. But because northerners dominate government much of the proceeds is siphoned off for projects in other areas, leaving the oil-producing south neglected. </P>
