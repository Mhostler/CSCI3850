<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A Romanian court has cleared the way for a 19-year-old Transylvanian transsexual to undergo the country's first known sex-change operation. </P>
<P> Tineretul Liber newspaper reported Wednesday that permission was given by a court in Alba Iulia, Transylvania. </P>
<P> Romania, under communism and the orthodox church, has been extremely conservative about homosexuality. Tineretul Liber said the man was regarded by officialdom as handicapped and treated for ``mental disability ... agitation and transexualism.'' </P>
<P> The paper said the court seemed swayed by medical evidence that refusal could drive the man to self-mutilation or suicide. </P>
