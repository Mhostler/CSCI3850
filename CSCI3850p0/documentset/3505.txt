<P>  U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said Saturday he believed U.S. and Chinese officials would meet in mid-January in an effort to settle a dispute over copyright piracy. </P>
<P> Kantor also told reporters that Chinese officials had sent to the U.S. embassy in Beijing a memorandum which ``seems to have laid out some criteria for further discussions'' but it had not been translated completely. </P>
<P> The memo arrived at nearly the same time Kantor issued a prelimary ruling against China and put $2.8 billion in Chinese goods on a tentative list for punitive tariffs.  During a telephone news conference, Kantor said he had sent a letter proposing a meeting in mid-January. </P>
<P> ``We expect that meeting to be held. We are not sure whether we can make any progress,'' he said, adding the United States hoped for a settlement but would act if there was none. </P>
<P> Kantor declined to suggest a size for a final U.S. target list. It could be above $1 billion, he said. </P>
<P> The tentative list covers 23 categories. It includes $1 billion in electronics, $176 million in ceramics and $600 million in wood and furniture, he said. </P>
