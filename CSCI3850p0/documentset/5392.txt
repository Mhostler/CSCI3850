<P>  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Sunday he was ``somewhat encouraged'' by progress in resumed Syrian-Israeli peace talks despite renewed tension over Lebanon. </P>
<P> ``I'm somewhat encouraged by what I see developing there in the last few days and weeks,'' Christopher, asked about progress in Middle East peace talks, told CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation.'' </P>
<P> ``There are a number of gaps, but I think they're not unbridgeable gaps,'' he said. </P>
<P> Christopher would not comment directly on reports that Syrian President Hafez al-Assad had told him during the secretary's recent visit to Damascus that Syria was prepared to grant Israel low-level diplomatic relations even before Israel fully withdraws from the Golan Heights. </P>
<P> Syria last week accused Israeli officials of issuing falsely optimistic statements over the negotiations and said it expected the Washington peace talks, which resumed on March 20 after a three-month break, to remain deadlocked. </P>
<P> The talks, held on and off for three years, are stalled over withdrawal from the strategic Golan, security and future ties. </P>
<P> Christopher said he would not discuss the substance of the Syrian-Israeli negotiations. </P>
<P> ``What I can tell you is the parties are seriously engaged across a broad spectrum of issues: the timing of withdrawal, the amount of withdrawal, the degree of normalisation -- that is, at what pace there would be diplomatic relations. And now they're focusing on security issues,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``So the parties have made a lot of progress in identifying what the issues are, in closing the gaps to some extent.'' </P>
<P> Christopher said he had worked through the weekend to cool tensions after Hizbollah guerrillas fired rockets into northern Israel from Lebanon, where Syria is the main power broker. </P>
<P> Israel said Sunday that Syria had informed Christopher that it agreed to restrain the guerrilla attacks. </P>
<P> Israel asked for Christopher's mediation after Hizbollah fired dozens of Katyusha rockets on the Jewish state on Friday, killing a 17-year-old boy and injuring 12 people. </P>
<P> The shelling followed the assassination of a Hizbollah leader, Ruda Yassin, who died when his car was rocketed by a an Israeli helicopter in south Lebanon. </P>
