<P>  The United Nations Tuesday began evacuating fearful minority Serbs from former rebel territory in Croatia recaptured by the army in a blitz across U.N. cease-fire lines last week. </P>
<P> Two white U.N. buses carrying 72 Serbs from the town of Pakrac crossed a front-line bridge over the Sava River border to Serb-held Bosnia after Croatian troops spent hours clearing it of mines laid to keep Bosnian Serbs at bay. </P>
<P> The Croatians put back anti-tank barriers at their end of the bridge after the buses passed in the late afternoon. </P>
<P> ``We're happy they (Serbs) got across the bridge safely. We don't know what is waiting for them on the other side but I hope they find the safety they are seeking,'' U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard told reporters at the bridge. </P>
<P> U.N. officials expect many more Serbs to register in the next few days for the evacuation program drafted after the Croatian army recaptured the rebel enclave of Western Slavonia. </P>
<P> About half of Western Slavonia's 15,000 Serbs fled the Croatian army onslaught. Most of the remainder who had no chance or chose not to bolt before the enclave fell are in Pakrac, the region's biggest town. </P>
<P> Croatian troops took 2,000 rebels prisoner but the government has pledged full civil rights and an amnesty to all Serbs in the region except for ``war criminals.'' </P>
<P> European Union monitors say the Croatian army's treatment of prisoners and civilians alike has been proper with no known abuses aside from isolated looting of vacated Serb homes. </P>
<P> But many POWs and civilians from the former breakaway enclave are apprehensive about their fate once international attention fades -- and Western television cameras go away. </P>
<P> Minority Serbs revolted in 1991 against Croatia's secession from multinational Yugoslavia and seized almost a third of the country in a war replete with atrocities and expulsions. </P>
<P> U.N. organizers admitted they could be abetting ``ethnic cleansing.'' But they were left no choice after Serb militants in remaining enclaves threatened reprisals if Slavonian kin were not allowed to leave immediately. </P>
<P> ``This has been a perennial dilemma since this conflict began,'' Eckhard said earlier in Pakrac, recalling the U.N. role in removing over 1.5 million refugees from regions seized by ethnic combatants in former Yugoslavia since 1991. </P>
<P> ``But the alternative is unacceptable. When someone is terrified and comes to the U.N. for help, you can't refuse it.'' </P>
