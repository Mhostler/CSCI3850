<P>  Turkish Foreign Minister Erdal Inonu told Iran Sunday that Turkey plans to withdraw its troops from northern Iraq in the immediate future, Iran's official IRNA news agency said. </P>
<P> Inonu ``said in a message to his Iranian counterpart, Ali Akbar Velayati, Sunday that Turkey honors Iraq's territorial integrity and will withdraw its troops from northern Iraq in the immediate future,'' IRNA reported. </P>
<P> IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, said a Turkish Foreign Ministry envoy delivered the message to Velayati Sunday. </P>
<P> It quoted Velayati as saying Iran supported Iraq's territorial integrity and did not want its neighbour's borders to ``undergo any infringement.'' </P>
<P> Turkey sent 35,000 troops into Iraq on March 20 to destroy Kurdistan Workers' Party guerrilla bases that separatist rebels use for their insurgency in southeast Turkey. </P>
<P> Inonu, while attending an international conference in Greece, said Friday that Turkey's operation in northern Iraq would take weeks to complete and declined to give a date for a pullout. </P>
<P> Iran has criticized the incursion as likely to exacerbate the regional tensions and has called for a pullout. </P>
