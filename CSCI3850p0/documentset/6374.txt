<P> Albright said the request for airstrikes came from General Rupert Smith, the British U.N. commander in Bosnia. According to Muhamed Sacirbey, Bosnia's U.N. ambassador, the decision against calling in NATO was made by by Yasushi Akashi, the U.N. special representative in the Balkans. </P>
<P> A U.S. official said NATO aircraft were in the Sarajevo area when the order to stand down came. </P>
<P> ``This issue is not closed, we will obviously be following it very closely,'' said Albright. </P>
<P> The United Nations had said earlier that it planned to punish Bosnian Serbs for Sunday's mortar attack, which killed 10 people near the Bosnian capital. But on Monday officials decided against it. </P>
<P> Up to 40 were wounded in the Sunday attack on the government-held suburb of Butmir. The tenth victim died of his wounds during the night. </P>
