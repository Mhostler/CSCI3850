<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Iraqi parliamentarians joined their government Tuesday in rejecting a U.N. plan for Baghdad to sell limited amounts of oil to meet urgent humanitarian needs, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported. </P>
<P> ``Members of the environment committee at the National Assembly (parliament) have expressed their categorical rejection of the American (U.N.) resolution,'' INA said. </P>
<P> Another committee dealing with religious, health and social affairs dismissed it as ``a violation of Iraq's sovereignty... denying Iraqi health establishments of the possibility of providing medical requiremetns needed by the Iraqi citizen.'' </P>
<P> Parliamentary committees begun discussing Monday the U.N. resolution which allows Iraq to sell $2 billion worth of oil over six months. </P>
<P> The Baghdad government has strongly recommended rejection of the resolution, adopted unanimously at the Security Council on Friday. </P>
<P> INA said the environment committee, following a meeting Tuesday, said ``the resolution was dangerous as it neglected the practical needs for environment projects damaged by the 30-state aggression (Gulf War),'' INA said. </P>
<P> After the discussions in various parliamentary committees this week, a full meeting of the assembly will be held to give Iraq's final word on the resolution, which is expected to echo the official line of total rejection. </P>
<P> Iraq's government, which demands removal of an oil embargo and other sanctions imposed by the United Nations after it invaded Kuwait in 1990, is stepping up attack on the resolution in an attempt to rally Iraqis behind its tough position. </P>
<P> A senior official of the ruling Baath Party, Abdel-Ghani Abdel-Ghaffour, blasted the resolution and described it as ``a desperate attempt to prolong sanctions on Iraq.'' </P>
<P> The official al-Iraq newspaper said the U.S. leaders' sponsorship of the resolution stemmed from their ``ugly imperialist mentality and empty minds.'' </P>
<P> Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan urged patience, saying the resolution had ``vicious intentions...and was an American ploy.'' </P>
<P> Iraq's state-run television conducts interviews with senior officials who explained to the Iraqis why the government was turning down the new offer. </P>
<P> Tuesday, the television run an interview with Culture and Information Minister Hamed Youssef Hummadi in which he slammed the plan and said ``the Iraqis could not accept the humiliation resulting from this resolution.'' </P>
<P> Hummadi said the new offer treated the Iraqi people as if they were ``a flock of sheep or a poultry farm.'' </P>
