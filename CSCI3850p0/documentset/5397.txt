<P>  The U.S. ambassador to Bosnia announced Sunday he would leave Sarajevo on April 19 and that several of his staff would leaving as well, confirming rumors which have circulated in the city for weeks. </P>
<P> ``During recent consultations in Washington, future assignment opportunities were discussed by me and my superiors for the period following my work in Bosnia,'' Ambassador Victor Jackovich said in an unusual statement faxed to the press. </P>
<P> ``I intend to depart Sarajevo Wednesday, April 19. At the same time several members of my staff will also be leaving over the next few months. </P>
<P> ``My departure -- and that of my colleagues -- should be viewed as regular rotation for a posting in an environment as difficult and risky as Bosnia.'' </P>
<P> Asked to provide some clarification on the ambassador's comments and the reasons for his departure the embassy issued only a terse ``no comment'' Sunday evening. </P>
<P> Jackovich, a 47-year old career foreign service officer, first came to Sarajevo in the 1970s, where he met his wife and opened a U.S. Information Agency office and library. </P>
<P> He was appointed to the position of ambassador to Bosnia by former U.S. president George Bush in 1992 and for many months divided his time between a temporary office in Vienna and the Sarajevo Holiday Inn, where his suite was once hit by gunfire. </P>
<P> Jackovich opened the U.S. embassy in Sarajevo on July 4, 1994 with a rousing speech supporting Bosnia's Muslim-led government. </P>
<P> His comments raised eyebrows at a time when Washington's actual suppport for Sarajevo in its war against separatist Serbs seems to be waning. </P>
<P> The ambassador's statement Sunday denied rumored policy differences between himself and the administration of President Clinton. </P>
<P> ``Regarding reported differences between myself and others in the U.S. government, I believe that all my public articulations of U.S. polices have accurately reflected and described those polices,'' his statement said. </P>
<P> Jackovich has been a favorite of the Bosnian government. His departure under unusual circumstances will heighten suspicions here that Washington's real commitment to Sarajevo falls far short of its rhetoric. </P>
