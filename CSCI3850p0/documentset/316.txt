<DATELINE>CAYENNE, French Guiana (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  France said Wednesday that it will tighten its border in French Guiana after an announcement that neighboring Surinam will accept 2,000 Haitian refugees. </P>
<P> ``The attraction of French Guiana (to the refugees) is extremely strong -- there is already a large Haitian community here,'' French Guiana administrator (prefect) Jean-Francois Cordet told state-owned radio. </P>
<P> Cordet said he would increase surveillance on the Maroni river border that separates this French overseas department on the northeast coast of South America from Surinam. </P>
<P> Surinam, a former Dutch colony, announced on July 13 that it would accept 2,000 Haitian refugees for up to a year under a United Nations-sponsored program to be funded by the United States. </P>
<P> Refugees from both Surinam and Haiti continue to be a major problem in French Guiana. In 1993 France expelled 3,629 Surinamese and 582 Haitians. An estimated 20,000 illegal Haitians and 15,000 illegal Surinamese live in French Guiana. </P>
<P> Many of the Surinamese fled to French Guiana in the 1980s when the military overthrew two civilian governments and fought rebels near the Maroni river border. Civilian rule was restored in 1991. </P>
<P> Thousands of Haitians have fled their Caribbean island in recent weeks to escape worsening poverty and oppression by the military regime that replaced ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in September 1991. </P>
<P> Surinam's agreement to accept the refugees follows a recent abortive attempt to send 10,000 Haitian exiles to Panama. </P>
<P> Panamanian President Guillermo Endara first accepted the U.S. resettlement proposal then withdrew his offer, claiming he had been browbeaten by White House officials who allegedly changed the terms of the agreement. </P>
<P> Surinamese legislators unanimously backed their government's offer, in contrast to Panama, where opposition parties opposed Endara for promising to take the refugees. </P>
