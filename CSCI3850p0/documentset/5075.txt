<P>  A large-scale study released Tuesday of two non-aspirin drugs to treat fever in children found that ibuprofen -- currently available only by prescription for children -- and acetaminophen are both safe. </P>
<P> The study found no increased risk to children in hospitals given ibuprophen, commonly sold under the brand names Advil and Motrin, for gastrointestinal bleeding, renal failure, anaphylaxis or Reye's syndrome. </P>
<P> Of the 55,785 children who received ibuprophen when they came down with a fever, four were hospitalized with gastrointestinal bleeding, none of them deemed clinically serious. </P>
<P> Among the 28,130 children who received treatment with acetaminophen, commonly sold under the name Tylenol, no ill effects were found. </P>
<P> Researchers at the Slone Epidemiology Unit of Boston University's School of Medicine enlisted doctors of a total of 84,000 children in the study, which appeared in the Journal of the American Medical Association. </P>
