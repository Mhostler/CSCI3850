<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev said Friday that Iraq's recognition of Kuwait within borders demarcated after the 1991 Gulf War had no conditions attached. </P>
<P> Iraq and Russia issued a joint statement Thursday in which Iraq said it was prepared to recognise Kuwait within new borders, apparently removing a major obstacle to the lifting of U.N. sanctions. </P>
<P> Asked whether Iraq set any terms for its recognition of Kuwait's sovereignty, Kozyrev said: ``I do not think so. </P>
<P> ``I think virtually we can speak of recognition because you know when President Saddam Hussein says that he wants to solve the issue, to my mind that boils down to a solution,'' the minister told a news conference before leaving Baghdad. </P>
<P> Kozyrev, who was due to fly to Kuwait after his visit to Baghdad, said the statement ``speaks very clearly that there are no conditions, that this is recognition in accordance with U.N. resolutions.'' </P>
<P> He added: ``We have to engage the Iraqi authorities in order to move towards full implementation of U.N. resolutions.'' </P>
<P> Fears of a new confrontation in the Gulf flared last weekend when Iraqi troops massed close to the border with Kuwait, triggering a large U.S.-led buildup to deter a possible repetition of Iraq's 1990 invasion of the emirate. </P>
