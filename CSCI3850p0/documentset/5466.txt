<DATELINE>EDINBURGH, April 5 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Voters in Scotland, an electoral wasteland for the ruling Conservatives, go to the polls on Thursday in local elections all but certain to give a massive ``thumbs down'' to Prime Minister John Major's government. </P>
<P> Opinion polls put Conservative support at only 11 percent, marginally ahead of the Liberal Democrats, but far behind the independence-seeking Scottish National Party (SNP) on 25 percent and the 53 percent share of the main opposition Labour party. </P>
<P> Nationally Labour, under new moderate leader Tony Blair, has a 30-point lead over Major's deeply unpopular party, which has been in power since 1979 but has registered only about 25 percent support in recent polls. </P>
<P> The Scottish election is for 29 new unitary councils which will replace the existing two-tier structure of 12 regional and 41 district councils in a year's time. There will be 1,161 councillors, compared to nearly 1,700 at present. </P>
<P> Labour hopes to win control of at least 17 of the 29 councils and the SNP three. Conservatives refuse to commit themselves on their aspirations but political analysts say they could end up with only one council. </P>
<P> An acrimonious campaign, which culminated in Scottish viewers being prevented by the courts from seeing a key televsion interview with Major this week, has been fought largely on the record of a government seen by voters as lacking in ideas and split over key issues such as links with Europe. </P>
<P> The future of rail services to remoter parts of Scotland, following privatisation of the rail industry, the creation of three bodies to take water supply out of local authority control, and increased taxation are also key issues. </P>
<P> The Conservatives insist that local elections are about local affairs and in their campaigning have ignored national issues such as the tax increases which take effect this week. </P>
<P> But voters in some areas have had the unusual sight of cabinet ministers canvassing in a local election, a sign of Conservative desperation according to opposition politicians. </P>
<P> The centrist Liberal Democrats admit they have no chance of winning control in any council. But they would be a strong influence in councils without one-party control. </P>
