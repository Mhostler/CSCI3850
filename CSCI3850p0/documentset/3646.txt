<P>  Three convicts have escaped from a British prison just hours after police recaptured three other dangerous escapees from one of the country's toughest jails. </P>
<P> The latest jailbreak is certain to increase criticism of Prime Minister John Major's unpopular government when parliament resumes its sessions Tuesday. </P>
<P> Police said Sunday they caught the three men, serving life sentences, whose escape six days ago from Parkhurst prison on the Isle of Wight -- off southern England -- provoked a political storm. </P>
<P> The three were caught after an off-duty prison officer from the top-security prison, known as Britain's ``Alcatraz,'' recognized them. </P>
<P> But police said Monday three other prisoners escaped from a central English jail around the same time as the three convicts were being recaptured on the Isle of Wight. </P>
<P> The men, described as ``low to medium risk,'' were discovered to be missing from Littlehey prison in Cambridgeshire during a Sunday evening roll call. </P>
<P> The new breakout, within 10 miles of Major's family home, is a blow to a government already embarrassed by a series of security lapses, jail riots and the suicide of an alleged serial killer in his cell on New Year's Day. </P>
<P> Last week's escape from Parkhurst, which highlighted low morale among prison staff, sparked growing calls in the media and by the opposition Labor Party for the resignation of Home Secretary Michael Howard. </P>
