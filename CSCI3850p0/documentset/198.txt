<P>  France is likely to suspend flights to Haiti Wednesday to reinforce sanctions against the military-backed government, a civil aviation source said. </P>
<P> ``We are awaiting word from the Foreign Ministry today and it seems to be going that way,'' the source said. </P>
<P> No comment was immediately available from the ministry. </P>
<P> A spokesman for the national airline Air France, which operates three flights a week to Port-au-Prince, said any decision would be announced by civil aviation authorities. </P>
<P> France has come under pressure to follow the United States and Canada, which halted passenger flights to Haiti last month. </P>
<P> The boycott added to a U.N. oil, arms and trade embargo to try to force out the military-backed government and restore elected president Jean-Bertrand Aristide who was ousted in a 1991 army coup. </P>
<P> The United Nations and the Organization of American States are withdrawing about 100 human rights observers who have been ordered to leave by the government. </P>
<P> The group is to leave Wednesday on an Air France flight from Haiti to Guadeloupe. </P>
