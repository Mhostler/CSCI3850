<DATELINE>ZAGREB, Croatia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Croatian army recaptured a breakaway Serb enclave Tuesday, sending rebel soldiers and civilians fleeing into Bosnia in its first major victory over separatists who seized a third of the country in 1991. </P>
<P> Croatia angered its Big Power patrons, however, by riding roughshod over U.N. cease-fire lines to retake the Western Slavonia region and provoked a Serb missile attack on Zagreb, its capital, that killed five people and wounded 121. </P>
<P> Croatia launched its offensive after rebel Serbs barricaded the country's main highway. They also killed three Croatians using the road in reprisal for the death of a Serb murdered by an embittered Croatian refugee. </P>
<P> In a victory statement President Franjo Tudjman said: ``The action by Croatian police and army forces to reopen the motorway and railway through the hitherto occupied area has been completed.'' </P>
<P> State television showed government soldiers and police taking over Okucani, the main town nearest to the highway, in the heart of the Western Slavonia pocket after Serb militiamen fled over the Sava river to Bosnia. </P>
<P> At least 5,000 of the region's 13,000 Serbs also bolted for Bosnia to escape the Croatian advance but the television broadcast interviews in which some remaining Okucani Serbs and a captured rebel said the army was treating them properly. </P>
<P> The Croatian government was clearly trying to refute Serb nationalist propaganda that it was bent on killing or persecuting the minority Serbs who refused to accept its independence from Yugoslavia four years ago. </P>
<P> About 600 Serb militiamen agreed to surrender and hand over their weapons to U.N. safekeeping in a deal mediated by the U.N. peacekeeping force in Croatia (UNCRO). </P>
<P> Tudjman said Serb civilians and fighters who remained in Western Slavonia would receive full civil rights and an amnesty unless they were what he termed ``war criminals.'' </P>
<P> Serbs seized almost a third of Croatia in a 1991 uprising against its secession from Yugoslavia and lost only a fraction of their domain in abandoning Western Slavonia. </P>
<P> But the success of the military offensive was a giant step for Zagreb in its effort to reunite the northern heart of the country. </P>
<P> Croatian troops and tanks needed just 36 hours to overrun virtually the entire pocket, extending 15 miles from east to west and 21 miles from north to south. </P>
<P> Yugoslav leaders including Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, orchestrator of Serb uprisings against the 1991-92 secession of Croatia and Bosnia, lambasted Croatia's blitz, Bosnian Serbs denounced it and threatened to intervene but did nothing. </P>
<P> Okucani's fall restored Croatian control over segments of the economically vital E-70 motorway and parallel railway lost in 1991. Zagreb said it planned to reopen the road Wednesday. </P>
<P> The Serbs, short on manpower but long in mass destruction weaponry, struck back by firing five Orkan missiles armed with cluster bombs into Zagreb. </P>
<P> Casualties and hysterical relatives clogged Zagreb's main trauma clinic. It was the city's first taste of war since it was bombarded by the Yugoslav air force in 1991. </P>
<P> Western Slavonia was the most vulnerable part of Serb-held territories in Croatia. Other parts of their Krajina enclave have borders with Bosnia and Yugoslavia over which Serb arms and reinforcement can flow at will. </P>
