<DATELINE>SEOUL, April 8 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief said on Saturday that North Korea was preparing to refuel a five-megawatt reactor at its Yongbyon nuclear complex, South Korea's domestic Yonhap news agency said. </P>
<P> IAEA Director-General Hans Blix said during a meeting with Seoul's Foreign Minister Gong Ro-myung that the international nuclear watchdog was watching the North's moves with concern, Yonhap said. </P>
<P> But he said the North was implementing most of the schedules it had promised to the United States last October in an agreement to freeze its nuclear programme. </P>
<P> Two IAEA inspectors were currently monitoring North Korea's nuclear activities. </P>
<P> Gong said if North Korea did break a nuclear freeze by refuelling the Yongbyon reactor, South Korea would push for swift and effective sanctions after consultations with its allies and the IAEA, Yonhap said. </P>
<P> Gong also said South Korea would support a move by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to improve its ability to inspect nuclear facilities of member countries. </P>
<P> He said Seoul would support the international nuclear watchdog's plan aimed at securing authority to examine undeclared nuclear facilities. </P>
<P> Blix, who arrived in Seoul on Thursday to attend a symposium and discuss nuclear issues with senior officials, said the IAEA needed the support of member countries to introduce the programme, a ministry official said. </P>
<P> Before leaving for Japan later in the day, Blix met with President Kim Young-sam. Officials gave no details of the meeting. </P>
<P> But they said North Korean nuclear developments had been discussed. </P>
