<DATELINE>ROME (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Trade unions put more than a million people on the streets of Rome Saturday in one of Italy's largest demonstrations and vowed to fight Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's plans to cut health and pensions spending. </P>
<P> Union leaders said some 1.5 million people took part in the protest against the 1995 budget which became a demonstration against Berlusconi's free-market government. </P>
<P> ``We warn the government that we will not stop until we have obtained concrete results,'' said Sergio Cofferati, leader of the CGIL trades union, after the march. </P>
<P> The huge turnout seems bound to put pressure on Berlusconi's shaky coaltion which Monday faces a vote of confidence in parliament over the 1995 budget. Berlusconi would be forced to quit if he lost the vote. </P>
<P> Police said there were a small number of minor scuffles, but no injuries were reported or arrests made. </P>
<P> Helicopters hovered overhead and police with truncheons and crash helmets attached to their belts and carrying gas-masks in bags slung on their shoulders were dotted along the routes of the marches. </P>
<P> Workers, pensioners and students had traveled through the night in chartered trains, buses and car ferries to express their anger at the government's plans. </P>
<P> One group of demonstrators carried large dustbins emblazoned with the names of Berlusconi and his two big coalition allies -- Umberto Bossi, the leader of the federalist Northern League, and Gianfranco Fini, head of the neo-fascist-led National Alliance. </P>
<P> Berlusconi's own workers took part in the protest, some traveling overnight by train to join in. </P>
<P> ``We all used to believe in him -- no longer,'' said a woman who works for Berlusconi's Standa supermarket chain. She asked not to be named. </P>
<P> Cabinet spokesman Giuliano Ferrara said the demonstration, ostensibly called to protest against cuts in health and pensions spending, had become an anti-government protest. </P>
<P> ``We respect those who disagree with us and must take their feelings into account,'' said Ferrara, a former editorialist with one of Berlusconi's three national television stations. </P>
<P> ``But governments are not toppled with street demonstrations,'' said Ferrara, who holds Cabinet rank. </P>
<P> Meanwhile, in Milan the businessman whose report of a bribe demand sparked a huge corruption scandal that led to a political revolution in Italy, said he would not do it again. </P>
<P> Businessman Luca Magni said he had had nothing but trouble since Feb. 17, 1992, when police acting on his tip-off arrested the Socialist party worker Mario Chiesa for trying to collect a bribe. </P>
<P> That arrest marked the start of the scandal and opened the way for investigating magistrates to launch their political corruption probes which overturned the old order of Italian politics. </P>
<P> Four former prime ministers, dozens of ministers, hundreds of ex-members of parliament and thousands of businessmen have since become caught up in the Milan investigations and similar ones launched elsewhere in Italy. </P>
<P> Bettino Craxi, the burly former Socialist prime minister who ran the government from 1984-87 and who is in virtual exile in Tunisia, has already been sentenced to eight-and-a-half years imprisonment in one trial. Several others are pending. </P>
<P> The daily revelations about bribes taken from businessmen by parties unleashed a political revolution that ended in the old political order being reshaped. </P>
