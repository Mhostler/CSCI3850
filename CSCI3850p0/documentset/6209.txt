<P>  British lawyers said Tuesday they have appealed to the government to set up a legal aid fund for Britons on death row in the United States. </P>
<P> The Human Rights Committee of the England and Wales Bar Association is backing a call by British lawyer Clive Stafford Smith who wrote to Prime Minister John Major asking him to help. </P>
<P> In the letter Smith, who represented British-born murderer Nick Ingram who was executed in Georgia last month, criticized the U.S. justice system because there is no system of legal aid beyond the initial trial and first appeal. </P>
<P> Two other Britons, Krishna Maharaj and Kenneth Richey, are facing execution in the United States. Maharaj in Florida and Richey in Ohio. </P>
<P> ``The committee backs Smith's call for the fund,'' said David Marshall, a member of the group. ``It supports the need to ensure these British men do in fact receive due process.'' </P>
<P> ``The system is unjust and extremely unfair,'' he added. </P>
<P> Major refused to intervene on Ingram's behalf because he said the due process of law had been respected. But Smith and the committee argue that Ingram who was executed for the 1983 murder of J.C. Sawyer and the shooting of his wife had not been treated fairly. </P>
<P> ``Saying Ingram had received due process is a fiction,'' said Marshall. </P>
<P> The lawyers urged Britain to follow the example of Germany and Mexico which assist its citizens on death row in the United States. </P>
<P> Maharaj was convicted of killing two people in Miami in 1986 and Richey, who was raised in Edinburgh, Scotland was sentenced to die for the death of a two-year old girl who was killed in a fire in 1986. </P>
