<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A group of 57 Vietnamese boat people, some bound hand and foot and carried on to an aircraft, was deported from Australia to Indonesia Thursday. </P>
<P> The Australian government confirmed the surprise deportation in a statement, saying the 57 were ``removed from Australia'' because their refugee applications had already been rejected while in the Galang migrant detention camp in Indonesia. </P>
<P> ``They were handcuffed with plastic ties, two of them were bound hand and foot and were carried onto the plane by Australian Protective Services (guards),'' said freelance cameraman Steve Lowe, from Port Hedland on Australia's far northwest coast. ``One lady was crying,'' he added. </P>
<P> It is not normal practice to handcuff migrant deportees. </P>
<P> An immigration department spokesman in Canberra confirmed some of the Vietnamese had been handcuffed and two carried on to the aircraft, saying this was necessary to ensure the safety of the aircraft and passengers. </P>
<P> The group arrived in Australia in three boats at different times in September and October and were taken to Australia's main migrant detention center at Port Hedland. </P>
<P> Under a controversial new law that came into effect Nov. 15, but which is retrospective to Sept. 1, people already assessed in another country under an international settlement plan are prevented from seeking asylum in Australia. </P>
<P> Australia has accepted almost 17,000 people under the international plan entitled the Comprehensive Plan of Action. </P>
<P> Vietnamese leaders in Melbourne earlier Thursday failed in Australia's federal court to get an injunction to stop the deportation. </P>
<P> Immigration Minister Nick Bolkus said all those deported had failed to meet the U.N. definition of a refugee. </P>
<P> Over 1,000 boat people have arrived in Australia since November 1989. The latest group of 118 arrived in Australia last Sunday and were taken to Port Hedland. </P>
