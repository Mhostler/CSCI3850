<P>  China's 90-year-old paramount leader Deng Xiaoping Monday ended a tradition of appearing on television on Lunar New Year's Eve, fueling speculation his health was declining. </P>
<P> The main evening television news broadcast made no mention of Deng's whereabouts. China's reclusive patriarch, who is said to enjoy the warmer weather of Shanghai, has traveled to the city for the lunar holidays for the past seven years. </P>
<P> It had been Deng's tradition to appear briefly on television on Lunar New Year's Eve, but his family may feel that the risks of being seen as a feeble shadow of his former self now outweigh those of not showing. </P>
<P> Last Saturday, senior Chinese leaders visited Deng at his home to wish him a long and healthy life, the official Xinhua news agency said. </P>
<P> But no newspaper photographs or television clippings of the meeting have been shown, deepening the mystery about Deng's deteriorating health. </P>
<P> Other retired but still powerful octogenarians also received holiday greetings from the current leadership ahead of the Year of the Pig, which begins Tuesday, Xinhua said. </P>
<P> ``If the emperor (Deng) cannot make a television appearance on New Year's Eve for health or other reasons, his contemporaries also do not make any appearances,'' a Chinese political analyst said in a recent interview. </P>
<P> The elderly powerbrokers, including Deng's arch-rival Chen Yun, are the last who will have political legitimacy bestowed on them by having fought in the revolution that brought the Communist Party to power in 1949. </P>
<P> On Deng's last public outing at a Shanghai Lunar New Year reception a year ago, which was televised nationally, he appeared almost deaf, spoke in a whisper and had such difficulty walking he had to be supported by daughters holding each arm. </P>
<P> Those images, which showed Deng's hands trembling, giving substance to rumours he is suffering from Parkinson's Disease, alarmed ordinary Chinese. </P>
<P> Deng's daughter, Deng Rong, told The New York Times this month that her father's health was declining ``day by day,'' but sought to calm intense speculation in a new interview by denying that Deng could no longer stand or walk. </P>
<P> The Times article and other Western and Japanese reports describing Deng's health as deteriorating have sparked a frenzy in the sensitive Hong Kong stock market that his death was imminent. </P>
<P> On Jan. 12, a Shanghai newspaper printed a black and white picture of Deng, the first glimpse the Chinese public has had of Deng since February last year. </P>
<P> The black and white picture on the front page of the Liberation Daily showed Deng seated and watching a fireworks display at Beijing's Zhongnanhai leadership compound on the Oct. 1 National Day last year. </P>
<P> Deng was wrapped in a coat and was wearing a cloth hat, but the picture was too fuzzy to be able to see if he were gaunt and frail or healthy. </P>
