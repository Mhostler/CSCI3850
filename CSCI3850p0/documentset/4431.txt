<P>  Pat Buchanan, the right-wing television commentator who fought incumbent George Bush for the Republican presidential nomination in 1992, said Saturday he was determined to run again. </P>
<P> In an interview with CBS News, the 56-year-old former White House speechwriter said he would make a final announcement next month on whether he would formally join in the Republican fray but added that ``it's my present determination to run.'' </P>
<P> ``I think Pat Buchanan's views now represent the views of the Republican party ... We lost our campaign in 1992 but the Buchanan crusade has prevailed,'' he told CBS on the eve of an unofficial kickoff of the 1996 campaign in New Hampshire, where Buchanan and other Republican presidential hopefuls fanned out over the weekend to test the political waters. </P>
<P> Buchanan told CBS that he intended to ``restore American sovereignty'' and that he alone, among all the Republican candidates, had stood up against NAFTA, the world trade organisation, GATT, and what he referred to as the ``$50-billion dollar bailout of Mexico City.'' </P>
<P> A recent poll showed Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole leading the GOP field with 45 percent in favor, while Buchanan and Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas placed far behind in second with 10 percent each. </P>
<P> Earlier Saturday at an impromptu news conference in Manchester, N.H., Buchanan tried to put a positive spin on the poll. </P>
<P> ``The idea that I'm tied for second is, first, astonishing for me ... and I was hoping I wouldn't come out that well so I could slip in under the radar,'' he told reporters. </P>
