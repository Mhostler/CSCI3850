<P>  A sniper wounded a French peacekeeper in the head in Sarajevo Thursday as a U.N. spokesman warned that the mission's plight in Bosnia was ``dire and deteriorating.'' </P>
<P> The soldier, manning an observation post in a tower block used to watch Bosnian Serb snipers firing from the Grbavica district, was in a ``life-threatening condition.'' </P>
<P> He was hit a day after three French soldiers escaped injury when a rifle-fired grenade hit their armored car in the Bosnian capital. </P>
<P> Growing casualties among peacekeeping forces have prompted threats by France and Britain, which provide the backbone of the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR), to pull their forces out of the country. </P>
<P> The French government is angry over the killing of two of its soldiers by snipers last month in Sarajevo, one thought to have been killed by Serbs and the other by a Bosnian government army marksman. </P>
<P> A Franco-British withdrawal would bring the peacekeeping mission to the brink of collapse at a time when the 22,000-strong force in Bosnia is demoralized and publicly voicing confusion over its role. </P>
<P> U.N. officials are demanding that the U.N. Security Council tackle contradictions in a mandate setting the mission goals which it has neither the men, the weapons nor the political support to achieve. </P>
<P> ``The secretary general is preparing a report on this mission and specifically on UNPROFOR in Bosnia and especially in the light of the current situation which can be described as dire and deteriorating,'' spokesman Alexander Ivank said. </P>
<P> U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali will meet his special representative Yasushi Akashi and his military commander in former Yugoslavia, Gen. Bertrand Janvier, in Paris Friday. </P>
<P> UNPROFOR's discontent has mounted rapidly since a four-month cease-fire ended May 1 with a refusal by both the Bosnian Serbs and the Muslim-led government to extend it. </P>
<P> Serb forces besieging Sarajevo killed 11 people in shelling at the weekend amid increasing attacks on U.N. personnel and restrictions on U.N. travel across their lines in the city. </P>
<P> ``They are exercising control, showing they can, if they want to, restrict our freedom of movement,'' Ivanko said. </P>
<P> Frustration boiled over when Akashi and advisers at mission headquarters in Bosnia refused a request by Sarajevo commanders for NATO air strikes to punish Serb shelling. </P>
<P> Akashi admitted ahead of his meeting with Boutros-Ghali that ``the situation in Bosnia does not permit any optimism.'' </P>
<P> UNPROFOR reported fighting incidents around Bosnia during the last 24 hours and a second day of heavy clashes between ethnic Croats and Serbs in the northern Orasje pocket. </P>
<P> Reuter journalists in the pocket said Serb shells were hitting local villages at the rate of one a second. </P>
<P> Orasje is on the edge of a Serb-held corridor across northern Bosnia which is vital to Serb supply lines. </P>
<P> The U.N. said the fighting could be a Serb attempt to widen the corridor or revenge for the recapture of a rebel Serb enclave in neighboring Croatia by government forces last week. </P>
<P> Croatian Serbs responded to the loss of the enclave with a rocket attack on Zagreb which U.S. ambassador Peter Galbraith said Thursday almost hit U.S. installations. </P>
<P> Washington wrote to rebel Serb leaders warning them of U.S. retaliation if the incident was repeated, he added. </P>
