<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Exiled Haiti President Jean-Bertrand Aristide appealed to his countrymen Friday to halt the violence in Port-au-Prince and not send the world ``the sad image'' of fighting in the streets. </P>
<P> He told reporters that he has taped a message in Creole to be broadcast in Haiti urging Haitians ``to move toward reconciliation, not violence.'' </P>
<P> ``There should be neither violence nor vengeance,'' Aristide said during a visit to the office of Senator Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat who is a supporter. </P>
<P> Speaking in French and English, Aristide said he wished that ``Haitian soldiers would be there to help the U.S. soldiers keep the security ... to help keep them not to spread the sad image.'' </P>
<P> He noted that so far much of the violence has occurred ``in just one single supermarket. Let's hope that will be the last.'' </P>
<P> Aristide was noncommital about when he would return to Port-au-Prince, saying it would be ``before October 15'', the date that Haiti's military leaders are scheduled to step down. </P>
<P> But then he quickly added ``if not then, then later.'' </P>
<P> Earlier, Aristide expressed concern about possible violence if blanket amnesty is given to military leaders who overthrew him in a coup three years ago. </P>
<P> Aristide said on NBC's ``Today'' television program that if there is blanket amnesty granted by the Haitian parliament, ``I would have then to work very hard to keep those who would be angry.'' </P>
<P> He was responding to a question on whether a blanket amnesty would increase the likelihood of violence. His answers during the interview suggested that he might have trouble controlling some of his backers if a comprehensive amnesty is granted. </P>
<P> The parliament is considering amnesty for the coup leaders, which was part of a deal worked out by a delegation headed by former President Jimmy Carter a week ago Sunday that averted an invasion of Haiti. </P>
<P> Although part of the deal did not call for Cedras and others to leave Haitian soil, Clinton administration officials and Aristide said they want them to depart. </P>
<P> ``Because I think they will leave,'' Aristide said. ``So I do not spend too much time thinking they will not.'' </P>
<P> Aristide was interviewed Thursday before an explosion, possibly from a grenade, tore through a crowd in downtown Port-au-Prince, leaving dozens of bloody bodies in the streets. </P>
