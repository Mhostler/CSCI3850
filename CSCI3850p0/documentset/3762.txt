<P>  Republicans are considering drastic measures to keep their campaign promises of cutting taxes, increasing defense spending and balancing the federal budget, according to a draft document circulated among party members in the Senate. </P>
<P> A budget policymaker familiar with the 60-page document's contents said Friday the potential areas for saving amounted to an overhaul of virtually every government entitlement program. </P>
<P> ``The proposal included many pages of social security cuts, but a line had been drawn through each of these pages suggesting they had been withdrawn from the table,'' the source said. </P>
<P> Among the options was taxing all entitlements by counting them as income, realizing a savings of $262 billion over five years, he said. </P>
<P> Another element would raise the Medicare retirement age from 65 to 67 over a phase-in period of 20 years. The draft also hit veterans' benefits by ending compensation payments for those with low-rated disabilities, the source said. About 1.3 million veterans fell into that category, he added. </P>
<P> The document also contained a draft proposal to lower cost of living increases by 1 percent for all future military retirees and a plan to merge the Women and Infant Children (WIC) program with Medicaid, according to the source. </P>
<P> ``This would basically wipe out this popular program while saving $4.4 billion over four years,'' he said. </P>
<P> CBS News reported that New Hampshire Sen. Judd Gregg, chairman of the Senate working group that prepared the draft, had asked colleagues to ``help find dramatic spending reductions.'' </P>
<P> The proposal included trimming the preschool educational program Head Start by 50 percent and introducing a one-month waiting period for unemployment benefits, CBS said. </P>
<P> Sen. Gregg refused to release the report but told CBS that the proposed drastic cuts were only options under consideration. </P>
<P> ``I guess my concern would be that if people said because it is in here you are going to do this,'' he said, referring to the draft document. </P>
<P> ``Well, we might,'' Gregg said, ``but then again we might not.'' </P>
