<P>  John Morse never looked like a man converting his first lead in a PGA Tour event into the first win of his career on the last hole of the $1.2 million Hawaiian Open Sunday. </P>
<P> He calmly sent a six-foot eagle putt straight into the center of the final cup to increase his lead to three strokes. </P>
<P> ``I was brain-dead,'' said Morse, describing his feelings over his 5-wood approach shot on 18. </P>
<P> ``I was just trying to hit a good shot. I was looking straight at the sun and never saw the shot, but when I got up to the green and saw I could three-putt and win, that's when I was finally able to relax. </P>
<P> ``This is a huge win for me.'' </P>
<P> Morse shot a final-round 68 to finish at 19 under par, three ahead of Tom Lehamn, who had a 67, and Duffy Waldorf, in with a 68. Paul Azinger shot a 66 and finished tied for fourth, his best performance on tour since returning from last year's cancer treatment. </P>
<P> The win, worth $216,000 to Morse, was his fifth world-wide, but his first in America. </P>
<P> Morse, 36, had failed repeatedly failed to gain a spot on the PGA Tour and played in Canada and Australia until 1993, when he finally earned his way onto the U.S. tour. Last year, he finished 122nd on the PGA money list with $146,137. </P>
<P> Morse's eagle finish on Waialae's par-5 18th was an appropriate cap to his tournament performance. Morse won the Hawaiian Open with his performance on the course's four par-5s. </P>
<P> For the week he was a collective 18 under par on the long holes, a dramatic change from the way he had played par-5s in previous years. Last year he was ranked 152nd in birdies on par-5s and made just two eagles all year. He had three eagles this week. </P>
<P> ``Not bad for a short guy,'' said Morse, referring to his lack of distance off the tee. </P>
<P> Morse began the day with a two-stroke lead, and never fell out of first place, though he was tied briefly with Dan Pohl, and several others got to within a stroke, including Lehman, Waldorf and Azinger. </P>
<P> Azinger, stating that he is in the best physical shape of his life, had his seventh top-10 finish at the Hawaiian Open in the past nine years. </P>
<P> Midway through the final round he carded a string of four straight birdies and an eagle. </P>
<P> ``I told my caddy then that I needed just a couple more birdies and that might be enough, but I couldn't do it. I made a lot of mistakes this week, but I still picked up some Ryder Cup points, and that's important,'' said Azinger. </P>
