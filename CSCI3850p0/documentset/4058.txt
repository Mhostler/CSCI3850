<DATELINE>MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Israel Tuesday allowed the first visits since 1987 to prisoners in a jail it controls in south Lebanon but the Red Cross and relatives of the inmates said it was not enough. </P>
<P> Sources in the South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia, which runs the Khiam jail in Israel's south Lebanon occupation zone under Israeli supervision, said the visits were by a dozen relatives of four of the 240 prisoners. </P>
<P> One prisoner, Rashed Hijazi, met his 10-year-old daughter Mariam for the first time when his relatives were allowed to visit him in a hospital near the hilltop jail. </P>
<P> But an expected Red Cross inspection of the jail did not take place. The International Committee of the Red Cross said it had not received permission to enter the prison near SLA headquarters at Marjayoun. </P>
<P> ICRC Lebanon chief Bernard Pfefferle said ICRC cars were allowed to escort the relatives into the zone and take them back after the 10-minute visit. But they were not allowed closer than four miles from the jail. </P>
<P> ``This is not enough. We want to organize ICRC visits to enter the place and to check the conditions of detention,'' Pfefferle told reporters. ``We have not yet reached an agreement and we hope that this will be the next step.'' </P>
<P> No humanitarian agency has been allowed into Khiam since its establishment in 1985. According to a Beirut-based prisoners' support group, three prisoners have died in the last two months -- one in hospital at Marjayoun after torture and two in Beirut hospitals immediately after their release. </P>
<P> Pfefferle said some 240 prisoners, mostly Lebanese but including a few Palestinians and other Arabs, are held at Khiam. Relatives say many have been held for years without trial in poor conditions and subject to maltreatment. </P>
<P> An SLA source said family visits to Khiam took place until 1987 but were halted because the pro-Iranian Hizbollah (Party of God), whose guerrillas are fighting Israeli troops in south Lebanon, refused to allow visits to SLA prisoners it held. </P>
