<P>  President Boris Yeltsin's security chief, Gen. Alexander Korzhakov, dismissed rumors that he is one of Russia's most powerful figures in a rare interview to be published Wednesday. </P>
<P> Russian and Western commentators have identified Korzhakov, a close friend of Yeltsin who is almost always at his boss' side, as one of the few men from whom the president has been taking counsel during the Chechnya crisis. </P>
<P> ``But I say immediately -- I have never been involved in politics and do not consider myself a professional politician,'' Korzhakov told the monthly newspaper Argumenty i Fakti. </P>
<P> Korzhakov set out in the interview, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters ahead of publication, to scotch rumors about the extent of his powers. </P>
<P> ``My legal status is clearly defined,'' Korzhakov said, presenting himself as a loyal servant of the state and the president. </P>
<P> Little is known about Korzhakov. Rumors about his influence grew as Yeltsin kept a low profile during the early stages of the Russian military intervention in Chechnya and recuperated from a minor nose operation. </P>
<P> Speculation about Korzhakov's role mounted last month when he denounced World Bank proposals to reform Russia's oil export system in a letter addressed to Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. </P>
<P> The letter, suggesting his influence went beyond the Kremlin walls, prompted the newspaper Izvestia last month to ask: ``Who is running the country -- Yeltsin, Chernomyrdin or Gen. Korzhakov?'' </P>
