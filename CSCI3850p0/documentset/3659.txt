<P>  The U.S. Coast Guard repatriated 500 Haitian refugees from the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base Monday and U.S. officials said the approximately 3,000 refugees still at the camp could all be home by early next week. </P>
<P> U.S. embassy spokesman Stanley Schrager said with at least two boatloads of refugees returning to Haiti each day the camp should be cleared by next week. </P>
<P> ``Very early next week we should have them all back,'' Schrager said. </P>
<P> The Coast Guard repatriated 325 refugees on the cutter Boutwell and 175 on the cutter Valiant Monday. All were being repatriated involuntarily. </P>
<P> Unlike on Saturday when some refugees physically resisted returning to their homeland, Monday's parties cooperated fully. But some hid their faces from the awaiting Bangladeshi and American soldiers and many were stony faced as they stepped ashore. </P>
<P> All the refugees were given about $15 and a small Red Cross package containing food and other small items such as detergent before being dropped off at the local bus station. </P>
<P> The mostly poor Haitians fled the Caribbean nation last summer amid violence by the then army rulers. The military was ousted from power in October and the refugees were recently told by their American hosts they had overstayed their welcome. </P>
