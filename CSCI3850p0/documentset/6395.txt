<P>  The Israeli army has raided and shut down a West Bank Palestinian media service office that supports the militant Muslim Hamas movement, the office' director said Tuesday. </P>
<P> Abdel Raim Qusimi, director of the Nablus Office for Media and Journalism, said members of the army's Civil Administration occupation arm entered the office Monday, handed him an order closing the office for six months for possession of what they called ``inciting material,'' and confiscated printed matter. </P>
<P> The office serves Nablus-area journalists who report for the independent al-Quds daily and other Palestinian newspapers. </P>
<P> Residents said the office was known as pro-Hamas. Hamas, which leads violent opposition to the 1993 Israel-PLO peace deal, is the Israeli army's main target in the West Bank. </P>
<P> Civil Adminstration officials were not immediately available for comment. </P>
<P> Qusimi said he was astonished by the closure order, which he called unfair and unjustified. ``The materials they confiscated were magazines sold on the open market,'' he said. </P>
<P> He said last January Israel also raided the office, confiscating a computer. </P>
<P> Journalists in Nablus protested against the closure to the Civil Administration, saying it constituted harassment of the press. </P>
