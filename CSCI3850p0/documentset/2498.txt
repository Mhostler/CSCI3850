<DATELINE>CARSON CITY, Nev.(Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Democratic Sen. Richard Bryan won his re-election bid, returns indicated Tuesday night, making him one of a shrinking number of Democrats who won a return ticket to Washington. </P>
<P> With 54 percent of the votes counted, Bryan had 52 percent versus 40 percent for his Republican challenger Hal Furman, a Washington lobbyist. </P>
<P> Bryan's apparent victory is not a result of touting his Democratic leanings, however. During his campaign Bryan distanced himself from President Clinton and opposed Clinton's tax plan. </P>
<P> This will be Bryan's second term in the Senate. He was Nevada's Governor before his first Senate victory in 1988. </P>
