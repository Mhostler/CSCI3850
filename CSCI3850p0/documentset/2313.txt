<P>  Vice President Al Gore said Sunday he believed new polls that show growing public approval for the job President Clinton and fellow Democrats are doing and that the party will not lose as many seats in the approaching Congressional elections. </P>
<P> ``I think the wind is at the backs of Democratic candidates now,'' he said. </P>
<P> Gore, on the ABC show ``This Week with David Brinkley, credited the turnaround to the adjournment of a fractious Congress and new statistics showing an economic resurgence. </P>
<P> Until this weekend, polls predicting the outcome of the Nov. 8 election have shown substantial Republican gains likely in the House of Representatives and Senate, possibly enough to give them majorities in both houses. </P>
<P> But polls released Saturday found rising confidence in President Clinton, stemming from his recent firm hand in foreign policy. The approval extended to his party. </P>
<P> Gore said good economic news contributed to the polls, too, with indices released Friday showing moderate inflation and strong third-quarter growth. </P>
<P> Gore said voters would re-elect Democrats who had backed Clinton's economic policies, which he credited for the nation's economic growth, low inflation and continued decline in the budget deficit. </P>
<P> The Democrats control the House of Representatives 256-178, with one independent, and the Senate 56-44. </P>
<P> Gore also took fresh aim at Oliver North, the conservative Republican trying to unseat U.S. Sen. Chuck Robb, a Virginia Democrat. </P>
<P> He said North, ahead in polls, ``cannot tell the truth.'' </P>
<P> North, a national security advisor to President Reagan, was found guilty on three charges involving the Iran-Contra affair of selling arms to Iran and illegally using the funds for arms to right-wing contra guerrillas in Nicaragua. </P>
<P> But an appeals court overturned the convictions on grounds North had been given immunity by Congress in exchange for his testimony about the affair. </P>
<P> Gore also said he opposed an initiative on the California ballot to deny education to chidlren of illegal immigrants. </P>
<P> The inititive backed by Republican U.S. Rep. Michael Huffington, who is challenging incumbent Democratic Sen. Diane Feinstein. </P>
<P> Holding the seats of Robb and Feinstein are vital if Dmocrats are to hold their Senate majority. </P>
<P> Gore said the right way to end illegal Mexican immigration was not to end social services but to keep them from crossing the border in the first place. </P>
