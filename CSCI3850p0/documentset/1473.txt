<DATELINE>NAPLES, Italy (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The ``miracle of San Gennaro'' happened Monday, as it has twice a year for centuries, when an Italian saint's congealed blood liquefied. </P>
<P> Roman Catholics in Naples were relieved when Archbishop Michele Giordano told 3,000 people gathered to celebrate the festival of the fourth century saint that the blood had turned to liquid. </P>
<P> The phenomenon is regularly hailed as averting disaster superstitious Neapolitans believe will strike the city if it fails to do so. </P>
<P> The miracle has been recorded on set dates twice a year for the past 600 years, and has been known to happen on special occasions and for illustrious visitors. </P>
<P> In his sermon, Giordano said he hoped it was a good omen for Naples -- one of Italy's least developed cities. </P>
<P> Italian scientists have confirmed that the substance, held in a vial in the Santa Chiara cathedral is blood, but have not discovered why it liquefies regularly. </P>
