<P>  In the kind of discovery that makes the art world gasp, a leading expert has identified a small bronze figure of Cleopatra that goes on sale here next week as probably a long lost work of the great Florentine sculptor Benvenuto Cellini. </P>
<P> Sotheby's auction house announced the discovery Thursday, saying that the expert, Dr Peter Meller of of the University of California at Santa Barbara University, would be re-examining the work and comparing it with existing records in the hopes of making a final determination. </P>
<P> The 10 5/8 inch long statue of a nude, reclining Cleopatra holding an asp to her neck is going on sale next Wednesday with the catalogue attributing it to an unknown French sculptor of the mid-16th century from the school of Fontainebleau. </P>
<P> Cellini, a 16th century artist, worked in France. </P>
<P> If the attribution is changed to Cellini, whose known surviving sculptures number fewer than 15, its selling price could be 10 times or more above its current estimate of between $25,000 and $35,000, Sotheby's said. </P>
<P> According to Elizabeth Wilson, the head of Sotheby's department of Renaissance sculpture, Mellor saw the work when it was on display in California and recalled that an inventory of Cellini's works complied after his death included both a wax model of Cleopatra and a bronze model. </P>
<P> ``Several of our historians had previously wondered if the work was a Cellini and Mellor says he is pretty convinced that it is,'' Wilson said. </P>
<P> She added, ``He will be coming here Friday with all his documentation and we hope to clarify the situation.'' </P>
<P> She said the work was close in style to other known Cellini works. </P>
<P> The work was once owned by Prince Nicholas of Romania and is being sold as part of the estate of the English dealer in Renaissance sculpture, Cyril Humphris. </P>
