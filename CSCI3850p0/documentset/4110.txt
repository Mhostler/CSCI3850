<P>  Former Detroit Lions quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner Andre Ware signed a contract with the National Football League expansion Jacksonville Jaguars Thursday. </P>
<P> The 26-year-old Ware is the first quarterback to sign with the Jaguars, who begin play this season. </P>
<P> After a college career at Houston during which he set 26 NCAA passing records, Ware joined the Lions as the seventh player selected in the 1990 draft. </P>
<P> In four seasons as a backup with the Lions, he completed 83-of-161 passes, a 51.6 per cent completion rate, for 1,112 yards with five touchdowns and eight interceptions. </P>
<P> Ware started just six games for Detroit, posting a 3-3 record. </P>
<P> Last year, Ware signed with Minnesota as a free agent but was released by the Vikings the day before the 1994 season began. He later signed a Canadian Football League contract with the Ottawa Rough Riders, which expired last week. </P>
<P> Ware played in only 27 games for the University of Houston, but threw for 75 touchdowns to set a Southwest Conference record. In his final season in 1989, he set NCAA records with 4,699 yards and 10 400-yard games. </P>
