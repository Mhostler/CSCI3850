<P>  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Monday a peace treaty with Jordan could be signed by the end of the year. </P>
<P> ``With satisfaction, joy and even pride I tell the Knesset (parliament) in my estimation a full peace accord between Israel and Jordan could be signed shortly, even before the end of the year,'' he told parliament. </P>
<P> Addressing the opening of the Knesset's winter session, Rabin said Israel and Jordan were still at odds over border locations, water and security issues. </P>
<P> ``In the coming days, our representatives will again sit at the negotiating table with the representatives of the Hashemite kingdom of Jordan in order to achieve the signing of another peace treaty for the state of Israel,'' he said. </P>
<P> Rabin's speech coincided with a meeting in Washington Monday between Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan and President Clinton -- another step on the road to a peace accord. </P>
<P> Last July, on the White House lawn, Rabin and Jordan's King Hussein signed a declaration ending a 46-year state of war between their two countries. </P>
<P> Israel and Jordan have since opened their border to the passage of foreign tourists and established direct telephone links. They are also negotiating overflight rights for their airlines. </P>
<P> Rabin and King Hussein last met, in a surprise summit in Jordan, Thursday. </P>
<P> ``Last Thursday, the king and prince made it clear to me they intend to achieve soon the signing of a full peace accord between Israel and Jordan,'' Rabin said. </P>
<P> ``The king told me, and I quote: 'In our peace, there will be no meaning to the border between Israel and Jordan'.'' </P>
