<P>  Hundreds of police turned out to control thousands of Chinese who packed churches in Beijing Sunday for Christmas midnight mass -- many attending to be fashionable and others celebrating the freedom to worship. </P>
<P> Church officials barred the doors of the Church of Our Saviour after more than 2,000 people jammed the most important Catholic church in Beijing for midnight mass, leaving hundreds outside in the freezing cold hoping for a chance to get in for the next service. </P>
<P> ``More than 40,000 people have attended services today,'' one church official said as Christmas Eve gave way to Christmas Day. ``The order has been a little chaotic.'' </P>
<P> Inside the blue and white Gothic church built by a French bishop in 1887, the faithful jostled with crowds of curious sightseers for space to pray. </P>
<P> The church, closed by radical fanatics in the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, reopened in 1985 and held three masses on Christmas Eve and four Sunday. </P>
<P> ``The Cultural Revolution was very cruel. In the past, people did not dare even to enter the church,'' said Tang Yulun, 36, whose family have been Catholics for generations. ``Now it is more free and there are no such worries. </P>
<P> ``In the past we would pray secretly at home, now it is much, much better,'' he said. </P>
<P> Outside the church, hundreds of police tried to maintain order in the jammed churchyard. Inside, the conversations among curious onlookers and complaints of pushing and shoving drowned out the Latin mass. </P>
<P> China is the only country in the world where mass is still said in Latin. The Patriotic Catholic Association is under the control of the Chinese government and not the Vatican, which switched to mass in local languages in the 1960s. </P>
<P> ``This is fashionable, it is the 'in' thing,'' said a 20-year-old university student, attending for the second year. </P>
<P> ``I have no plans to become a Catholic,'' he said. ``Both God and Buddha are imaginary but they can influence people's thoughts and provide spiritual sustenance.'' </P>
<P> All 14 Catholic churches open in Beijing held Christmas services. The city has 70,000 Catholics and there are about four million nationwide, officials say. </P>
