<P>  A publisher is offering Chinese speculators an extremely limited edition of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping's selected works. </P>
<P> The China Thread-bound Publishing House will issue just 100 copies of Deng's thoughts on July 1, the official Science and Technology Daily reported Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``This set of books is not only a classical work by a great man but also a precious work of art that is worth collecting,'' the newspaper said. </P>
<P> Such a rare item could be expected to soar in value in the increasingly speculative socialist market economy pioneered in China by Deng since 1978. </P>
<P> The report did not say how the 100 curios would be sold. </P>
<P> The edition was designed by well-known Chinese artists, the newspaper said, but was not described in detail. </P>
<P> Thoughts of the retired Deng, 90, venerated as the ``chief architect'' of China's market reforms, are available in an abundance of books, floppy discs, CD-ROMs and even a calligraphic scroll running 2.4 miles in length. </P>
<P> But Deng has shunned a repetition of the cult-like adulation that surrounded his predecessor, Mao Tse-tung, in the decade preceding his death in 1976. </P>
