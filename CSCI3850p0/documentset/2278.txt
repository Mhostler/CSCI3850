<P>  Hedda Nussbaum broke down and wept on the witness stand Thursday after viewing a videotape showing the permanent scars and brutal wounds inflicted seven years ago by her ex-lover, Joel Steinberg, whom she helped send to prison. </P>
<P> It was the first time Nussbaum, 52, had seen the videotape since the sensational trial that convicted Steinberg for the November 1987 fatal beating of Lisa, a 6-year-old girl they had illegally adopted. </P>
<P> Nussbaum was in Manhattan Supreme Court pressing her claim against Steinberg for $12.6 million in damages for injuries she said he inflicted on her during their decadelong relationship. </P>
<P> Her face scarred and disfigured, her nose flattened and her ears cauliflowered from years of abuse, Nussbaum recalled more than 30 incidents during which she said her ex-lover battered and tortured her. </P>
<P> She said Steinberg beat her with an exercise bar and on another occasion shattered her eye socket. She also described a series of beatings that left her with a fractured knee, lip injuries, a ruptured spleen, a broken nose, cigarette burns on her stomach and black and blue bruises on her buttocks. </P>
<P> Nussbaum covered her mouth with her hand and lowered her face as she watched the videotape. But when her ulcerated leg wounds were shown, she began crying and was ushered out of the courtroom. </P>
<P> The videotape was made by police the night she and Steinberg were arrested. </P>
<P> Charges against Nussbaum were later dropped after she agreed to testify against Steinberg, 53, a disbarred lawyer. </P>
<P> He was convicted of manslaughter and is serving an 8 1/3 to 25 years in prison. </P>
<P> Since the sensational trial that attracted international media attention, Nussbaum has gone through a series of painful operations on her face and body to repair the damage left by vicious beatings, her lawyer, Betty Levinson, said. </P>
<P> Nussbaum now works as a legal secretary for a lawyer and lives alone in Westchester County, a 30-minute drive from midtown Manhattan, Levinson said. </P>
<P> ``Hedda also works now with battered women's groups and is very active lobbying to reform various aspects of the law to be more sensitive to the problems of battered women,'' Levinson said. </P>
<P> Levinson said Nussbaum did not expect to collect any money from Steinberg, who has no known assets. </P>
<P> ``The purpose of the lawsuit is to determine whether she or any battered woman, can file a suit after the statute of limitations lapses and be excused for not filing on time because she was suffering from the effects of beatings.'' </P>
