<P>  Somalian warlord Ali Mahdi rebuked Muslim nations Saturday for failing to send aid to his impoverished and conflict-riven country. </P>
<P> Mahdi told an Arab and Islamist conference in Khartoum that Somalis had protested outside his office recently complaining that Muslims ``won't even send us burial shrouds, let alone food.'' </P>
<P> ``With this tragedy in our country it is sad for me to say that help from Islamic countries was not as forthcoming as we wanted it to be,'' Mahdi said. </P>
<P> ``Some of our brothers from the Muslim world have come to rescue our people but their number is very limited,'' he added, speaking through an interpreter. </P>
<P> He urged Muslims to mobilize aid for Somalia ``not by reciting verses of the Koran but by translating them into deeds.'' </P>
<P> Mahdi addressed the conference, aimed at rallying Arab and Moslem delegates against perceived Western domination, just after a representative of rival Somali warlord Mohammad Farah Aideed. </P>
<P> Aideed's spokesman condemned United Nations peacekeepers who stayed more than two years in the country before pulling out last month. </P>
<P> Neither speaker mentioned reconciliation between opposing Somali factions. </P>
