<P>  Buckingham Palace won a moral victory Wednesday in its struggle to save the royal family's children from media intrusion. </P>
<P> The Press Complaints Commission upheld a palace complaint that it was misleading for a newspaper to portray a few passing remarks at a horse show as the ``first-ever interview'' by Peter Phillips, the 16-year-old son of the queen's daughter Anne. </P>
<P> ``The complaint by Buckingham Palace underlines the importance which the royal family attaches to protecting younger members of the family from unnecessary and unjustified intrusion before they reach adulthood,'' a palace spokeswoman said. </P>
<P> But the media watchdog body made no mention of any financial penalty for Today newspaper, which like all Britain's tabloids knows nothing sells newspapers like a good royal story. </P>
<P> Palace aides are trying to acclimatize Prince Charles' children William, 12, and Harry, 10, gradually and carefully to the media spotlight which will dog them all their lives. </P>
<P> A more aggressive royal establishment appears increasingly ready to fight back against intrusive or inaccurate media reports which they used to greet with haughty silence. </P>
<P> Princess Diana, suing a gym owner who took sneak photographs of her, is next month due to become the first member of the inner royal circle for 90 years to testify in court. </P>
