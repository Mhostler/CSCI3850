<P>  Alpine skiing officials are worried that the fiance of the late Austrian skier Ulrike Maier may try to disrupt the return of the women's World Cup to the German resort where she lost her life in a terrifying crash last year. </P>
<P> Organizers plan at least one tribute to Maier around this weekend's super giant slalom and slalom races on the Garmisch-Partenkirchen course where the former world champion broke her neck in a high-speed downhill accident last January. </P>
<P> But they refused to release any details Thursday because of a threat of disturbances from Hubert Schweighofer, the father of Maier's young daughter who is presently trying to sue skiing chiefs for insufficient safety precautions last year. </P>
<P> ``We are not saying what we are doing yet because Schweighofer has let it be known that he may do something,'' a German skiing official said. ``He may come to Garmisch and seek publicity. </P>
<P> ``We have no objections if it's a matter of a banner or something... He asked for a press conference here but the press did not want to talk to him.'' </P>
<P> Schweighofer, who is seeking compensation for their daughter Melanie, is unhappy that German public prosecutors have closed the case into the death of the 26-year-old Maier because they believed sufficient safety measures had been taken. </P>
<P> Garmisch decided in October against staging downhills on the Kandahar course this year because it would cost too much to make the piste safe. </P>
<P> But there is still bitterness about the death. Chief organizer Hubert Ostler has received death threats. The resort has increased its safety budget to try to make sure there are no accidents this year. </P>
<P> The super-g course includes the same stretch of piste where Maier lost control of her skis, careered down the slope backwards and smashed the back of her head on a pile of snow and a timing post at the side of the course. </P>
<P> The ``FIS-Schneise'' section is one of the easiest and most straightforward parts of the piste. Garmisch officials have often claimed that it was almost impossible to predict that Maier would have lost control there. </P>
<P> But Garmisch spokesman Rudi Maerkl said it was very unlikely that a timing post would be placed at the spot this year. Decisions about the posts are not made until the course has been set in the run-up to the super-g. </P>
<P> Maier's death cast a huge shadow over last season despite the Lillehammer Olympics. </P>
<P> The most moving scene of the year was that of Schweighofer shedding tears on the snow where Maier died the morning after the accident. The Austrian team have undergone pyschological treatment to get over the crash. </P>
<P> Garmisch organizers are expected to hold a church service and a minute's silence before the races in memory of the Austrian skier. </P>
