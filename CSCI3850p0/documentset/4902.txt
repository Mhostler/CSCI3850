<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Lebanon staged a general strike Tuesday to demand withdrawal of Israeli troops from south Lebanon on the 17th anniversary of Israel's first invasion of the country. </P>
<P> Schools, offices and most shops closed and the government was due to hold an unprecedented meeting in the south to show solidarity with inhabitants who bear the brunt of almost daily bombardments by Israeli troops occupying a border zone. </P>
<P> Israel and a local client militia have held a border strip in south Lebanon uninterruptedly since 1978. </P>
<P> Many Lebanese wore yellow ribbons Tuesday reading ``Resolution 425'' in Arabic and English, referring to the 1978 U.N. Security Council resolution calling for an immediate and unconditional Israeli withdrawal. </P>
<P> Yellow ribbons were tied to lamp posts in Beirut and streets were lined with lit candles Monday night. </P>
<P> Israeli troops and the South Lebanon Army militia in the nine miles wide occupation zone hold 11 percent of Lebanon's national territory, including 156 towns and villages with a population estimated at 200,000. </P>
<P> Israel first seized part of the south in 1978 when it invaded Lebanon to fight the Palestine Liberation Organization. It held on to a border strip until 1982 when it invaded again, and expanded the strip in 1985 when it withdrew the bulk of its forces. </P>
<P> The cabinet meeting in the Shiite Muslim town of Nabatiyeh facing the occupation zone aims at underlining Lebanon's demand for implementation of resolution 425. </P>
<P> Lebanese-Israeli peace talks aimed at securing an Israeli withdrawal have been stalled for more than a year and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin angered Beirut this year when he said he considered that resolution 425 no longer existed. </P>
<P> The government has urged motorists to bring the country's chaotic traffic to a halt for three minutes at noon in a demonstration of solidarity with the south. </P>
<P> ``All of Lebanon demands that the Israeli enemy withdraw from south Lebanon,'' read a street banner in the Christian Beirut suburb of Furn ash-Shubbak. </P>
