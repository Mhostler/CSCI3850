<P>  France called Tuesday for a ``last-chance'' international conference on former Yugoslavia, saying the alternative was more fighting and the collapse of U.N. peace efforts. </P>
<P> In a statement published in the newspaper Le Monde, Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said the only way to pull the negotiations out of deadlock was ``a summit meeting of the main protagonists in the tragedy,'' followed by an international conference. </P>
<P> Juppe made clear he was announcing an initiative coordinated with the United States and Russia in France's capacity as current president of the European Union. </P>
<P> ``I have reached the conviction that this is the last-chance scenario for everyone ... The time has come for (France) to propose the holding of a new conference on ex-Yugoslavia,'' Juppe said. ``In three months' time, it will perhaps be too late.'' </P>
<P> He urged the presidents of Croatia and Serbia, Franjo Tudjman and Slobodan Milosevic, to meet and settle their differences on the basis of mutual recognition. </P>
