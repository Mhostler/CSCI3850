<P>  The head of Paraguay's anti-drug squad died Monday in a bizarre double attack in which he was first shot by unidentified gunmen, then finished off by one of the officers sent to his aid, army sources said. </P>
<P> Three gunmen opened fire on General Ramon Rosa Rodriguez, head of the Paraguayan Anti-Drug Service, after he dropped his daughter off at school in Asuncion. They fled by jeep.  Wounded in the right arm, Rodriguez called for help by radio but then got into an argument with an army captain sent to rescue him, who shot him in the back of the neck. Rodriguez died from his wounds in a hospital. Army sources said the captain was arrested by other soldiers but gave no explanation for the quarrel. </P>
<P> Paraguayan interior minister Carlos Podesta said three people had so far been arrested in connection with the attacks but he did not identify them. ``Rodriguez was in charge of all information on drug trafficking,'' he said. </P>
