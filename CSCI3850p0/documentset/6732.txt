<P> In an interview publsihed in Monday's Woman's Own magazine, Hurley was asked what she thought of America's movie capital. </P>
<P> ``I thought 70 percent of the people I met were idiots. Half of those were fools and the other half were vile. They'll take phone calls while you're in the room and are just horrendous,'' she said. ``The other 30 percent are nice, though.'' </P>
