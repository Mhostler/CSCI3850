<P>  Citing continuing reports of human rights abuses in China, a panel of Republican and Democratic lawmakers urged the House Tuesday to withdraw favorable trade treatment for imports from China. </P>
<P> They told a hearing of the House Ways and Means trade subcommittee termination of Most Favored Nation status for China would pressure Beijing to improve human rights.  Republican Rep. Gerald Solomon of New York, chairman of the powerful House Rules Committee, said he will introduce a resolution to disapprove of the extension of MFN for China. </P>
<P> But top administration officials told the panel the White House believes the best human rights policy is to continue open trade with China by renewal of its MFN status. The recommendation is expected to be sent to Congress before June 3 and is granted automatically unless Congress votes to disapprove. </P>
<P> Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said Washington has found Beijing more open to U.S. trade concerns now that trade and human rights issues are no longer linked. She told the hearing greater involvement with China on trade, human rights and other fronts will encourage more openness. </P>
<P> Last year Clinton chose not to link trade with human rights or other issues in deciding to seek the annual renewal of MFN status for China. </P>
<P> ``This decision sets a long-term foundation for a more productive bilateral relationship with China. At the same time, the administration has pursued, and will continue to pursue vigorously, U.S. objectives in all areas of policy toward China, including human rights and non-proliferation,'' Barshevsky said. </P>
<P> Republican Rep. Frank Wolf of Virginia brought up reports of sales of organs for transplant from executed prisoners and sales of aborted fetuses for human use. </P>
<P> ``A year has passed (since the last granting of most favored nation status) and the human rights situation has not improved,'' Wolf said. He, Solomon and California Democrats Nancy Pelosi and Tom Lantos urged the panel to use MFN as leverage with Beijing. </P>
<P> But committee member Robert Matsui, a California Democrat, argued that termination of the special trade privileges would in effect end all trade with China since it would raise tariffs to a level making the products unaffordable. </P>
<P> ``It is just a very blunt instrument to use and I think an ineffective one,'' agreed Republican Rep. Jim Kolbe of Arizona. </P>
