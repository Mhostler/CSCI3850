<P> A high-ranking Russian defense ministry source had earlier denied reports in the Russian media that the thousands of besieging troops would storm Grozny on New Year's Eve, Interfax news agency said. </P>
<P> ``The planned taking charge of the city is going on in accordance with the dispositions worked out earlier,'' a source close to defense chiefs said. ``Russian troops are not starting any emergency efforts at all.'' </P>
<P> He said there was a possibility of a lull in military operations around Grozny ``close to midnight.'' Russia sent troops into Chechnya on December 11 to crush the southern region's three-year independence bid. </P>
