<P>  French Defense Minister Francois Leotard Sunday joined a growing chorus of criticism of President Francois Mitterrand's recent discussions of his ties to the collaborationist Vichy regime during and after World War Two. </P>
<P> ``Those who say that they didn't know, those who think that it was less serious than people thought, they -- whether they like it or not -- are putting themselves on the same side as the oppressors,'' Leotard told French television. </P>
<P> On Saturday, Interior Minister Charles Pasqua said he was saddened by what he saw as Mitterrand's attempt to rewrite the history of the era and his portrayal of wartime France as ``a beaten, divided and consenting'' nation. </P>
<P> Mitterrand, a socialist whose second seven-year term ends in May, shares power with the center-right government of which Leotard and Pasqua are a part. </P>
<P> Mitterrand served during the war as a minor official in the Vichy government before playing an active role in the anti-Nazi resistance. </P>
<P> In recent television and newspaper interviews, Mitterrand played down a prewar fling with rightist extremists as youthful dalliance and said he was unaware, while serving Vichy in 1942, of anti-Semitic laws imposed two years earlier. </P>
<P> He also defended a long post-war friendship with Vichy police chief Rene Bousquet and acknowledged slowing down some legal proceedings against former collaborators, saying he believed he had a duty to reconcile the French people following the wartime years. </P>
<P> Echoing Pasqua, Leotard told France-2 television he had listened to a recent Mitterrand interview ``with sadness.'' </P>
<P> ``If one tries to say that basically it was not serious to be mistaken in '40, '41, '42, '43, if one starts to develop that theory, if one seeks to present such an error as commonplace, one is in the process of attempting to rejustify that era.'' </P>
<P> ``One could not claim to have no knowledge at that time of those wearing a yellow star (of David), one could not claim to not know about the anti-Semitic laws,'' Leotard said. </P>
