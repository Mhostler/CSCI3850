<P>  The chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. John Shalikashvili, whose father served with the Waffen SS, Tuesday visited Israel's memorial to six million Jews killed in the Nazi Holocaust. </P>
<P> ``Well, you know, for someone who was born in Warsaw, Poland, whose memory as a child is seeing the (Jewish) ghetto but from the outside, someone who as a child left in 1944, it is perhaps the most moving day to come here,'' Shalikashvili told reporters. </P>
<P> Israel radio stations noted that Shalikashvili's father, Dimitri, served with a German unit against Soviet troops at the end of World War Two. During the visit the general did not mention his father's service. </P>
<P> A Jewish research center revealed the information in 1993 when Shalikashvili's appointment as head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had yet to be confirmed. </P>
<P> The general said at the time: ``I did not withhold this information, for I never had the slightest hint that my father was associated with the Waffen SS. I'm deeply saddened that my father had this tragic association.'' </P>
<P> The father had written in a family memoir that he hoped fighting with the German unit at the end of the war would help his native Georgia in the Caucasus gain independence. </P>
<P> On Tuesday, the United States' top soldier told reporters as he left the Yad Vashem memorial: ``To come here and see this inhumanity of man to man... I think what is in your heart is the deepest hope that here in this place, on this beautiful day, at this very special time, that peace can be built.'' </P>
<P> Israel Radio said Shalikashvili wrote in Yad Vashem's visitors book: ``With tears for all those whose lives were taken from them and with hope for a free and safe Israel that will live in peace forever.'' </P>
