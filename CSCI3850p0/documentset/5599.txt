<P>  Thailand's Foreign Minister Krasae Chanavongse said on his return from a two-day trip to Rangoon he was satisfied with Burma's efforts to improve human rights and democracy, Thai newspapers reported on Sunday. </P>
<P> He told reporters Burma's ruling military body was sincere in its efforts to foster national reconciliation. </P>
<P> ``Burma knows about the outside world's criticism. However, each country has its own way of developing democracy and human rights,'' Krasae was quoted as saying. </P>
<P> His trip followed several months of cooler relations that began when a Burmese army offensive against minority Karen guerrillas forced thousands of refugees into Thailand. </P>
<P> The two neighbours have since then exchanged accusations over a series of incidents along their border. </P>
<P> Krasae had talks with his Burmese counterpart, Ohn Gyaw, and the military government's powerful intelligence chief, Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt. </P>
<P> ``After talking with Ohn Gyaw and Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt I am pleased and satisfied with their efforts to develop democracy and human rights,'' Krasae said. </P>
<P> ``The Burmese government is not only attempting to restore national unity, it has developed the country in many areas, including border areas,'' he said. </P>
<P> The recent border problems stemmed from fighting between Burmese government forces and autonomy-seeking guerrillas that at times spilled over the frontier into Thailand. </P>
<P> Bangkok offered to act as a mediator in the long-running disputes but Rangoon turned down the offer saying the fighting was an internal affair. </P>
<P> Despite the recent problems, Thailand has long been a leading advocate of Southeast Asia's policy of ``constructive engagement'' with the Rangoon military government. </P>
<P> Burma attended a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) for the first time last year as a guest of host country, Thailand. </P>
<P> Bangkok newspapers cited Ohn Gyaw on Sunday as saying he would be happy to attend the next ASEAN foreign ministers' meeting in Brunei in July if he were invited. </P>
<P> ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. </P>
<P> ASEAN leaders have said they hope the four Southeast Asian countries, which are not yet members, Burma, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, will eventually join. </P>
