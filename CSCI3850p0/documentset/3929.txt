<P>  Advocates vowed Tuesday to fight to bring to the United States 357 Haitian children in U.S. detention without adult relatives, in spite of U.S. policy that bars them while admitting thousands of Cuban boat people. </P>
<P> ``The continued detention of Haitian children at (the U.S. Naval Base at) Guantanamo and their unequal treatment because they are black ... is a continuation of the blight of American justice,'' said John Due of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. </P>
<P> Due and other Haitian refugee advocates held a news conference to discuss recent visits to the base, during which attorneys were barred from the unaccompanied minors' camp. </P>
<P> They said Haitian children said they had been shouted at, handcuffed and physically abused at the base, and that they already had promises from relatives and other Haitian-Americans that many would be supported if they were admitted to the United States. </P>
<P> Cheryl Little, an attorney who represents the refugees, said Washington should not offer humanitarian parole to thousands of Cuban children and their parents while barring a small group of Haitian children, some of them orphans. </P>
<P> ``They have nobody there to go back to. They have nothing but terrible memories of Haiti,'' she said. </P>
<P> A spokesman said the U.S. Justice Department would rule on the children after it received recommendations from the United Nations and the State Department. </P>
<P> The 357 Haitian children, many of whose parents are U.S. residents, were among thousands of refugees who fled Haiti and Cuba and were brought to Guantanamo last summer. </P>
<P> There are still 30,000 Cubans there and in Panama. Only about 770 Haitians remain, compared to 21,000 in August. Thousands returned home voluntarily after President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was restored to power in October after three years in exile due to a bloody 1991 coup. </P>
<P> U.S. officials returned thousands more this month, deciding that almost all but the very sick and unaccompanied minors should be forcibly repatriated, saying Haiti is now safe. </P>
<P> In contrast, the Clinton administration has announced plans to bring thousands of Cubans, including children with and without relatives, to the United States. </P>
<P> Some of the Haitian children have made statements to lawyers about their requests for U.S. asylum. </P>
<P> ``After the coup, my father was threatened by the military. The military made him take down posters of Aristide and eat them. After other threats, my father went into hiding. We never heard from him again,'' said a 16-year-old girl. </P>
<P> The girl and her mother fled Haiti in June despite her mother's severe illness, which led to her death July 25. </P>
<P> ``I have been very sad since my mother died,'' said the girl, who was not identified. ``I am all alone.'' </P>
