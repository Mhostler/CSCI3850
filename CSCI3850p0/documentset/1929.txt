<P> ``Our deployments in the Gulf region are continuing today. There has been no change in the pattern of Iraqi activity from (Monday), so we will continue our deployments,'' Clinton said as he departed the White House for a one-day trip to Michigan. </P>
<P> The president said he spoken with several world leaders on Monday, adding: ``We have received strong support from the international community for this approach.'' </P>
<P> Iraq announced on Monday that it was pulling back some of the troops it has massed near its border with Kuwait but there has been no independent confirmation of that. And in a television interview earlier Tuesday, Madeleine Albright, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said there was evidence that Baghdad was still moving troops into the region. </P>
<P> In a speech to the nation Monday night, Clinton announced a massive buildup of U.S. airpower in the Gulf to thwart a possible Iraqi invasion of its neighbour. </P>
