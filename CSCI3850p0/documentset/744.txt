<DATELINE>TORONTO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Russian coach Sergei Belov told his team before their game against the U.S. Dream Team II that their opponents weren't supermen, and to remember to provide an entertaining game for the fans. </P>
<P> They did -- for about 25 minutes of the 40-minute contest between previously undefeated teams. </P>
<P> Shaquille O'Neal scored 21 points and Joe Dumars added 20 to lead the United States to a 111-94 victory over Russia on Friday after leading by as many as 24 points in their round-robin quarter-final game at the world basketball championships. </P>
<P> Croatia, the Americans' likely opponent in Sunday's final, easily defeated Greece 81-55 in the earlier game at the Toronto SkyDome. The United States and Croatia are both a perfect 6-0 in the tournament. </P>
<P> Russia, now 5-1, made a game of it, staying close through the first half, which ended with the United States ahead 52-44. With just over two minutes gone in the second half, the Russians cut the lead to five. </P>
<P> O'Neal was not concerned. Asked if he was worried the Americans might do the unthinkable and lose, the giant from the NBA's Orlando Magic said: ``I never think about losing.'' </P>
<P> The United States, clearly fresher than the Russians, pulled away to a 19-point lead with 12:58 to go on back-to-back 3-pointers by Dumars and Reggie Miller, and were never again threatened. </P>
<P> The 17-point margin of victory dropped the U.S. average margin to a shade over 36 points in its six games here. </P>
<P> ``We wanted to give entertainment to the public and give decent opposition to the American team,'' said Belov. </P>
<P> Russia got 18 points from Yevgeni Kissourin, 17 from Dmitri Domani and 14 points and some clever playmaking from Sergei Bazarevich. </P>
<P> Bazarevich said Belov had told the team: ``We aren't playing superhumans, we are playing humans. And I just felt happy every moment of the game. We demonstrated we can play baskeball, we can compete. I know we were playing the best players in the world.'' </P>
<P> Said Domani: ``It was a celebration of basketball for us. We tried our best.'' </P>
<P> U.S. coach Don Nelson said: ``It was a perfect game for us to play at this time. It was a close game in the first half. We had to play good basketball.'' </P>
<P> Nelson, noting that his team of NBA stars has a far deeper bench than the Russians, said: ``I know they were tired in the second half.'' </P>
<P> Nelson called the Russians a well-coached team who played solid defense and passed extremely well. He also praised Dumars, who held the Russians' second leading scorer, Sergei Babkov, to seven points. </P>
<P> ``We owe this one to Joe,'' said Nelson. </P>
<P> ``I think that they were by far the smartest team we've played,'' Dumars said of the Russians. ``I enjoyed playing against them because they make you play pure basketball.'' </P>
<P> Nelson also said the semifinal between Russia and Croatia on Saturday would be ``one of the most interesting games of the tournament.'' </P>
<P> Croatia, led by Dino Radja's 27 points, beat a Greek team frankly aiming no higher than a bronze medal on Sunday and content to rest its best players on Friday. </P>
<P> Toni Kukoc and Arijan Komazec added 14 points apiece and big man Stojan Vrankovic tallied 12 for Croatia. </P>
