<DATELINE>SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A United Nations delegation failed Sunday to persuade Bosnian Serbs to reopen roads in and out of Sarajevo and U.N. officials said the impasse could have grim repercussions on efforts to bring peace to Bosnia. </P>
<P> The delegation, which included the commander of U.N. troops in Bosnia, Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Rose, went to the Serb stronghold of Pale, near Sarajevo, for talks with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic. </P>
<P> They emerged empty-handed, however, with no agreement on the reopening of the so-called ``blue routes'' into the Serb-besieged Bosnian capital. </P>
<P> ``There is a discrepancy on how the two sides interpret the agreement ... and that's what we are trying to breach,'' said U.N. civil affairs chief Victor Andreev. </P>
<P> Rose's plan to reopen civilian routes into Sarajevo failed Saturday when Serb forces laying siege to the city brought up last-minute preconditions and threatened to fire on vehicles if their demands were ignored, U.N. officials said. </P>
<P> The Serb leadership denied it had threatened to fire at cars but U.N. peacekeepers denounced its latest demands as calculated obstruction imperilling the truce. </P>
<P> The Serbs had promised to allow the routes to open Sunday morning but lines of cars waited in vain outside the city to use the roads Sunday morning. </P>
<P> The Pale talks were swiftly arranged when negotiations on the spot failed after Bosnian and Serb military officers failed to show up. </P>
<P> The Serbs are opposed to Muslims using the routes for commercial traffic but a U.N. spokesman, Col. Gary Coward, said the United Nations had assured them that only humanitarian and civilian traffic would be allowed to pass. </P>
<P> He said a failure to reopen the roads would have grave implications for efforts to bring peace to Bosnia. </P>
<P> ``If the BSA (Bosnian Serb army) is not prepared to come to some sort of arrangement, then this puts the current peace process in jeopardy. This needs to be resolved in the short term,'' Coward told Reuters. </P>
<P> ``It's surprising because we had every indication from the BSA that they wanted the cessation of hostilities agreement to work. This process is very delicate, needs to maintain a momentum. The routes issue has great symbolic meaning.'' </P>
<P> The opening of the routes was a condition of a New Year four-month ceasefire agreed to by Bosnia's main warring factions, but many obstacles have developed in follow-up talks on implementing the provisions of the truce. </P>
<P> The United Nations says the truce is basically holding, with the exception of the Bihac enclave in northwestern Bosnia, where renegade Serbs and Muslims have not signed the ceasefire. </P>
<P> Coward said a mortar bomb that smashed into a bridge in Bihac town Saturday killed five people, one more than earlier reported, and wounded four. </P>
<P> He said the mortar was apparently fired in retaliation for a Bosnian army lightning assault out of the Bihac ``safe area'' hours before on the adjacent Klokot area, despite the standing ceasefire between the war foes. </P>
<P> ``We think the assault was successful, so the mortar may have been fired into the town in response,'' Coward said. </P>
<P> He said the U.N. regional headquarters at Tuzla airport in northern Bosnia as well as other U.N. bases in the area remained blockaded by Bosnian forces protesting the presence of a Serb liaison officer under terms of the ceasefire. </P>
