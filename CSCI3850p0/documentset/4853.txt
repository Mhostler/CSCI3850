<P>  Brazilian competitors at the Pan-American Games complained their gear had still not arrived Friday, the day before the tournament officially gets under way. </P>
<P> Competitors said they had nothing to train in, nothing to wear in competition and nothing to wear for the official ceremony on Saturday evening. </P>
<P> Dignitaries at the ceremony are expected to include International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch and International Football Federation president Joao Havelange. </P>
<P> ``They say it'll arrive tonight, we'll see,'' said a member of the rowing team. ``Really, we should have had it before we arrived. I've been wearing the same underpants for two days.'' </P>
<P> Rodney Bernardes, the president of the Brazilian Rowing Confederation, said that if the gear did not arrive on Saturday, he would go into a sports shop in Mar del Plata and buy any yellow vests and green shorts -- Brazil's national colors -- he could find for his athletes. </P>
<P> Cyclist Cassio Freitas said he had brought with him the shirt he wore during the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul for luck but was now thinking he would actually have to use it. </P>
<P> Competitors in some sports said on Friday they had finally been given their gear but others, including cyclists and rowers, were still waiting. </P>
<P> ``We won't lose heart because of this but it takes the shine out of taking part,'' said a rower. </P>
<P> Brazilian Olympic Committee officials guaranteed Friday that the missing stuff was on its way. They said the gear was all imported and had been held up at Brazilian customs because last week was carnival week. </P>
