<DATELINE>TAIPEI, April 8 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui called on China on Saturday to end its threat of force against the island and urged cooperation with Beijing to ensure a democracy in Hong Kong and Macau. </P>
<P> Lee, replying to an overture from Chinese President Jiang Zemin in January, also said that Beijing's suppression of Taipei's diplomatic activities had shut off prospects for reunification between the two arch-rivals. </P>
<P> ``We think that mainland authorities should show their good will and renounce the use of force...and no longer conduct any military actions that raise people's suspicions,'' Lee said in an address to the National Unification Council. </P>
<P> His speech offered no concessions but was more concilliatory than remarks by Taiwan's top security official, Yin Tsung-wen, who warned at the same council session that Beijing might try some ``adventurist'' move against this island. </P>
<P> China and Taiwan split in 1949 after Taiwan's ruling Nationalists lost a civil war in China and fled here. Beijing views Taiwan as a rebel-held province and has not withdrawn a threat to recover it by force. </P>
<P> Chinese President Jiang urged Taiwan to end a state of hostility and offered high-level talks between Taiwan and China in his ``olive branch'' January overture. </P>
<P> Lee replied that only after China renounces force will Taipei be ready to hold ``preparatory negotiations'' on how to hold talks on ending the hostility. </P>
<P> China, set to recover Hong Kong from Britain in 1997 and Macau from Portugal in 1999, sees reunification with Taiwan as a pressing mission to restore ancestral unity and pride. </P>
<P> Taiwan says that reunification can only take place once China has espoused a democratic system like Taiwan's and fulfilled other requirements. </P>
<P> Lee urged Beijing to end an opposition to Taipei's international diplomacy which has left the island with official recognition from just 29 countries. </P>
<P> In a new move, he also called for cooperation with Beijing in ensuring democracy in Hong Kong -- a sore point at the centre of soured relations between Beijing and London. </P>
<P> ``The two sides should jointly the maintain the prosperity of Hong Kong and Macau and promote democracy in Hong Kong and Macau,'' Lee said in one of six summarising ``points.'' </P>
<P> In his speech to the council, Yin accused China of practising duplicity in talking peace but not ruling out war against Taiwan and he warned of possible ``adventurism'' by Beijing. ``Their strategy toward Taiwan is one of peace on the one hand and war on the other,'' the chairman of the National Security Bureau added. </P>
