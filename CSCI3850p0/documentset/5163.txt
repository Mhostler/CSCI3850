<DATELINE>BAMAKO, March 24 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A court in Mali on Friday imposed the first death penalty in the corruption trial of associates of ousted dictator Moussa Traore who has already been condemned to death. </P>
<P> The court of assizes in the capital Bamako sentenced the former chief executive of the national tobacco company SONATAM, Boubacar Dembele, to death for misappropriation of public funds amounting to 3.1 million Swiss francs ($2.7 million). </P>
<P> He was acquitted on another count of enriching himself illegally to the tune of 193.6 million cfa francs ($395,100). </P>
<P> Details of the misappropriation charge showed the existence of a Swiss bank account in Dembele's name containing 610,378,439 cfa francs ($1.2 million). Dembele argued during trial that the money was from honoraries paid to him for advice and marketing studies on behalf of SONATAM's former foreign managing partners. </P>
<P> He accused former partners, American tobacco giant Philip Morris, of abandoning him during the trial stemming from the overthrow of Traore after a populist uprising in March 1991. </P>
<P> Dembele was the first Traore associate to be sentenced for economic crimes since the former president and three close aides were condemned to death for their part in the brutal suppression of the 1991 uprising against Traore's one-party dictatorship. </P>
<P> Friday's sentence was handed exactly four years to the day after the three-day uprising peaked in 1991. Official figures later showed 106 people were killed by security forces. </P>
<P> Traore's government fell two days later on March 26 when then Lieutenant-Colonel Amadou Toure seized power in a coup. He immediately begun a successful programme to establish multi-party democracy. </P>
<P> Traore and several associates are still languishing in jail awaiting trial for economic crimes. The former president refuses to apply for state clemency for his death sentence but none of those sentenced with him have so far being executed. </P>
