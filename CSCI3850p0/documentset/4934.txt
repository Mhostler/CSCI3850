<P>  India's Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao has asked Indian states to pass legislation to stop the commercial trade in human kidneys, the Press Trust of India said Wednesday. </P>
<P> He said the sooner the law was brought in, the easier it would be to take action against those involved in the sale of human organs. </P>
<P> Last month India brought into force a federal law banning transplantation and removal of human organs for commercial purposes after a multimillion-dollar kidney transplant business flourished in southern Karnatka state. However, few states have ratified it. </P>
<P> Rao, who was replying to a question in parliament, said the federal government could only request states to bring in new laws. </P>
<P> Bangalore police arrested two doctors, one of them the head of the nephrology department at a government-run hospital and two agents after it began investigating the scandal in which organs from poor, often illiterate, Indian peasants were transplanted into foreigners. </P>
<P> Police said they believed up to 1,000 kidney transplants have been performed in Bangalore for foreign recipients, mainly from the Middle East. </P>
