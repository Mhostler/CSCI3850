<DATELINE>GOLCUK, Turkey (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Turkish ships set sail Monday for the northern Aegean Sea to begin live-ammunition air and naval exercises which have raised fears of a conflict with Greek forces also on maneuvers in the region. </P>
<P> Reuter reporters saw at least 10 destroyers and frigates equipped with surface-to-surface and surface-to-air missiles leave the main naval base of Golcuk for Seawolf-94 exercises to last until Nov. 23. </P>
<P> Fleet Commander Adm. Guven Erkaya would command the exercise during which live ammunition would be used, military officials told Anatolian news agency. </P>
<P> Submarines, assault boats, minesweepers and auxiliary vessels would take part they said, but did not specify how many. </P>
<P> Fighter jets and bombers are to take part in the exercises which aim to test the degree of coordination between the two forces and try out warfare and command methods. </P>
<P> Fellow NATO-member Greece is holding its own air and sea maneuvers in the south of the Aegean between Nov. 10-21. </P>
<P> Tension between the age-old rivals may come to a head on Wednesday when an international pact comes into force giving Greece the right to double its territorial waters to 12 miles. </P>
<P> Turkish Foreign Minister Mumtaz Soysal said Sunday in The Hague that there was no need for concern as the exercises were taking place away from each other. </P>
<P> Turkey concedes the Law of the Sea accord gives Greece the right to extend its control but says implementation could lead to war because it would lock Turkey out of the Aegean Sea. </P>
<P> President Suleyman Demirel, reiterating this position, said on Sunday: ``Let no one take this as a threat or blackmail. Turkey is obliged to take this matter seriously.'' </P>
<P> Greece has carefully avoided saying it will extend its waters but insists it has the right to do so. </P>
<P> The Aegean is a source of conflict between the two over territorial waters, airspace, continental shelf and mineral rights. They narrowly averted war in 1987. </P>
<P> Many of the sea's islands belong to Greece and Turkey says a literal interpretation of the Law of the Sea, would put more than 70 percent of the Aegean under Greek control. </P>
<P> ``There should be no likelihood of a conflict but these are after all, armed forces. When armed forces hold exercises in the same area, there can be such a possibility due to provocation or something like it. Care must be taken, this is what we say should be done,'' Demirel said. </P>
<P> Greece has accused Turkey of whipping up tensions. </P>
<P> ``Unfortunately there are Turkish circles prone to creating tensions and using heavy words with no meaning,'' government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos told reporters Sunday. ``Greece will not be the victim of artificial tensions.'' </P>
<P> The U.S. warship USS Cape St. George is in the Aegean but the Pentagon has denied press reports it was deployed to keep the peace between Greece and Turkey. </P>
