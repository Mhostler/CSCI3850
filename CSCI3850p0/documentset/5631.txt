<P>  Anthony Way, 12-year-old star of a television serial about a boy whose angelic voice saves a cathedral choir from closure, topped the charts Monday. </P>
<P> ``Fiction has become reality,'' a record company spokesman said after ``The Choir'' went straight to the top of the classical album charts and even broke into the top 10 of the pop charts. </P>
<P> The serial ``The Choir,'' based on the best-selling novel by Joanna Trollope, tells the tale of a chorister who makes a best-selling record which tops the charts and earns the money needed to save a threatened cathedral choir. </P>
<P> Way, himself a member of the St Paul's Cathedral choir in London, was picked from 300 hopefuls for the role. </P>
<P> ``His family are waiting to see whether he will follow in the footsteps of other former choirboys Keith Richards, John Lennon and David Bowie,'' a spokesman for Decca Records said. </P>
