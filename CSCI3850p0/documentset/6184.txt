<DATELINE>GENEVA (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The World Health Organization (WHO), in a report it labelled ``a devastating portrait of our times,'' said Tuesday 12 million children die every year in developing countries before they reach the age of five. </P>
<P> Most of the deaths, equal to the combined populations of Norway and Sweden, were from diseases like pneumonia, diarrhea, measles and malaria which could be prevented if more resources were available, it said. </P>
<P> Combating the extreme poverty in which more than one in five people around the world lives is the key to improving health and lengthening life expectancy in the Third World, the WHO said. </P>
<P> It called on governments to step up the war on deadly childhood ailments as well as infectious and parasitic diseases that kill millions of adults. </P>
<P> The ``World Health Report 1995 -- Bridging the Gaps'' was presented to officials from 190 WHO member states gathered in Geneva for the United Nations body's annual assembly which opened Monday. </P>
<P> ``Poverty is the main reason why babies are not vaccinated, why clean water and sanitation are not provided, why curative drugs and other treatments are unavailable and why mothers die in childbirth,'' the report said. </P>
<P> ``But today the money that some developing countries have to spend per person on health care over an entire year is just $4 -- less than the amount of small change carried in the pockets and purses of many people in developed countries,'' it added. </P>
<P> Hiroshi Nakajima, WHO director-general, said the survey painted a ``devastating portrait of our times.'' </P>
<P> ``More than 200 million children -- almost a third of all the children in the world -- are undernorished,'' WHO said. </P>
<P> ``Malnutrition contributes substantially to childhood disease and death but often goes unrecognised as such.'' </P>
<P> The report, the first in what is to be an annual survey by the Geneva-based agency, highlights stark examples of growing inequity in health and in access even to basic health care. </P>
<P> ``In 1993, about one billion people had no access to local health services within a one-hour journey,'' it said. </P>
<P> Life expectancy in Uganda, one of the world's poorest countries is just 43 years -- against Japan, where people can expect to live to almost 79 years of age. </P>
<P> ``A short air trip between Florida in the United States and Haiti represents a life expectancy gap of more than 19 years,'' the report said. </P>
<P> Americans could look forward to reaching age 76 while people in the poor Caribbean island can expect to live to 57 years. </P>
<P> Among adults, communicable diseases such as tuberculosis and respiratory infections account for about 20 million or 40 percent of the 51 million deaths worldwide, WHO said. </P>
<P> WHO said it was possible by the end of the 20th century to live in a world without polio, leprosy and deaths from neonatal tenanus and measles -- which kill and disable millions each year -- provided resources were made available. </P>
