<P>  Many North Koreans died a sudden death in mourning the late ``Great Leader,'' Kim Il-Sung, Russia's Itar-Tass news agency said Friday. </P>
<P> Some of them, mostly elderly, died of shock or heart attack at the first news of the July 8 death of the man ``without whom they could not imagine their existence,'' said Tass, one of the few foreign news organisations based in the Stalinist state. </P>
<P> Many more died of heat stroke after long hours of mourning vigils in blazing sun at Kim Il-Sung's monuments across the state, Tass said quoting North Korean and diplomatic sources. </P>
<P> ``It was not without reason that field hospitals were set up and thousands of doctors and nurses put on duty,'' said a Tass correspondent, adding that he himself saw a number of people carried out unconscious from crowds in Pyongyang. </P>
<P> Tass said it was impossible to give a figure for such deaths, saying only ``it was not that low.'' But it praised the communist authorities for maintaining order and avoiding panic during the funeral ceremony. </P>
