<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A 75-page questionnaire given to potential jurors in the O.J. Simpson double murder trial probes their attitudes on domestic violence, divorce, racism and interracial marriages, it was reported Friday. </P>
<P> The football legend had denied murdering his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, 35, and her friend, Ronald Goldman, 25 on June 12. They were stabbed and slashed to death outside Nicole's Brentwood townhouse. </P>
<P> The Los Angeles Daily News said the questionnaire, which was to be released later Friday, also asks for jurors' impressions of Simpson before his arrests and how they feel about Nicole from what they have read or seen on television since her death. </P>
<P> The questionnaire, composed by Superior Court Judge Lance Ito in conjunction with prosecutors and defense lawyers, is designed to find an impartial 12-member jury and eight alternates from the ethnically diverse jury pool of 304 men and women. </P>
<P> Because the case has received widespread publicity around the world, and saturation coverage in Los Angeles, the questionnaire assumes that the potential jurors have followed it and does not ask if they know of the case, but how closely they have followed it. </P>
<P> The Daily News said one question asked of potential jurors was, ``What was your first reaction to hearing that O.J. Simpson was a suspect in this case?'' </P>
<P> Another asks, ``Do you think you may find it more difficult to believe the evidence presented to you if it conflicts with your belief about O.J. Simpson?'' </P>
<P> Potential jurors are also asked their views on the incidents of June 17, when Simpson, rather than surrender to authorities as was arranged, took a car ride with his friend Al Cowlings that ended in a televised low-speed freeway police pursuit in which Cowlings' white Ford Bronco led patrol cars along Los Angeles freeways. </P>
<P> Many questions probe the subject of domestic violence, the paper said, asking if jurors have ever been involved in domestic violence, if they think it is OK to use physical force and ''When is violence an appropriate response to domestic trouble?'' </P>
<P> Simpson pleaded no contest in 1993 to a charge of spousal battery after his then-wife called police to complain he had beaten her during an argument early in the morning of January 1. </P>
<P> The questionnaire also seeks to weed out people with specific agendas for sitting on the jury, such as writing a book or selling their stories after the trial. </P>
<P> Because Simpson is black and his ex-wife was white, potential jurors are asked their opinions on interracial marriages. </P>
<P> Race is also the subject of a question that asks, ``How big a problem do you think racial discrimination against African-Americans is in southern California?'' the Daily News said. </P>
