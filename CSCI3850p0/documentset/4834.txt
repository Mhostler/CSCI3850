<P> Bert Stapleton, 59, was returning from a trade union meeting when he stopped for a meal -- and a drink -- while waiting for a connecting train in western England. </P>
<P> Railway management were tipped off anonymously that Stapleton had infringed strict regulations forbidding drinking at work. He was on official paid duty as a union representative at the time, a railways spokeswoman said. </P>
