<P>  Former Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater, who pioneered the modern Republican conservative movement, Friday endorsed the presidential bid of Senate Republican leader Bob Dole, the Kansan's campaign office said. </P>
<P> Goldwater, whose own Republican presidential run in 1964 ended in a lop-sided defeat at the hands of then-Democratic president Lyndon Johnson, gave his endorsement after a series of telephone conversations, Dole's press spokesman said. </P>
<P> ``Bob Dole is a man whose courage and conviction have been tested again and again,'' Goldwater said in a statement issued by the Dole campaign. ``America needs a leader who is committed to reducing the size of the federal government and returning power where it belongs -- with the people. </P>
<P> ``And as a fellow veteran, I can tell you that no one is more dedicated to restoring America's rightful place as the leader of the free world than Bob Dole.'' </P>
<P> Also backing Dole in Arizona was former U.S. House minority leader John Rhodes, the Dole camp said. </P>
<P> Dole, considered the frontrunner in a current field of eight Republican aspirants for the party's presidential nomination, with Texas Sen. Phil Gramm a distant second in polls, has been collecting key endorsements from party leaders around the country. </P>
<P> Goldwater, now 86, won only five southern states and his home state in his 1964 bid, but his conservative candidacy acted as a pace-setter for Republican conservatives who now overwhelmingly dominate the party. </P>
