<P>  The Justice Department said Monday it supports allowing one of the regional Bell telephone firms to offer long-distance service within its territory in an experiment aimed at boosting industry competition. </P>
<P> The Justice Department recommended to U.S. District Judge Harold Greene that he approve a proposal by Chicago-based Ameritech Corp. to provide long-distance service to some customers in Illinois and Michigan on a trial basis. </P>
<P> The Justice Department said Ameritech could offer long-distance services only after it finds that actual and substantial potential competition exists in its local telephone market. Judge Greene also must approve the proposal. </P>
<P> Richard Notebaert, Ameritech chairman and chief executive officer, urged Greene to act quickly. He expressed optimism the judge would accept it and the Justice Department's conditions would be met. </P>
<P> He said the proposal brought consumers ``one step closer for one-stop shopping for communications services'' and predicted that Ameritech may be able to offer long distance services by Jan.1. But the Justice Department and industry executives were skeptical it could be done so fast. </P>
<P> Notebaert also rejected criticism from other regional telephone firms, saying the Justice Department agreement was in Ameritech's best interests and adding that its situation may be different from the other firms. </P>
<P> Justice Department officials described the proposal as a model that could be used throughout the industry and by Congress in considering sweeping reforms in telecommunications legislation. The department has been particularly concerned because pending legislation in the Senate would virtually eliminate its role in telecommunications oversight. </P>
<P> Robert Allen, chairman of ATT Corp., supported the proposal, calling it ``good public policy.'' But he said steps need to be taken to eliminate ``local monopoly bottlenecks.'' </P>
