<P>  British Defense Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, alarmed at the prospect of the U.S. Congress ending the arms embargo on Bosnia, called Monday for annual week-long meetings between European and American legislators. </P>
<P> ``The Atlantic relationship needs a new infusion of ideas,'' Rifkind said in a speech to the Royal Institute of International Affairs in Brussels. </P>
<P> Rifkind said if Congress approved a Republican bill to end the United Nations embargo unilaterally, ``that would lead to the withdrawal of United Nations forces from that country.'' </P>
<P> He said constant dialogue between the governments of the United States and Western Europe had led to a large measure of agreement over Bosnia. The Clinton administration is fighting against the bill. </P>
<P> By contrast, Rifkind said, there was an almost total lack of meetings between European and U.S. legislators. </P>
<P> ``Senators and congressmen need to be exposed to the same discussions and dialogues with their European counterparts as are ministers,'' he said. </P>
<P> He said the annual meetings of 150 legislators from each side of the Atlantic should discuss defense and security, the future of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and trade and economic issues. </P>
<P> This could be done either by creating a new Atlantic Assembly or giving the existing North Atlantic Assembly, which currently discusses NATO issues only, a wider remit. </P>
