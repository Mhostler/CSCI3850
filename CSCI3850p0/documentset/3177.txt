<P>  The militant Hamas Islamic group Tuesday accused Libya of refusing to let Palestinians return to the country after visiting the Gaza Strip and said two children of families trapped at the border had died. </P>
<P> The group and other Palestinian sources said dozens of Palestinians were trapped both on the Libyan-Egyptian border and the frontier between Egypt and the Gaza Strip. </P>
<P> ``Those people returning to Libya have residence permits and they were returning to their work in Libya after visiting their families in the Gaza Strip,'' one Palestinian source said in Damascus. </P>
<P> ``They now cannot go back to Gaza because they were there as visitors.'' </P>
<P> Hamas indicated the Libyan action was a political move to expose what Tripoli sees as the inability of PLO leader Yasser Arafat's self-rule authority in Gaza to decide, free of Israeli constraints, who should be allowed into the Strip. </P>
<P> The group, in a statement sent to Reuters in Damascus, said its spokesman, Ibrahim Ghoshi, met the Libyan ambassador to Amman to discuss the cause of the ``tens of Palestinian families which are stranded on the Libyan-Egyptian border'' after Tripoli stopped them from returning. This effectively expelled them from Libya. </P>
<P> ``Ghoshi expressed Hamas's understanding of the Libyan political position, which is aimed at revealing the reality of the Palestinian self-rule authority which has no ability to allow the entry of the Palestinian people to return to their homeland... </P>
<P> ``But Ghoshi affirmed that the Palestinian people and their children should not pay the price of this. They should be supported and honored and not be subjected to suffering ...''the statement said. </P>
<P> One Palestinian source said: ``Two children of these families stranded on the Libyan-Egyptian border died during the last two days due to bad weather there.'' </P>
<P> A Libyan official, attending the Islamic summit in the Moroccan city of Casablanca, said all those with residence status would be allowed in. He said 20 who had regular residence visas had already entered Libya. </P>
