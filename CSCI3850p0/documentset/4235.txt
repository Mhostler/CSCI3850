<P>  John McEnroe guaranteed he would deliver a win in next month's tie against Italy if given the chance to play again for the United States Davis Cup team. </P>
<P> ``I could beat Italy's doubles team tomorrow,'' said McEnroe, the holder of six U.S. Davis Cup records, including most matches played, most singles wins and most years played. </P>
<P> McEnroe, a member of five U.S. Davis Cup championship teams, lobbied for the opportunity to play in cup competition again prior to being honored at the Thurman Munson charity dinner Tuesday night. </P>
<P> The 35-year-old McEnroe, who last played Davis Cup in 1992 when he helped the United States beat Switzerland in the final, also pushed for giving his younger brother Patrick the chance to be his doubles partner. </P>
<P> ``Do I think Patrick and I could beat any team out there? Yes,'' said McEnroe, who understands his chances of being named on the team are slim. ``My feelings are I would like to play Davis Cup, but I'm not expecting that.'' </P>
<P> The four-time U.S. Open champion and three-time Wimbledon winner has always had a special feeling about the Davis Cup. </P>
<P> ``The ultimate honor was to represent your country,'' McEnroe said of the 12 years he played Davis Cup. </P>
<P> McEnroe's commitment is not held by many of today's stars. Last weekend in the opening round, the United States played without world number one Pete Sampras and number two Andre Agassi, but still beat France 4-1. </P>
<P> ``It's too bad that it doesn't seem to have any sort of interest, or minimal interest with lot of players,'' said McEnroe. </P>
<P> Both Sampras and Agassi begged off the team because of scheduling problems. The Davis Cup first round came just five days after the completion of the Australian Open where Agassi beat Sampras in the final. The next round is March 31-April 2. </P>
<P> Though a little sympathetic to the players' concerns, McEnroe still feels that Davis Cup is important enough to make the sacrifice. </P>
<P> ``I don't think that excuses not doing it,'' he said. ``I think you should eliminate some of the unimportant tournaments, rather than protecting tournaments that nobody knows about it.'' </P>
