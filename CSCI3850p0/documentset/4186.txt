<P>  Commerce Secretary Ron Brown told PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat in Gaza Tuesday President Clinton favored granting Palestinian goods preferential trade status in U.S. markets. </P>
<P> Brown, on a Middle East tour to promote investment and trade, said Washington was keen to help improve living conditions in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and wanted to include the Palestinian self-rule Authority in its Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). </P>
<P> ``I indicated to Chairman Arafat that he has the commitment of President Clinton on this matter,'' Brown told a joint news conference with Arafat in Gaza. </P>
<P> ``We are taking formal administrative steps that will certainly help matters of commerce and trade. It will help in the creation of jobs,'' he said. </P>
<P> The White House announced last week that Clinton had ended the GSP program for Israel. The program offers duty-free treatment to specified products sold in the United States. It is primarily aimed at helping developing countries. </P>
<P> Palestinian officials said they have been negotiating with Washington to be included in the GSP and expect to be granted the status by April. </P>
<P> Arafat said he was pleased by the U.S. assurances on trade. </P>
<P> ``This visit is a clear signal from His Excellency President Clinton and Mr. Brown of the support of the American administration to the Palestinians,'' Arafat said. </P>
<P> Brown announced the launching of two projects established or being planned by U.S. companies from a group of Arab-American and Jewish-American businessmen eager to invest in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. </P>
