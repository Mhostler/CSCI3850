<DATELINE>DUBAI, April 14 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Renewed United States pressure on Iran is viewed with some apprehension by oil-rich Arab neighbours across the Gulf, diplomats and officials said. </P>
<P> ``We have to live with them,'' one Gulf official said of the Moslem fundamentalist rulers of Tehran, seen by Washington as sponsors of religious extremism and anti-Western sentiment. </P>
<P> The diplomats and officials said that even Saudi Arabia, Iran's traditional Arab rival across the Gulf, was unhappy with the renewed aggression in Washington's anti-Iran rhetoric. </P>
<P> ``The main concern of Gulf Arabs is to maintain stability in this very sensitive and strategic region,'' one Arab diplomat said. ``The latest American campaign does not help.'' </P>
<P> ``The last thing they (Gulf Arabs) want is for Iran to feel isolated and under siege. This would not be conducive to stability in the Gulf,'' said another. </P>
<P> The concerns follow a Gulf tour last month by U.S. Secretary of Defence William Perry when he spoke at length of potential threats from Iran and urged its neighbours to build up their defences in what many saw as a sales pitch for American arms. </P>
<P> U.S. officials were at the same time denouncing what they said was a buildup of Iranian military muscle, including missiles, at the entrance of the Gulf, the route for about a quarter of the world's oil trade. </P>
<P> The concerns also coincide with a campaign by U.S. President Bill Clinton's administration to isolate Tehran economically after forcing the U.S. oil company Conoco to abandon a contract to develop an Iranian oilfield. </P>
<P> Tehran also believes strongly that Washington was behind the torpedoing of a Caspian oil deal that would have given Iran a stake in an Azerbaijan oil consortium. </P>
<P> The Clinton adminstration has also proposed a ban on U.S. imports of Iranian oil, which account for more than 10 percent of Tehran's oil sales. </P>
<P> And it was pressing allies in Europe and Japan to curtail badly needed credits and loans to Iran. </P>
<P> ``Many in the Gulf do not see a justification for the new U.S. campaign,'' one Gulf diplomat said. </P>
<P> ``The Gulf states do not, for example, see any significant change in Iran's military posture in the Gulf,'' he added. </P>
<P> ``It is reminiscent of the discredited policy of double containment,'' he said of the policy announced when the Clinton team took power two years ago which sought to contain both Iran and Iraq and was criticised as counter-productive. </P>
<P> U.S. allies in Europe, Japan and the Gulf saw double containment as misguided, the diplomats said. </P>
<P> They believed that while Iraq appeared unrepentant after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, Iran's pragmatic President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani was working hard for an accommodation with his neighbours and the rest of the world. </P>
<P> ``They (Washington) stopped talking about double containment for a time but they seem to have come back to it with a vengeance, and that is worrying for many people,'' one Western diplomat said. </P>
<P> Rafsanjani, bogged down in economic problems, was struggling to maintain his policies against radicals within and outside parliament trying to drag Iran back to the militancy of the early years of the 1979 Islamic revolution. </P>
<P> ``There is a view in this part of the world that prosperity is the only thing that would blunt the edge of Iranian militancy,'' the Western diplomat said. </P>
<P> ``A hungry and aggressive Iran is the last thing Gulf Arabs want,'' he added. </P>
