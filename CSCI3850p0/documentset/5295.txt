<P>  An ailing seven-year-old Florida Marlins baseball fan who has undergone 40 operations for a rare digestive condition says striking baseball players and unbending management do not know what real problems are. </P>
<P> Jennifer Bush, 7, wrote a letter to the Florida Marlins and urged the team president to ask God for help in settling the strike, the Miami Herald reported Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``Please sir ask your friends to make the strike go away. Tell them if they had 40 operations like me and had tubes in there tummy and a port in there heart and had to wear a smelly bag on there tummy and (had) one ear that doesnt hear then they would have something to fight about,'' Jennifer wrote in a letter to team president Don Smiley. </P>
<P> Jennifer suffers from a rare digestive condition and receives most of her nutrition through an intravenous tube. Her condition is improving but her mother, Kathy Bush, said her daughter has had eight operations since September and her prognosis is ``day-to-day.'' </P>
<P> While she was in the hospital last fall, Jennifer was visited by Jeff Conine, a left-fielder for the Marlins. They became friends and her parents bought her a Marlins uniform, No. 19, just like Conine's. </P>
<P> Jennifer decided to write the letter after her doctors reminded her that major league players will not be participating when the 1995 season officially opens Sunday. </P>
<P> ``When I read it, I thought, 'When you look at the strike through the eyes of a child, it makes whatever they're feuding about seem ... mundane','' Mrs. Bush told the newspaper. </P>
<P> In her letter, Jennifer said she admired Conine for his love of the game. ``Maybe if everyone else had so much love in there heart they would be playing real ball,'' she wrote to the Marlins president. ``Please try your best and i will ask my buddy Jeff (Conine) to hit a home run for you. P.S. When you say your prayers tonight ask God for his help.'' </P>
<P> Smiley, who has a six-year-old son, said he was touched by Jennifer's letter and planned to telephone her to explain the standoff between players and management. </P>
<P> ``I read it and put it down and then I read it again,'' Smiley told the newspaper. ``I certainly realized how much the game means to people of every age.'' </P>
