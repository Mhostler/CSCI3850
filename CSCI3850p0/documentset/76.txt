<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The U.S.-installed government of Panama has agreed to accept as many as 10,000 Haitian refugees for up to one year at the request of President Clinton and the United Nations. </P>
<P> The announcement by President Guillermo Endara came as a record 2,628 Haitian boat people were picked up by the U.S. Coast Guard on Monday, the largest one-day total since the United States relaxed its Haitian refugee policy two weeks ago. </P>
<P> Endara said in the announcement late Monday that the refugees would be housed on the Pacific Ocean island of San Jose off Panama City. While installations there were brought up to scratch, they would be held at Fort Sherman, a U.S. military base near the Atlantic Ocean city of Colon. </P>
<P> Endara said he had made the decision after receiving a phone call from Clinton on Sunday night in which Clinton asked him to take in the Haitians. A formal agreement will be signed Wednesday, he added. </P>
<P> He said Panama's costs would be covered by the United Nations and the Haitians would be guarded by U.N. forces. </P>
<P> President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares, who takes office September 1, said he supported the decision provided the refugees would stay in Panama only for a short time. </P>
<P> This week the Panamanian government also prohibited sales from the Colon Free Zone, the most important in the Western Hemisphere, to the Haitian military. </P>
<P> During the past two weeks, some 8,000 Haitians have taken to small boats to flee their politically troubled homeland, ruled by army leaders since a 1991 coup. </P>
<P> Those Haitians found to qualify for political asylum are taken to the U.S. Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba, which can accommodate up to 12,000 refugees. </P>
<P> In recent weeks, the Clinton administration has sought help from Latin American and Caribbean nations to cope with the flood of refugees. Jamaica agreed to allow a U.S. Navy hospital ship to berth in Kingston harbor, and the British twin-colony of Turks and Caicos is setting up a Haitian refugee processing camp. </P>
