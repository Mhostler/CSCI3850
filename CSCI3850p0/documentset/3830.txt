<DATELINE>NEW YORK, (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Cuba and the United States held a fresh round of talks Wednesday to review progress in a September deal that halted an exodus of over 30,000 Cubans trying to reach Florida on makeshift vessels. </P>
<P> Cuban parliamentary president Ricardo Alarcon, Havana's fiery former U.N. ambassador, heads Havana's delegation. Dennis Hays, the State Department's coordinator for Cuban affairs, leads the talks for the United States. </P>
<P> Neither man would comment before the two-day negotiations opened at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations. </P>
<P> But State Department spokeswoman Christine Shelly said in Washington that the morning session was ``serious and businesslike''. </P>
<P> She said Washington was generally satisfied with progress in implementing a pact forged in September under which the United States promised to let at least 20,000 Cubans immigrate legally each year if Cuba stops the flood of refugees. </P>
<P> But Shelly listed several problems the U.S. side would raise. These included fees the Cuban government charged migrants for air travel to the United States, conditions for Cubans who return home and the rate at which U.S. visa offices in Havana were being refurbished. </P>
<P> Shelly said that since the September agreement, some 7,000 Cubans had been approved for travel to the United States, of whom about 5,000 counted towards the 20,000 annual total. The other 2,000 were approved on other special grounds. </P>
<P> A previous round of talks to review the agreement was held in Havana last November. </P>
<P> Cuba says one topic on the agenda in New York is likely to be the situation of thousands of Cubans picked up at sea and taken to camps at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay on the southeast tip of Cuba, and in Panama. </P>
<P> Washington, however, remains adamant about not allowing the talks to include other issues, such as the 30-year trade embargo against the communist-led country. </P>
