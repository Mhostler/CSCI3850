<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Australia signaled an increase in its immigration program Friday, saying the numbers of foreigners coming into the country were at historically low levels and that business groups wanted the intake boosted. </P>
<P> Citing Australia's dramatic economic recovery over the past few years, Immigration Minister Nick Bolkus said the time was right to look at moderate increases in the country's migration program, especially more business migrants. </P>
<P> ``The feedback I have already had, from the business sector in particular, is that it would be remiss of the government not to consider increasing the program ...,'' Bolkus told a Foreign Correspondents Association lunch in Sydney. </P>
<P> The government will stress business skills and the need for family reunions in deciding on calls for a bigger intake than the 70,000 new immigrants who settled in Australia in the year to June 30, 1994, Bolkus said. </P>
<P> Bolkus said he had yet to begin consultations with private, community and public-sector groups on the size of the intake for the fiscal year to the end of June 1996, but his spokeswoman said mainstream and ethnic business groups wanted a boost in numbers. </P>
<P> The banking industry was also lobbying for an increase, said the spokeswoman, adding: ``Clearly they (immigrants) bring with them large amounts of investment.'' </P>
<P> Australia's immigration program is roughly split into business migration, family reunion and humanitarian migration. </P>
<P> Business migration requires immigrants to invest at least $186,000 in Australia. It is being promoted heavily as the Australian economy continues to expand and as trade and investment ties with booming Asian economies strengthens. </P>
<P> The intake of immigrants spiraled to a peak of nearly 145,000 in 1988/89, but fell to about half that number during the global recession of the early 1990s. </P>
