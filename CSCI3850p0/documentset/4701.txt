<P>  A knife-wielding man cut off the genitals of a five-year-old boy but surgeons managed in an all-night operation to replace his penis and one testicle. </P>
<P> The boy's distraught mother called police Thursday night after finding her son bleeding profusely. Police searching the family garden in Wood Green, a north London suburb, found the boy's sex organs and rushed them to the hospital packed in ice. </P>
<P> After all-night microsurgery on the boy, doctors at St Andrews hospital in Billericay, Essex, said it was too early to tell if the operation had been successful. </P>
<P> A 24-year-old man arrested at the scene is to be questioned by detectives. ``At this stage there is no known motive for the assault,'' a police spokesman at Scotland Yard said. </P>
