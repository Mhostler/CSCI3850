<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A key defense alibi witness in the O.J. Simpson double murder case testified Monday she saw the football legend's white Ford Bronco parked outside his home on the night his ex-wife and her friend were murdered. </P>
<P> In her videotaped testimony with the jury absent from the courtroom, Rosa Lopez -- then a housekeeper for Simpson's next-door neighbor -- said she saw the Bronco at about 10:15 p.m. on June 12, 1994, the time prosecutors charge he was committing the murders. </P>
<P> She said she first noticed the Bronco at about 8.15 p.m. on that night, and again shortly after 10 p.m. </P>
<P> Lopez' court appearance provided one of the high points of the trial to date as Simpson's defense sought to establish an ironclad alibi for their celebrity client, who claims he was at home waiting for a limousine to take him to the airport at the time of the murders. </P>
<P> He has pleaded not guilty to murdering Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman, who were stabbed and slashed to death outside Nicole Simpson's condominium two miles from his estate. </P>
<P> Lopez said she did not wear a watch but knew the times when she saw the Bronco because she had looked at her bedroom clock just before going outside on each occasion. </P>
<P> She said she was on the street at about 8:15 p.m. on June 12 walking her employers' dog when she saw the Bronco, which she described through an interpreter as being parked ``askew.'' </P>
<P> The car was parked in the same position, she said, at about 10:15 p.m. that night when she was exercising the dog in the front yard of her employers' estate, which overlooked the street. </P>
<P> Lopez, a reluctant witness, has said she intends to go home to her native El Salvador and not return because her life in Los Angeles has been ``destroyed'' by media harassment. </P>
<P> Her testimony will be shown to the jury when the defense presents its case -- not expected for several weeks. </P>
<P> Speaking through a Spanish-language interpreter, Lopez also said she heard men talking and a dog barking on Simpson's property around midnight after Simpson left in the limousine. </P>
<P> Earlier that evening, Lopez said, she had heard footsteps either on her employer's property or on Simpson's estate that had worried her. </P>
<P> She said she was questioned early on the morning of June 13 by Detective Mark Fuhrman, and told him about the suspicious noises she had heard on Simpson's estate. </P>
<P> Lopez said Fuhrman told her he would send a police officer to take her statement. Asked by defense attorney Johnnie Cochran if any officers had taken such a statement, she replied, ``I'm still waiting for them.'' </P>
<P> Fuhrman, the prosecution's most contentious witness, has come under increasing attack by the defense, which is seeking to brand him as a ``rogue cop'' who may have planted incriminating evidence on Simpson's estate. </P>
<P> Defense attorneys claim Fuhrman never mentioned his conversation with Lopez in his report and never requested that a police officer take a full statement from her. </P>
<P> Fuhrman testified at an earlier hearing that he found a bloody glove on Simpson's estate the day after the murders, and the defense has suggested he may have planted it there to incriminate Simpson for racial motives. </P>
<P> In a motion filed with the court Monday, the defense alleged Fuhrman had been the target of internal police probes into allegations that he owned a Nazi swastika and once claimed to be ``familiar'' with Simpson's ex-wife's anatomy. </P>
<P> The defense asked for access to Fuhrman's personnel file, saying it had learned he was investigated over allegations he had ``in his possession a swastika or other Nazi-like symbol at the West Los Angeles Division station house.'' </P>
<P> Defense lawyers also said they were ``informed of an investigation into an allegation that Fuhrman made statements suggesting his personal acquaintance'' with Nicole Simpson. </P>
<P> In a separate development, Newsweek magazine reported that at an administrative board hearing 10 years ago, Tia Morris, a black policewoman, identified Fuhrman as the leader of a cop ''clique'' called Men Against Women and of a group that went by the acronym WASP, for White Anglo-Saxon Policemen. </P>
<P> During Monday's questioning of Lopez, Cochran elicited a sympathetic picture of a hard-working but ill-educated woman, one of six sisters and four brothers, who was forced to leave school and labor in the fields at the age of 10 because her parents were too poor to buy her books and pencils, and who came to the United States 27 years ago looking for a better life. </P>
<P> But prosecutors, who caught her in a series of inconsistencies when she first took the witness stand Friday, were expected to be less charitable when they cross-examined her, probably Tuesday. </P>
<P> They were likely to try to hammer away at her credibility, even to the point of bringing out that the weekly tabloid, the National Enquirer, found her too unreliable to use in one of its many sensational stories on the case. </P>
