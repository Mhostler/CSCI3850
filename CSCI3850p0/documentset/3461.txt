<DATELINE>DALLAS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The veteran Phoenix Suns taught the young Mavericks a lesson in finishing when they erased a five-point deficit in the last 52 seconds and beat Dallas 119-118 Tuesday. </P>
<P> Kevin Johnson hit a 15-foot jumper from the corner with 3.7 seconds left for the game-winner. </P>
<P> ``We've been running that play all night long,'' Johnson said of the pick and roll that set up his shot. ``I got a good look at the basket. I just had to make the right decision whether to shoot the jumper or get the ball inside to Charles (Barkley). I got a good look at it and it just went in.'' </P>
<P> Jimmy Jackson missed a jumper at the buzzer for Dallas. </P>
<P> That wasn't the shot Dallas coach Dick Motta would have preferred. ``You want to go to the hole and put it in the hands of the referee or make them play defense,'' said Motta. </P>
<P> Johnson led Phoenix with 28 points and 11 assists. Barkley added 22 points and 16 rebounds for the Suns, who have won seven of eight since Johnson's return from the injured list. </P>
<P> Jackson scored 31 points and Jamal Mashburn had 30 for Dallas, which shot a season-high 57 percent from the field. </P>
<P> Rookie Jason Kidd had 16 assists but hit just two for 10 from the field for the Mavs, who have dropped four in a row. </P>
<P> In Houston, Hakeem Olajuwon had 35 points, 16 rebounds, and eight assists to lead the Rockets to a 105-93 triumph over the Atlanta Hawks, spoiling Lenny Wilkens' bid to tie Red Auerbach's record for most career NBA coaching victories. </P>
<P> Wilkens entered the game with 937 victories over his 22-year coaching career, one short of the 938 posted by Auerbach. The Hawks next play San Antonio Thursday. </P>
<P> Ken Norman had 28 points and 11 rebounds to pace Atlanta. </P>
<P> In Chicago, Pooh Richardson scored 21 points as the Los Angeles Clippers scored a 95-92 victory over the Bulls. </P>
<P> The Clippers held the Bulls to one field goal in the final 5:42, snapping a five-game losing streak and winning at Chicago for the first time since January 1979 -- 17 games and nearly 16 years. </P>
<P> Toni Kukoc scored 21 points and Scottie Pippen added 19 for the Bulls. Pippen was ejected late in the second quarter for arguing with referee Terry Durham. </P>
<P> In Orlando, the Magic used an 18-2 fourth-quarter burst to remain unbeaten at home with a 103-83 win over the Miami Heat. </P>
<P> Shaquille O'Neal scored 28 points, grabbed 11 rebounds and blocked four shots, and Anfernee Hardaway added 19 points for the Magic, who improved their NBA-best record to 22-5. </P>
<P> At New Jersey, John Starks scored five of his 22 points during a 14-0 third-quarter run and Charles Smith added 20 as the New York Knicks snapped a five-game losing streak, their longest in four years, with a 99-91 win over the Nets. </P>
<P> Starks hit 4-of-5 3-pointers, Patrick Ewing had 19 points and Derek Harper added 18. The Knicks were without forward Charles Oakley, who had toe surgery earlier in the day. </P>
<P> Chris Morris scored 21 points for New Jersey, which was playing its fifth straight game without leading scorer and rebounder Derrick Coleman (hand injury). </P>
<P> At Detroit, Vin Baker scored 24 points as the Milwaukee Bucks snapped a 10-game road losing streak with a 98-88 wire-to-wire victory over the Pistons. </P>
<P> Terry Mills had 23 points and 11 rebounds for the Pistons, who lost for the fourth straight time at home. </P>
<P> In San Antonio, David Robinson scored 30 points, Chuck Person had 21 and Vinny Del Negro 20 to help the Spurs win their seventh straight, 119-108 over the Charlotte Hornets. </P>
<P> The Spurs are 6-0 since Dennis Rodman returned from his suspension for conduct detrimental to the team. </P>
<P> The Hornets played the entire second half without starting center Alonzo Mourning, who twisted an ankle. Larry Johnson had 29 points and 12 rebounds for Charlotte. </P>
<P> In Sacramento, Spud Webb's fadeaway jumper with two seconds remaining lifted the Kings to a 102-101 triumph over the Portland Trail Blazers. </P>
<P> Mitch Richmond had 30 points and Olden Polynice scored 21 for the Kings. </P>
<P> At Golden State, Tom Gugliotta and Tim Hardaway had 20 points each to lead seven Warriors in double figures in a 129-105 rout of the Los Angeles Lakers. </P>
<P> Hardaway had 15 assists for the Warriors, who led all the way and have won two straight after a 10-game losing streak. </P>
<P> Cedric Ceballos led the Lakers with 24 points. </P>
<P> In Denver, Rik Smits scored a season-high 33 points and grabbed 14 rebounds to lead the Indiana Pacers to a 95-91 win over the Nuggets. </P>
<P> Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf had 23 points to lead Denver. </P>
