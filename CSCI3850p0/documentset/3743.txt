<P>  O.J. Simpson killed his ex-wife when he found he could no longer dominate her, a prosecutor said Thursday after outlining the allegedly abusive means the former football star used to keep her under his control. </P>
<P> Deputy District Attorney Lydia Bodin withdrew 18 of the 62 explosive incidents made public in prosecution court papers Wednesday, which she said chronicled the alleged pattern of abuse. She said the remainder were ample to prove Simpson's motive for murder. </P>
<P> The prosecution wants the evidence put before the jury to show a pervasive pattern of abuse by Simpson against Nicole Brown Simpson starting right after they met in 1977. </P>
<P> ``When he finally couldn't control her, when she was finally breaking away from him, when she had finally estranged herself from him and tried to distance herself from him, it is the people's contention that he killed her,'' Bodin said in the strongest indication yet of how the prosecution intends to build its case of why Simpson murdered his ex-wife. </P>
<P> Simpson, a star running back who became an international celebrity and a household name in America as a sportscaster, actor and television pitchman, has pleaded not guilty to the murders of his 35-year-old ex-wife and her friend Ronald Goldman, 25. </P>
<P> The two were stabbed to death on the night of June 12 outside Nicole's Brentwood townhouse where, the prosecution contends, Goldman, a waiter, was delivering a pair of prescription glasses left behind at a restaurant where she had dined earlier that evening with her family. </P>
<P> Thursday's hearing was marked by the first appearance on center stage by famed trial lawyer F. Lee Bailey in an indication that he will play a major part in the trial. </P>
<P> The gray-haired bespectacled attorney appeared at ease during his first appearance ever in front of Superior Court Lance Ito, as he cross examined prosecution witness Prof Donald Dutton, a Canadian expert on battered women's syndrome. </P>
<P> Bailey exchanged pleasant banters with the witness as they promised to swap autographed copies of their books and chatted about the rules of hockey and how they pertain to the violence inherent in the game. </P>
<P> Through his questioning, Bailey disclosed that a letter from Simpson to Nicole characterized by the prosecution as a threat to report her to the Internal Revenue Service was in fact written on the advice of Simpson's lawyer cautioning Nicole not to try and cheat the IRS out of capital gains tax that she owed. </P>
<P> Bailey said Nicole had sold a rental property she owned, used the proceeds to buy a condominium and asked her ex-husband to say she was living with him so as to avoid paying $90,000 in capital gains taxes. </P>
<P> ``If the sole evidence alleged of economic abuse were to get a lawyer to tell the victim not to defraud the United States out of $90,000, is that economic abuse?'' Bailey asked. </P>
<P> Dutton said if that was the case, it was not economic abuse. </P>
<P> Prosecutors had wanted to detail 62 incidents proving spousal abuse, but reduced that number to 44, cutting out many items from Nicole's diary as so-called inadmissible ``hearsay evidence'' as well as the most inflammatory incident in which Simpson was said to have told a fellow actor he would cut off the heads of any of Nicole's boy friends who he saw driving his cars. </P>
<P> That statement, from actor Eddie Reynoza, was called into question Thursday by defense counsel Johnnie Cochran. </P>
<P> ``This person would say anything to get into any case; he turned up mysteriously in the Michael Jackson case,'' said Cochran, who helped the pop star fend off child molestation allegations. </P>
<P> ``The case of the prosecution is sagging,'' he said. ``They don't have a theory they feel they can sell to the jury ... We have what is called tabloid prosecution. They're getting many of their witnesses from (the television tabloid show) 'Hard Copy.''' </P>
<P> Deputy District Attorney Christopher Darden disagreed. </P>
<P> ``This is no character assassination of O.J. Simpson,'' he said. ``What you've heard so far in this case is nothing more than O.J. Simpson's life. This is his character. His behavior has come back to haunt him and it is not our fault.'' </P>
<P> Among the diary items withdrawn by the prosecution were incidents chronicled by Nicole detailing how Simpson allegedly beat her in her San Francisco apartment and threw her clothes on the street, how he beat her in public in New York and how he hit her and locked her in a wine cellar. </P>
