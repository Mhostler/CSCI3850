<P>  A new brand of vodka, said by its makers to be good for the liver, was launched in Russia in time for New Year celebrations, Itar-Tass news agency said. </P>
<P> The ``healthy vodka,'' made in the central Russian town of Samara, is called Rastoropsha after a local herb the manufacturers say gives it health-giving properties. </P>
<P> But the distillers pointed out the positive effect could be obtained only if the vodka was drunk ``in moderation,'' Tass said in a weekend report. </P>
