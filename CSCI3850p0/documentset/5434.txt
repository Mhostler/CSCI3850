<P>  Secretary of State Warren Christopher was wrong earlier this week when he said money to Guatemala's military intelligence services was cut off after reports it was paid to a colonel involved in the killing of one American and the husband of another, the New York Times reported Tuesday. </P>
<P> Money from the Central Intelligence Agency was continuing to flow to the military intelligence services of Guatemala, the Times reported, quoting senior Clinton Administration officials as saying the ``bulk of those payments would be suspended immediately.'' </P>
<P> Justice Department officials said Monday the CIA told them that Col. Julio Roberto Alpirez was involved in the killing of American innkeeper Michael DeVine in 1990, the newspaper reported from Washington. Col. Alpirez has also been accused of involvement in the killing of a guerrilla married to an American attorney at an unspecified time since. </P>
<P> Speaking on the CBS-TV program ``Face the Nation'' Sunday, Christopher said he was confident that CIA payments to Guatemalan military intelligence had ended. </P>
<P> The administration officials told the Times Monday night that ``the record on the 'liaison'' payments needed to be corrected.'' </P>
<P> The newspaper quoted an unnamed senior administration official as saying that payments were as much as $7 million each year during the administration of former President George Bush, had ``dwindled considerably in recent years'' and ``would be suspended immediately pending a broad administration investigation into the matter.'' </P>
<P> Some principals in the case are due to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee Wednesday. They include Jennifer Harbury and Carole DeVine, the widows of the two men whose killings have been connected to Col. Alpirez and Adm. William Studeman, the acting director of central intelligence. </P>
