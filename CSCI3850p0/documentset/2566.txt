<P>  The lawyer for a retarded Philadelphia woman has vowed to appeal an order by Supreme Court Justice David Souter that allows the woman's family to decide whether to sterilize her. </P>
<P> Souter on Friday upheld a lower court ruling in favor of the mother, Delores Wasiek, who wants to arrange a tubal ligation for Cindy Wasiek, 26, who is described as having the mental capacities of a 5-year-old. </P>
<P> The retarded woman's court-appointed guardian, lawyer Lorrie McKinley, said she will appeal Souter's order to the full Supreme Court next week. </P>
<P> Mrs. Wasiek said her daughter is affectionate and cannot be left to her own discretion. Moreover, she contends the younger woman has had epilepsy since birth and birth control pills would conflict with her drug regimen. A pregnancy might prove fatal, the mother's lawsuit contends. </P>
<P> McKinley argues that less invasive procedures have not been given an adequate trial. Imposing sterilization on an adult, even if retarded, would set a dangerous precedent for all retarded adults, she said. </P>
<P> The surgery could occur whenever the family decides fit, since Justice Souter rejected McKinley's request for a stay. </P>
<P> Souter, who is responsible for reviewing cases from the Philadelphia region, did not rule on the merits of the case. </P>
