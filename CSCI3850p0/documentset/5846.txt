<P>  Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said on Wednesday his country would consider strengthening strained relations with the United States if Washington first released billions of dollars of frozen assets. </P>
<P> ``We do not have any trust in the United States,'' Rafsanjani told a news conference at the end of a three-day state visit to India. </P>
<P> ``We believe that they should first prove they do not have any misintentions in their behaviour so that we could have further consideration for our future reference.'' </P>
<P> Rafsanjani said: ``We feel one such indication of goodwill from the United States could be the release of our frozen assets of our country. That would be a good sign.'' </P>
<P> Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati told Reuters that Rafsanjani was referring to $17 billion Iran says Washington froze after the 1979 Islamic revolution. </P>
<P> The United States regards Iran as an outlaw nation and has warned against moves by China and Russia to provide it with nuclear reactors, which Tehran says would be for peaceful purposes. </P>
<P> Rafsanjani said the presence of U.S. troops and warships in the Gulf had raised tensions in the region. </P>
<P> He also warned against Washington's involvement in a dispute between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, saying Iran was ready to mediate on the issue. </P>
