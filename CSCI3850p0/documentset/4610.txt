<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A key defense alibi witness testified Monday in O.J. Simpson's murder trial that she saw his white Ford Bronco parked outside his estate at around the time prosecutors say his ex-wife and a friend were killed. </P>
<P> Testifying with the jury absent from the courtroom, Rosa Lopez -- then a housekeeper for Simpson's next-door neighbor -- said she saw the Bronco at about 10:15 p.m. last June 12, the time prosecutors charge that the football legend was committing the murders. </P>
<P> Lopez -- whose testimony was being videotaped for a possible later showing to jurors -- said she was walking her employers' dog and that the Bronco was parked in the same place she had seen it about two hours earlier. </P>
<P> Speaking through a Spanish-language interpreter, Lopez also said she heard men talking and a dog barking on Simpson's property around midnight after Simpson left in a limousine to catch a plane to the airport. She said she was frightened but never saw anything. </P>
<P> Lopez said earlier that evening she had heard footsteps either on her employer's property or on Simpson' estate that had worried her. </P>
<P> The next morning, Detective Mark Fuhrman -- a conotroversial investigator in the case -- questioned her and she told him what she had heard, Lopez testified. </P>
<P> Under gentle questioning by defense attorney Johnnie Cochran, she said Fuhrman told her he would send a police officer to take her statement. But she said no one ever came. ''I'm still waiting for them,'' Lopez said. </P>
<P> The defense team has called Fuhrman a racist rogue cop and has suggested that he may have planted a crucial bloody glove he found at Simpson's Brentwood estate. </P>
<P> Prosecutors contend that Simpson drove his Bronco from his mansion to his ex-wife's townhouse, where she and her friend Ron Goldman were stabbed to death. Authorities say DNA tests show that blood from Simpson and both victims were found in the vehicle. </P>
<P> Lopez, who was called to testify early after she threatened to flee to her native El Salvador because of media harassment, is Simpson's only alibi witness. </P>
<P> Prosecutors, who caught her in a series of inconsistencies when she first took the witness stand Friday, are expected to try to hammer away at her credibility. </P>
