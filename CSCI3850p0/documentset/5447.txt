<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A coalition of consumer and labor groups charged Tuesday that the Food Lion supermarket chain sold pain relievers and other over the counter medicines long after their expiration date. </P>
<P> A spokesman for Food Lion, a non-unionized chain at odds with organized labor, said the Salisbury, North Carolina-based company with more than 1,000 stores in 14 states, was committed to excellence in its operations and made an ``aggressive effort to keep out-of-date products off of the shelves.'' </P>
<P> In its fourth critical report on the chain, the Consumers United With Employees (CUE), found that scores of nonprescription medicines -- including some for children -- were being sold months after their expiration date. </P>
<P> In a few cases, the products were being sold years after the expiration date. The problem was most common with the Food Lion house brand, the organization charged. </P>
<P> Food Lion spokesman Chris Ahearn said: ``Any time that there is a human element involved there is the possibility of error.'' Food Lion urged consumers to return any expired product for replacement or refund, she added in a telephone interview with Reuters. </P>
<P> Ahearn charged that CUE is not a consumers' group but a ''union-funded organization whose main concern is to hurt Food Lion's business and to prevent us from growing in markets where grocery stores with unionized labor dominate the market.'' </P>
<P> ``We feel very strongly that if they were concerned with consumer safety they would be checking all chains and not only Food Lion,'' she said. Representatives of CUE were not immediately available to reply. </P>
<P> The company maintains that CUE is partly funded by the United Food and Commercial Workers union, which has been unsuccessful in efforts to organize Food Lion workers. </P>
<P> CUE sent copies of its findings to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and state officials requesting action. </P>
<P> For this survey, CUE checked on products at 116 Food Lion stores in all of the 14 states where the chain operates. It found and purchased outdated medicines in all the states, and in 70 of the 116 stores. </P>
<P> The single most outdated product was the Food Lion brand of a children's painkiller at a store in Winnsboro, South Carolina. It had expired 963 days -- nearly three years -- earlier. </P>
