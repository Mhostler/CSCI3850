<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Dominik Hasek made 39 saves, 31 over the final two periods, as the Buffalo Sabres held on for a 5-3 triumph over the NHL-best Nordiques Tuesday, ending Quebec's four-game winning streak. </P>
<P> Pat LaFontaine had a goal and two assists and Alexander Mogilny and Charlie Huddy each had a pair of assists for the Sabres, who won for the second time in their last six games. </P>
<P> Yuri Khmylev, Dave Hannan, Donald Audette and Jason Dawe also tallied for the Sabres. </P>
<P> Dawe finished Buffalo's scoring off a nifty setup from LaFontaine. ``Playing with those guys (Lafontaine and Mogilny) is like run-and-gun offense, you've got to look around all the time,'' said Dawe. </P>
<P> Quebec goaltender Jocelyn Thibault left the game early in the first period after injuring his shoulder and was replaced by Stephane Fiset, who allowed all of Buffalo's goals. </P>
<P> Scott Young scored twice for Quebec, which lost for just the second time in its last eight games. </P>
<P> ``We've got a little saying in this room, 'never lose two in a row,''' said Quebec's Owen Nolan. </P>
<P> ``We've got all the tools to be a Stanley Cup contender, we've just got to learn to accept the loss and rebound.'' </P>
<P> The Nordiques (22-7-3) outshot the Sabres 42-23 -- 33-8 over the final two periods. </P>
<P> Buffalo played without head coach John Muckler, who was suspended for three games and fined $10,000 Monday for attacking a fan after a game. </P>
<P> In Pittsburgh, Jaromir Jagr scored two goals, his league-leading 24th and 25th, and Tomas Sandstrom added a goal and two assists to lead the Penguins to a 6-3 victory over the New York Islanders. </P>
<P> Wendell Young made 40 saves for his first win as the Penguins (22-9-2) won their fourth straight to move within a point of Quebec for first place in the Northeast Division. </P>
<P> Kjell Samuelsson, Kevin Stevens and Joe Mullen also tallied for Pittsburgh. </P>
<P> Ray Ferraro, Brad Dalgarno and Troy Loney scored for the Islanders, who are winless in their last 13 road games (0-11-2) and have lost seven of their last eight overall. </P>
<P> In Detroit, Ray Sheppard scored twice and Dino Ciccarelli had a pair of assists in his 1,000th game as the Red Wings beat the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim 6-4. </P>
<P> ``Given the fact that I had the broken leg (in junior hockey) and that I was overlooked in my draft year, I was just hoping to make it to the NHL, never mind playing in 1,000 games,'' Ciccarelli said. </P>
<P> ``If someone had told me that my 1,000th game would be against the 'Mighty Ducks,' I would have really laughed.'' </P>
<P> Detroit's Steve Yzerman broke a six-game points drought with a goal and an assist. </P>
<P> Joe Sacco notched his second straight two-goal game for the Ducks, who are 1-3-2 in their last six games. </P>
<P> The Red Wings, 8-1-1 in their last 10 games, lead the Central Division at 21-7-2. </P>
<P> In San Jose, Jeff Friesen scored with 32 seconds left in overtime to lift the Sharks to a 6-5 victory over the Winnipeg Jets. </P>
<P> Friesen, at 18 the youngest player in the league, picked up his own rebound and, with Teppo Numminen draped on him, scored on a wrist shot from a tight angle. </P>
<P> Nelson Emerson had four points, including his first career hat trick, for the Jets, who are winless in their last eight games (0-6-2). </P>
<P> The Sharks erased a three-goal deficit and took their first lead of the game at 5-4 midway through the third period. </P>
<P> Winnipeg's Igor Korolev scored with 47 seconds left in regulation to send the game into overtime. </P>
<P> Winnipeg played without star winger Teemu Selanne, who was suspended for two games for a slashing incident against Toronto's Dmitri Mironov. </P>
<P> In Calgary, Pot Conacher scored a pair of goals and Dan Quinn had a goal and two assists to lead the Los Angeles Kings past the Flames, 5-3. </P>
<P> Wayne Gretzky set up three goals for the Kings, who broke Calgary's three-game winning streak. The Kings are 3-1-1 in their last five games. </P>
<P> Phil Housley had a goal and an assist for Calgary, which leads the Pacific Division at 15-13-5. </P>
<P> Kelly Hrudey made 38 saves, 12 in the final stanza as the Kings were outshot 13-1. </P>
<P> In Boston, Bryan Smolinski and Adam Oates each scored twice and Ray Bourque had three assists as the Bruins beat the Atlantic Division-leading Philadelphia Flyers 5-1. </P>
<P> John LeClair scored the only goal for Philadelphia (17-11-4). The Flyers' Eric Lindros was held without a point for the first time in six games. </P>
