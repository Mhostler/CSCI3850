<P>  Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan said Friday that King Hussein's meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in Washington July 25 was ``only an important step'' toward peace. </P>
<P> ``Jordan has accepted the invitation which is linked directly to comprehensive peace ... the meeting is only an important step on the long and difficult road to achieving the peace which future generations can accept,'' Crown Prince Hassan was quoted as saying by state television. </P>
<P> The two countries are formally at war and this will be the first public meeting between the two leaders. </P>
<P> The meeting was announced in Washington by President Clinton, who hosted the signing of last September's peace accord between Rabin and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat. </P>
<P> Israel and Jordan have been formally at war since Israel's founding in 1948. Their three years of talks, launched in Madrid and confined largely to Washington, move to Israel and Jordan next week. </P>
