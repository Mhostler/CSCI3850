<P>  The Duchess of York, the fun-loving royal rebel known as ``Fergie'' who British tabloids love to hate, has promised not to be so extravagant in 1995. </P>
<P> Dressed as Father Christmas for a children's party interview with Hello magazine, she also pledged to be more self-confident next year. </P>
<P> The duchess, whose marriage to Prince Andrew collapsed in 1992, was propelled into the headlines again this year after admitting she took AIDS tests and is seeing a psychoanalyst. </P>
<P> Sarah the flame-haired duchess, known as ``Fergie'' after her maiden name Ferguson, has been attacked for her love of the good life from skiing holidays to lavish shopping trips with Princess Diana, estranged wife of Andrew's brother, Prince Charles. </P>
<P> Asked by Hello what faults she might try to correct in herself in 1995, she said: ``My extravagance and my lack of self-confdience which sometimes makes me indecisive. </P>
<P> ``I''ve been criticized so much over the past seven years that I have lost all my self-confidence and self-esteem.'' </P>
