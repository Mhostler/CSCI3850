<DATELINE>PHNOM PENH, May 10 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Cambodian army must attack the Khmer Rouge's main guerrilla base at Pailin or face a rebel advance intent on driving all the way to Phnom Penh, First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh said. </P>
<P> Ranariddh made the chilling warning during a speech in northwest Battambang on Tuesday which was later broadcast on state radio. </P>
<P> ``Now we have to choose whether to allow them (Khmer Rouge) to stay on at Pailin or not,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``If they just stay at Pailin and let us live safely in Ratanakmondul and Banan t would be all right even though the constitution says no one can occupy Khmer territory,'' he said in reference to areas near Pailin. </P>
<P> ``If we let them stay on at Pailin they will not let us stay at Ratanakmondul and if they could drive us out from Ratanakmondul they will keep driving us out until they reach Phnom Penh,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``With Mister Pol Pot -- if we let him stay at Pailin they will take Battambang. If we let them stay at Battambang, they will take Pursat and if we let them stay at Pursat they will take Kompong Chhnang and then Phnom Penh.'' </P>
<P> Battambang is the main city in the northwest and the others are major towns between it and Phnom Penh. </P>
<P> On May 1, about 400 Khmer Rouge backed by up to seven tanks, captured Treng commune about 40 kilometres (25 miles) south of Battambang on National Route 10. </P>
<P> The surprise attack pushed the army back to new a defensive position about 38 km (23 miles) south of Battambang where skirmishes and sporadic shelling has continued unabated. </P>
<P> On Wednesday, Defence Minister Tea Banh told Reuters that the Khmer Rouge in Treng would soon begin to run low on ammunition. </P>
<P> ``They are still at Treng -- but I don't think they can hold it. I don't think they have enough ammunition,'' he said. </P>
<P> Ranariddh visited Battambang province to supervise the donation of humanitarian assistance to local people forced to flee their homes because of fighting along Route 10. </P>
<P> Aid officials estimate that at least 10,000 people have been forced to abandon their homes because of the violence. </P>
<P> The Khmer Rouge, who continue to wage a low-level guerrilla war against the government, are held responsible for the deaths of one million Cambodians during its reign between 1975 and 1979. </P>
