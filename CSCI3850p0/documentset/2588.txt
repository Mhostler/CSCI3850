<P>  The U.S. Coast Guard said Sunday it was searching waters off the Chesapeake Bay for a man reported missing from the luxury liner, QE2, since Saturday evening. </P>
<P> ``We are presuming he went overboard or has hidden himself very well, which is unlikely because the vessel has been thoroughly searched,'' said a spokesman from the Fifth Coast Guard District Public Affairs Office in Portsmouth, Va. </P>
<P> The man's name was not released. </P>
<P> The Coast Guard said it was searching a 2,060 square-mile area from the Chesapeake Bay entrance to 120 miles southeast. </P>
