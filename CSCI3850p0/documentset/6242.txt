<P>  A fire was started Wednesday at the offices of an Arab East Jerusalem newspaper which had criticized Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Israeli police and Palestinians said. </P>
<P> An Israeli police spokesman said an investigation was under way into the torching of the offices of al-Uma newspaper. He said no one was hurt and the damage not serious. </P>
<P> Nearly two weeks ago Adnan al-Khatib, editor and publisher of al-Uma, said about 20 men loyal to Arafat raided the press where the newspaper was printed and confiscated equipment. </P>
<P> Khatib's newspaper reflects the opinions of various Palestinian opposition groups. </P>
<P> He said the men were members of the Palestinian ``preventive security'' apparatus, established in self-ruled Jericho and Gaza under terms of a 1993 Israel-PLO peace deal and headed by Jibril al-Rajoub. Rajoub denied ordering the raid. </P>
<P> Under the PLO-Israeli peace deal, Rajoub's jurisdiction is limited to the Palestinian-ruled areas but Israeli officials have in the past accused him of operating throughout the still-occupied West Bank. </P>
<P> Arafat's Palestinian Authority has temporarily banned distribution of two Palestinian newspapers since taking over from Israel last May. It limited distribution of a third paper for two days. </P>
