<P>  Expanding access to health and social services could save up to 23,000 children's lives a year and a Republican bid to cut back welfare could worsen the U.S. child mortality rate, a consumer group said Wednesday. </P>
<P> A report by Citizen Action, a consumer group which often supports liberal policies, found children who live in the poorest counties had a far higher death rate for almost all major causes -- including car accidents, fires, and even congenital heart defects -- than children in the wealthiest counties. </P>
<P> Black children were also at much higher risk than white children, for most causes of death, according to the report called ``Dying Before Their Time: Child Mortality in the United States.'' </P>
<P> ``Reducing the level of poverty in the nation is the best means of lowering infant and child death rates,'' said Tom Pollak, the author of the report. </P>
<P> ``Policy makers must focus on strategies that not only create jobs but also expand access to quality medical care, child care, and increased opportunities for education and training,'' he told a news conference. </P>
<P> He and other advocates said Republican cuts in social programs will hurt the health and wellbeing of children. </P>
<P> ``When we talk of cuttng welfare, we're talking about a direct hit on children,'' said Eve Brooks, president of the National Association of Child Advocates. </P>
<P> Nearly half the infants who died in the first month of life died of causes related to premature delivery. This was more common among blacks than among whites. </P>
<P> The organization called for health care for all children and pregnant women, public health education and services for youth, and more public funding for health care for the poor. </P>
<P> The key factors in child mortality were premature birth, Suddent Infant Death Syndrome, and unintentional injuries. For ages teen-agers between the age of 15 to 18, homicide was the second leading cause of death, with suicide the third. </P>
