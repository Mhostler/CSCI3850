<DATELINE>SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The new U.N. military commander in Bosnia took up his post Thursday as efforts to bring the warring factions to the negotiating table ran into difficulties and fighting flared up in the troublesome Bihac enclave. </P>
<P> Efforts by international peace mediators to persuade the Bosnian Serbs to accept the latest peace plan remained deadlocked, a senior Serb official confirmed. </P>
<P> The United Nations blamed Bosnian Serb forces for shelling the government-held northwestern town of Bihac, a U.N. safe area, Thursday morning. Six shells impacted around dawn, wounding one civilian, U.N. spokesman Paul Risley said. </P>
<P> It was the first reported attack on the U.N.-declared sanctuary of Bihac, the main town in a Muslim-populated government enclave known by the same name, since Jan. 14 when seven civilians were killed by Bosnian Serb mortars. </P>
<P> The United Nations said shelling by rebel Muslims and Croatian Serbs who did not sign a Bosnia-wide truce intensified near Velika Kladusa in the north end of the enclave Thursday and spread west of the north-south highway for the first time. </P>
<P> It said that 579 artillery detonations buffeted front lines southeast of Velika Kladusa during the day, five times the daily average since the cease-fire went into force. </P>
<P> Shelling also broke out west of the highway in the Bugar region, which had been quiet. </P>
<P> Lt. Gen. Rupert Smith, 51, who replaced fellow Briton Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Rose, said that he hoped to convert Bosnia's shaky new cease-fire into lasting peace. </P>
<P> ``I'm pleased to take up the reins from my predecessor Michael Rose to do what we can to give aid to the unfortunate and long-suffering people caught up in this conflict and on the basis of the 'cessation of hostilities' to work hard at arriving at a settlement and peace in this country,'' Smith told reporters on arrival at the U.N.-run Sarajevo airport. </P>
<P> Analysts believe Smith's main task will be to deploy U.N. troops between rival Serb and Bosnian government forces to damp down fighting and foster a revival of peace talks. </P>
<P> Three envoys from the five-nation ``contact group,'' who are trying to revive the peace process, were in Sarajevo Thursday to consider their next step after having changed their minds about breaking off their mission to Bosnia. </P>
<P> Russian and German envoys flew out because they had prior engagements. The other members of the contact group are the United States, Britain and France. </P>
<P> Meanwhile, the United Nations mounted what it feared may be its last medical evacuation from the city, saying the program had been crippled because donor nations had stopped giving funds. </P>
<P> Fifteen patients accompanied by 21 escorts boarded U.N. armored vehicles at the city's main hospital for the trip to the airport, from where they were flown out for treatment in Denmark, the only country currently providing beds. </P>
