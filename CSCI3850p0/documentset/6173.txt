<P>  The wives of two Americans jailed in Iraq for illegal entry spent several hours with them in prison Sunday, the women told CNN in an interview Monday.  ``We were very appreciative (of Iraq) for enabling us to visit so quickly with them,'' Linda Barloon told Cable News Network in a brief interview from Baghdad. ``It was very unexpected, we did not anticipate that we would be able to see them.''  Linda Barloon and Kathy Daliberti, whose husbands are serving eight year terms for crossing the border into Iraq from Kuwait without proper visas, traveled to Baghdad Saturday.  They have said they want to see President Saddam Hussein to ask for clemency for William Barloon, 39, and David Daliberti, CNN said the wives hope to repeat their visit to their husbands at the prison, which is about 20 miles (outside Baghdad. The Iraqi government wants the visit to be kept in low profile.  Barloon and Daliberti were arrested in Iraq on March 13 after crossing the border from Kuwait. They were tried and sentenced for illegally entering Iraq. </P>
<P> Washington says the two Americans made a wrong turn and should be freed. </P>
<P> CNN said it had been given a statement from the Iraqi minister of information urging Arab leaders not to meet with U.N. ambassador Madeleine Albright on her current visit to the Middle East. </P>
