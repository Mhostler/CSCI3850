<P>  Croatia will have the final word on the size, mandate and composition of a new U.N. force to be set up in the former Yugoslav republic, Croatia's U.N. envoy said Friday. </P>
<P> ``We have the final say in these very sensitive issues, like the number of troops deployed. We will also have to say where certain troops will be deployed (and) which country should be present in Croatia,'' said Ambassador Mario Nobilo. </P>
<P> He said Croatia preferred troops from European countries, although some from other countries could be included ``in some symbolic way.'' </P>
<P> Currently soldiers from Russia and Third World countries are in Croatia as well as troops from European states and Canada. </P>
<P> Nobilo spoke to reporters after Croatian President Franjo Tudjman saw Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright. Tudjman had originally ordered the 12,000 U.N. troops in Croatia to leave, starting in April.  But he relented last week on condition that their number would be cut in half and that they would not only patrol the cease-fire line between Croatian government troops and rebel Serb forces but also control Croatia's border with Bosnia and Yugoslavia to prevent military supplies to the Serbs. </P>
<P> Just how the border would be controlled is still a subject of controversy, with a U.S. official telling reporters that ''control'' was an appropriate word for U.N. mandate but that the frontier would not be ``sealed militarily.'' </P>
<P> The official also said efforts were now under way in draft resolutions that would set up three separate U.N. commands for Croatia, Bosnia and Macedonia, rather than lumping all three theaters together under the rubric of the U.N. Protection Force, or UNPROFOR. </P>
<P> While the U.N. special representative for the entire theater, Yasushi Akashi, would remain, he would have three deputies -- one for each of the three countries hosting U.N. contingents. </P>
<P> Nobilo also said that if the March 31 deadline for expiration of the UNPROFOR mandate could not be met, there could possibly be an extension of a ``few days or weeks.'' </P>
<P> But he was adamant that the final say on all issues lay with the Zagreb government and that the rebel Serbs in Croatia, who control nearly a third of the country, could give an ``amber light'' but should not have any veto power. </P>
<P> Most of all, Nobilo said the mandate had to be changed to insist on ``border control, not monitoring.'' The United Nations, he said, had to ``leave beside the philosophy of consent from two sides.'' </P>
