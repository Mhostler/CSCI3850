<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The key defense witness in the O.J. Simspon double-murder trial, Rosa Lopez, has changed her name three times, a newspaper in her home country of El Salvador reported Thursday. </P>
<P> The daily La Prensa Grafica said Lopez was born with the name Reyes Lopez but later changed it to Maria Reyes Martinez Lopez, and then Rosa Maria Lopez Martinez before adopting her current name. </P>
<P> It said reporters had located Rosa Lopez's half-paralyzed stepdaughter, Maria Cruz Rogel, in the eastern province of Cabanas and that she said Lopez had promised to return soon to live with her in El Salvador. </P>
<P> Prosecutors in the O.J. Simpson case have questioned Lopez's reliability as a witness in the sensational trial of the former football great. </P>
<P> She is Simpson's only alibi witness, and testified Monday that she saw his white Ford Bronco parked outside his estate last June 12 at roughly the same time prosecutors say he was murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman at Brown Simpson's townhouse two miles away. </P>
<P> La Prensa Grafica said Lopez visited El Salvador in December and had told relatives she would return to stay for good after living in the United States for 26 years. </P>
