<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Indonesia's Merapi volcano, which killed more than 50 people when it erupted last month, has spewed lava and debris again, the official Antara news agency said Monday. </P>
<P> It quoted officials in the central Javanese town of Magelang as saying the crater of the 9,800 foot volcano spilled lava about 18 times Sunday, although the flows stopped short of villages on the volcano's slopes. </P>
<P> More than 50 people lost their lives, many burned by a lethal mix of toxic gases and pyroclastic flows, when Merapi, 250 miles east of Jakarta, erupted Nov. 22. </P>
<P> More than 4,000 refugees from the eruption are still waiting for officials to allow them to return to their homes, Antara said. </P>
