<P>  Nepal's army chief has resigned, owning moral responsibility for a corruption scandal that led to the sacking and imprisonment of army officials, including senior officers, officials said on Friday. </P>
<P> The Defence Ministry of the Himalayan kingdom announced that Prime Minister Man Mohan Adhikary's government approved an army court martial decision to sack four officers and jail two of them. </P>
<P> General Gadul Shumsher Rana resigned on Thursday after the decision in order to uphold the diginity of the Royal Nepal Army, a communique from King Birendra's Narayanhity Palace said. </P>
<P> ``General Rana submitted his resignation on moral grounds to maintain the image of the Royal Nepalese Army as well as the prestige and dignity of the office of the chief of army staff in the context of the case of corruption and financial irregularities,'' the statement said. </P>
<P> The King accepted his resignation, it said. </P>
<P> The Royal Nepal Army is a small but disciplined force that has helped United Nations peacekeeping forces in trouble spots all over the world. </P>
<P> The Gurkha soldiers of legendary loyalty hail from Nepal. </P>
<P> Officials said a general court martial found retired Major General Yogendra Pratap Jung Rana guilty of extending benefits to civilians in return for bribes. </P>
<P> It ordered him to repay 10.4 million rupees ($208,000) to the government, the amount it said he had taken and jailed him for four years, they said. </P>
<P> The army probed allegations of irregularities, corruption and forgery last year in the ordnance office that Major General Rana headed before his retirement, they said. </P>
<P> Rana was found guilty of deliberately incurring losses to government property and not fulfilling his responsibilities honestly, the Defence Ministry statement said. </P>
<P> Four serving officers -- a colonel, a lieutenant colonel, a major and a lieutenant -- were dismissed from the service after the enquiry. Two of them were jailed, but the officials did not say for how long. </P>
<P> Three junior officers have also been sacked for their involvement in the scandal, the officials said. </P>
