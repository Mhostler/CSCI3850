<DATELINE>CHICAGO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Talks between the National Hockey League and players adjourned after just two hours Friday with no sign of progress toward rescuing the 1994-95 hockey season. </P>
<P> ``We did not have anything more to provide to each other,'' said union executive director Bob Goodenow. </P>
<P> ``One could say we agreed to disagree on the issues as they were, give it more thought and more work and see if some ideas could develop before we meet again,'' he told reporters. </P>
<P> Boston Bruins president Harry Sinden, a member of the league's negotiating team, voiced frustration following Friday's abbreviated talks. </P>
<P> ``We are tapped out on conversation,'' Sinden said. ``We are frozen on the positions we were at last night. </P>
<P> ``Maybe it's better if we sleep on it for the weekend,'' he said. </P>
<P> Both sides said they would probably meet again Monday, most likely again in Chicago. </P>
<P> Thursday's marathon eight-hour session had produced some optimism that a deal could be reached in time to save the season with some movement reported on the issue of a rookie salary cap. </P>
<P> But NHL Commisssioner Gary Bettman said there appeared to be little more that could be accomplished at this time after Friday's talks. </P>
<P> ``I'm getting a little frustrated,'' Bettman said. ``Obviously there isn't enough momentum or we would be further along in the process.'' </P>
<P> The lockout of the players is in its 63rd day. As of Thursday night, a total of 347 games have been missed. </P>
<P> The league has already cancelled 24 games per team, reducing the 84-game season to 60 games if a new collective bargaining agreement can be reached in the very near future. </P>
<P> There has been speculation that the season will be cancelled entirely unless an agreement can be reached by mid-December. </P>
<P> ``Time is a factor,'' Bettman said. ``One of the possibilities is the possibility of no season.'' </P>
<P> Salary arbitration, free agency and a rookie salary cap are the major issues in the impasse as both sides try to reach a deal that will address rapidly escalating salaries. </P>
<P> During the recent talks in Boston, the controversial proposal of a ``luxury tax'' on teams with the highest payrolls was dropped by the owners while other issues were discusses. </P>
<P> Sinden said last weekend that the NHL could reintroduce its tax proposal if agreement on the other issues does not produce a significant drag on rising salaries. </P>
<P> The players are adamently opposed to the tax proposal, saying it is a salary cap in disguise. </P>
