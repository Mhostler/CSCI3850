<P> Interfax said the delegates would also consider ways to keep apart Azeri and Karabakh forces, the dispatch of international observers to the area and a withdrawal of Karabakh forces from Azeri territories they have seized. </P>
<P> Thousands of people have been killed since fighting broke out in Karabakh about seven years ago, causing severe economic problems for both Armenia and Azerbaijan. This will be the fourth round of talks on finding a peace settlement. </P>
