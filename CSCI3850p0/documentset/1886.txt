<P>  Lawmakers and political pundits reacted with disbelief when Socialist Tomiichi Murayama came to power in June at the head of an unwieldy left-right coalition. </P>
<P> They predicted he would soon join a growing list of short-lived Japanese prime ministers. </P>
<P> More than three months later, MPs and commentators now say both Murayama and his oddball coalition linking the Socialists with the conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) are here to stay, barring unexpected scandals. </P>
<P> ``I predict he will stay in power for some substantial time,'' unaligned lawmaker Banri Kaieda said in an interview. ``At least until next summer's Upper House elections.'' </P>
<P> ``For that, the LDP must be given credit for keeping a low profile and a mature attitude towards their Socialist allies.'' </P>
<P> Kaieda, member of the original reformist coalition that toppled the LDP after 38 years of unbroken rule last year, is one of only four non-communist lawmakers not belonging to either the opposition or the ruling bloc. </P>
<P> Public support for the coalition has been growing steadily among a population weary of political instability. </P>
<P> When the 70-year-old Murayama came to power in late June as the first Socialist premier since 1948, one newspaper poll said only 37 percent backed him while 41 percent did not. </P>
<P> Last week a survey by the same daily gave Murayama a 43 percent support rate against 42 percent who did not back him. </P>
<P> ``People were forecasting, I think prematurely, that we'd see this administration out before the end of the year,'' said Geoffrey Barker, chief economist at Baring Securities in Tokyo. </P>
<P> Murayama's expected longevity, however, rests less on popular support for his policies, than on the fact that he has no intention of calling early elections which could trigger a repeat of the past year's political upheavals. </P>
<P> In the opening barrages of parliamentary debate last week, Murayama's predecessor Tsutomu Hata lambasted the ``unlawful LDP-Socialist marriage'' and demanded early general elections. </P>
<P> In reply, Murayama raised his trademark bushy eyebrows a tad and quietly dismissed the plea. ``We have no room for a two-month political vacuum (to call elections).'' </P>
<P> The ruling coalition and the unified opposition, masterminded by maverick powerbroker Ichiro Ozawa, have few policy differences. Both sides vow to streamline the bloated bureaucracy, clean up messy politics and speed up economic deregulation. </P>
<P> Murayama's coalition was formed by forces emotionally opposed to Ozawa's forceful methods over policy issues when his supporters -- Hata and Morihiro Hosokawa -- were in power. </P>
<P> Both sides also want to cement a recovery from Japan's worst post-World War II economic slump and pursue an active global political role, as shown in the despatch of troops to aid Rwandan refugees in Zaire and Japan's declaration that it would seek a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council. </P>
<P> Last week in parliament Hata could find little to attack in Murayama's plans to continue this year's $5.5 billion income tax cuts for the next two years and raise the three-percent consumption tax to 5 percent in 1997. </P>
<P> Hata's attacks were directed instead against a dramatic policy about-face by Murayama's Socialists, who have scrapped their traditional opposition to the country's military, the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty and the consumption tax, which the leftist party had singled out as a levy unfair to the poor. </P>
<P> The LDP-Socialist coalition is pursuing a mature approach to politics, while the ``Young Turk'' opposition acts erratically and childishly, lawmaker Kaieda said. </P>
<P> This was exemplified Sept. 30 when the newly unified opposition, comprising 10 small parties and holding 187 seats in the 511-member Lower House, boycotted Murayama's policy speech on the opening day of parliament. </P>
<P> The dispute stemmed from opposition demands for Murayama to handover the post of house vice speaker, normally given to the second largest party in parliament after a general election. </P>
<P> But the ruling bloc, which together holds a comfortable majority of 294 seats in the chamber, simply waited for media and public opinion to take their toll on the opposition. After two days, the Ozawa camp surrendered and agreed to open debate. </P>
