<P>  President Clinton Sunday took a stroll down memory lane with his first visit to the Arkansas governor's mansion since he left it two years ago for the White House. </P>
<P> ``It's nice to be back here,'' Clinton said on a sunny spring morning after walking through the house to see how it looks now that his successor, Gov. Jim Guy Tucker, lives there. </P>
<P> The occasion was a reception for former Arkansas governors to dedicate portraits of them that will hang in the mansion. </P>
<P> They all posed for pictures after the reception, including Sid McNath (1949-52), Dale Bumpers (1971-74), David Pryor (1975-78), Clinton (1979-80 and 1983-92), Frank White (1981-82) and Tucker. </P>
<P> Who was the best governor? </P>
<P> ``We all have our favorites,'' said Clinton. </P>
<P> Added Bumpers: ``The present governor is working on becoming the second best governor the state ever had.'' Who's the best? ''No comment,'' he chuckled. </P>
<P> Clinton made clear he is happy in Washington despite his occasional gripes about his new job. Is he sorry he left? ``Not on most days,'' he said. </P>
<P> The president is spending a long weekend in his home state to catch up with old friends. Saturday night he watched the Arkansas Razorbacks defeat North Carolina to advance to Monday night's NCAA championship basketball game in Seattle. </P>
<P> In an ESPN interview, he left it unclear as to whether he might make a cross-country dash to Seattle to see the game in person, then jet back to Washington in time for a meeting with British Prime Minister John Major at noon Tuesday. </P>
<P> White House spokeswoman Ginny Terzano said Clinton was definitely not going to Seattle but was trying to decide whether to stay in Little Rock to see it on television or return to Washington in time for the game. </P>
<P> The White house cleared up the mystery by announcing Sunday afternoon the president would stay in Little Rock to watch the game Monday night and return to Washington Tuesday morning in time for his midday meeting with Major. </P>
<P> Clinton is to travel to Jonesboro, Ark., Monday morning for dedication ceremonies at the Dean B. Ellis Library at Arkansas State University. </P>
<P> After the governors' reception, Clinton went to the Immanuel Baptist Church where he has been a member since 1980. The Rev. Rex Horne led the congregation in offering a prayer for Clinton's continued ``wisdom and courage'' in his job. </P>
