<P>  Police on Tuesday tried to identify nine rotting bodies left in a hot, stuffy public storage facility, apparently by a funeral director who went out of business. </P>
<P> The decomposing human remains were discovered Monday by a manager who noticed a foul smell coming from behind the locked doors of the concrete rental unit, said Lee County Sheriff Office spokesman Tim Hetz. </P>
<P> ``What he saw was right out of 'Tales from the Crypt,''' said Hetz. ``Nine bodies in various stages of deterioration.'' </P>
<P> Some of the bodies -- believed to be eight men and a woman -- were in caskets, while others were in cardboard boxes or wrapped in cloth. </P>
<P> Although investigators were uncertain how long the bodies had been at the unventilated facility, Hetz said temperatures in the storage unit probably had reached 130 degrees the past few weeks. </P>
<P> Investigators were considering possible charges against the former funeral director, Finley Carter Jr., of Fort Myers. </P>
<P> Charges could include improper disposal of a body, or fraud if payment had been made for their burial, he said. </P>
<P> Following the discovery of the bodies, police searched another rental storage unit, where they found caskets, gurneys and other funeral home equipment, but no remains. </P>
