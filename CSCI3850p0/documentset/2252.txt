<P>  The U.S. Treasury Wednesday announced steps designed to eliminate fraud in the earned income tax credit program that has developed as a result of the growing practice of electronic tax return filing. </P>
<P> The program provides payments to low-income families. </P>
<P> Under the proposals to eliminate fraud, the Treasury will develop measures to deny the credits to illegal aliens, estimating that 150,000 claimed the credits for last year's taxes. </P>
<P> In addition, it will no longer provide preparers who file electronically a so-called direct deposit indicator, which shows that it sees no reason to hold up the tax credit. </P>
<P> Used to signal lenders who work with preparers that a refund will be on the way shortly, the indicator has become a key tool in fraud schemes, it said. </P>
<P> ``The crooks take the money and run, and the taxpayers and banks get burned,'' Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen told a briefing for reporters. </P>
<P> The elimination of the indicator would take place in the next tax season, while the measures designed to shut off illegal aliens from the program would be developed by early next year, the Treasury said. </P>
