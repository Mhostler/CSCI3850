<DATELINE>SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The United Nations blamed Bosnian Serb Army (BSA) commander Gen. Ratko Mladic Thursday for a fuel blockade which is threatening peacekeeping operations in Sarajevo and eastern Bosnia. </P>
<P> As U.N. special envoy Yasushi Akashi prepared to tackle Bosnian Serb leaders on the fuel crisis, peacekeepers' spokesman Thant Myint-U said: </P>
<P> ``We understand Gen. Mladic himself has ordered that fuel convoys not be allowed through. The fuel situation remains critical. We cannot fulfil any of our tasks if we don't have the fuel to move around.'' </P>
<P> Mladic, a bellicose hard-line nationalist, is the driving force behind the BSA's military dominance in Bosnia and a veteran of confrontations with the peacekeepers. </P>
<P> The United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) said it would take unspecified but ``extremely strong'' action against Serbs if re-fuelling convoys continued to be obstructed. </P>
<P> Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic told Bosnian Serbs on Thursday in his first public appearance for months in Belgrade that the war in Bosnia must stop. </P>
<P> Milosevic said the Bosnian Serbs had achieved their goals and taken superior territory from their enemies. </P>
<P> ``In the civil war waged there they have separated themselves with superior territory from those they fought with,'' Milosevic said at a celebration marking the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Serbia and its capital Belgrade during the Second World War. </P>
<P> ``The war in Bosnia must stop,'' he said. ``Any more fighting would be territorial aggression against others.'' </P>
<P> But as he spoke, the man his words were addressed to, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic again rejected an international peace plan drawn up by major powers. </P>
<P> ``The international community keeps wasting its time waiting for our positive response to the plan,'' he said in the northern Bosnian Serb town of Banja Luka. </P>
<P> ``There is no reason and justification for that, because ... no one has the right to put his signature on to the kind of map which, if not redrawn, has no chance of being accepted by us.'' </P>
<P> Bosnian Serb television broadcast Karadzic's statement minutes after Serbian television's live coverage of Milosevic's speech in Belgrade. </P>
<P> Milosevic insisted further fighting was ``a lethal and unnecessary adventure'' for the Bosnian Serbs and ``further tragic exhausting of Serbia and its citizens.'' </P>
<P> Milosevic broke off political and military ties with the Bosnian Serbs after they rejected the latest international peace plan awarding them 49 percent of Bosnia with the rest going to the Muslims and Croats. </P>
<P> U.N. peacekeepers said their fuel stocks in Sarajevo and three U.N. protected Muslim enclaves in eastern Bosnia were down to a matter of days. </P>
<P> The Serbs blocked three more fuel convoys Thursday, leaving U.N. commanders helpless and fuming with impatience. </P>
<P> Although professional European troops form the backbone of U.N. forces in Bosnia, UNPROFOR goes to almost any lengths to avoid conflict with Mladic's ill-disciplined conscript army. </P>
<P> Akashi suggested there would be no departure from this policy over the fuel blockade when he said he would not allow media criticism to push him into using ill-considered force. </P>
<P> He told reporters in Zagreb that differences between the United Nations and NATO over air strikes in Bosnia were exaggerated. </P>
<P> ``There is divergence of views ... (but) we do not have any difference of views about the need for a proportionate, robust and effective response to challenges to the performance of our task,'' he said. </P>
<P> Akashi will meet Bosnian government leaders in Sarajevo Friday and talk to Bosnian Serb leaders Saturday. </P>
<P> U.N. sources said he would urge the Serbs to stop interfering with convoys and try to defuse tensions over the refusal of mainly-Muslim Bosnian government forces to leave a demilitarized zone (DMZ) outside Sarajevo. </P>
<P> Around 500 government soldiers are occupying the slopes of Mount Igman inside the DMZ despite a Serb ultimatum to UNPROFOR to clear it by Oct. 20. </P>
<P> The U.N. responded vigorously at first, sweeping 650 Muslims out of the zone at gun-point and destroying their bunkers. But it backed away from a confrontation with those remaining when the government refused to withdraw them. </P>
<P> UNPROFOR spokesman Tim Spicer said the stand-off ``is still giving rise to concern'' but he had no evidence the BSA was preparing to attack the mountain. </P>
