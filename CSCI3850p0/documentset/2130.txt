<P>  A deputy premier of Tajikistan, Munnavar Nazriyev, was killed by a landmine Thursday, the day a ceasefire between the government and the opposition was to come into force, the Tajik mission in Moscow said. </P>
<P> A spokesman for the mission said the landmine blew up Nazriyev's car in Tajikistan's Garm region, 140 miles east of the capital, Dushanbe. </P>
<P> The driver of the car was also killed and a guard was injured, Radio Russia said in its account of the incident. </P>
<P> There was no immediate comment from the Tajik authorities in Dushanbe linking the killing to a deliberate attack by the Afghanistan-based Tajik opposition. </P>
<P> The incident occurred on the same day a ceasefire between the government and an opposition coalition of pro-Islamist and liberals, reached in Tehran last month, was due to come into force. </P>
