<DATELINE>HANOI, Vietnam (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Dissident Vietnamese Buddhists said Thursday a Republican U.S. senator had urged Secretary of State Warren Christopher to halt normalization of ties with Vietnam until Hanoi freed two jailed monks. </P>
<P> Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch wrote to Christopher and Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet Jan. 23, the International Buddhist Information Bureau in Paris, spokesman for the banned Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV), said in a statement sent to foreign news bureaus in Hanoi. </P>
<P> It said Hatch urged Kiet to release monks Thich (Venerable) Huyen Quang and Thich Quang Do, regarded by their followers as the two top UBCV leaders in Vietnam. </P>
<P> He urged Christopher ``not to allow the process of normalization to continue until you have convinced the Hanoi authorities to release Thich Huyen Quang and Thich Quang Do and to allow the UBCV to operate freely and without intimidation,'' it added. </P>
<P> The government last week denied UBCV reports that Quang had been arrested but said he had moved to another pagoda in the southern province of Quang Ngai at the request of monks and local people ``because he has systematically created trouble.'' </P>
<P> It said Do had been arrested on charges of causing disturbances and breaking the law, but has not revealed details or announced a trial date. </P>
<P> The United States established formal relations with Vietnam last week for the first time since the Vietnam War ended in 1975 by opening a liaison office in Hanoi. Vietnam opened a liaison office in Washington Wednesday. </P>
<P> The two governments do not have full diplomatic relations, which would enable them to open embassies. But neutral diplomats here expect the liaison offices to function as embassies in all but name. </P>
<P> The Paris bureau said Hatch's letter was part of growing international concern over the reported arrests of Quang and Do in December. </P>
<P> U.S. Sens. Bob Kerrey, Charles Robb and Tom Daschle also wrote to Kiet appealing for the monks' release, it said. Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch Asia and the European Parliament have also expressed concern. </P>
<P> Hanoi and the UBCV have been in dispute for years over management of Buddhism, which 80 percent of Vietnamese follow. </P>
<P> The government says only the Vietnam Buddhist Church, founded in 1981 under the umbrella of the ruling Communist Party, has authority in Buddhist matters. </P>
<P> UBCV supporters say the UBCV, which ran Buddhist affairs in former South Vietnam and was banned after the war, is still the legitimate religious authority. </P>
<P> The U.S. State Department, in its annual review of human rights Wednesday, made relatively mild comments about Vietnam, accusing it of continued violations but adding that there were no reports of political killings or torture. </P>
<P> There was no immediate government comment on the report. </P>
