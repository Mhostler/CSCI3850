<P>  The Honduran president on Friday reassigned his economy minister, Delmer Pantig, to foreign minister, replacing a man who resigned amid a corruption scandal allegedly involving his sister. </P>
<P> Pantig replaced Ernesto Paz, who resigned after his sister, Maria de los Angeles Paz, was arrested on charges she used his influence to peddle passports to enable Hondurans to travel to the United States. </P>
<P> At a news conference on Friday, President Carlos Reina said Paz had made a personal decision to step down and would be posted as an ambassador abroad. </P>
<P> The former foreign minister had raised eyebrows by fostering closer ties with socialist Cuba and China, but officials said this played no part in his resignation. </P>
<P> Pantig said his mission as foreign minister was to build stronger commercial ties abroad. ``In that sense I have some experience and training to contribute to international policy,'' the ex-banker said. </P>
<P> It was the first change in Reina's cabinet since he took office in January 1994. He stopped short of naming a new economy minister, though press reports said the post was most likely to be filled by the deputy minister Gustavo Aguilar. </P>
