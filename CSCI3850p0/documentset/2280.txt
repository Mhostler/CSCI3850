<P>  Britain won a test case on its controversial Northern Ireland emergency legislation Friday when the European Court of Human Rights dismissed a complaint by a suspected Irish Republic Army activist alleging arbitrary detention. </P>
<P> Margaret Murray was arrested by soldiers at her Belfast home in July 1982 and questioned about contacts with two of her brothers who had been convicted in the United States of firearms offenses related to gun-running for the IRA. </P>
<P> She was held for questioning for two hours at an army screening center, refused to answer questions other than to give her name and was photographed without her knowledge. She was released without charge. </P>
<P> Murray's lawyers argued that her rights to liberty and security, to be informed promptly of the reasons for arrest and to compensation for wrongful arrest had been violated under the European Convention on Human Rights. </P>
<P> The court ruled that ``in the particular circumstances, there did exist sufficient facts or information which would provide a plausible and objective basis for a suspicion that Mrs. Murray may have committed the offense of involvement in the collection of funds for the Provisional IRA.'' </P>
<P> It also said that no government could be asked ``to establish the reasonableness of the suspicion grounding the arrest of a suspected terrorist by disclosing information or facts leading to confidential sources, thereby placing the lives and safety of others in danger.'' </P>
<P> The court also dismissed a complaint by her husband and four children that their private family life and home had been violated by the army raid to arrest Murray. </P>
<P> Britain's 1978 Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act empowered the army to arrest and detain for up to four hours a person suspected of committing a criminal offense, provided the arresting officer's suspicion was ``honestly and genuinely held.'' </P>
<P> The law has since been amended to say arrest must be based on ``reasonable suspicion.'' </P>
