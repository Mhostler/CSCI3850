<DATELINE>MOCHOVCE, Slovakia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Anti-nuclear demonstrators scaled a cooling tower of a nuclear plant being built in Slovakia and two women were slightly hurt in a clash with security staff, protest organizers said Wednesday. </P>
<P> Six climbers scaled the 390-foot tower at the plant at Mochovce and unfurled a giant banner reading ``EBRD: Stop Mochovce.'' </P>
<P> EBRD, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, is considering whether to provide funds to complete the plant. About $750 million is needed to complete two 440-megawatt reactors by 1997. </P>
<P> The head of the Bratislava office of the environmental group Greenpeace, Lubica Trubiniova, said about 80 demonstrators protested at the Mochovce plant, 60 miles east of the Slovak capital Bratislava. </P>
<P> The two women who were hurt were a Slovak and an Austrian, she said. </P>
<P> Nuclear power generates about 55 percent of Slovakia's total energy consumption, according to state-owned power distributor Slovensky Energeticky Podnik. </P>
