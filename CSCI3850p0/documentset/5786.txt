<P>  Russia said Sunday it could not stick to all the terms of a crucial conventional arms reduction treaty until the war in rebel Chechnya was over, Interfax news agency reported. </P>
<P> Defense Minister Pavel Grachev told Interfax that Moscow wanted a review of the 1990 Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty, which limits the number of troops and armor Russia can station in the volatile southern Caucasus region where Chechnya is located. </P>
<P> His comments were likely to provoke yet more gloom among Western countries which have seen their once-cordial relations with Moscow take a heavy battering since the Chechen war started last December. </P>
<P> ``The amount of arms and military equipment which the treaty allows Russia to have in this region is insufficient,'' Grachev said. </P>
<P> ``(Our) foreign and defense ministries are therefore explaining to our Western partners the importance Russia places on revising the treaty.'' </P>
<P> Russia has been pressing for some time for the CFE treaty to be altered, saying the Soviet Union's collapse and subsequent local wars had made the document outdated. </P>
<P> Grachev said last week that Moscow might stop complying with CFE if NATO rapidly expanded its membership to East European countries. </P>
<P> But his latest comments were the clearest sign yet of the Kremlin's determination to change the treaty. </P>
<P> ``Only when conditions are stable can Russia fulfil all the conditions in the CFE treaty,'' he said. ``After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia, as the successor state, cannot accept all (CFE's) limitations on its flanks.'' </P>
<P> Grachev said there were several ways in which Russia could circumvent the decree, for example by reallocating parts of its armor to Interior Ministry forces. </P>
<P> ``But we will try to persuade our Western partners that the leaders of the former Soviet Union made a mistake when they agreed to sign this document,'' he said. </P>
<P> The CFE treaty, which includes 30 nations and covers an area from the Atlantic to the Urals, provides for the biggest cuts of conventional weapons in arms control history and fixes the distribution of troops and armour. </P>
<P> Russia says that after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the distribution of forces should be changed to allow Moscow to station more men and armor in its volatile southern regions. </P>
<P> The West, fearing the possible breakdown of the security arrangements it spent so long setting up, rejects the idea. </P>
<P> Last week Germany told Russia it would jeopardize its ties with the West if it disregarded the treaty. </P>
<P> ``The Russians must understand: if they get serious with such threats, this means the end of cooperation to date with the West in other areas as well,'' German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel told Spiegel magazine. </P>
