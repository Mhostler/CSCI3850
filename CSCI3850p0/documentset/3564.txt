<P>  Britain will close down a specialist police war crimes unit which has not brought a single case to court since it was established by a controversial law in 1991, the Daily Telegraph reported Wednesday. </P>
<P> No one has been tried so far under the law, and the three cases currently under consideration look unlikely to reach court, the newspaper reported. </P>
<P> The legislation, allowing prosecutions of people who were not British citizens when they committed offenses, was rejected by parliament's upper House of Lords and only became law after the government used a seldom-invoked act to force it through. </P>
<P> Its opponents questioned whether it was possible for a conviction to be based on identification of someone almost 50 years after events that took place during World War II. </P>
<P> The Telegraph endorsed the decision to close the unit next March, saying it had already cost $7.8 million without producing results. </P>
<P> ``To devote millions to war crimes investigations that have such scant prospects of success is not only futile, but profligate,'' it said. </P>
