<P>  The Chinese scientist who says he has discovered DNA in sticky pulp from a 65-million-year-old fossilized dinosaur egg said Saturday the find opened a gate for man's research into the past. </P>
<P> Speaking for the first time since China this week announced his find, molecular biologist Chen Zhangliang told Reuters he believed the discovery had the potential not only to unlock the mystery of the disappearance of dinosaurs but also to clone a gene. </P>
<P> ``This opens a gate for modern biologists, archeologists and paleontologists to carefully study ancient life,'' said Chen, a 34-year-old graduate of Washington University in the United States and head of the college of life sciences at prestigious Beijing University. </P>
<P> ``We could open the genetic secret to understanding ancient life ... how dinosaurs lived and survived,'' he added during an interview in his laboratory. </P>
<P> However, he said longer strands of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) or complete dinosaur cells would have to be found before he could add fact to the fictional hit movie ``Jurassic Park,'' in which dinosaurs were brought back to life. </P>
<P> ``This is absolutely different from 'Jurassic Park,''' he said. ``Baby dinosaurs are not going to be running down Tiananmen Square.'' </P>
<P> In U.S. director Steven Spielberg's thriller ``Jurassic Park,'' dinosaurs were brought back to life by cloning a sample of DNA. </P>
<P> Chen said he only decided to go public with the breakthrough research after three months of tests, many of them through the Internet worldwide computer link, and after repeating all the tests to ensure the DNA was really that of a dinosaur and not some outside intruder. </P>
<P> ``We had to be sure ... or I would be killed,'' he laughed. ``Anyone will say this egg is 65 million years old how do you know it has not been contaminated?'' </P>
<P> The tests had ruled out the possibility that the DNA could have come from ancient or modern bacteria or fungus, from other vertebrates or from humans who had handled the egg after it was found, he said. </P>
<P> The egg in question was found by fossil collector Li Guanglin in Henan province in central China, where thousands of dinosaur nests have been unearthed since 1993, said geologist Zhang Yun who extracted the gene material from the egg. </P>
<P> Li dropped the egg in late 1993 and it split open to reveal a softish center, prompting the puzzled collector to approach the government, who brought in Zhang Yun. </P>
<P> Zhang said he obtained 90 mg (0.003 of an ounce) of spongy cotton wool-like material from the egg, and after burning a small part established that the matter was organic. </P>
<P> ``This was very unique,'' said Zhang, who checked 5,000 eggs. After analysis showed presence of amino acids, he called in Chen's molecular biology skills. </P>
<P> Beijing University decided finally to unveil its findings because of fears the news would leak out and because the scientists believed it was time to bring international expertise into furthering the next stage of their research. </P>
