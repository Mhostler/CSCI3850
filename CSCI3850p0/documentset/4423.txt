<P>  The president of Chechnya, driven into hiding by Russia's assault on the breakaway republic, said in an interview published Saturday that bands of Chechen guerrillas are preparing counterattacks against military targets in Russian cities. </P>
<P> ``We are giving notice: In the spring and summer, the war moves to Russian territory,'' Gen. Dzhokar M. Dudayev told the Los Angeles Times. </P>
<P> In a story written from the town of Stary Atagi and reported to have resulted from an interview at the home of a supporter, Dudayev listed targeted areas across the Chechen border in southern Russia. </P>
<P> ``There's Stavropol, there's the Krasnodar region and the cities there; there's Mineralniye Vody, Sochi, Kislovodsk, Pyatigorsk, Astrakhan. Our quick, maneuverable groups will quietly move in,'' he was quoted as saying. </P>
<P> Dudayev insisted that the small attack groups would not target civilians and cannot be described as terrorists. </P>
<P> ``We have in our hands a weapon more powerful than terrorism,'' he told the Times. ``We are a state based on law. If there are pretensions against our statehood, we are prepared to discuss them, at the United Nations, or at the negotiating table with Russian.'' </P>
<P> He described Russia's bombing of Chechnya, which began about two months ago and has caused the deaths of thousands of civilians, as a terorist act condoned by the world. ``Russia is destroying us, and it's called simply aggression,'' he said. ''But if we answer in kind on Russia's territory, that's what, terrorism?'' </P>
<P> Dudayev said that Chechnya's regular army is unlikely to be reinforced by guerrillas from sympathetic Muslim countries of the Middle East, saying, ``Russian ideologues have created that myth in people's heads.'' </P>
<P> Dudayev -- a former Soviet air force bomber pilot -- estimated that 27,000 Chechen civilians out of a population of about one million have been killed since about 40,000 Russian troops entered Chechnya Dec. 11. </P>
<P> He said that about 340 Chechen fighters have been killed and 400 wounded but claimed that the Russians had suffered 18,000 military casualties. The Russian government has painted a much more favorable picture for its own forces. </P>
<P> A team of Chechen lawyers is preparing a Nuremberg-style indictment for war crimes against Russia, Dudayev told the newspaper. </P>
<P> Russian and Chechen negotiators agreed Friday to extend a shaky two-day-old cease-fire until Sunday. Dudayev said he authorized the talks but that he doubted Russia was interested in a political settlement. </P>
<P> Even after his forces were bombed out of his presidential palace, Dudayev spoke confidently. </P>
<P> ``Now in Grozny ... there are small (Chechen) groups,'' he was quoted as saying. ``Hundreds of groups of three, five, seven, 10 men -- maneuverable, fast, mobile, that are spread around the Russian forces and beat at them every day and every night,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``In the spring and summer, when it will be possible to sleep outdoors, that will be for us a hunt,'' he was reported to have said, rubbing his hands together. ``Not one Russian will emerge alive.'' </P>
