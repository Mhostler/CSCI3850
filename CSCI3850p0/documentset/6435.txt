<P>  An aide to PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat welcomed Wednesday U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's opposition to a bill before Congress to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. </P>
<P> ``Christopher's statement on Jerusalem is encouraging. It helps the peace process,'' said Nabil Abu Rdainah. </P>
<P> Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole introduced legislation Tuesday setting a timetable for moving the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem by 1999. </P>
<P> Christopher quickly denounced Dole's move as ``ill-advised and damaging'' to Middle East peace negotiations. </P>
<P> Although Israel's declared capital is Jerusalem, the United States and most other countries maintain their embassies in Tel Aviv on the grounds that Jerusalem's final status has yet to be determined in peace negotiations. </P>
<P> Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and proclaimed the whole city as its capital. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state. </P>
<P> A PLO official said Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres telephoned Arafat Tuesday to wish him well on the Muslim Eid al-Adha holiday. The official said the two might meet soon. </P>
