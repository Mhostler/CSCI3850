<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Senate easily approved compromise legislation Wednesday to curb Washington's habit of imposing expensive programs on states without providing the money to pay for them. </P>
<P> The measure, approved by the Senate on a 91-9 vote, is expected to pass the House soon as part of the Republican majority's Contract with America. It will then go to the White House, where President Clinton will sign it into law. </P>
<P> States and local governments have pleaded for years for some relief from the billions of dollars they must pay to implement regulations and carry out programs forced upon them by Washington. </P>
<P> The legislation requires Congress to pay for any unfunded mandates included in legislation it considers after Jan. 1, 1996, that are expected to cost more than $50 million. </P>
<P> If it does not provide state and local governments the money to carry out its dictates, Congress has 60 days to decide whether to keep, terminate or change the mandate. After that time, if no money is appropriated, states can ignore the mandate. </P>
<P> Federal agencies will be required to analyze the impact on private comapanies if the mandate is expected to cost more than $100 million. The government will not be required to pick up the cost of mandates on industry. </P>
