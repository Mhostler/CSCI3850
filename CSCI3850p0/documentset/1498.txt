<P>  Iran protested to China over the killing Tuesday of an Iranian diplomat and his son during a shootout between police and a gunman in Beijing, an Iranian official said. </P>
<P> ``The Chinese charge d'affaires was invited to the Foreign Ministry where Iran's concern and protest were relayed and the Chinese government was asked to inflict maximum punishment on the perpetrators as soon as possible,'' Deputy Foreign Minister Alaeddin Boroujerdi told Tehran Radio. </P>
<P> A soldier trying to hijack a jeep to Beijing's Tiananmen Square opened fire in rush-hour traffic, triggering a gunbattle with police which killed eight people, including Iranian diplomat Yousef Mohammadi Pishknari and his 10-year-old son. </P>
<P> An elder son and a daughter were wounded. A second daughter escaped unhurt. </P>
<P> Boroujerdi said Mohammadi Pishknari, who was taking his children to school when he was shot, was deputy head of the Iranian embassy's consular section. </P>
<P> He said the Foreign Ministry was sending a delegation to China to follow up the case. </P>
<P> Boroujerdi, a former ambassador to Beijing, said Iran was confident that China would punish any culprits in the ``very regretable incident'' in view of its good relations with Iran. </P>
