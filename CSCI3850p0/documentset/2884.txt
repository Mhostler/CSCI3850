<DATELINE>HANOI, Vietnam (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Ground was broken Tuesday for a $60 million tower hotel complex on the site of Hanoi's infamous central prison -- remembered by U.S. prisoners of war as the ``Hanoi Hilton'' and known to Vietnamese as ``the furnace.'' </P>
<P> ``I want to make it a landmark for the city of Hanoi,'' said Doreen Goh Poh Joo, chairman and managing director of Singapore's Burton Engineering. </P>
<P> The prison site was a beautiful square plot of land in the heart of the city, and ``I thought I would like to transform it into two beautiful towers,'' she added. </P>
<P> Contractors broke through one of the thick, yellow ochre walls last weekend, creating a site entrance and ending a century of history. </P>
<P> Communist Party chief Do Muoi, 77, was one of thousands of Vietnamese revolutionaries jailed in Hoa Lo under French colonial rule which ended in 1954. </P>
<P> Prisoners went naked because it was so hot -- hence its name Hoa Lo (or furnace). It was so crowded that they slept in shifts. </P>
<P> Dozens of captured U.S. pilots and soldiers held there during the Vietnam War gave it the ``Hanoi Hilton'' nickname in a wry comment on the facilities. </P>
<P> It took Burton, a subsidiary of Liang Court Holdings, 21 months to get permission to knock down the prison after old Vietnamese revolutionaries objected. </P>
<P> ``We did initially have a lot of problems getting a license to demolish because there were a lot of sentimental feelings among the old people of this country,'' Goh said. </P>
<P> The company modified the project to incorporate a museum honoring the prison's role under French colonial rule and paid at least $1.5 million to help Vietnam build a new prison on the city's outskirts, to which prisoners were moved last March. </P>
<P> Burton said the ``Hanoi Towers,'' containing 204 hotel apartments, office space, shops and a convention center, would be completed in mid-1997. </P>
<P> It is one of seven hotel complexes for which ground has been broken in Hanoi, which is severely short of high-quality office and residential space. </P>
<P> Foreign companies and embassies have rushed in to do business since Vietnam opened up its economy in the late 1980s and the United States lifted an economic embargo last February. </P>
<P> Dr. Nguyen Mai, deputy chairman of the investment watchdog State Committee for Cooperation and Investment, said he hoped the Hanoi Towers would not go the way of some other projects by breaking ground but not starting construction on schedule. </P>
<P> It is Liang Court's second project in Hanoi following an apartment complex on the picturesque West Lake. </P>
<P> Singaporean Ambassador Toh Hock Ghim said leading Singapore investors had invested a total of more than $600 million in Vietnam. ``Singapore is committed to promoting a greater flow of our investments to Vietnam,'' he said. </P>
