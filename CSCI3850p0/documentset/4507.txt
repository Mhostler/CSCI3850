<P>  Don't tell your doctor you think you have the ``yuppie flu,'' at least if you don't want to be treated for it, British doctors said Thursday. </P>
<P> They reported in the British Medical Journal that doctors they studied were reluctant to treat patients who said they thought they had myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), commonly known as yuppie flu because it often affects young professionals. </P>
<P> Dr. Anthony Pelosi and colleagues at Hairmyres Hospital in Glasgow, Scotland, randomly chose 200 general practitioners and presented them with descriptions of four patients, all of whom described general malaise, abdominal pains, insomnia and a tendency to cry for no reason -- common symptoms of ME. </P>
<P> One was a personnel officer who said she had read about ME and thought that was her problem, the second was the same personnel officer, who made no mention of ME, the third was an office cleaner who again mentioned ME and the fourth the office cleaner with no mention of ``yuppie flu.'' </P>
<P> ``Doctors were more likely to refer the personnel officer than the office cleaner for counseling. This supports previous findings on the social class of people receiving psychological treatment,'' Pelosi wrote. </P>
<P> But those who said they thought they had ME were likely to be dismissed, or sent to a second doctor. </P>
<P> ``Self-diagnosis led general practitioners to consider the patient less likely to comply with treatment, more likely to pose difficult management problems, and more likely to take up a lot of time,'' the Scottish doctors concluded. </P>
<P> ``Our results suggest it is not in patients' interest to suggest to doctors that they may have myalgic encephalomyelitis. Because of media interest, self-diagnosis of ME will continue, and doctors should remind themselves that resulting attitudes could lead to ... resentment, and perhaps even unnecessarily prolonged disability.'' </P>
