<DATELINE>ZAGREB, Croatia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The first U.N. humanitarian convoy in a month reached the surrounded Bosnian Muslim enclave of Bihac Friday for only the second time in more than two months, a U.N. spokesman said. </P>
<P> ``The convoy just reached the enclave,'' Peter Kessler of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) told Reuters. </P>
<P> ``It is (only) ... the 14th in six-and-a-half months due to a cynical Croatian Serb game to prevent food from reaching 180,000 people in Bihac pocket,'' Kessler said. </P>
<P> Only two U.N. food convoys have made it into the enclave since Oct. 1. </P>
<P> The 10 trucks laden with 106 tons of emergency food stocks were held up for more than one day for an exhaustive search, which U.N. officials described as harassment, before being allowed to resume their journey Thursday. </P>
<P> Kessler said the agency managed to cover only 10 percent of the December needs of the mainly Muslim population in Bihac pocket, under attack by allied Bosnian and Croat Serb and rebel Muslim forces. </P>
<P> He accused Serbs of deliberate obstruction of the humanitarian aid operation in the area. ``They obstruct deliveries, while permitting enough traffic in to avoid international condemnation,'' Kessler said. </P>
<P> Krajina Serbs have let only 14 of 155 U.N. food and other aid convoys pass through since June. U.N. officials say hunger threatens Bihac's 180,000 people with the Balkan winter starting to bite. </P>
<P> In a related development, Kessler said the humanitarian airlift for the besieged Bosnian capital Sarajevo will not resume at least until next week despite Bosnian Serb assurances that its airport is ``safe and open.'' </P>
<P> He said the countries that contribute planes for the operation will meet next week to decide whether it is safe to resume relief flights to Sarajevo. </P>
<P> The U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) said it plans to resume its flights Saturday to test the Serbs' commitment to their latest six-point peace offer. </P>
<P> Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said his side was already implementing almost all the proposals he has put forward in a plan to end the war, including the reopening of the Sarajevo airport. </P>
<P> ``We have announced the airport is safe and open,'' Karadzic said Friday. </P>
<P> But before UNHCR restarts the humanitarian lifeline to the city, closed since Nov. 21 and on-and-off for months, donor countries will have to make sure Karadzic means what he said. </P>
