<P>  Tomas Fogdoe's career as a top skier appears to be over following a training accident that left him partially paralyzed, the Swedish news agency TT quoted his doctor as saying Monday. </P>
<P> Olle Andren, head doctor at the University Hospital of Umea, in northern Sweden, said Fogdoe could recover some use of his legs but would have to ``get used to a different way of life.'' </P>
<P> Fogdoe, World Cup slalom champion in 1993, was training with the rest of the Swedish downhill team last week at Are -- 200 miles from Umea -- when he skied into a wood and apparently crashed into a tree. </P>
<P> ``Fogdoe has suffered serious partial paralysis. He will be able to recover partially as a result of physiotherapy and partially with drugs,'' Andren was quoted as saying. </P>
<P> ``At the moment he is in a wheelchair and he will probably have to get used to a different way of life in the future.'' </P>
<P> Swedish team doctor Goran Skog said the crash compacted vertebrae in the middle section of Fogdoe's spine. During an operation early Wednesday screws were inserted to re-position the affected vertebrae. </P>
