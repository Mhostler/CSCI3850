<P>  Author William Trevor has won Britain's prestigious Whitbread Book of the Year prize for his novel ``Felicia's Journey'' -- his third Whitbread award. </P>
<P> The Irish-born Trevor, 66, won $33,600 with the prize. </P>
<P> ``There seems to be no good reason why I should have won,'' Trevor told a dinner held to celebrate the awards. </P>
<P> Bill Kalloway, director of the Whitbread Literary Awards, said there was a ``lively discussion'' among the judges to pick the winner from a shortlist of five titles, which had won $3,200 each in their individual categories. </P>
<P> They included ``The Married Man: A Life of D.H. Lawrence'' by Brenda Maddox, ``Gold Dust'' by Geraldine McCaughrean, ``The Longest Memory'' by Fred D'Aguiar and ``Out of Danger'' by James Fenton. </P>
