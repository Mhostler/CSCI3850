<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Hundreds of thousands of North Koreans watched the nation's elite take turns to honor Kim Jong-il as de facto leader Wednesday -- confirming the line of succession devised by his late father, ``Great Leader'' Kim Il-sung. </P>
<P> In a huge rally led by Kim Jong-il at Kim Il-sung Square in the heart of Pyongyang, speakers swore allegiance one after another while paying tribute to the Stalinist president who died July 8. </P>
<P> Analysts said the unanimous show of support ensured the world's first dynastic communist succession, although secretive North Korea has given no sign of when Kim junior would officially be rubber-stamped into the top posts. </P>
<P> ``Standing at the head of our revolution today is comrade Kim Jong-il, supreme commander of the revolutionary armed forces,'' Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam said in a speech to the rally. </P>
<P> ``With him at the center, our party members will follow his leadership,'' said Kim, also a member of the powerful political bureau of the communist party's central committee. </P>
<P> Deputy Defense Minister Kim Kwang-jin cast the solid weight of the 1.1-million military powerhouse behind the ``Dear Leader,'' who stood grimly at the center of the honor podium. </P>
<P> ``Our soldiers will follow the will of the Great Leader and will support Kim Jong-il as the head of the nation, the party and the people,'' Kim said. </P>
<P> In an unusual move, North Korea's state television relayed live its broadcast of the rally to Western networks. Analysts in Seoul say the move was aimed at signaling the opening of the Kim Jong-il era. </P>
<P> They said the first signs were that Kim junior would follow the same diplomatic policies as his father, including tentative approaches to the United States and South Korea to ease nuclear tensions and start a post-Cold War dialogue. </P>
<P> ``North Korea probably wanted to tell the world that the new leadership of Kim Jong-il has been launched in a stable manner,'' said Kim Chang-soon, head of the Seoul-based Institute of North Korean Studies. </P>
<P> Wednesday's solemn rally was in marked contrast to Tuesday's funeral, when weeping citizens paid an emotional farewell to the only ruler they had ever known. </P>
<P> Apart from those in military uniform at the rally , men wore simple black tunics while women wore black skirts and white tops. All stood to attention throughout the 75-minute rite, which ended with a cannonade and a military band playing the Internationale, the anthem of socialism. </P>
<P> Despite the oaths of allegiance, Kim Jong-il has yet to be officially confirmed in the posts his father held -- state president, general secretary of the communist party and chairman of the party's central military commission. </P>
<P> Kim Jong-il, dressed in a simple dark tunic, was flanked during the rally by Defense Minister O Jin-u and Prime Minister Kang Song-san, ranked second and third after Kim junior in the communist party. </P>
<P> North Korean television showed people observing a three-minute silence at midday Wednesday. Factories, trains and ships sounded horns or sirens. </P>
<P> Across the tense border in South Korea, officials resumed the drive to end the North's suspected nuclear weapons program. </P>
<P> Washington's chief negotiator on North Korea. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci, opened talks with South Korean officials Thursday to plan their approach to the communist state's new leadership, a foreign ministry official said Thursday. </P>
<P> South Korean officials said one of the most important issues on Gallucci's agenda would be the possibility of the West offering to help convert North Korea's graphite atomic reactors to safer light-water systems. </P>
<P> The reactor issue is expected to be discussed extensively during high-level talks between the United States and North Korea in Geneva, at which Gallucci is chief delegate. Discussions were suspended because of the death of Kim Il-sung. </P>
<P> On his arrival Wednesday, Gallucci told reporters he hoped North Korea's stand would remain unchanged from the last few weeks of Kim Il-sung's life. Before he died, Kim Il-sung pledged to suspend the refueling of a key nuclear reactor pending the Geneva talks. </P>
<P> Washington said it planned to contact North Korea after Kim's funeral to arrange a resumption of the talks. </P>
<P> South Korea geared up its propaganda offensive against the North on Wednesday after cooling the war of words following Kim's death. </P>
<P> The foreign ministry released documents which it received from Russia last month, confirming the widely held view that North Korea started the 1950-53 Korean War. </P>
<P> Pyongyang asserts that South Korea invaded the North in cooperation with the United States. </P>
