<DATELINE>CAP HAITIEN, Haiti (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P> By David Lawsky  U.S. Marines unloading masses of materiel here Saturday were warmly received by crowds of joyful Haitians but some people were wondering how long the goodwill would last. </P>
<P> Several Haitians interviewed here in this north coast port city, occupied by the Marines since Monday, said they had eaten nothing for two days except mangoes and had only drunk water. </P>
<P> That concerns Marines who are watching the Haitians from the other side of the concertina wire surrounding their operations. They say they fear that eventually the people will turn against the United States. </P>
<P> ``I hope this time we deliver,'' said a young Marine. </P>
<P> Non-governmental organizations are said by U.S. officials here to be readying food deliveries to start at some time in the future that includes beans, baby food and rice. </P>
<P> On Wednesday, President Clinton announced that the U.S. Agency for International Development would begin providing 1.3 million meals a day to needy Haitians, up from the 1 million a day it has been serving. </P>
<P> But many people are still going hungry. </P>
<P> With all the preparations being made for the longer-term encampment of the U.S. Army, and the Air Force at the airport, no one has yet delivered any of the food that is eventually supposed to be part of the plan. </P>
<P> While there appears to be recognition that the Americans are up against a tough task, some people are questioning how long the festive atmosphere can last without concrete help from the United States -- food, restoration of the city's broken electric and water systems and the creation of jobs. </P>
<P> At this point, the U.S. military's ability to facilitate free speech has apparently been enough. At one of the daily demonstrations to support the return of exiled President Jean Bertrand Aristide, a young man credited U.S. troops with making possible the president's return, set for October 15. </P>
<P> He also gave the troops credit for his right to demonstrate. Earlier this week the Marines issued a warning to the Haitian police not to create violence, and forced them to stop beating people at demonstrations. </P>
<P> ``This is our victory,'' the young man said while the demonstrators danced down the street waving green tree branches above their heads, dipping and rising to illustrate the song they sang about Aristide's return. </P>
<P> The demonstration was downtown, only a block or two from the docks where hundreds of others gathered at rolls of concertina wire to look at the show of American force. </P>
<P> The spectacle of the uniformed men unloading massive amounts of military equipment and materiel has become a major draw, attracting hundreds of people to the port to watch helicopters, ships and small vessels bringing in equipment. </P>
<P> At the dock, one helicopter after another buzzed in, each stopping only long enough to deposit cargo hanging from a long cable protruding from its belly, a process that took minutes. </P>
<P> On the dock, a nearly 700-foot (220 metres) roll-on, roll-off ship unloaded ammunition, trucks, cranes, coastal patrol boats and other items. </P>
<P> ``We have never seen anything like this before,'' said one Haitian man. </P>
<P> Another spectator in the crowd at the docks responded with irony when asked what he wanted for his country, ``Only a few little things, like electricity, schools and a water system.'' </P>
<P> The Marines were even welcomed by some businessmen, historically not friendly to Aristide's populist government, have joined in the cheers. </P>
<P> Two businessmen said they were happy to see the Americans. One man, who asked not to be named, said his commodities trade had suffered from the embargo prior to the U.S. landing and he hoped that the American presence would end it. </P>
