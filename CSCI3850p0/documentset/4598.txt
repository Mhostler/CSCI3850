<P>  Negotiations in the Major League Baseball strike were scheduled to resume Monday with the owners' lead negotiator saying a deal must be reached within a week for the season to start on time with regular players. </P>
<P> Boston Red Sox owner John Harrington said a deal must be reached by March 5 in order for teams to have enough time to prepare the striking major leaguers for the regular season, which begins April 2. </P>
<P> Meanwhile, teams were getting ready for this week's start of spring training games with squads of specially recruited replacement players, who will man the regular season rosters if no settlement is reached, and minor leaguers. </P>
<P> Participation of minor leaguers has become another hot topic in the labor dispute. Friday, team general managers blasted the Players' Association position that minor leaguers involved in spring games would be considered strike-breakers. </P>
<P> Frustrations bubbled to the surface Sunday in the New York Mets' camp in Port St Lucie, Fla., where manager Dallas Green railed against the leadership of players' union chief Don Fehr and his assistant Gene Orza. </P>
<P> ``I'd like to grab Don Fehr by the throat,'' Green said. ''And his buddy, Gene Orza, along with him.'' </P>
<P> The union, meanwhile, was quiet about a questionable arrangement struck by New York Yankee pitcher Steve Howe, who through the strike was in danger of violating his probation for a drug conviction in 1992. </P>
<P> Howe is required to maintain steady employment, and the Yankees accomodated him by giving the 36-year-old lefty reliever a job in their ticket office. </P>
<P> The tussle over allegiances of minor leaguers, who might lend credibility to spring training games, was a key battle ground over the weekend. </P>
<P> Major League Baseball's Operating Committee and all 28 general managers issued a release asking all minor leaguers not on the 40-man rosters to play in exhibition games. It said minor leaguers who refused to participate could be sent home. </P>
<P> The Chicago White Sox Sunday sent home minor league pitcher Barry Johnson after he said he would not participate in spring training games. Johnson pitched for Birmingham of the Double-A Southern League last season. </P>
<P> Ten minor leaguers walked off the Texas Rangers' practice field Saturday in Port Charlotte, Fla., protesting plans to use them in exhibition games. </P>
