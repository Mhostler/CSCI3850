<DATELINE>MANILA, May 8 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Twenty-seven people died in mortar attacks and ambushes as one of Asia's most turbulent democracies voted on Monday to elect a new Congress and cast its mid-term verdict on President Fidel Ramos. </P>
<P> And more than 40 people were wounded as political passions erupted into violence in a country where political office is viewed as a passport to wealth and power. </P>
<P> In the bloodiest incident, six people were killed and 17 wounded when suspected Moslem guerrillas backing a mayoral candidate in southern Maguindanao province shelled Maganoy an hour before voting was to begin, police said. </P>
<P> Ten mortar bombs hit the town, forcing more than 600 people to flee. The army rushed in to restore the peace. </P>
<P> Reinforcements were also flown to Talipao in the Sulu Islands farther south after 200 armed followers of a Moslem mayoral candidate barricaded the town hall to prevent voting, the military said. </P>
<P> Five marines escorting poll officials to distribute ballot boxes in Talipao were wounded in a mortar attack, it said. </P>
<P> The latest casualties brought to almost 60 the total of deaths since campaigning for the congressional and local positions began, police and election officials said. They included two candidates for mayor and eight running for councils. </P>
<P> Thirteen of the latest deaths occurred on election eve but were not reported until Monday. Most of the violence was the result of intense rivalries and occurred in 21 of the country's 76 provinces. Voting in the other areas was generally peaceful, the Commission on Elections said. </P>
<P> Executive Director Resurreccion Borra said security forces could not be blamed for failing to curb the violence. </P>
<P> ``They cannot totally control the behaviour of the citizens,'' he said. ``(The killers) ... don't usually ask for the permission of the police to kill their enemies. The police cannot divine the pent-up emotions of those who want to kill each other.'' </P>
<P> Election officials reported rampant vote-buying, with the going rate at 200 to 300 pesos ($8 to $12) in some Manila districts. In one southern district, voters were being bribed with fake 500 peso notes, television reports said. </P>
<P> Violence and cheating are traditional accompaniments to Philippine elections, usually characterised as being centred on ``guns, goons and gold.'' </P>
<P> Officials reported a heavy turnout all over the country. Thirty-six million of the Philippines' 65 million people are registered voters. </P>
<P> ``Today is an opportunity for the 36 million Filipinos to make sure democracy will flourish in our country,'' Ramos told reporters after voting in his northern home town of Asingan. </P>
<P> Ramos, who has called the polls a referendum on his rule, said the polls would ensure economic stability and progress. </P>
<P> Surveys and analysts say Ramos's coalition is likely to win a majority of the 12 seats at stake in the 24-member Senate. About 17,000 local positions are also up for grabs as are all 204 elected seats in the House of Representatives. </P>
<P> The widow of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, Imelda, and his son, Ferdinand, Jr., known as Bongbong, are standing in the elections, Imelda Marcos for a congressional seat in her native Leyte province and her son for the Senate. Opinion polls give both a chance of winning. </P>
<P> Mrs Marcos said her victory would be ``a vindication'' of the Marcos family, accused of looting the economy during their rule. ``Any mandate from the people is the voice of God,'' she said. </P>
