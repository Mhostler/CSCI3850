<P>  President Clinton caught a bit of the Christmas spirit Wednesday as he lighted the national Christmas tree, sang Christmas carols with Aretha Franklin and said Americans should ``treat all people with love.'' </P>
<P> The president, finishing a year that gave him a fair share of political hard times, declared it was time to remember the most important things -- family, community and country. </P>
<P> ``As we celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ, the prince of peace, let us not forget his lesson,'' the president told a crowd of 5,000 gathered for the annual tree-lighting ceremony on the Washington Ellipse just south of the White House. </P>
<P> ``One day we will be asked whether we lived out his love in ways that treated all of our brothers and sisters as we would have treated him, even the least of them. He taught us all to seek peace, and to treat all people with love,'' Clinton said. </P>
<P> ``This is a time to rededicate ourselves to the things which matter most -- our responsibility to our families, our community and our country,'' the president said. </P>
<P> With the help of seven children from a Washington homeless shelter, Clinton threw the switch that lighted the spectacular 40-foot tree, a live Colorado blue spruce decorated with red, white and blue lights. </P>
<P> Then the president, his wife Hillary Rodham Clinton and their daughter, Chelsea, joined singer Aretha Franklin and others on stage in singing ``Jingle Bells,'' ``Silent Night'' and ``We Wish You a Merry Christmas.'' </P>
<P> Franklin, wearing a bright red dress, had entertained the crowd earlier by singing a soul version of ``O Tannenbaum'' in both English and German. The master of ceremonies was Santa Claus, played by Williard Scott of NBC's ``Today'' show. </P>
<P> Every U.S. president since Calvin Coolidge, in 1923, has lighted a national Christmas tree outside the White House. </P>
