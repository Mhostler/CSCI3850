<P>  A British man who alleges he was scarred for life when a McDonald's apple pie squirted blistering hot filling onto his arm said Thursday he was suing the fast food chain. </P>
<P> Darren Miles told the Sun newspaper that steaming apple filling shot out onto his arm as he bit into the pie. </P>
<P> ``The filling was like napalm -- worse than any burn I've had from soldering in my work,'' the 28-year-old electrical engineer told the Sun. </P>
<P> ``We will be suing McDonald's for breach of contract and compensation,'' Miles's lawyer Aftab Ahmed said. ``This will be a test case in the U.K.'' </P>
<P> Miles, of Weybridge in southern England, said he had taken his five-year-old daughter to the fast-food restaurant and was horrified at the thought that she could have been hurt. </P>
<P> A spokesman for McDonald's Corp. said the company was investigating the complaint. </P>
<P> Late last year McDonald's said it had reached an out-of-court settlement with an elderly U.S. woman for an undisclosed sum after she spilled boiling hot coffee onto her lap at a drive-thru window and was badly burned. </P>
<P> A jury had earlier awarded 82-year-old Stella Liebeck of Albuquerque, N.M., $2.7 million in punitive damages and $40,000 in compensatory damages. Jurors said they wanted to send a message to McDonald's and other fast-food restaurants. </P>
