<P>  Denmark said Iran's visiting vice foreign minister made clear Tuesday that Tehran would not send assassins to carry out the death edict against British author Salman Rushdie. </P>
<P> Iran has repeatedly said the edict is a purely religious matter, unrelated to the Iranian government. Top Iranian leaders have said the government would not actively pursue Rushdie. </P>
<P> After meeting Iran's Mahmoud Vaezi in Copenhagen, Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Peterson said: ``I understood from what he was saying that the Iranian government would not take part in executing the edict.'' </P>
<P> ``This is of course not good enough but I do consider it a positive signal,'' Petersen said, adding that Vice Foreign Minister Vaezi described the edict as a ``religious decision.'' </P>
<P> Vaezi told reporters the Rushdie issue was one of many which they had discussed. He declined to comment further. </P>
<P> Rushdie was condemned to death in a ``fatwa,'' or religious edict, issued in 1989 by the late Iranian spiritual leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who said the Indian-born Rushdie's novel ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemed Islam. </P>
<P> Iranian groups have promised multi-million-dollar rewards to anyone who kills Rushdie, who was born a Muslim and has been in hiding under British police protection for six years. </P>
<P> Iranian leaders say they are powerless to withdraw the death edict because of its religious nature. </P>
<P> Scandinavian supporters of Rushdie have been outraged by Vaezi's two-day visit to Denmark. The Danish parliament's foreign policy committee called off a meeting with the Iranian vice foreign minister which had been scheduled for Tuesday. </P>
<P> Vaezi was originally due to make a tour of Nordic countries. </P>
<P> But Sweden and Iran agreed last week to cancel Vaezi's visit, scheduled for Feb. 7-8. The two countries declined to say why the trip was cancelled. </P>
<P> Relations between Norway and Iran have deteriorated sharply over Rushdie, whose Norwegian publisher William Nygaard was shot and seriously wounded in Oslo in 1993. </P>
