<DATELINE>WICHITA, Kan.(Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  U.S. prosecutors Wednesday formally charged a second man, Terry Nichols, with the Oklahoma City bombing in which 166 people died. </P>
<P> Nichols, 40, was named in a charge identical to that already lodged against his Army buddy Timothy McVeigh, the prime bombing suspect -- maliciously damaging and destroying government property with fire and explosives. </P>
<P> Nichols, who surrendered in Kansas shortly after the bombing, agreed in an appearance before a federal magistrate to be transferred to Oklahoma where McVeigh is being held. </P>
<P> U.S. Attorney Randall Rathbun said evidence had mounted against the one-time Michigan farmer in the time since the April 19 truck bombing. </P>
<P> But the affadavit detailing evidence remained sealed and no details were released. </P>
<P> David Phillips, one of two public defenders assigned to Nichols, told reporters the evidence against his client is entirely circumstantial. </P>
<P> ``I haven't heard anything that says Terry Nichols is involved in the Oklahoma City bombing,'' Phillips said. </P>
<P> He said Nichols was very upset that he had been charged but at the same time relieved that some of the uncertainty facing him had been removed. </P>
<P> Nichols gave only yes and no answers to questions put to him in court. He waived his right to a preliminary hearing and other procedures in Kansas and agreed to face those in Oklahoma. </P>
<P> Prosecutors said they expected him to arrive in Oklahoma by the end of Wednesday. </P>
<P> FBI agents have documented frequent contacts between McVeigh, an embittered 27-year-old Gulf War veteran, and Nichols, who lived in Herington, Kan., in the days before the blast. </P>
<P> At the Nichols home in Kansas they also found empty bags of ammonium nitrate fertilizer, a key ingredient in the bombing, and blue plastic drums of the type believed to have been used to store the explosives in the truck, government sources said. </P>
<P> Nichols and his brother James, who owns a farm in Michigan, have ties to the paramilitary, anti-tax and anti-government militia movement. </P>
<P> James Nichols has been in custody in Michigan since two days after the bombing, charged with explosives and weapons violations not directly related to the Olkahoma City bombing. </P>
