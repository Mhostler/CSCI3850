<DATELINE>SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The U.N. commander in Bosnia has proposed demilitarizing Sarajevo and banning heavy weapons from a major Serb-Muslim war zone in order to prevent a feared mammoth escalation in fighting. </P>
<P> U.N. peacekeeping officers worry that Bosnia's Muslim-led government army may feel increasingly tempted to launch offensives where the Serbs are most vulnerable in the wake of rump Yugoslavia's disowning of the Bosnian Serbs.. </P>
<P> If Muslims attack, the Serbs -- still defiant despite losing their chief supply of arms as punishment for spurning a major-power peace plan -- could revert to total war jeopardizing U.N. ``safe areas'' in Bosnia, U.N. officers believe. </P>
<P> Bosnian troops are already clawing back ground from Serbs in localized offensives in central and northeast Bosnia. </P>
<P> Muslim thrusts, coupled with international pressure to cede land for peace, goaded the Serbs into reimposing a blockade of Sarajevo, a U.N. safe area, and seizing back heavy weapons from a U.N. depot inside it, provoking a NATO air strike. </P>
<P> ``It doesn't look very good at the moment. We've certainly taken a few steps back. What we can do is create initiatives and momentums at a tactical level,'' said Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Rose, commander of the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR). </P>
<P> Rose said Monday he would seek total demilitarization of Sarajevo, allowing no more than police with pistols in a big step to solidify an unstable heavy-weapons exclusion zone. </P>
<P> The zone was imposed by the United Nations in February to stop Serb shelling of the Bosnian capital. </P>
<P> Rose also plans to propose to both sides that the United Nations set up a third heavy weapons-free zone -- after Sarajevo and Gorazde -- around Tuzla, shelled by Serbs despite its ``safe area'' status, and extend it to the Serb-held Brcko corridor. </P>
<P> A huge exclusion zone grouping Tuzla and Brcko in the northeast could pacify what is potentially the most explosive Serb-Muslim arena of conflict in Bosnia. </P>
<P> ``We would stabilize the whole area and put one little bit of the jigsaw puzzle from the (major-power map for Bosnia) on the table for other bits to join later on,'' Rose said. </P>
<P> To police it on the ground, he would need reinforcements from U.N. members reluctant to devote any more resources to perilous peacekeeping in Bosnia's intractable conflict. </P>
<P> But Rose appeared to have backing from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, whose members provide the bulk of his peacekeeping force in Bosnia. </P>
<P> The United States said Monday NATO was preparing contingency plans to turn four more ``safe areas'' into exclusion zones, including Tuzla. </P>
<P> Rose has asked for meetings with Bosnian Serb army commander General Ratko Mladic and government commander General Rasim Delic Wednesday to present his initiative. </P>
<P> The slender Brcko corridor in Bosnia's northeast corner is the sole link between vast Serb domains in the east and north otherwise separated by a big swath of government territory jutting up from the center. </P>
<P> Losing it would be a disastrous military setback for the Serbs as this would maroon the north between Muslim and Croatian enemies and isolate the east now as well -- following Yugoslavia's closing of its borders to anything but humanitarian supplies. </P>
<P> Muslim forces are believed to have advanced half a mile into the three-mile wide corridor in the past week. </P>
<P> Rose would like to prevent a possible head-on offensive by government troops that he believes would provoke a ferocious Serb riposte with dire implications for hard-won peacekeeping gains in Bosnia to date. </P>
<P> ``If the Bosnians took (Brcko) it would mean all-out war. This is the Bosnia Serb Army's center of gravity, as Sarajevo is for the government,'' Rose said. </P>
