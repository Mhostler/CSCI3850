<P>  Detroit Tigers manager Sparky Anderson, the dean of American League managers, has taken a leave of absence from the Tigers rather than have to mold a team of replacement players. </P>
<P> The Tigers, who opened their spring training camp here Friday, announced that the leave was of undetermined length. Anderson, 60, will not be involved with any club duties during his leave, the team said. </P>
<P> Tom Runnells will serve as interim manager. </P>
<P> Anderson, who has managed Detroit the last 16 seasons after pilotting the Big Red Machine teams of the Cincinnati Reds that won back-to-back World Series in the 1970s, has told the Tigers he does not want to work with replacement players. </P>
<P> Major league clubs are planning to use replacements for striking players when the regular season opens on April 3. </P>
<P> Anderson, who also steered the Tigers to a World Series triumph in 1984, is in the final year of his contract and was scheduled to earn about $1 million this season. </P>
<P> ``My decision has nothing to do with money,'' Anderson was quoted Friday by the Detroit News. ``I vowed to myself long ago that when I leave this game, I will leave it with my head held high. </P>
<P> ``I will not compromise my beliefs for any amount of money. If I did that, it would not be me and I could not live with myself.'' </P>
<P> Anderson, the only manager in baseball history to hold franchise records for wins with two different teams (Reds and Tigers) said: ``If I have to leave, I will leave knowing I've done the right thing.'' </P>
<P> A number of managers have voiced objections to working with replacement players, but have been ordered by management to honor their contracts. The lone exception has been Cito Gaston of the Toronto Blue Jays, who has been reassigned by the club so he does not have to work with the replacements. </P>
