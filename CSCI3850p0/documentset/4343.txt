<P>  Russia may retaliate for tough U.S. visa requirements by asking anyone who wants to visit Russia to come to its embassy for an interview, a top Foreign Ministry official said. </P>
<P> Vasily Vinogradov, head of the ministry's consular department, complained that some Russians had to travel from the middle of Siberia for an obligatory interview at the American Embassy in Moscow, and even then were uncertain of being granted a visa. </P>
<P> ``We may be asking the Utah farmers to come to our embassy in Washington for an interview,'' he told a news conference. </P>
<P> Russian newspapers are full of reports about long delays at Western embassies and the U.S. mission in Moscow has been singled out for special criticism. Vinogradov said Russia believed some states were treating its citizens unfairly. </P>
<P> U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering said late last year measures were being taken to improve the situation. </P>
