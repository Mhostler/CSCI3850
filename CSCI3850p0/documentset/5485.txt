<P>  Developing countries can avoid the mistakes made by the industrialized world by taking advantage of technology transfers to cut air pollution, a U.S. official said Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``Why should they make the same mistakes we made?'' Undersecretary of State Timothy Wirth, head of the U.S. delegation at the U.N. climate conference, told Reuters in an interview. </P>
<P> ``We use energy a lot more efficiently now than we did 10 or 20 years ago. They can save money and do the right thing at the same time.'' </P>
<P> The climate conference aims to find ways to tackle air pollution to reduce the risk of global warming and climate change. </P>
<P> With two days left, progress was stalled by the refusal of the United States and other major polluters to accept European Union demands to pledge new emission cuts. </P>
<P> Developing countries support cuts but say the industrialized world has the prime responsibility to reduce pollution. </P>
<P> The United States wants a system of ``joint implementation'' under which rich countries could offset their own reduction quotas by investing in reductions in developing countries. </P>
<P> Negotiations on the issue broke down early Wednesday when developing countries refused to consider letting developed countries ``credit'' themselves for projects in the Third World while ``joint implementation'' was still in a pilot phase. </P>
<P> Wirth said the United States expected poorer countries to take on additional commitments beyond those they signed up to at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit. </P>
<P> ``Each country has its responsibilities ... Some are developing more rapidly than others, producing more greenhouse gases than others, and therefore have different responsibilities,'' he said. </P>
<P> Wirth denied the United States was opposed to reductions, but reiterated Washington's view that the conference should not define these if it succeeds in setting a mandate for talks leading up to an emissions protocol in 1997. </P>
<P> ``The purpose of the meeting here in Berlin is not to set specific targets or timetables but rather to set up a process in which we will negotiate those targets and timetables,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``We have been very careful about measuring our own performance against the goals that we've set and not putting a lot of rhetorical goals out there that we can't reach.'' </P>
