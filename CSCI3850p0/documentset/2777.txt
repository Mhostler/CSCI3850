<P>  A Pentagon official said Tuesday that 93 Cuban boat people held at the U.S. Guantanamo Bay base tried to swim to Cuba this week and he blamed slow Cuban repatriation in part for their frustration. </P>
<P> Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said 46 Cubans tried to swim around the Guantanamo Bay base perimeter to Cuba Sunday morning, 30 succeeding; 44 more tried Sunday afternoon, 32 succeeding, and three tried Monday, one succeeding. </P>
<P> Another defense official said one of the Cubans who tried to make the swim Sunday afternoon apparently drowned. </P>
<P> ``I think that some of this reflects the frustrations the Cubans may feel in the slowness of getting processed to go back into Cuba by Cuba,'' Bacon said at a press briefing. </P>
<P> He said a U.S.-Cuba agreement reached in response to the Cuba boat people exodus will allow 20,000 Cubans a year to enter the United States but Cubans at Guantanamo must return to Cuba to apply for those visas. </P>
<P> ``The Cubans have been reluctant to allow large numbers of people back in from Guantanamo Bay to Cuba, and there's a very lengthy processing procedure,'' Bacon said. </P>
<P> ``If we submit a list of names they may select only a very, very few of those names to go back for processing,'' he said. </P>
<P> The Pentagon said 22,796 Cuban boat people are being held at the Guantanamo base at the southeast end of Cuba and 8,630 are being held in Panama under a new policy that prohibits their entry into the United States. </P>
