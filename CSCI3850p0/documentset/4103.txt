<P>  Japanese men think their women are a flop when it comes to romance, and a third would not marry the same woman again if they had the choice, according to a survey released Thursday. </P>
<P> Harlequin Enterprises, a Canadian publisher of romantic novels, said it polled more than 5,000 men in 19 countries in Europe, North America and the Pacific region. </P>
<P> It found that Japanese men rate their women lower in questions of romance than men from any of the other countries. </P>
<P> Only 15 percent of Japanese men said their spouses or partners had surprised them in the past year by doing something romantic, three times fewer than the next lowest scorer, Taiwan. </P>
<P> Asked whether their partner had said ``I love you'' in the past year, more Japanese men, 58 percent, said ``seldom'' or ``never'' than in any other country surveyed. </P>
<P> Only 29 percent replied ``frequently'' or ``sometimes,'' compared with 93 percent in the United States, 90 percent in Canada and 88 percent in Britain. </P>
<P> Perhaps Japanese women keep quiet about their feelings because their men would not listen anyway; 13 percent of the Japanese men said they did not know whether or not their woman had said ``I love you'' in the past year. </P>
<P> Fewer Japanese than men in the other countries said their women were ``always doing something nice'' for them. Only 71 percent of Japanese men said they agreed with the statement ``She's my lover AND my best friend,'' again, lowest of the 19 countries. </P>
<P> However, few Japanese men, 21 percent, think their partners takes them for granted, beaten only by Turks at 19 percent. </P>
<P> And 91 percent of Japanese men said their partners had prepared their favorite dinner in the past year, the highest number in the survey. </P>
<P> But still only 66 percent of married Japanese men said that if they had to tie the knot again, they would do it with the women they are with today. </P>
<P> In Canada, 96 percent of the men asked said they would marry the same womman again. In Britain the figure was 94 percent and in the United States and Australia it was 93 percent. </P>
