<P>  In a move aimed at what it sees as American cultural imperialism, the European Commission proposed tighter limits Wednesday on the amount of foreign films and programming broadcast on European televisions. </P>
<P> But the controversial plan -- a response to pleas from the EU's ailing film industry for help to match up to Hollywood -- immediately ran into trouble. </P>
<P> As the EU executive fine-tuned plans to revise a 1989 EU broadcasting law, Germany's high court ruled that the federal government had violated states' rights in part by agreeing to the law in the first place. </P>
<P> The court partially upheld complaints from eight regional states that they alone had final say over broadcasting affairs -- a move seen as a setback for efforts to curtail the pervasive impact of American television worldwide. </P>
<P> EU officials said the new plan was bound to run into a wall of opposition when the 15-nation bloc's culture ministers meet in Luxembourg in April and would face years of dispute. </P>
<P> Only France has been lobbying passionately for tougher limits on Hollywood and other foreign films to help its own ailing industry. </P>
<P> The Commission said it was proposing to remove a loophole which has allowed television channels to get round the 1989 ``television without frontiers'' law, which sets a 51 percent target for European films and programs shown on EU channels. </P>
<P> Under the revision, the words ``where practicable'' would be scrubbed out of the law. But EU governments showed themselves against such an idea at a meeting of the bloc's culture ministers in the French town of Bordeaux in February. </P>
<P> The law aims to create a border-free market in the EU for audiovisual services, while setting minimum standards on issues such as advertising. </P>
<P> The EU's Audiovisual Commissioner Marcelino Oreja told a news conference the Commission considered 10 years was long enough to promote the European audiovisual industry given changes under way in the sector. </P>
<P> But that idea of a 10-year limit has already drawn fire from EU film makers. A host of film personalities including Bernardo Bertolucci pleaded for EU help last month to try to stop their industry ``bleeding to death.'' </P>
<P> Under the proposal, stations broadcasting on a particular theme, such as cartoons, could opt to invest one quarter of their program budget into European productions instead of respecting the 51 percent European program target. </P>
<P> They would have three years to adapt. </P>
