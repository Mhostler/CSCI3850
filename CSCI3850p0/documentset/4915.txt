<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole asked the State Department Tuesday to justify its decision to treat the U.S.-North Korean nuclear accord as a political agreement rather than a treaty. </P>
<P> North Korea reached agreement with the United States last October to freeze its graphite nuclear program in return for light-water reactors, alternative energy supplies and steps for diplomatic ties with the United States. </P>
<P> Washington and its allies had feared North Korea's graphite reactors could be used to develop nuclear weapons. </P>
<P> If the agreed framework was considered to be a treaty, it would require ratification by the Senate. </P>
<P> ``Numerous questions have been raised by the decision to treat the agreed framework as a non-binding 'political' agreement rather than as an international agreement, an executive agreement or a treaty,'' Dole, a Kansas Republican, said in a letter to Secretary of State Warren Christopher. </P>
<P> Dole said the chairmen of the Senate committees on foreign relations, intelligence and energy had asked that the framework be considered a treaty. </P>
<P> He asked Christopher to provide all legal memoranda and opinions concerning the framework to the Senate. </P>
<P> ``At what point, and by whom, was the decision made to handle the agreed framework as a political agreement rather than as a treaty or an executive agreement? Was there any consultation with Congress on this issue?'' Dole asked Christopher. </P>
<P> He also asked what the administration's position would be on submitting the agreement to the Senate as a treaty. </P>
