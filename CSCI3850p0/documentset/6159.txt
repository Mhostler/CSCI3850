<P>  South African President Nelson Mandela said on Sunday poachers decimating Africa's wildlife had to be stopped in their tracks. </P>
<P> ``Throughout our continent and especially in our region, poachers are on the rampage. They must be stopped in their tracks,'' Mandela said at centenary celebrations at Africa's oldest game parks, Hluhluwe-Umfolozi and the Greater St Lucia wetland in KwaZulu-Natal. </P>
<P> Mandela, addressing guests including Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini and Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party, said efforts to conserve rhino and other rare species would fail unless they were supported by local communities. </P>
<P> ``If these game and park reserves are to become part of our national heritage...the people of this area must be involved. They should see their heritage to preserve (it) for future generations,'' Mandela said. </P>
<P> The two KwaZulu-Natal parks are home to both white and black rhinos, among Africa's most endangered species. </P>
<P> The continent's population of black rhinoceros has fallen from 65,000 in the early 1970s to less than 3,000 due to widespread poaching. </P>
<P> Rhino horn is prized as an aphrodisiac in Asia and is used in dagger handles in parts of the Gulf. </P>
