<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Iraq's parliament ended a special session on its troubled relations with the United Nations Monday without revealing whether it had debated the U.N. demand for recognition of Kuwait. </P>
<P> The official Iraqi News Agency said only that the 250-member body, summoned at one-day's notice, had discussed ``situations on the Arab and international arenas, their development, attitude toward the Security Council and recent Russian-Iraq talks.'' </P>
<P> It was not known if Iraq's parliament discussed recognition of the Kuwaiti border set by the U.N. after the 1991 Gulf War, but President Saddam Hussein last week endorsed the Russian plan to accept the border. </P>
<P> The session ended as Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev was proposing a plan to the United Nations in New York that would have Iraq accept the new borders of Kuwait in return for lifting the ban on Iraqi oil exports in six months. </P>
<P> Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz also addressed the Security Council Monday, saying afterward that Baghdad's recognition of Kuwait ``was under consideration'' but he offered no details on when it might be carried out. </P>
<P> Members of Iraq's parliament told reporters before the start of their session -- which was closed to reporters -- that Kuwait was expected to be high on the agenda. </P>
<P> One member, declining to be named, said parliament would debate a recommendation by the Revolution Command Council, Iraq's highest governing body, to accept Kuwait as a sovereign state within the border demarcated after Iraqi occupation troops were driven out in 1991. </P>
<P> ``I think the matter is over. We will have to co-exist as two sovereign and independent states,'' he said. No Iraqi leader has accepted the independence of Kuwait, which was described by Saddam as Iraq's 19th province. </P>
<P> But Britain and the United States -- two of the five permanent members of the Security Council -- had already described acceptance of the Kuwaiti border as only satisfying one of a number of U.N. resolutions to be implemented. </P>
<P> The session came two days after Saddam chaired a top-level meeting following Security Council demands that Iraq's recognition of Kuwait come through constitutional and formal channels. </P>
<P> Kozyrev, in New York, minimized the recent Iraqi military threat to Kuwait, saying Monday that the Security Council should consider lifting the oil embargo against Iraq within six months. </P>
<P> But the Russian foreign minister said he agreed with Saturday's Security Council resolution demanding Iraq withdraw all troops and ``understood the intense concern of troop movements by Iraq's neighbors, first and foremost Kuwait.'' </P>
