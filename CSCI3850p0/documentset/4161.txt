<P>  The Clinton administration proposed Monday increasing the budget for the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in an attempt to reduce crime. </P>
<P> The administration proposed a budget for the FBI at more than $2.3 billion for the 1996 fiscal year while the DEA would get nearly $800 million, both reflecting a six percent rise from the previous year. </P>
<P> FBI Director Louis Freeh and Thomas Constantine, the DEA chief, came out publicly last year in opposing White House proposals to cut their budgets. </P>
<P> Freeh said in a statement Monday that the increase ''reflects President Clinton's strong support for the FBI's crime-fighting programs'' and would allow the law enforcement agency to hire new agents. </P>
<P> Among the new initiatives, the budget called for $4 million to allow the DEA to hire 30 new agents to focus on the recent surge in heroin trafficking. </P>
<P> The FBI would get $2 million to set up an international training facility in Budapest, Hungary to stop organized crime activities from Eastern Europe, Russia and the former Soviet Republics from reaching the United States. </P>
<P> The FBI and the DEA also plan to spend $1 million to open a joint office in Beijing to combat Asian organized crime and drug trafficking. The FBI opened a similar office in Moscow last year. </P>
