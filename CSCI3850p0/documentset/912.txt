<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  U.N. peacekeepers from Nigeria shot dead two Somalis and captured eight in Somalia Saturday when gunmen attacked their convoy outside the southern port Merca, a military spokesman said. </P>
<P> ``The Nigerians managed to kill two of the attackers and captured eight of them,'' U.N. Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM) military spokesman Major Richard McDonald told Reuters in Nairobi by telephone. </P>
<P> McDonald could not say what UNOSOM would do with the prisoners. All those previously captured in battle with the U.N. in Somalia have been allowed to walk free, even when they have killed peacekeepers. </P>
<P> Two years after the U.N. first sent troops to Somalia to ensure aid reached the starving and to help reconcile feuding clans, there is no proper legal system, no government and rival warlords and their militias hold sway. </P>
<P> U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali in New York on Friday called on the Security Council to reconsider the billion dollar a year UNOSOM operation if the faction leaders make no progress toward reconciliation by the end of September. </P>
<P> In the meantime, he said, the 18,800-strong Asian and African force would be cut to 15,000, with 1,500 to go at once. </P>
<P> He paid particular attention to reconciliation between rival clans from the Hawiye group, whose leaders include self-declared President Ali Mahdi Mohamed and Mohamed Farah Aideed, whose supporters fought bloody clashes with U.N. forces last year. </P>
<P> Since U.S. and other Western forces withdrew from Somalia in March after suffering dozens of casualties, the U.N. mandate has been cut back to merely protecting humanitarian efforts and U.N. operations while officials try to broker peace. </P>
<P> But there has been little progress in talks to set up a government, which have failed repeatedly since January 1992. </P>
