<DATELINE>PARIS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres discussed reviving sluggish Middle East peace moves early Sunday after an angry exchange earlier before hundreds of spectators. </P>
<P> The two men, who clashed Saturday at the opening ceremony of a privately organized conference on peace in the Mediterranean region, closeted themselves in their hotel afterward for nearly an hour of private talks. </P>
<P> ``We won't publish details (yet) but basically, we agreed two issues remained: the economic situation in Gaza that needs immediate help and security for Israel.'' </P>
<P> Peres said Israel would help accelerate construction of industrial parks in Gaza to create jobs there. </P>
<P> He said he told Arafat ``if the measures he will take to preempt and prevent terror continue and become visible, this will enable us to accelerate negotiations and go ahead.'' </P>
<P> Arafat did not emerge to speak to reporters but his aides denied this indicated he was unhappy with the discussions. </P>
<P> The Palestinian leader earlier delivered a blistering public attack against Israel at the conference they both attended, saying the Jewish state was deliberately obstructing the peace process and slowing its evacuation of occupied areas. </P>
<P> He said Israel had imposed collective punishment on the Palestinians by preventing them from travelling to jobs in Israel following anti-Israel attacks by Muslim fundamentalists. </P>
<P> ``Yes, violence (against Israelis) is despicable and we reject it but this deliberate obstruction by Israel of the peace process violates our peace agreements as well as international law ... delay will have a dangerous impact on peace,'' Arafat said. </P>
<P> ``The fundamental land-for-peace principle is being violated,'' he said of Israel's slowing down of troop withdrawals until Arafat halts fundamentalist attacks. </P>
<P> Peres, visibly stung, said Israel appreciated Arafat's recent crackdown on radicals. </P>
<P> ``If you continue to show a dedicated attempt to reduce violence and bloodshed, you will see how open the road is to peace ... We don't want to keep land which is not ours, we want to see the Palestinians prosperous,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``We intend to continue the peace process ... to the next phase of bringing autonomy to the West Bank and we shall continue to seek a permanent settlement in two years time.'' </P>
<P> The two men, together with French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, spoke at the start of the three-day privately-organised seminar at the Paris headquarters of the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). </P>
<P> The event is organised by the French Jewish Radio Shalom with help from France's TF1 television channel and the Egyptian Al-Ahram newspaper. </P>
<P> Many at the gala opening were well-heeled, upper middle class members of France's Jewish community. </P>
<P> Although they first greeted Arafat warmly, they became angry when he made his accusations and said Israel prevented Christians and Muslims from praying at their holy sites in Jerusalem. </P>
<P> The comment drew jeers and banging on delegates' desks as Balladur shifted uneasily in his seat. </P>
<P> When Peres later said Jerusalem was ``open for all to pray,'' a handful of Palestinians who came with Arafat shouted ``Not true, not true'' and waved their hands in objection. </P>
