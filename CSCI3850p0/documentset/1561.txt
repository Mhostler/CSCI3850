<P>  A pack of 25 wild elephants, apparently fleeing hunters, have killed two people and crippled three in a rampage in north-central Vietnam, an official newspaper reported Friday. </P>
<P> ``The rage of these wild beasts might have been caused by the uncontrolled hunting in the region,'' the Vietnam News said. </P>
<P> The angry elephants swooped down recently from mountains near the Vu Quang Nature Reserve in Ha Tinh province, about 170 miles southwest of Hanoi. </P>
<P> ``In the last four years, at least 48 elephants have been killed by hunters in the region,'' the newspaper said. </P>
<P> ``Vietnam's elephants, which have just revived in some areas after being almost wiped out by American bombing during the Vietnam War, are now facing threats from deforestation and illegal ivory trading,'' it said. </P>
<P> The same reasons caused rampages by elephants in two provinces near Ho Chi Minh City in southern Vietnam last year in which 12 people were killed, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> The government spent $30,000 on shelters, ditches and alarms to protect villages in the region and hired tamers from Thailand to control the elephants. </P>
<P> In Vietnam's heaviest sentence against ivory poachers, a court jailed four men for up to 20 years last December for killing an elephant in the central highlands and selling its tusks for gold. </P>
