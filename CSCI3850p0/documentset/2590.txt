<DATELINE>CORAL GABLES, Florida (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Tropical Storm Gordon churned across the southeastern tip of Cuba on Sunday, unleashing powerful gusts and heavy rain on a tent city packed with thousands of Haitian and Cuban refugees. </P>
<P> One man was electrocuted in Cuba and dozens of homes were destroyed. </P>
<P> The storm, packing winds of 45 mph, was pushing north through the Bahamas and was expected to sweep ashore at south Florida by Tuesday, according to forecasters at the U.S. National Hurricane Center. </P>
<P> The weather threatened to postpone the planned Monday morning landing of the space shuttle Atlantis, which is scheduled to return to Cape Canaveral after an 11-day mission. </P>
<P> On Sunday evening, the storm was centered 215 miles southeast of Nassau, Bahamas, and moving north at 12 miles an hour. </P>
<P> The National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning for all of the Bahamas, and gale and flood warnings for Florida's east coast. </P>
<P> Gordon crossed the southern tip of Cuba on Sunday, whipping the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay with fierce winds -- including one gust clocked at about 104 miles an hour -- and dumping several inches of rain, according to Jerry Jarrell, deputy director of the hurricane center. </P>
<P> In the Cuban province of Guantanamo, a rail line was cut and 12,000 homes were partially flooded. </P>
<P> In neighboring Santiago de Cuba province, one man was electrocuted and 278 homes were damaged by rains and winds, the state news agency AIN reported. It gave no other details. </P>
<P> U.S. military officials said some of the 29,000 Cuban and Haitian refugees at the Guantanamo camp were temporarily moved out of tents to higher ground because of flooding. </P>
<P> A Navy spokeswoman said the base recorded 8.5 inches of rain and sustained winds of about 40 to 50 miles an hour. Electrical power and telephone lines were briefly disrupted, but soldiers repaired the damage. </P>
<P> ``There's a lot of nasty weather out there, and we're not sure how it will develop over the next few days,'' Jarrell said. </P>
<P> The Haitian and Cuban refugees at the camp were intercepted earlier this year as they tried to make their way to Florida aboard small home-made rafts and boats. </P>
<P> The remaining 5,900 Haitians at the camp are being repatriated in small groups to their homeland now that the junta which ruled Haiti has relinquished power. </P>
<P> Most of the 22,900 Cuban refugees at the camp remain in legal limbo. The majority of them have refused to return home and are prevented from legally entering the United States. </P>
<P> The annual Atlantic hurricane season, which has brought relatively few storms this year, ends on Nov. 30. </P>
