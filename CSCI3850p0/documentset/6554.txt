<P>  Cosmonaut German Titov has been elected to Russia's parliament, beating the glamorous wife of the head of a failed pyramid scheme and a nationalist who once vowed to kill 150 liberals, Interfax news agency said Monday. </P>
<P> The electoral commission said preliminary results of a special election to replace a murdered deputy showed Titov, the second Russian to walk in space, won the parliamentary seat in Kolomna, 60 miles southeast of Moscow, Interfax said. </P>
<P> The director of a textile company, Mikhail Guberman, came second and Yelena Mavrodi, a model whose face adorned dozens of posters around Kolomna, was third. </P>
<P> The poll was called after sitting deputy Sergei Skorochkin was kidnapped, handcuffed and shot through the head in February after saying he had been threatened by the local mafia for refusing to pay protection money. </P>
<P> In all, 11 candidates took part, including ultra-nationalist Alexei Vedenkin. He faces a criminal charge for telling a television interviewer he would shoot 150 liberals, including members of parliament, if his Russian National Unity Party came to power. Russian deputies are immune to prosecution. </P>
<P> Mrs. Mavrodi is the wife of the head of the MMM investment fund that collapsed in early 1994, Sergei Mavrodi. </P>
<P> Her husband is himself a parliamentary deputy and closely escaped prosecution over the MMM affair in April when his colleagues voted against the prosecutor-general's request to lift his immunity. </P>
<P> Other candidates included hardline army officer Stanislav Terekhov, jailed for his role in a 1993 coup against President Boris Yeltsin, and businessman Nikolai Lopukhov, who promised a car and a television to two voters chosen by a lottery. </P>
<P> Titov will have to run for office again in December, when full elections to the 450-seat State Duma are due. </P>
