<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Applying President Clinton's controversial policy on gays in the military, a Navy board of inquiry recommended Thursday that a lieutenant who has publicly declared she is a lesbian remain in the service. </P>
<P> The decision was handed down by the three-member Navy administrative board of inquiry, which began meeting Tuesday at the Treasure Island naval base in San Francisco. </P>
<P> It unanimously recommended Thursday that Lt. Zoe Dunning be retained. </P>
<P> ``I feel fantastic,'' said a stunned Dunning, wearing her navy blue uniform, afterwards. ``I was not expecting it. We know of no one who's won one of these hearings before.'' </P>
<P> She said she had expected the proceedings, which began after she publicly stated she is a lesbian, to lead to the end of her Navy career. </P>
<P> ``My eyes teared up a little. It's been two years. It's been very frustrating,'' she said. </P>
<P> Dunning's attorneys said the ruling was the first ever in favor of a homosexual or lesbian member of the Navy. </P>
<P> They noted that in the two previous cases decided under President Clinton's compromise ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell,'' the sailors were dismissed. </P>
<P> Under the current policy, personnel can no longer be asked about their sexual orientation but can be dismissed for openly acknowledging their homosexuality -- unless they can prove that does not mean they will engage in prohibited homosexual sex. </P>
<P> Clinton's policy is now under fire from conservative Republicans in Congress, including Sen. Jesse Helms, who want to return to an outright prohibition of gays in the military. </P>
<P> Captain Thomas Berns, president of the naval board of inquiry, before closing the hearing, said that there was no evidence that Dunning engages in, intends to engage in or is inclined to engage in homosexual activity. </P>
<P> ``This means you can make the statement you are gay and stay in the service,'' Dunning told reporters later. </P>
<P> Dunning, who had been selected some time ago for the rank of lieutentant commander, said her promotion should now proceed. </P>
<P> But both Dunning and her lawyers said her ordeal may not be over as her tenure could be questioned again, especially if official policy changes. </P>
<P> Dunning said that after today's hearing, she recoiled when her Navy lawyer, Lt. Jill James, embraced her in congratulation. </P>
<P> ``All it might take is for me to hug a woman in public,'' she told reporters afterwards. </P>
<P> Her lawyer, Gregory Bonfiglio, said Dunning could face another inquiry if the ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' policy is changed. </P>
<P> Dunning said she does not expect a negative response from fellow Navy members. </P>
<P> ``My unit is going to be ecstatic. I don't expect any backlash,'' she said in response to a question. </P>
<P> Dunning announced that she was a lesbian in January of 1993 at a rally in support of gays in the military. </P>
<P> A Navy administrative board in July of 1993 recommended that Dunning be honorably discharged based on the government's previous policy barring gay people from the military. </P>
<P> A new board of inquiry was called to judge the Dunning case under the Clinton policy. </P>
<P> Wednesday, Dunning told the board that she does not regret her declaration last January. ``I have no regrets whatsoever,'' she told the board. ``I told the truth.'' </P>
<P> A graduate of the Naval Academy at Annapolis, Md., Dunning served on active duty for six years until September 1993 when she tranferred to the Naval Air Station Naval near San Francisco. </P>
<P> Dunning, 31, is a supply officer in Alameda, Calif. </P>
<P> She has been consistently praised by her superiors, and the prosecutor at her 1993 hearing said she was a fine officer. </P>
<P> The administration board's recommendation will go to the Bureau of Naval Personnel and then to the Secretary of the Navy. </P>
