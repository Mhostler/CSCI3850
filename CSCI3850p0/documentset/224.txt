<P>  United Nations officials said Thursday they were pressing the Serbs for permission to fly seven sick and wounded children out of Muslim enclaves in eastern Bosnia for urgent medical care. </P>
<P> The seven, including an eight-year-old boy shot through the head Wednesday near the frontline in Srebrenica, are all in danger of dying. Serbs have denied U.N. mercy flight requests for the enclaves since last Saturday. </P>
<P> ``An immediate evacuation could save the boy's life,'' said Kris Janowski, spokesman for the Sarajevo office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. </P>
<P> ``We hope to get permission since this is a matter of life and death for the boy.'' </P>
<P> One of 32 patients awaiting medical evacuation from Gorazde in eastern Bosnia died Tuesday. He was a 63-year-old man suffering from cancer. </P>
<P> Janowski said UNHCR is placing priority on evacuations for the wounded boy in Srebrenica and six children in Gorazde, including a premature baby in need of an incubator. </P>
<P> U.N. sources say the Bosnian Serbs are denying U.N. helicopters permission to fly into the Muslim enclaves because they feel the Muslim-led Bosnian government has reneged on a truce commitment to release prisoners of war. </P>
<P> The Bosnian government is refusing to release prisoners until the Serbs account for persons missing and feared dead in the country's 27-month ethnic war. </P>
<P> ``Linking medical evacuations to prisoner releases is totally inappropriate and the resulting delay puts people's lives at risk and is outrageous,'' Janowski said Wednesday. </P>
