<P>  A U.N. official who flew along the Iraq-Kuwait border Sunday said there were no Iraqi troops in the 12 miles of Iraqi territory visible from his helicopter. </P>
<P> ``I flew over about 130 miles of the demilitarized zone (DMZ). No Iraqi troops were within sight,'' Vesselin Kostov, a spokesman for the U.N. Iraq-Kuwait Observer Mission (UNIKOM), told Reuters by telephone. </P>
<P> Kostov said his field of view covered no more than 12 miles because ``the visibility was not good today.'' </P>
<P> His account was the first official eyewitness description of the Iraqi side of the border where Western governments say Iraq has massed more than 60,000 troops. </P>
<P> Diplomats have said the nearest units to Kuwait are stationed about 12 miles from the frontier, but most are about 12 miles further north. </P>
<P> The DMZ is six miles wide on the Iraqi side of the border and three miles wide on the Kuwaiti side. </P>
<P> Kostov's flight provided him with a view of the six-mile wide band of Iraqi territory in the DMZ and another six-mile wide band of Iraqi territory beyond it. </P>
<P> He said an encampment of unarmed people in Iraq just north of the DMZ grew during the day and women and children had been sighted for the first time. </P>
<P> ``The number of the tents is something like 700 and each tent has the capacity of about four persons,'' he said. </P>
<P> Iraq says the tents were erected near the border with Kuwait by stateless Arabs who planned to stage a protest on the border against their alleged expulsion from the emirate after the 1991 Gulf War. </P>
<P> Kostov, repeating earlier statements that the number of the tent people could increase to about 6,000, said UNIKOM was given the figure by Iraqi liaison officers. </P>
<P> UNIKOM has sent several of its Bangladeshi peacekeeping troops to monitor activity around the tents from within the zone. </P>
<P> Many stateless Arabs left Kuwait during or soon after the 1990-91 Gulf crisis. Almost none have been allowed back. </P>
<P> About 230,000 stateless Arabs lived in Kuwait before Iraq's invasion but their total is estimated at around 120,000. </P>
<P> Kuwaiti officials say most are actually Iraqis who concealed their nationality to benefit from Kuwait's extensive economic opportunities and welfare state provisions. </P>
