<P>  Pope John Paul II is set to become a best selling author with the publication later this year of a 230-page book of essays that will raise millions of dollars for charity, his publisher said Thursday. </P>
<P> ``Crossing the Threshhold of Hope'' seems sure to prove a hit with many of the world's 950 million Roman Catholics and will make the 74-year-old pope, who wrote plays in his youth, the first pontiff to publish a book while in office. </P>
<P> It will be translated into more than 20 languages and published around the world in hardback and paperback editions. </P>
<P> ``Everyone can now have a private audience with the Pope, discussing the big questions of our existence,'' Leonardo Mondadori, chairman of publishers Arnoldo Mondadori Editore Spa, told Reuters. </P>
<P> ``It will represent a fundamental moment of reflection not only for Catholics but for all men,'' said Mondadori. </P>
<P> The company is 47 percent-owned by Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi but Mondadori played down what may prove to be the publishing coup of the century. </P>
<P> ``It is an honor to have been chosen to publish the book,'' he said. </P>
<P> Mondadori spokeswoman Rosella Citerio said the Pope was writing the manuscript by hand in Polish, his mother tongue. </P>
<P> Several million copies are expected to be sold when the book is released and subsequent reprints will add to the figure. The publication date has not yet been announced, but the book is expected on shop shelves by the northern hemisphere's autumn. </P>
<P> Its contents are shrouded in secrecy but it is likely the work will reflect some of the Pope's views which include strong support for human rights and religious freedom. </P>
<P> Concerned that many Catholics had strayed from traditional teachings, John Paul has also waged an unflagging battle against abortion, contraception, pre-marital sex, divorce, drug abuse and the breakdown of traditional family values. </P>
<P> His visits to more than 100 countries in 59 foreign trips may also have provided some inspiration. </P>
<P> The contract, giving Mondadori the world publication rights, was signed in June on the Pope's behalf by his spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, Citerio said. </P>
<P> ``There will be a first print run of 250,000 hardback copies in Italy and the paperback edition should be several times that amount,'' she said. ``Overseas, the numbers should be even larger.'' </P>
<P> Mondadori has been selling on the rights to the book in other countries. It struck a deal earlier this week with publishing giants Random House for the United States for a $6 million advance, according to publishing industry sources. </P>
<P> Proceeds will go to charity, but Mondadori declined to say how many millions of dollars the pontiff would make. </P>
<P> Normally, authors can expect 15 percent of the cover price, although better-known writers can command more. </P>
<P> A former actor who wrote several plays, Pope John Paul has used his mastery of timing, levity and languages to communicate like few other world figures of modern times. He has joked that admirers call him ``the new Moses.'' </P>
<P> Since his election in 1978, the pope has written 10 encyclicals, the highest form of Papal teaching, ranging from the family and morality to workers' rights. </P>
<P> The pope, at the time Karol Wojtyla, studied Polish language, literature and philosphy at the Jagellonian University in his home city of Krakow. He joined the university theater workshop and began studies for a diploma in drama in spare time. </P>
