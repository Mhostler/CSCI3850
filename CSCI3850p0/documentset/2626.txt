<P>  The Pentagon Tuesday defended U.S. military readiness against charges by prospective Republican House Armed Services Committee Chairman Floyd Spence that budget cuts have weakened the armed forces. </P>
<P> ``I think our forces are very ready today, particularly the forces that will deploy first,'' Defense Department spokesman Ken Bacon told reporters. </P>
<P> ``Their readiness is like weight control; it's a battle that has to be fought constantly. It's never over,'' he said. ``There is always room for improvement.'' </P>
<P> Spence, a South Carolina Republican, criticized a senior defense official for saying that U.S. defense readiness is now higher than it was before the 1991 Gulf War. </P>
<P> ``This administration is showing the classic symptoms of denial,'' Spence said in a statement. </P>
<P> On the contrary, Spence said in a letter to the official, Deputy Defense Secretary John Deutch, ``U.S. military units are caught in the early stages of a downward readiness spiral. </P>
<P> ``Wholesale categories of combat units are in a reduced state of readiness and those that are not, are managing to preserve short-term readiness only through engaging in a desperate 'shell game' with dwindling resources,'' he wrote. </P>
<P> Spence is in line to take over the committee chairmanship because of the Republicans' election sweep last week. </P>
<P> He issued a statement after the election which said, ``I will be working to reverse the past two years of neglect of our nation's military.'' </P>
<P> Spence told Deutch in the letter he was surprised by his comment at a press conference Oct. 13 that Deutch believed U.S. forces' readiness was higher than before the Gulf War. </P>
<P></P>
<P> -- Two of six Army contingency corps, including one that would have been a big part of U.S. defenses if Iraq had invaded Kuwait last month, are reporting reduced readiness. </P>
<P> -- All of the U.S. F-15E crews in Europe and 64 percent of the F-15C crews needed waivers from training requirements as of June to keep flying. </P>
<P> ``This means that should a contingency arise, we would not be able to deploy a single F-15E crew out of Europe that had not suffered recent training deficiencies,'' Spence said. </P>
<P> -- Regular Navy peacetime requirements plus Cuban and Haitian boat people operations and drug interdiction required 61 ships to do the work of 73 in the past few months. </P>
<P> -- Eight Marine Corps air squadrons were completely grounded for the month of September and 28 Navy and Marine squadrons had to ground more than half their planes then. At the Pentagon, Bacon appeared to respond with skepticism to promises by some Republicans to raise defense spending. </P>
<P> ``It's very easy to make statements about showering buildings (the Pentagon) with money. It's sometimes harder to deliver the money,'' he said at the regular department news briefing. </P>
<P> ``We plan to stick with our budget plan ... And if we end up fortunately getting more money, we will find very good ways to spend that money,'' Bacon added. </P>
