<P>  Turkey is as strategically important as it was during the Cold War and it is critical that Ankara's ties with Greece be normalized, a senior U.S. official said Friday. </P>
<P> To that end, Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke said the United States is optimistic Turkey will be admitted to the European Union's customs union but warned that if Ankara is rejected this would be ``a tremendous setback for stability in Europe.'' </P>
<P> Testifying before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee, he reiterated U.S. concerns about Turkey's human rights record and said he saw ``some faint rays of hope'' that long-standing tensions between Turkey and Armenia could be defused. </P>
<P> The United States has launched a wide-ranging round of diplomacy to ``strengthen relations with Turkey and Greece and bring stabillity to this very very explosive region,'' said Holbrooke who visited the region last week. </P>
<P> He was aiming for the kind of ``historic breakthrough that (French) General DeGaulle and (German Chancellor) Konrad Adenauer effected between France and Germany in the late 50s and early 60s ... an historic change in the map of Europe.'' </P>
<P> He described Turkey as being at the crossroads of key issues of importance to the United States, including NATO's future role, war in the Balkans, U.N. sanctions on Iraq, and Russia's relations with other newly-independent states. </P>
<P> The United States considers Turkey part of Europe but while that country is a NATO member it is not part of the EU, although Greece, Turkey's age-old adversary, is. </P>
<P> Greece had been threatening to veto Turkey's bid for a customs union, seen as a first step to EU membership. </P>
<P> But on Friday EU officials struck a provisional deal that broke a two-decade deadlock over the customs union issue and set a date for accession talks with Cyprus. </P>
<P> The United States, including President Clinton, lobbied hard for Turkey and ``we're very optimistic'' the union will happen, Holbrooke said. If Turkey is rejected ``it would be a tremendous setback for stability in Europe.'' </P>
<P> Holbrooke reiterated U.S. support for a $3 billion to $4 billion oil export pipeline across Turkey. </P>
