<P>  Turkish legal authorities are considering a further charge against well-known author Yasar Kemal for criticizing Turkey's Kurdish policy in a magazine article, his lawyer said Tuesday. </P>
<P> An Istanbul prosector will question Kemal Wednesday about the article he wrote for Germany's Der Spiegel magazine and may charge him with insulting the Turkish republic, lawyer Ender Nalbant told Reuters. </P>
<P> If found guilty he would face a jail sentence of between one and six years under Turkey's tight restrictions on criticism of the government and state institutions. </P>
<P> Kemal has already been charged with separatism for writing January's Der Spiegel article and with racism for a similar essay he contributed to a book about freedom of expression. </P>
<P> The charges have brought unwelcome publicity for Turkey, already under fire from the West for its intolerance of dissent, especially over the Kurdish issue. </P>
<P> Kemal, frequently noted as a candidate for the Nobel literature prize, accused Turkey in the article of orchestrating ``a campaign of lies'' to justify what he called the oppression of its Kurdish minority. </P>
<P> Security forces in southeast Turkey have been fighting the separatist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) since 1984. </P>
