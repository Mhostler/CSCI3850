<P>  Pope John Paul II, speaking out in this country where where church and state are in conflict over family planning, made a powerful defense Saturday of a Roman Catholic ban on artificial birth control. </P>
<P> In his first reference to abortion and contraception during his visit to Manila, the pope told Catholic bishops their resistance to those who ``plot against the splendor of human sexuality and human life'' was essential. </P>
<P> ``When powerful interests promote policies which are against the moral law inscribed on the human heart, they offend the dignity of man who is made in the image and likeness of God, and in doing so they undermine the foundations of society itself,'' he told a closed meeting of Filipino bishops. </P>
<P> ``Because the Church treasures the divine gifts of human life and its inalienable dignity, she cannot but strenuously oppose all measures which are in any way directed at promoting abortion, sterilization and also contraception.'' </P>
<P> The pope's comments were clearly aimed at bolstering the moral authority of the bishops, who have fought an increasingly strident battle against the government of President Fidel Ramos over its support for family planning. </P>
<P> The pope and Ramos met Friday to discuss social issues but neither the Vatican nor the presidential palace gave any details of their conversation. </P>
<P> The Catholic Church, which represents about 85 percent of the Philippines' 65 million population, has been outraged by government efforts to trim the nation's high birth rate through offering people a choice of contraception and promoting condoms as a way of combating AIDS. </P>
<P> Abortion is outlawed. </P>
<P> The country's leading churchman, Cardinal Jaime Sin, has singled out for his most stinging attacks the architect of the family planning program, Health Secretary Juan Flavier. </P>
<P> He has also accused Ramos, the country's first Protestant president, of harboring dictatorial tendencies. </P>
<P> In his speech to the bishops, the pope also hit out at the injustices of Philippine society and the breakdown of traditional values in a country where the gap between rich and poor is growing. </P>
<P> ``Too many families remain without land to till or a home to live in and too many people are without employment and basic services,'' he said in a speech released by his aides. </P>
<P> ``Your task must be to help create a new attitude, a conviction shaped by the principle of the social purpose of power and wealth, which can lead to appropriate changes in the prevailing order.'' </P>
<P> The pope chose a private meeting with his bishops to make the strongest comments so far on his four-day visit, the first leg of an 11-day tour that will take him on to Papua New Guinea, Australia and Sri Lanka. </P>
<P> They reflected the church's unwavering rejection of all artificial contraception, reiterated last year in the Pope's Letter to Families when he said civilization itself was under threat. </P>
<P> A recent survey by researchers at the University of the Philippines showed many Filipinos did not accept the church's teaching. </P>
<P> About 98 percent of the 1,000 couples surveyed said they supported the government's population policies and more than three-quarters would not be swayed by church teachings on contraception. </P>
