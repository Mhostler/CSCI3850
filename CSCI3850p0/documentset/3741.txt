<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  He paints himself as an heir to Malcolm X but in the last days of Malcolm's life he was his worst enemy, calling for his death in words that have haunted his reputation for years. </P>
<P> Now Malcolm's 34-year-old daughter, Qubilah Bahiyah Shabazz -- four years old when she saw her father gunned down in a Harlem ballroom -- is accused of plotting to hire a hitman to kill black separatist firebrand Louis Farrakhan. </P>
<P> She has pleaded not guilty and her mother says she was raised not to hate. </P>
<P> But the irony of the charge is heavy. </P>
<P> During Malcolm's life, Farrakhan moved from friend and disciple to arch-foe. Now 30 years after the assassination, Farrakhan praises Malcolm, calls himself his successor and is treated as such by many in the U.S. black community who think he stands as tall and firm against white America as Malcolm did. </P>
<P> His comments have stirred anger and pride the way Malcolm's did and like Malcolm, who once called John Kennedy's assassination a case of ``chickens coming home to roost,'' Farrakhan has been upbraided for remarks like calling Hitler a ''wickedly great man'' and Judaism ``a gutter religion.'' </P>
<P> But years ago his anger was aimed at Malcolm and the question Thursday was whether the past was catching up with the present. </P>
<P> Writing in 1965 in the Black Muslim newspaper ``Muhammed Speaks'' just months before Malcolm's murder, Farrakhan said, ''The die is set and Malcolm shall not escape. Such a man as Malcolm is worthy of death.'' </P>
<P> Farrakhan had remained faithful to Black Muslim leader Elijah Muhammed while Malcolm had broken with him and started a movement of his own. </P>
<P> The assassination was allegedly planned in the Newark Mosque of Mohammad's movement and Farrakhan preached there the night before the murder. Malcolm's family has long thought that Farrakhan may have had a hand in the killing. </P>
<P> ``I was not in any way involved in his murder. I did say those words but that's not the full statement. I said a such a man as Malcolm is worthy of death and were it not for Elijah Muhammad's faith in God, it would have been so,'' he told ABC's Barbara Walters in an interview last year. </P>
<P> In the interview, he admitted he contributed to the atmosphere of hate that surrounded Malcolm and added, ``I was hurt by his assassination. I can't say that I approved and I really didn't disapprove. I was numb. But today looking back, Malcolm would have been much more valuable to us alive.'' </P>
<P> And in press conferences at which white reporters are allowed in, Farrakhan had praised Malcolm and cloaked himself in his mantle. </P>
<P> But according to a new documentary film, ``Brother Minister: The Assassination of Malcolm X,'' there is another side to Farrakhan. </P>
<P> The documentary shows a video made of a Farrakhan speech to his Nation of Islam followers in 1993 in which he says, ``I loved Elijah Muhammad enough so I would kill you. .... We don't give a damn about no white man's law when you attack what we love.'' </P>
<P> ``Was Malcolm your traitor or ours? And if we dealt with him like a nation deals with a traitor, what the hell business is it of yours? You just shut your mouth and stay out of it. Because pretty soon we are going to be a nation and a nation has got to be able to deal with cutthroats and turncoats. ... There are certain paths you don't cross.'' </P>
