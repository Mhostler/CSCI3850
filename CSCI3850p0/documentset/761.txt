<DATELINE>TBILISI, Georgia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  At least 15 people were killed and dozens injured early Sunday when a Georgian passenger train crashed into a stationary freight train just outside the capital Tbilisi, the interior ministry said. </P>
<P> The passenger train was traveling from the industrial suburb of Rustavi to Tbilisi. </P>
<P> Most of the dead and injured were taken away by passenger cars because many ambulances in the cash-starved former Soviet republic are not in service. </P>
<P> Guguly Mayduradze, deputy director of the Georgian railroads, told reporters the likely cause of the accident was signal failure. Many signals do not work because of a lack of funds while others have been stolen for the copper they contain. </P>
<P> At least 21 people were killed and 80 were taken to hospital after a commuter train slammed into derailed freight wagons in southwest Russia Thursday. </P>
