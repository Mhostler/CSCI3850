<P>  The government's main economic forecasting gauge took its sharpest tumble in more than 1 3/8 years in February, the Commerce Department said Wednesday, pointing to slower growth ahead. </P>
<P> The Index of Leading Indicators, which is supposed to forecast economic trends six to nine months ahead, fell 0.2 percent in February, continuing a pattern of weakness that began last fall. It was its sharpest monthly decline since a matching 0.2 percent drop in July 1993 and the biggest fall since a 0.4 percent slide in May that year. </P>
<P> The leading index measures a basket of economic indicators from unemployment benefit claims to building permits. It has been trending downward since last September, when it was flat before declining 0.1 percent in October. It rose slightly by 0.1 percent in November and 0.2 percent in December and then was flat again in January. </P>
<P> The decline in the index during February was consistent with several other recent signs of economic slowing, including weaker sales of new cars and of new and existing homes. </P>
<P> The Federal Reserve boosted short-term interest rates seven times in a year through Feb. 1 to slow the economic pace without stalling the expansion. Costlier credit has caused consumers to rein in their spending. </P>
<P> Seven of the 11 separate indicators in the leading index weakened in February, led by lower commodity prices that fell at the sharpest rate since November 1992, according to department officials. </P>
