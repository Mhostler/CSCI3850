<P>  Greek customs officials, acting on a tip, seized 220 pounds of cocaine hidden in a sack of rice Thursday and said there were nine more sacks which may also contain the drug. </P>
<P> The cocaine was in a bag of rice stored at a customs shed at the port of Piraeus, near Athens, waiting for transport to Albania or Italy, customs officials said. </P>
<P> The rice arrived earlier in December on an Antiguan-flag ship coming from Ecuador. </P>
<P> Customs officials said they searched the rice after a tip from U.S. drug enforcement officials. They said they would search the remaining bags of rice stored at the shed Friday, and gave no reason for putting off the search. </P>
