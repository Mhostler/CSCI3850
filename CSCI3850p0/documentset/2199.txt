<P>  Actor Raul Julia, star of ``Kiss of the Spider Woman'' and the Addams family films, died Monday of complications following a stroke, hospital officials said. He was 54. </P>
<P> The Puerto Rican-born actor was also known for playing left-wing Latin American political figures and for his stage work including the role of Mack the Knife in an acclaimed Lincoln Center revival of ``The Threepenny Opera.'' </P>
<P> He suffered the stroke two weeks ago and lapsed into a coma last week. He died at North Shore Hospital in Manhasset, Long Island. </P>
<P> Julia starred as the charmingly ghoulish father, Gomez, in the hit movie ``The Addams Family'' and its sequel ``Addams Family Values.'' </P>
<P> Julia also played the political prisoner Valentin in the film version of the Argentine novel ``Kiss of the Spider Woman.'' His co-star, William Hurt, won the Academy award for best actor for his role as the hairdresser who shares Valentin's prison cell. </P>
<P> Julia began his career as a prolific Shakespearean stage actor, starring in the New York Shakespeare Festival's ''Macbeth'' (1966) and ``Othello'' (1979) and opposite Meryl Streep in ``The Taming of the Shrew'' (1978). </P>
<P> In one of his latest appearances, Julia played the Brazilian rainforest activist Chico Mendes in a recent HBO film, ``The Burning Season.'' </P>
<P> In the 1989 movie ``Romero'', he portrayed El Salvador's assassinated Archbishop Oscar Romero, one of the martyrs of the civil war in El Salvador. </P>
<P> The film was banned by the government there because of its indictment of the ruling right-wing party. The Archbishop, an outspoken critic of the rightist government, was murdered in San Salvador Cathedral in 1980. </P>
<P> ``I think Romero would believe that he has not been forgotten, that his dream for a better El Salvador will come true,'' Julia said in an interview with the Boston Globe in March. </P>
<P> Julia was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico on March 9, 1940, where his father Raul ran a restaurant and his mother Olga was a non-professional opera and church singer. </P>
<P> He is survived by his wife and two children. </P>
