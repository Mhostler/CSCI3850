<P>  Nick Price took advantage of favorable morning conditions Friday to move into a two-stroke lead early in the second round of the PGA Championship at Southern Hills Country Club. </P>
<P> The British Open champion from Zimbabwe, who began the warm, sunny day tied for the lead with Colin Montgomerie of Britain at three-under-par, birdied the third hole and the 10th to reach five-under. </P>
<P> Montgomerie, a playoff-loser at the U.S. Open, was teeing off later in the day. Joining the burly Scotsman at three-under was diminutive American Corey Pavin. </P>
<P> Pavin, who along with Montgomerie is seeking to win his first major championship, birdied the fourth, fifth and 10th holes after starting the day at even par after an opening 70. </P>
<P> After Thursday's play, which saw just 14 sub-par rounds among the 151-man field, Southern Hills seemed to be more yielding in the relatively still air. </P>
<P> The player taking best advantage of conditions early on was Blaine McCallister. </P>
<P> McCallister, who struggled in with a four-over 74 on Thursday, was six-under for his second round through 12 holes. McCallister stood at two-under for the tournament after posting seven birdies against one bogey with six holes still to play. </P>
<P> Another player enjoying the morning was Jumbo Ozaki of Japan, who climbed to two-under through 12 holes with five birdies that took away the bad taste of a bogey-bogey start. </P>
<P> Price had predicted some low scores for Friday morning and said he was pleased to have gotten his afternoon starting time out of the way on Thursday. </P>
<P> ``The greens will obviously be a little better tomorrow morning,'' Price said following his opening round. </P>
<P> ``And I really like playing late-early (late on Thursday, early on Friday) because you seem to have more continuity than the guys who play early and then late.'' </P>
<P> Former Masters champion Ian Woosnam of Britain was not in such a positive a frame of mind. </P>
<P> The Welshman, who began the day one shot off the pace, improved to four-under-par with two early birdies before sinking at the seventh hole. </P>
<P> Woosnam put his tee shot into the trees on the right side of the 382-yard par-four hole, left his second shot in the rough short of the green and then landed his next in a bunker on the way to a double-bogey six. </P>
<P> On the par-three eighth hole, Woosnam took three putts for another bogey to fall to one-under. A bogey at the 14th left him at even par. </P>
<P> Raymond Floyd, who won the last PGA Championship played at Southern Hills in 1982, also struggled. </P>
<P> Floyd, who shot a first-round 69, bogeyed the first and double-bogeyed the third and fourth holes to topple from the leaderboard. </P>
<P> U.S. Open champion Ernie Els was having a bumpy ride. The South African, who began one shot off the pace, bogeyed the first three holes before beginning his climb back on the back nine. </P>
<P> A birdie at the 10th and an eagle at the par-five 13th brought Els back to two-under, level par for the day. </P>
