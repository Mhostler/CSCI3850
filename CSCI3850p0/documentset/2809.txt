<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Twenty-nine East Timorese protesters ended a 12-day sit-in at the U.S. Embassy Thursday and left Indonesia for exile in Portugal, hours after students clashed with security forces in the East Timor capital. </P>
<P> Officials overseeing their departure said the 29 youths, whose occupation of the embassy parking lot in Jakarta had grabbed headlines during a visit to Indonesia by U.S. President Clinton and other leaders, left on a flight for Amsterdam. </P>
<P> From there they will transfer to a flight to Portugal, officials said. </P>
<P> Their departure came as calm returned to East Timor's university in Dili following clashes between students and security forces, witnesses said. </P>
<P> The security forces had barricaded hundreds of students and staff inside the campus in the capital Dili after East Timorese protesters showered police with stones, witnesses said. </P>
<P> Timorese youths have been in the vanguard of fresh protests against Indonesian rule of the former Portuguese colony, which is not recognized by the United Nations. In the past six months there have been at least three clashes on or around the campus. </P>
<P> Thursday's confrontation was the latest in two weeks of violent protests, most of them triggered by rising tension between East Timorese and Indonesian forces. </P>
<P> Angry students stoned nearby houses and security forces, who replied with tear gas, effectively blockading more than 400 students and staff inside the campus. At least one security official was injured by flying stones, witnesses said. </P>
<P> Indonesia has said it will prosecute 30 East Timorese for their alleged involvement in last week's riots and protests. </P>
<P> Amnesty International said in a statement made available Thursday it was concerned about the fate of nearly 200 students involved in the Jakarta and Dili protests. </P>
