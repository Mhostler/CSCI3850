<P>  Sixteen Turkish dancing bears will shed their chains and take up a new life this week in a sanctuary designed to teach them to live on their own again, wildlife officials said. </P>
<P> The bears were taken off the streets over the past year under a government-backed rescue program to stem trafficking in this illegal but popular form of tourist entertainment. </P>
<P> The Turkish Society for the Protection of Animals said in a statement released this week the bears would be retaught bear skills -- foraging for food and living in groups in a temporary shelter near the city of Bursa, south of Istanbul. </P>
<P> Under an international campaign started by the World Society for the Protection of Animals, the bears will one day be moved to a semi-wild sanctuary in the mountains close to Bursa. </P>
<P> Wildlife officials are trying to stop people from kidnapping wild cubs and raising them to dance, which often entails the bears being beaten and otherwise maltreated. </P>
