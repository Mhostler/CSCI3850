<P>  Canadian Paul Tracy took the provisional pole for Sunday's Monterey IndyCar race when he smashed the track record in practice Friday. </P>
<P> Tracy, a 26-year-old from Toronto who is the defending champion here, turned in a lap of 70.058 seconds, or 113.768 miles an hour, driving a Penske Ilmor. </P>
<P> Jacques Villeneuve, another Canadian and son of the late Formula One driver Gilles Villeneuve, was second fastest with a time of 71.010 seconds driving a Reynard Ford Cosworth on the road circuit in northern California. </P>
<P> Britain's Nigel Mansell, making his last IndyCar appearance before returning to Formula One for the final three races of the season, was third quickest in a Lola Ford Cosworth at 71.071 seconds. </P>
<P> Tracy, whose time was more than nine-tenths of a second quicker than the record set by teammate Emerson Fittipaldi of Brazil last year, thinks he could go even faster. </P>
<P> ``I got in only one clear lap. The car had good balance from the beginning,'' said Tracy. </P>
<P> Villeneuve was not so optimistic. ``We just managed to do a few quick laps at the end of the session on new tires,'' he commented. </P>
<P> American Robby Gordon was fourth fastest in a Lola Ford Cosworth at 71.146 seconds followed by the 1994 IndyCar series champion, Al Unser Jr., at 71.268 seconds in a Penske Ilmor. </P>
<P> Qualifying was to continue on Saturday. </P>
