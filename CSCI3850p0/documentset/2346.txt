<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Steven Hoffenberg, the flamboyant founder of scandal-ridden Towers Financial Corp, appears close to settling fraud charges brought by the trustee in the Towers bankruptcy case. </P>
<P> A press release quoting the trustee Alan Cohen was mistakenly sent Tuesday stating that Hoffenberg had consented to judgments of $516.5 million against him. PRNewswire, which carried the statement, later said the information should be disregarded. </P>
<P> The press release said that Hoffenberg has also agreed to cooperate with the trustee's efforts to conclude the investigation of the fraud of the company and to recover funds for the creditors of Towers Financial. </P>
<P> Terry Corrigan, a lawyer representing Cohen, said that the press release was ``incorrect and released in error.'' </P>
<P> A source close to investigations of Hoffenberg's alleged wrongdoings said he understood that a deal was to be announced shortly. </P>
<P> In addition to the bankruptcy court proceedings, Hoffenberg was indicted in both New York and Chicago on securities fraud charges. He also has been sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission. </P>
<P> Federal prosecutors and securities regulators have alleged that Hoffenberg, who supposedly built a financial empire on bill collecting, was running one of the biggest Ponzi schemes in history. </P>
<P> They allege he defrauded thousands of investors across the country of $460 million between 1987 and 1993. Authorities allege Towers sometimes collected debts for business but did not turn over the proceeds. </P>
<P> Hoffenberg had at one point agreed to a plea bargain in the New York criminal case but the deal collapsed and the indictment is still pending. </P>
<P> Towers filed for bankruptcy protection in March 1993 citing liability of $271.6 million and assets of $251.7 million. </P>
