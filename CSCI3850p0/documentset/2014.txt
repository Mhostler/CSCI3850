<P>  In a decision affecting millions of Roman Catholics, the Vatican strongly reaffirmed its stand Friday that worshippers who divorce and remarry cannot receive communion unless they abstain from sex. </P>
<P> The cast-iron ruling appeared to be aimed at some bishops, particularly in Germany, who have suggested that good Catholics who are deeply convinced that their first marriage was invalid could effectively exempt themselves from Church rules. </P>
<P> The Church does not allow divorce. Catholics can seek marriage annulments from Church tribunals but the process is often costly and can take years. </P>
<P> In the eyes of the Church, divorced Catholics who are not granted annulments are still married to their first partner. </P>
<P> ``The Church affirms that a new union cannot be recognized as valid if the preceding marriage was valid,'' a nine-page letter to the world's bishops said. </P>
<P> ``If the divorced are remarried civilly, they find themselves in a situation that objectively contravenes God's law. Consequently, they cannot receive Holy Communion as long as this situation persists,'' it said. </P>
<P> Communion, which according to Catholic teaching is the body and blood of Christ, is the centerpiece of the Mass. The letter was written by the Vatican's doctrinal watchdog department, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. It unequivocably reaffirmed the stand that only the divorced and remarried who abstain from sex can receive communion. </P>
<P> The letter was approved by the 74-year-old Pope John Paul, who has shown himself to be a stickler on Church rules regarding marriage and divorce. </P>
<P> It said that if Catholics who remarry outside the Church cannot separate for overriding reasons, such as raising children, they must ``take on themselves the duty to live in complete continence, that is, by abstinence from the acts proper to married couples.'' </P>
<P> The problem of how to deal with the complicated cases of many divorced Catholics who what to re-approach the Church resurfaced last year when German bishops issued a long statement on the subject. </P>
<P> The Germans said that many Catholics in such situations were personally convinced of the invalidity of their first marriage but unable to prove it before a Church tribunal. </P>
<P> The German bishops had suggested that the Church should respect the good faith decision of such Catholics when taken in consultation with their local priests. </P>
<P> The Vatican letter, however, rejected as ``inadmissible'' suggestions that the issue could be resolved by solutions based on personal conscience. </P>
