<P>  Dozens of cars and trucks were involved in a string of collisions in heavy fog on the Mobile Bay bridge Monday, killing one person and closing a busy interstate highway for six hours, police said. </P>
<P> Eighty-seven people were injured and several were in critical condition in local hospitals, said Sgt. Mike Boan of the Alabama state police. </P>
<P> About 130 vehicles were involved in five clusters of accidents during the morning rush hour over a four-mile stretch of Interstate 10, a major cross-country highway that runs from Florida to California. </P>
<P> ``Basically they ran into a wall of fog,'' said Boan. ``The cars in front slowed down but the ones behind didn't slow quickly enough.'' </P>
<P> A woman was killed when a group of eight vehicles burst into flames, he said. Other cars mounted barrier walls along the bridge but none fell into the water. </P>
