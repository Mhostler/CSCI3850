<P>  About 30,000 pigeons are being discharged from the Swiss army. </P>
<P> The army's carrier pigeon service will be disbanded next year under measures to cut military costs, the defense ministry said in a statement Thursday. </P>
<P> The army owns 7,000 pigeons and pays for the private care of another 24,000 kept ready for emergencies. </P>
<P> Shutting down the 77-year-old carrier pigeon service will save the army about $465,000 a year. </P>
<P> The birds were trained to make ``two-way'' flights -- flights between two command posts -- and were working up to three-way journeys. </P>
<P> The birds could cover round trips of up to 500 miles carrying messages, tape recordings and microfilm. </P>
<P> Their retirement will mean that 266 employees of the carrier pigeon service will have to be trained for other jobs. </P>
<P> ``It's really sad...apart from dogs these were the last small animals in the Swiss Army,'' said Sam Iselin at the federal communications office. </P>
