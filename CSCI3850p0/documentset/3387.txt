<P>  The White House and leading Democrats criticized incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich Thursday for signing a book contract worth more than $4 million, saying the deal raised serious ethical questions. </P>
<P> The charge followed media reports that Gingrich, who will assume the most powerful post in Congress in two weeks, will get a seven-figure advance from a New York publishing firm owned by Rupert Murdoch to write two books. </P>
<P> ``A $4 million advance for a member (of Congress) who is soon to be Speaker raises questions,'' White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said at her final briefing before she returns to private life after two years on the hot seat as President Clinton's press secretary. </P>
<P> Asked if she was suggesting that media magnate Murdoch was buying influence with the advance, Myers replied: ``I'm not drawing any conclusions, but I do think there are a number of questions that need to be answered.'' </P>
<P> Clinton, in a brief appearance to bid a public farewell to Myers, brushed aside questions about the $4 million advance. But he said, referring to his former job as Arkansas governor: ``I made $36,000 a year for 12 years and was glad of it. I don't even know how to think in these terms.'' </P>
<P> Gingrich's office dismissed the White House criticism. ``The Democrats seem to be suffering from book envy,'' Gingrich spokesman Tony Blankley said in a statement. </P>
<P> ``The public has read Al Gore's book, and now they are ready for something completely different. I would suggest that the Democrats join us in putting pen to paper, and may the best ideas win,'' he said. </P>
<P> HarperCollins Publishers said it had signed Gingrich to write two books for an undisclosed amount. The first, tentatively titled ``To Renew America,'' outlining Gingrich's political philosophy will be published in the fall of 1995. </P>
<P> The second, ``The Democracy Reader,'' will be a compendium of readings in American democracy with a commentary by Gingrich. </P>
<P> ``We won the rights to publish these books in a hotly contested bidding, with a number of major publishing houses participating,'' said HarperCollins senior vice president Jack McKeown, who added the company has a 750,000-copy first printing target for ``To Renew America.'' </P>
<P> House ethics rules ban honoraria and limit outside earned income to 15 percent of members' salaries. An exemption is allowed for book royalties. </P>
<P> The rules were crafted after Gingrich helped force the 1989 resignation of former Democratic House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas over a questionable book deal. Gingrich also has come under fire in the past for other book ventures. </P>
<P> Common Cause President Fred Wertheimer suggested in a letter to Gingrich that the Ethics Committee might need to review his generous book advance. </P>
<P> Myers said Gore had received a $100,000 advance for his book on the environment and ``all the details of that were fully disclosed.'' Gore cleared the arrangement with the Senate Ethics Committee before accepting the deal, she said. </P>
<P> Blankley said the Gingrich deal would meet ethics rules. </P>
