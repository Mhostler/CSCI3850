<DATELINE>LONDON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Princess Diana has denied press reports implying that she made a series of nuisance telephone calls to a friend, the Daily Mail reported Monday. </P>
<P> It said she made her unusual public denial because she felt she was being destroyed by the allegations, which have been featured on the front pages of Britain's tabloid press for two days. </P>
<P> ``What have I done to deserve this?'' the newspaper quoted the estranged wife of Prince Charles as saying. ``I feel I am being destroyed. There is absolutely no truth in it.'' </P>
<P> Members of the royal family rarely publicly comment on press reports about them, but the Daily Mail said Diana contacted its royal reporter Richard Kay and met him to pour out her heart about the allegations. </P>
<P> Rival newspapers published photographs of the pair holding their clandestine meeting in a car parked in west London. </P>
<P> Police and Buckingham Palace have refused to comment on the reports saying that Oliver Hoare, a close friend of Diana and Charles, complained to police last October about a stream of anonymous calls. Each time he answered the line stayed silent. </P>
<P> The newspapers said police traced the calls to Diana's residence at Kensington Palace, to her mobile telephone and to Charles's private line. </P>
<P> Diana, who tearfully announced nine months ago that she was withdrawing from public life, told the Daily Mail that she had nothing to do with the calls. </P>
<P> ``Somewhere, someone is going to make out that I am mad, that I am guilty by asociation, that the mud will stick,'' the newspaper quoted her as saying. </P>
<P> ``I am bemused by this constant attention, a level of intrusion that I thought would diminish. Photographers follow me constantly.'' </P>
<P> According to the newspaper, Diana released details of her private diary to prove she had not been at home at the time the alleged telephone calls were made. She also denied that police had interviewed her about the calls. </P>
<P> Phone calls have embarrassed the royal couple before. </P>
<P> Diana's private conversations with an infatuated male admirer who called her by the nickname ``Squidgy'' found their way into the media, as did intimate conversations that Charles is alleged to have had with his close friend Camilla Parker-Bowles. </P>
