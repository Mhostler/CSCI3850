<P>  An emergency room doctor who was overcome by mystery fumes emanating from a cancer patient sued the hospital where the incident occurred for $6 million Monday. </P>
<P> Julie Gorchynski's lawsuit against Riverside General Hospital and Riverside County claims the hospital has not done enough to solve the medical mystery of the patient's ammonia-like fumes and crystallized blood. </P>
<P> Gorchynski, who appeared on crutches at a news conference, said she is suffering from a disease caused by the fumes. </P>
<P> The 33-year-old doctor said the disease causes bone deterioration, and she has already undergone surgery on her left knee. </P>
<P> In addition to crutches, she said she is occasionally forced to use a wheelchair. ``I don't get out as often because of the pain,'' she said. </P>
<P> Gorchynski's troubles began February 19 when Gloria Ramirez, a cancer patient, was brought into the emergency room of Riverside General Hospital. </P>
<P> Gorchynski and five other emergency room workers had to be hospitalized because of the effects of the fumes coming from the patient's body. </P>
<P> The doctor said she could smell the ammonia and it made her lightheaded. She described how one nurse fainted. She said she picked up a syringe the nurse had been using to extract a blood sample from Ramirez and saw that the blood contained white crystals, a phenomenon she had not come across before. </P>
<P> Ramirez died in the hospital and because of the fumes and crystallized blood her body was placed in a sealed container. </P>
<P> Coroner's officers, dressed in protective clothing and looking more like astronauts than doctors, performed an autopsy on the body but could find no cause for the fumes or the unusual blood. </P>
<P> Ramirez's body was later buried in a sealed coffin. </P>
