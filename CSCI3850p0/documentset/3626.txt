<P>  Malawi President Bakili Muluzi Saturday dismissed suggestions that his predecessor, Kamuzu Banda, believed to be in his 90s and senile, was too old to stand trial for the murders of four politicians. </P>
<P> Speaking to Reuters in an interview, Muluzi said if Banda was too aged now to stand trial, he should not have run in presidential elections held in May. </P>
<P> ``I mean, if he stood as a presidential candidate, supposing he had won? How would he have ruled this country for five years?'' Muluzi said. </P>
<P> ``The court will have to decide that. I believe the commission of inquiry found him alert and able to remember about this case and, therefore, one wonders why people are suggesting he cannot stand trial.'' </P>
<P> Banda and a close associate, John Tembo, were formally charged Friday with the 1983 murders of four politicians. </P>
<P> A government inquiry last week said police acting on official orders killed cabinet ministers Aaron Gadama, Dick Matenje and Twaibu Sangala and parliament member David Chiwanga in May 1983 and disguised their deaths as a car accident. </P>
<P> The government placed Banda under house arrest and detained Tembo when the commission made its findings public. </P>
<P> The diminutive Banda, self-proclaimed life president, ruled Malawi for three decades after independence from Britain in 1964 until he was ousted in the country's first multi-party elections last May. </P>
<P> Information Minister Brown Mpinganjira said Thursday the four politicians were apparently killed for opposing Tembo's appointment as acting president during Banda's absence. </P>
<P> Tembo, in his early 60s, was minister of state and virtual prime minister before last year's elections. He was regarded as the power behind the aging Banda. </P>
