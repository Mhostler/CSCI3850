<P>  Russia said Wednesday former President Jimmy Carter's peacekeeping mission to Bosnia worsened prospects for a lasting peace settlement, Interfax news agency reported. </P>
<P> On the eve of a visit to Moscow by Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, the agency quoted a senior Russian official as criticizing Carter's mission of last December even though it produced a truce which is largely holding. </P>
<P> ``Actions by the Americans and in particular the peacekeeping mission of ex-president Jimmy Carter have led to toughening of the positions of both Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Muslims,'' it quoted the official, who was not named, as saying. </P>
<P> He said Russia would not resume contacts severed with the Bosnian Serbs last year unless they accepted the plan put forward by an international contact group, which includes both Russia and the United States. </P>
<P> ``After Carter's mission, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic broke completely loose and does not want to listen to any arguments apart from his own,'' the diplomat said. </P>
<P> Carter persuaded Bosnian Serbs and the Muslim-led government to accept a New Year truce intended to last four months and to agree to restart peace talks. </P>
<P> The unidentified official told Interfax that Russian officials and Silajdzic would discuss ways of persuading the Bosnian Serbs to accept the international peace plan during his two-day visit. </P>
<P> Under the plan, the Bosnian government and allied Bosnian Croats would control 51 percent of the former Yugoslav republic and the Serbs would have 49 percent, meaning they would have to cede a third of the territory they now have. </P>
