<DATELINE>TRENG ARMY BASE, Cambodia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Cambodian soldiers have begun to clear this devastated army base of thousands of landmines and booby traps laid by Khmer Rouge guerrillas during recent fighting. </P>
<P> Along a 1 3/8-mile stretch of Route 10 between O'Andong and Treng, a 50-foot steel traffic bridge has been blown up, the road is full of holes caused by explosives and is littered with landmines. </P>
<P> ``From here (O'Andong) to Treng there's so many mines, don't walk off the side of the road,'' Capt. Dom Udom told Reuters Sunday. ``We found 33 anti-personnel mines and five anti-tank mines this morning.'' </P>
<P> The mines were captured from the government last year and relaid when Khmer Rouge guerrillas overran Treng Army Base May 1, he said. </P>
<P> ``The Khmer Rouge captured them from us at Pailin last year,'' he said. </P>
<P> Pailin was captured in March, 1994, but lost one month later after the Khmer Rouge launched a fierce counterattack to retake their stronghold, which is rich in gems and timber. </P>
<P> The mines along Route 10 were identified as Russian-made anti-personnel mines, which guarantee an above-the-knee amputation, according to one expert. </P>
<P> Most government casualties in the recent fighting around Treng were caused by landmines or booby traps, hospital officials in Battambang said. </P>
<P> On May 12, government troops recaptured Treng and pushed the main Khmer Rouge force back into the western foothills of Pailin. </P>
<P> Before retreating, the rebels also laid thousands of bamboo spikes, many wired to booby-trapped mortar bombs or Chinese-made rifle grenades. </P>
