<P>  Caitlin Thomas, widow of the poet Dylan, was laid to rest alongside her husband in the local churchyard here Wednesday, ending a remarkable chapter in the history of this close-knit Welsh community. </P>
<P> Dylan and Caitlin Thomas spent most of their turbulent, drunken and penurious marriage in this tiny town, the model for his world-famous play for voices, ``Under Milk Wood.'' </P>
<P> But Caitlin's decision to join her husband in death surprised all but a few of the townsfolk who had witnessed their quarrelsome marriage. </P>
<P> More than 1,000 people attended the ceremony at St Martin's Church -- described by Dylan in a poem as ``this sea-wet church the size of a snail, its horns through mist.'' Some came out of respect, many out of curiosity. </P>
<P> Caitlin, who was living in Sicily with former actor Giuseppe Fazio before she died last week at the age of 80, wrote after Dylan's death in New York in 1953: ``I can't decide now if I liked the bloody man ... all his betrayals and weaknesses.'' </P>
<P> But George Tremlett, a local bookseller and Dylan's biographer, who became friendly with Caitlin, said she decided to be buried next to him during her last stay here in 1988. </P>
<P> ``She spent a month here. She retrod her past life -- the Boat House (where the couple lived), Brown's Hotel (their favorite pub) and she felt at peace,'' he said. </P>
<P> Caitlin and Dylan, notorious for their bouts of heavy drinking, violent quarrels and outlandish behavior, have entered into the town's folklore. </P>
<P> Caitlin, with her nude sunbathing on the balcony of the Boat House where they lived, her wild drunken nights and propensity for dressing in flamboyant costumes and dancing at the annual carnival, scandalized and fascinated the locals. </P>
<P> ``She was smashing with those brightly colored skirts. I suppose nowadays she'd be called a hippie,'' said Bobby Gleed, who ran the butcher's shop in Laugharne for 40 years. </P>
<P> Mayor Dilys Jones said: ``She did some daft things in her lifetime, but now that's all forgotten.'' </P>
