<P>  Mexico's top law enforcement official said Monday he was investigating whether a former deputy attorney general at the hub of a political scandal had stashed drug-trafficking funds in U.S. banks. </P>
<P> Mexican Attorney General Antonio Lozano Gracia said charges related to what he called ``illicit enrichment'' may be incorporated into the pending extradition request for the former deputy attorney general, Mario Ruiz Massieu. </P>
<P> Lozano will discuss the matter when he meets Attorney General Janet Reno Tuesday. He told an audience at the private Center for Strategic and International Studies that investigators had turned up ``large'' deposits by Ruiz Massieu. </P>
<P> But he said they were still attempting to establish whether the allegedly ill-gotten gains ``originated in drug trafficking.'' Previously, Mexican officials have privately circulated charges that Ruiz Massieu deposited about $7 million in a Houston bank account last year. </P>
<P> The former top prosecutor already stands accused of a coverup in connection with the Sept. 28 murder of his brother, Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, the number two official in the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party. </P>
<P> Raul Salinas, accused mastermind of the assassination and the elder brother of former president Carlos Salinas de Gortari, faces murder charges in the killing. </P>
<P> Lozano, in response to a question, said Carlos Salinas was not under investigation. Massieu was detained in the United States March 3, when U.S. customs agents charged he was travelling with $46,000 in currency that had not been properly declared. </P>
