<P>  Scores of frightened Muslim prisoners of war were forced to chant ``Bosnia belongs to Serbia'' in front of television cameras, recent pictures from Bosnian Serb television showed Tuesday. </P>
<P> The pictures also showed Bosnian Serb special forces jamming a Turkish fez (hat) onto the head of a plainly terrified young prisoner. Some Serbs refer contemptuously to the Bosnian Muslims as ``Turks.'' </P>
<P> Serb-controlled Banja Luka television said the pictures were shot ``recently'' in the vicinity of Bihac, as Serb forces closed in on the Muslim-held enclave. </P>
<P> The prisoners, lined up in rows, appeared cowed. But when ordered they chanted: ``Bosnia is Serbian just as Moscow is Russian.'' </P>
<P> The film showed Bosnian Serb special forces bayoneting the Bosnian government flag over a municipal building in Sokolac, on the south outskirts of Bihac town. </P>
<P> Sokolac was taken several days ago. </P>
<P> A special forces commander speaking to Banja Luka's film crew says Serb forces are in the suburbs of Bihac and about to take it. </P>
