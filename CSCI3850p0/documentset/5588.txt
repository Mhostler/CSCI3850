<P>  More than a thousand Buchenwald survivors gathered at the former death camp Saturday to unveil a memorial to the half a million gypsies murdered by the Nazis in Europe. </P>
<P> The memorial, a collection of low pillars bearing the names of concentration camps, was inaugurated at the start of two days of ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Buchenwald by U.S. troops. </P>
<P> ``I can only hope that this monument will open the eyes of young people to the consequences of racism and exclusion so that what happened here never happens again,'' said gypsy survivor Franz Rosenbach. </P>
<P> Gypsies believe the fate of their people, targeted like Jews for extermination on racial grounds , has been largely neglected by historians. </P>
<P> Several hundred gypsies, who prefer to be known as Sintis and Romanies, attended the inauguration, along with many other former inmates -- Jews, foreign prisoners of war and German political prisoners. </P>
<P> ``We are here in the presence of the survivors to speak of those who were violated, humiliated, enslaved, tortured and cruelly murdered,'' Thuringia regional state premier Bernhard Vogel said before unveiling the memorial. </P>
<P> ``We recall the darkest chapter in German history at the place where it happened.'' </P>
<P> The memorial is the first to be erected at a concentration camp in Germany in honor of the gypsies killed by the Nazis. </P>
<P> Vogel, a close ally of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, acknowledged gypsies still faced hostility in Germany. </P>
<P> ``Ignorance and prejudicies against Sintis and Romanies still characterise their image in the world today. Many of them feel more tolerated than respected by us,'' he said. </P>
<P> An estimated 51,000 people died in Buchenwald, a bleak hillside camp on the outskirts of Weimar. About 11,000 of them were Jews and 5,000 were gypsies. </P>
<P> Prisoners at Buchenwald were worked to death as slave labourers in the camp quarry or at outlying arms factories. </P>
<P> There were no gas chambers, but thousands were shot, hanged or tortured to death by the camp's SS guards or became victims of brutal medical experiments. </P>
<P> Sunday, the Thuringia state government will host a memorial cermemony in the German National Theater in Weimar which will be attended by Israel's Chief Rabbi Yisrael Lau. </P>
<P> Former prisoners from the International Buchenwald Committee, who assemble at Buchenwald every year, will hold a final ceremony at the site Sunday afternoon. </P>
<P> An Israeli youth orchestra will perform and Rabbi Menachem Klein of Frankfurt's Jewish community will intone the Kaddish, the Jewish prayer for the dead. </P>
