<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin Tuesday reasserted Israel's claim to all of Jerusalem and said he would oppose a full Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank. </P>
<P> Rabin said the government would go on building housing for Israelis in Arab East Jerusalem, which Palestinians see as the capital of a future state. </P>
<P> ``The supreme thing above all is a united Jerusalem as the capital of Israel under Israeli sovereignty,'' Rabin told Israeli students during a tour of the Old City. </P>
<P> Rabin also said that for its own security, Israel must hold on to parts of the occupied West Bank which border Jordan. </P>
<P> ``I want the Jordan border, the River Jordan to be the security border of the state of Israel,'' Rabin said. </P>
<P> Israel captured the West Bank and Arab East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East War. </P>
<P> Rabin made his comments at a delicate time in the implementation of Israel's self-rule accord with the Palestinians. </P>
<P> Bloodshed between Arabs and Israelis is on the rise and the issue of Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank was pushed to the forefront last month when settlers tried to expand a site at Efrat near Bethlehem, prompting clashes between Israeli troops and Palestinian villagers who said they owned the land. </P>
<P> The PLO has said continued settlement could wreck the peace process. </P>
<P> In Cairo Tuesday, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Israel had brought relations with the Palestinians to crisis point by illegally expanding West Bank settlements. </P>
<P> In Ramallah in the West Bank, Israeli soldiers stopped Jewish settlers from setting up a new enclave by a main road. </P>
<P> Rabin, accompanied by hard-line Mayor Ehud Olmert and a cordon of bodyguards and police, walked the narrow cobblestone streets of the Old City's souk where some Arab shopkeepers startled him with cheerful greetings. </P>
<P> ``You're a good man,'' one said. </P>
<P> Christian clergymen at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, Jesus's traditional burial place, embraced him. </P>
<P> But a few Jews unhappy with his peace policies jeered Rabin at the Wailing Wall, sacred to Judaism. Two youngsters called him a ``murderer'' and a ``traitor'' and a man blamed him for the killing of Jews by Palestinian gunmen. </P>
<P> After his walking tour, Rabin hinted that building of housing for Jews in the Arab sector might come at the expense of construction in the West Bank. </P>
<P> ``It cannot be ruled out that we will have to redirect resources, and instead of building in areas that are not within Jerusalem's municipal borders, focus investment within the borders,'' Rabin told a news conference. </P>
<P> Rabin, born in the city, said Israel would never return to its borders before the 1967 war, when he was army chief. </P>
<P> Palestinians demand the return of all of the West Bank, home to more than a million Arabs. </P>
<P> The tough-talking Rabin, who swept to power on a vow to accelerate peace moves while ensuring Israeli security, has been losing ground in opinion polls to right-wingers who oppose any territorial concessions and assail the surge of violence. </P>
<P> Rabin shared the 1994 Nobel peace prize with his foreign minister Shimon Peres and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat for the 1993 accord which launched Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho, areas once held by Israel. </P>
<P> Talks on the core issues of Jerusalem and the settlements are due to begin by mid-1996. </P>
