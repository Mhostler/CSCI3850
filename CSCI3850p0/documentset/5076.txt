<P>  Israel's finance minister said Tuesday a plan to boost the Jewish state's security by physically separating Israelis and Palestinians was too expensive and would not work. </P>
<P> ``The goal is not achieved (by implementing the plan) and the price is too high,'' Avraham Shochat told Israel Television. </P>
<P> An intitial plan unveiled last week by Police Minister Moshe Shahal envisaged building a fence in parts of the occupied West Bank, increasing road blocks and employing technological devices to prevent Palestinians from crossing into Israel. </P>
<P> The cost, according to some estimates, runs as high as $700 million. </P>
<P> Members of Israel's treasury, appointed to check the economic aspects of the plan said it would be impossible to implement. </P>
<P> ``The committee which examined the idea of separation has doubts about the possibility of implementing it from the political, military and economic perspectives,'' the treasury committee said in a statement. </P>
<P> Committee members recommended that the government, scheduled to discuss the plan in two weeks, scrap the idea. </P>
<P> The cabinet first adopted the idea of separation in January after two Palestinian suicide bombers opposed to the Israel-PLO peace deal blew up 21 Israelis at a bus stop north of Tel Aviv. </P>
