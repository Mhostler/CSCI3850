<P>  Britain Tuesday took issue with Israel's plans to expand Jewish settlements in Arab East Jerusalem. </P>
<P> ``We criticize attempts to create settlements in occupied territory whether in Jerusalem or in the West Bank,'' British Consul General in Jerusalem Richard Dalton told reporters. </P>
<P> Israel's decision to expropriate 131 acres of Arab-owned land to build settler housing in East Jerusalem has angered Palestinians and sparked warnings the step could wreck the 1993 Israeli-PLO peace deal. </P>
<P> The PLO Monday urged the United Nations Security Council to take measures to stop the confiscation and asked the Arab League to meet to discuss the subject. </P>
<P> Israel, which annexed East Jerusalem after capturing it in the 1967 Middle East war, claims the Arab sector as part of its ``eternal capital.'' Arabs view East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state. </P>
<P> The city's 155,000 Palestinians complain they are prevented from building new houses in an attempt to drive them out of Jerusalem, while Israel continues to expand East Jerusalem's Jewish population, now 160,000. </P>
<P> Jerusalem's Higher Islamic Council briefed Western diplomats in the holy city Tuesday on what council members described as Israeli incursions against Muslim holy places and Palestinian property. </P>
<P> Mohammed Nusseibeh, acting chairman of the council, said he complained to the diplomats about Israeli excavations under al-Aqsa mosque, Islam's third holiest site. </P>
<P> Nusseibeh said the excavations were damaging the 1,300-year-old shrine and attempts by armed Jews to pray on the site violated Islamic rules. </P>
<P> ``We want them to convey to their governments the grave situation and we want to warn the Israeli government that the repercussions will be very bad for the entire peace process,'' Nusseibeh said. </P>
