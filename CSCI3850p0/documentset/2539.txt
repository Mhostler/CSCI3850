<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Two of the National Basketball Association's giants went head-to-head Thursday night and Shaquille O'Neal poured in 41 points but Patrick Ewing had the last laugh. </P>
<P> Ewing's baseline jumper with 2.4 seconds left lifted the New York Knicks to a 101-99 victory over the Orlando Magic. </P>
<P> The (3-0) Knicks survived a late 12-3 tear by the Magic as Ewing sank the game-winner from 15 feet following an O'Neal bucket that tied the game at 99-99 with 10 seconds remaining. </P>
<P> Ewing finished with 24 points, while O'Neal added 17 rebounds to his 41 points, including the final six for Orlando. </P>
<P> ``We came back at the end but Patrick hit a great shot,'' said O'Neal, who has 87 points in his last two games. </P>
<P> ``I think that we expected them to call a timeout and (instead) Starks came flying up the side and dished to Ewing, who made a great shot.'' </P>
<P> Derek Harper scored 22 points for New York and added nine assists. Anfernee Hardaway, who missed a desperation three-pointer at the buzzer, chipped in 27 points for Orlando. </P>
<P> At Detroit, rookie Grant Hill scored eight of his 23 points during a 31-13 second half run to lead the Pistons to a 112-110 win over the Indiana Pacers. </P>
<P> The Pacers held an 84-67 lead with 4:15 left in the third before Hill and Terry Mills each scored eight points in the run that gave the Pistons a 98-87 edge with 5:32 left. </P>
<P> Mills finished with 20 points and 11 rebounds for Detroit, which won its third straight game. </P>
<P> Rik Smits, who led Indiana with 23 points, hit a pair of foul shots to knot the game at 108-108, but missed a six-foot jumper at the buzzer that would have sent the game into overtime. </P>
<P> At Cleveland, Mark Price led a balanced attack with 18 points and 12 assists and Bobby Phills added 17 points as the Cavaliers beat the Milwaukee Bucks 108-88. </P>
<P> Cleveland had seven players in double figures in recording their first victory in their new home, the Gund Arena. </P>
<P> Milwaukee lost for the first time in three games, while the Cavs improved to 2-1. </P>
<P> The Bucks led by one point with 6:51 left in the third quarter when Cleveland scored 18 of the final 23 points in the period to grab a 73-61 lead. </P>
<P> Milwaukee forward Glenn Robinson, the top overall pick in the NBA draft, scored nine points in 29 minutes. </P>
<P> In Sacramento, Clifford Robinson scored 25 points and Rod Strickland added 16 with 12 assists as the Portland Trail Blazers beat the Kings 104-84 to remain undefeated. </P>
<P> Robinson shot 8-of-16 from the field and scored 13 of his team's 21 third-quarter points to put the game away. </P>
<P> The Blazers took a nine-point lead in the first quarter and never relinquished it, improving to 3-0. </P>
<P> Mitch Richmond led the Kings in scoring for the third time in as many games with 23 points, while rookie Brian Grant had 18 with nine rebounds. </P>
<P> In Los Angeles, Stacey Augmon scored nine of his 25 points during a 17-1 first-quarter run as the Atlanta Hawks earned their first win with a 108-91 victory over the Clippers. </P>
<P> The Clippers dropped to 0-3 after losing their first two games of the season to Portland in Japan last weekend. </P>
<P> The score was tied at 6-6 when Augmon ignited the run from which the Clippers would never recover. </P>
<P> Steve Smith chipped in 23 points for the Hawks, who lost their first four games of the season. </P>
<P> The Clippers were led by Loy Vaught's 20 points. </P>
