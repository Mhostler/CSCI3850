<P>  U.S. authorities have notified a prison inmate that his death sentence will be carried out March 30 in the first federal execution in 32 years, the Justice Department said Monday. </P>
<P> It said the execution of inmate David Chandler, who was convicted for his involvement in a 1990 drug-related murder of a police informant, will take place at a federal penitentiary in Terre Haute, Ind. </P>
<P> He was convicted in 1991 in Alabama of hiring another individual to kill a member of his marijuana smuggling ring who had become an informant. </P>
<P> Chandler, 42, became the first federal inmate to receive a death sentence under a 1988 law involving murders carried out in connection with a continuing criminal enterprise. </P>
<P> The federal Bureau of Prisons said five other inmates are awaiting execution under the same drug kingpin law. </P>
<P> Prison officials acknowledged that Chandler's execution, which would be carried out by lethal injection, could be delayed by his filing of a new appeal. </P>
<P> They said the last federal execution took place in 1963 when an Iowa inmate was hanged for murder and kidnapping. </P>
<P> The Supreme Court in 1972 struck down capital punishment as unconstitutional, but reinstated it four years later, with additional safeguards. </P>
