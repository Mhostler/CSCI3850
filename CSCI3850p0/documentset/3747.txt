<P>  Janis Joplin, Frank Zappa, Led Zeppelin, Neil Young, Martha and the Vandellas and the Allman Brothers Band were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Thursday. </P>
<P> The surviving members of Led Zeppelin reunited to play several of their 1970s classics in celebration of the glittering ceremony at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. </P>
<P> Rolling Stone Publisher Jann Wenner used the tenth annual induction dinner as the forum to announce the opening of the Hall's permanent museum in Cleveland Sept. 1, 1995. </P>
<P> Soul singer Al Green, who was inducted into the Hall of Fame by Natalie Cole, began the show singing his hit ``Take Me to the River'' backed by Paul Schaffer and the CBS Orchestra. </P>
<P> Melissa Etheridge paid tribute to Joplin by singing ``Piece of my Heart'' accompanying herself on accoustic guitar. </P>
<P> ``She was the only goddess in a sea of rock gods,'' said Etheridge, who accepted the award for Joplin, who died in 1970. </P>
<P> Lou Reed, believed to be fighting back bitterness over not being inducted to the Hall as a member of the Velvet Underground, gave a speech inducting the late Frank Zappa. ``I respected him and I know he respected me,'' said Reed after comparing Zappa to Andy Warhol. </P>
<P> The B-52s inducted Martha and the Vandellas. </P>
<P> The Allman Brothers rocked the house out of its post-dinner torpor with a firey version of ``One Way Out'' that had record industry moguls and others clapping and singing along. </P>
<P> ``If you let the people have a choice they will always respond to good music,'' said Willie Nelson as he inducted the Allmans, calling them ``one of the most exciting live bands to ever hit the stage.'' </P>
<P> Gregg Allman dedicated his award to the memory of his brother Duane, the band's lead guitarist who died in 1971. </P>
<P> Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam inducted Young, saying ``I hope Neil's feeling feisty tonight.'' Young in a gracious acceptance, offered profuse thanks to Ahmet Ertegun, who signed him to his first record deal as part of Buffalo Springfield. </P>
<P> Steven Tyler and Joe Perry of Aerosmith inducted Zeppelin. Tyler reminisced about hearing the band during its first tour, recounting a story about guitarist Jimmy Page stealing his girlfriend. </P>
<P> ``I never wanted to do this,'' said singer Robert Plant after accepting his award. ``I thought we'd always be rebels.'' </P>
