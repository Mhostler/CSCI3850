<DATELINE>MANCHESTER, N.H. (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Sen. Phil Gramm marched his newly official presidential campaign through the first battlefield state of the 1996 race Saturday, promoting himself as the Republicans' most electable conservative. </P>
<P> Gramm, the senior senator from Texas, vowed at a rally of more than 250 New Hampshire supporters that, if elected, he would get tough on crime, reform welfare and balance the federal budget during his first term in office. </P>
<P> ``We're going to balance the budget, and I won't run for re-election if I don't,'' said Gramm, who last week set a record by raising $4.1 million in a single event. </P>
<P> Gramm, 52, official declared in Texas on Friday that he was running for president. He is the first of nine major Republicans actively seeking the White House to formally declare his candidacy. </P>
<P> Gramm has already become a familiar face in New Hampshire, having visited the state repeatedly as he ``explored'' whether to make a presidential bid. The state will hold the first presidential primary, Feb. 20, 1996. </P>
<P> After speaking in Manchester, Gramm headed to a similar rally in Des Moines, Iowa. </P>
<P> Iowa is scheduled to hold the Republican Party's first presidential caucus Feb. 12, 1996. </P>
<P> A New York Times/CBS News poll published Saturday said 46 percent of Republicans nationally have not heard enough about Gramm to form an opinion about him. </P>
<P> Of the Republicans who felt they did know enough about Gramm to form an opinion, 23 percent veiwed him favorably, 13 percent unfavorably and 19 percent were undecided, the survey found. </P>
<P> In addition to promoting himself as the only true conservative in the race, Gramm maintains he has the leadership skills to continue the ``revolution'' begun in the November elections. </P>
<P> ``We need a leader with the courage and vision to define solutions to American's problems. And one that is tough enough to get the job done,'' Gramm told the Manchester rally. </P>
<P> The next big-name Republican scheduled to officially join the race is former Tennessee governor Lamar Alexander, who is to declare his candidacy Tuesday at events in Tennessee and New Hampshire. </P>
<P> Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, of Kansas, Sen. Arlen Specter, of Pennsylvania, California congressman Robert Dornan and television commentator Patrick Buchanan are expected to officially join the Republican field this spring. </P>
<P> Several other Republicans are also considering running, including Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana, who also visted New Hampshire Saturday. </P>
<P> President Clinton has said he will seek re-election, and is not facing any big-name competition for the Democratic nomination so far. </P>
