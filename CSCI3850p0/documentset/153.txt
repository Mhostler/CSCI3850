<DATELINE>MINSK, Belarus (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Self-styled corruption buster Alexander Lukashenko seemed headed for victory Sunday in his drive to become the first president of the former Soviet republic of Belarus. </P>
<P> The central election commission said that by 8:00 am EDT 52 percent of more than seven million voters in the conservative republic had cast their ballots, clearing the required 50 percent barrier. Polling ends at 3:00 pm EDT. </P>
<P> Lukashenko, favorite after the first round, has won popularity with promises to halt inflation and clean up the state apparatus that he says is corrupt from top to bottom. </P>
<P> ``My first move will be to fight corruption, first of all at the top. My list of corrupt government officials is growing and only two members of the government leadership will be able to stay in their posts,'' he said after casting his vote in the town of Shklov, 125 miles northeast of the capital Minsk. </P>
<P> ``I am voting for myself. For the first time a simple man has a chance to vote freely for a man just like himself,'' he said. </P>
<P> Lukashenko, 39, a populist with no experience of state administration, got a surprising 45 percent of the vote in the first round of voting in June against 17 percent for Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, 58. In Sunday's run-off round, the winner needs 50 percent plus one vote. </P>
<P> Lukashenko has yet to announce a coherent economic program or to name his candidate for prime minister. </P>
<P> ``It's no problem to find a prime minister, it's easier than finding a milkman,'' he told reporters. </P>
<P> ``Any politician is a populist, including Clinton. So far you have heard my promises, you will see my deeds shortly,'' he said. </P>
<P> Until now, the nominal head of state in post-Soviet Belarus was the chairman of parliament. </P>
<P> After seven decades of Soviet rule, Belarussian language and culture have become largely assimilated by Russia and most residents readily identify with their large eastern neighbor. </P>
<P> More than two years of economic decline have generated serious doubts over whether the country can survive on its own or even wishes to do so. </P>
<P> In two televised debates Thursday and Friday Lukashenko accused authorities of trying to torpedo Sunday's polls by persuading voters to stay home. </P>
<P> Kebich has stressed his experience as premier since 1990 and said the government had managed to avoid economic collapse. He has also campaigned on his personal role in forging a monetary union with Russia which has yet to come into force. </P>
<P> But most voters, interviewed as they came out of polling stations in Minsk, blamed Kebich for economic hardship. </P>
<P> ``I voted for Lukashenko, but not because of his personality,'' said Valentina Churin, an economist in her late thirties. ``I voted against Kebich because his team has led the country into this terrible economic crisis.'' </P>
<P> Lukashenko told reporters the West should not be afraid of him. ``Foreign policy will remain the same.'' </P>
<P> He denied some media comparisons to Russian ultra- nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, saying the latter backed Kebich. </P>
<P> Lukashenko said he regretted the collapse of the Soviet Union and hoped some form of a union betwen ex-Soviet republics would be restored. </P>
