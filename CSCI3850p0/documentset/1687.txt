<DATELINE>TURKU, Finland (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Rescuers searching the Baltic Sea for survivors of the Estonia ferry disaster concluded Thursday that more than 900 people were now missing or dead, over 80 more than previously thought. </P>
<P> New figures from the Estonian Interior Ministry showing several dozen more passengers than earlier reported and the discovery of more bodies raised the number of dead and missing from 826 to 909. </P>
<P> A three-nation investigation commission began a search for clues into what caused one of the worst maritime disasters in peacetime history. </P>
<P> A fresh report from a survivor appeared to back earlier testimony that water leaked through loading doors into the car deck. According to some Swedish experts, this could have caused the ferry to tip over. </P>
<P> Aundus Maidre, a 19-year-old Estonian, said he was sleeping on the first deck of the Estonia, below the car deck, when he heard a sound like trucks falling over. </P>
<P> ``I heard a loud crashing sound like the noise falling trucks would have made,'' he told Reuters from his hospital bed. ``Then the whole ship started to list. I ran upstairs, past the car deck, and saw water gushing in. It came very fast.'' </P>
<P> This appeared to bear out a statement from a surviving crewman, Henrik Sillaste, that water entered the car deck through the forward loading door shortly before it sank early Wednesday on a voyage from Estonia to Sweden. </P>
<P> A Swedish maritime union official alleged Wednesday that inspectors had discovered a faulty seal on one of the Estonia's loading doors just a day previously. </P>
<P> But the inspectors themselves said they had found only minor safety faults during an inspection of the ferry in Tallinn harbor Tuesday. </P>
<P> Announcing the new passenger list provided by the Estonian government, the head of the Finnish rescue operation, Raimo Tiilikainen, told a news conference: ``We have rescued 140 people and found seven more bodies. The new number of passengers and crew is 1,049, so 844 people have not been found yet.'' </P>
<P> He offered no explanation for the rise in the number of people believed to have boarded the ship in Tallinn. Rescuers and the boat's Estonian operator earlier estimated that either 964 or 975 were on board the ferry. </P>
<P> ``The figures have now changed so many times that I really don't know if they are the last or not. I don't know how reliable they are either,'' Tiilikainen said. </P>
<P> A Finnish member of the investigation team, Kari Lehtola, asked about the exact number of dead and missing, replied: ``I don't know, every hour comes a new number.'' </P>
<P> Antti Jaaskelainen, the pathologist in charge of identifying 65 of the salvaged bodies, said the ``unreliable'' lists were hampering his work. </P>
<P> ``The names are changing all the time. To identify (people) we must know who was on the ship, but if the passenger lists are as unreliable as this it will be very difficult,'' he said. </P>
<P> Tiilikainen said bad weather provided a fresh complication for rescuers trying to recover the bodies of victims. ``We promised to try to start looking for the wreck today but it seems the weather is against us,'' he said. </P>
<P> Searchers hope to find the wreck and to recover the remains of victims thought to have gone down with the ship. They also hope to carry out an initial survey using robot cameras to see if it can can be raised to establish what went wrong. </P>
<P> But the first stage, using a so-called sidescan sonar device to find the wreck on the seabed, could not start as intended because of heavy winds and rough seas. </P>
<P> Doctors said it was a miracle anyone had come out alive from the storm-whipped Baltic Sea and rescue crews were resigned to recovering hundreds more corpses. </P>
<P> But the overriding question was yet to be answered: What caused the German-built, 14-year-old ferry to sink so rapidly in the cold, pitch-dark waters off Finland that only 138 of the 1,049 people on board managed to survive? </P>
