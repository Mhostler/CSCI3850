<P> The agent, testifying at a hearing over whether to hold the suspect in custody, also said one witness in a car had to slow down to avoid hitting McVeigh as he walked through a parking lot across the street from the federal building before the explosion. </P>
<P> The agent, John Hersley, said there were no witnesses who saw the suspect in the area of the building after the blast. </P>
<P> The federal magistrate hearing the testimony ordered that McVeigh, the prime suspect in the bombing which killed over 100 people, remain in custody, saying the evidence against him was ''highly credible.'' </P>
<P> U.S. Magistrate Roland Howland ruled that McVeigh, a former soldier and a member of right-wing paramilitary groups, be held for a grand jury investigation that is expected to decide whether to indict him for the bombing. </P>
