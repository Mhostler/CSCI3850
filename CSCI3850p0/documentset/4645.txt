<P>  Latvia says Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin has promised to work with it to avoid conflict over the withdrawal of up to 2,000 former Russian servicemen and their families who stayed on after Moscow pulled out of the Baltic country. </P>
<P> The government press service, quoted by local news agencies, said Tuesday that Latvia received a letter from Chernomyrdin in which he pledged Moscow would help find ``a peaceful and conflict-free solution'' to the dilemma of these people. </P>
<P> Latvia and Russia signed an agreement almost a year ago under which all servicemen demobilized from forces in the newly independent Baltic country after Jan. 28, 1992, should have left by last Aug. 31. </P>
<P> The letter was delivered Monday after senior Latvian government officials said that the cabinet planned to debate Tuesday deporting those former servicemen whom both sides agree have remained in breach of the treaty. </P>
<P> In the event, the cabinet did not formally address this issue, a spokesman for Prime Minister Maris Gailis said late Tuesday. ``This question was not on the government schedule today,'' spokesman Rolands Tjarve told Reuters. </P>
<P> Riga has ordered the estimated 2,000 illegals to register by Wednesday for temporary residence up to April 30. After that deadline, they must leave. </P>
<P> Less than half the people in question have turned up at immigration authorities, officials say. </P>
<P> Tjarve suggested that, unless the government decided otherwise, the course of deportation remained open. </P>
<P> ``Residents' permits are necessary, and those who have not acquired them have violated the law. The responsible ministries will have to act,'' he said. ``March 1 is now here, and the decisions have already been taken (under existing laws).'' </P>
<P> Russia has requested that Latvia extend the departure deadline until the end of 1995, saying more time was needed to settle practical matters of resettlement. </P>
<P> A senior Latvian immigration department official said that, as cabinet had not ruled on the issue, it would remain partly open, explaining that it would have to be resolved by the Interior Ministry. </P>
<P> ``If there is no concrete decision, we will decide within the Interior Ministry,'' Ugis Sulcs, deputy head of the ministry's citizenship and immigration department said after the meeting. </P>
<P> Technically, Moscow has little room in which to maneuver given that both governments Monday made the final exchange of ratified documents on the troop withdrawal agreement, meaning they have now officially put it into force. </P>
<P> But, from the released version of Chernomyrdin's letter, it was clear that he viewed the issue of demobilized troops as part of a much broader move towards better Russian-Latvian relations. </P>
<P> ``Chernomyrdin expressed the hope that, taking into consideration the interests of both nations, the focus of cooperation will be on achievments in not only the economic but also in the humanitarian sphere, which directly influences the two countries' residents,'' the BNS news agency quoted the letter as saying. </P>
<P> ``Russia is also ready to cooperate with the (responsible) Latvian authorities to peacefully and without confrontation settle the matters related to Russian servicemen demobilized after Jan. 28, 1992,'' the reported text continued. </P>
<P> Riga's version of the letter also quoted Chernomyrdin as saying the recent completion of the troop withdrawal deals had ``added to the momentum'' of the bilateral relationship. </P>
