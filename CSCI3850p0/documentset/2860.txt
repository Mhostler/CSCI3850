<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Seven of 11 civilian employees charged with mishandling police emergency calls that might have prevented the killing of a teen-ager will be disciplined, Mayor Ed Rendell announced Monday. </P>
<P> ``The system clearly didn't work. There was human error,'' Rendell said on the NBC ``Today Show.'' He spoke after excerpts of taped exchanges between callers and the police workers. </P>
<P> He said the incident showed the need for ``a thorough overhaul.'' </P>
<P> On Nov. 11, Eddie Polec, 16, became the target of a roving band of suburban teen-agers seeking to avenge a rumored sexual assault. </P>
<P> He was beaten with baseball bats and left to die on the steps of St. Cecilia's Church, where he had served as an altar boy. Meanwhile, concerned residents had flooded the police ''radio room'' with calls of increasing intensity about a disruption in the neighborhood -- the beating. </P>
<P> But a full 45 minutes passed before police units arrived at the scene in Northeast Philadelphia. </P>
<P> The mayor said if several early calls had been correctly coded for a computerized priority-setting system, police officers might have been dispatched in time. </P>
<P> He said there had been a highest priority ``assist officer'' call at the time, but noted ``that was over in eight minutes ,,, That was just an excuse.'' </P>
<P> Rendell's announcement touched off harsh scrutiny of the 911 system in the nation's fifth largest city where the police force is already conducting an internal investigation. </P>
<P> City Councilman Brian O'Neill called for an immediate overhaul of a system he described as ``dysfunctional'' in Philadelphia but not in other cities. ``This was an avoidable problem,'' he said also during the ``Today Show.'' </P>
<P> Meanwhile, three of five Abington youths arrested in the incident face judicial proceedings this week to decide whether they should be tried as juveniles or adults. </P>
