<P>  Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said Saturday Israel was satisfied with the way Yasser Arafat's Palestinian self-rule authority dealt with its demands following the abduction of a soldier by Muslim guerrillas. </P>
<P> ``I think by and large they responded to our demand,'' Peres told Israel Television. </P>
<P> Israeli troops tried to rescue the soldier, Cpl. Nachshon Waxman, Friday but he and another soldier were killed by guerrillas in the attempt. The troops also killed three guerrillas when they stormed their hideout near Jerusalem. </P>
<P> ``We never measured Mr Arafat by the degree of success but by the degree of mobilization, of readiness,'' Peres said. </P>
<P> ``And over the last two or three days I believe that Mr Arafat and the Palestinian Authority did show a readiness to counteract the dangers of Hamas,'' he said. </P>
<P> Earlier in the week Arafat's authority in Gaza rounded up some 300 activists of the Islamic militant group Hamas in response to a demand from Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin that he track down down the kidnappers. </P>
<P> Hamas strongly opposes the deal for Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho signed between Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel last year. </P>
<P> Peres said: ``It's clear Hamas is against the two of us because the two of us are for peace.'' </P>
<P> Israel broke off peace talks with the PLO following the abduction of the soldier. </P>
<P> Rabin, Peres and Arafat were joint recipients of the Nobel peace prize announced Friday. </P>
