<P>  An explosion at a Russian gas pipeline set ablaze a forest on Thursday, but officials said the fire, spotted from an airliner flying over Russia, had hurt nobody and would not affect buyers of Russian gas. </P>
<P> ``There was a leak of gas and a spark probably set off the fire,'' said an official from Russia's Ministry of Emergency Situations. ``If that plane had not been flying overhead, there would not have been any panic.'' </P>
<P> The fire was first reported by the crew of a Japanese Airlines (JAL) jumbo jet heading from Frankfurt to Tokyo, who reported a blaze rising to between 3,000 and 6,000 metres (9,800 feet to 19,700 feet) as they flew over northern Russia. </P>
<P> Russian officials said later the explosion took place in a gas pipeline near the town of Ukhta, about 1,200 km (800 miles) northeast of Moscow. Ukhta, in the remote semi-autonomous Komi Republic, is an oil-refining centre. </P>
<P> An official from the Ministry for Emergency Situations said nobody had been injured, the damaged section of the pipeline had been cut off soon after the blast and the fire had been put out. </P>
<P> Russian had enough gas reserves to ensure customer supplies were not affected and there were several alternative routes bypassing the pipeline, which is 1,400 mm (55 inches) in diameter. </P>
<P> ``It was a big fire because it was a big pipeline -- you can almost stand in it,'' an official at producers Gazprom said. </P>
<P> Russia is a major producer of natural gas and a major supplier to a number of Western European countries. </P>
<P> ``There will be no influence on gas supplies to customers, we have reserves and we can compensate for (the explosion) from other sources,'' the official said by telephone. </P>
<P> ``They closed the section very quickly. There is no problem. we haven't got any problems.'' </P>
<P> The state of Russia's pipeline network has caused widespread international concern, amid a series of major oil leaks in the last 12 months, most of them caused by years of poor maintenance and neglect. </P>
<P> The biggest leak in recent times affected an oil pipeline near Usinsk, some 300 km (200 miles) north of Ukhta, where up to 120,000 tonnes of oil spilled into the tundra. </P>
<P> Environmentalists fear much of the oil has not been cleaned up properly and that it will make its way into rivers and the sea once the last winter snows melt. </P>
