<DATELINE>THE WOODLANDS, Texas (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Scott Hoch found his golf legs Friday and fired an eight-under-par 64 to charge up the leaderboard and into the halfway lead at the $1.4 million Houston Open. </P>
<P> Hoch stood at 12-under-par 132 after two rounds for a two-stroke lead over unheralded Willie Wood. </P>
<P> First-round leader Steve Rintoul of Australia added a 70 to his opening 66 and fell into third place along with 22-year-old Justin Leonard, four strokes off the pace at 136. </P>
<P> Masters champion Ben Crenshaw made cut by one stroke when he sank a 12-foot putt for birdie on his final hole. He had a one-over 73 for the round and stood at 143. </P>
<P> Hoch said he began the tournament with sea legs. ``I went on a cruise last week,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``The way I started I kind of felt like I was still on the boat,'' added Hoch, who bogeyed two of his first three holes in his opening round. </P>
<P> On Friday, he carded six birdies and an eagle. </P>
<P> ``The greens were the big difference,'' said Hoch, who took advantage of a morning tee-off when scoring conditions were more favorable. </P>
<P> Hoch, who needed only a six-foot putt for eagle at the 15th hole, said he was inspired by playing with Nick Price even though the Zimbabwean missed the cut. </P>
<P> ``Anytime you play with the number one player in the world it's got to pump you up,'' Hoch said. </P>
<P> Wood, who lost his tour card after last season, shot six-under 66 to move into second place. </P>
<P> The 34-year-old Wood, who entered the tournament on a sponsor's exemption, has played in only one other PGA event this season and has been competing on the Nike Tour. </P>
<P> ``I know I don't have a lot of opportunites at PGA Tour events,'' said Wood, who opened his round with a 40-foot birdie. ``I've got to do something. I can't sit at home.'' </P>
<P> Leonard's round was highlighted by an eagle on the par-4 11th hole when he hit a 9-iron 139 yards into the cup on one bounce. </P>
<P> ``I holed a sand wedge last week and I didn't get to see it (go in),'' Leonard said. ``I looked at my caddie and said, 'well at least we got to see this one.''' </P>
