<P>  Canada, in a tense standoff with the European Union over North Atlantic fishing rights, expressed hope Saturday that talks between the two sides could soon get under way to grapple with the issue. </P>
<P> ``We're willing to meet the Europeans,'' said Eduardo del Buey, spokesman for the Foreign Affairs department in Ottawa. ''I'm sure in the next little while there will be some signals from one side or the other.'' </P>
<P> Spain said it will not negotiate until Canada releases a Spanish fishing trawler which was seized last week after accusations of overfishing. The vessel, the Estia, did not escape, although about 17 other Spanish and Portuguese trawlers did after Canadian gunboats gave chase in fogbound waters off the coast of Newfoundland. </P>
<P> Canada's Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin said Saturday there was no sign of the other trawlers in the disputed area of the Grand Banks known as the Nose and Tail, where Canadian gunboats continue to patrol. </P>
<P> ``Canada has already said it wouldn't negotiate with the Europeans as long as fishing is going on, but it looks as if the fishing has stopped now,'' said Bonnie Mewdell, spokeswoman for the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. </P>
<P> ``We're looking at diplomatic contacts, seeing if there is some basis for discussion. But no negotiations are going on. We want to stress that.'' </P>
<P> The Estia, which was seized after Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien authorized firing across its bows, is due to arrive in St. John's Sunday afternoon. </P>
<P> Ottawa said both the boat and its captain will be charged under a Canadian law that other fishing nations refuse to recognize. </P>
<P> ``We have no intention of releasing the ship,'' said del Buey. But the European Union's ambassador to Canada, John Beck, said Saturday that he supports diplomatic contact and a resolution through negotiation. </P>
<P> ``The last word is not negotiations, it's contact,'' Beck told Reuters. ``It's the only way I can see. It's got to be done by negotiations.'' </P>
<P> Beck joined the Spanish, German and French ambassadors in St. John's Saturday to show support for Europe's claim to more than its quota of 3,400 metric tons of turbot or Greenland halibut, set by the 15-member Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) earlier this year. </P>
<P> Spain and Portugal, the only European fishing fleets to catch the species, have already exceeded the EU's allocation out of a total quota of 27,000 tons. </P>
<P> Mewdell, who declined to outline the penalties the Spanish ship and its captain might face, played down the dispatch of a Spanish patrol boat under orders to protect other Spanish and Portuguese fishing vessels in the North Atlantic. ``It's one vessel in a large ocean,'' Mewdell said. </P>
<P> Beck said Europe is ``reviewing aspects of its relationship'' with Canada, but he dismissed Canadian media reports that the dispute could affect the G-7 meeting in Halifax this June. </P>
<P> ``Who would dream of such a thing at this juncture when we are actually trying to sort things out,'' he told Reuters. </P>
