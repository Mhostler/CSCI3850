<DATELINE>KUWAIT (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  France said Monday it was up to the United Nations, not the United States, to decide on the use of force if Iraq disobeyed a U.N. resolution ordering it to pull its troops out of southern Iraq. </P>
<P> French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told reporters that Washington should consult U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and Security Council members before taking military action against Iraq's President Saddam Hussein. </P>
<P> Further widening France's disagreement with the United States, Juppe also said full and formal recognition of Kuwait by Iraq would be ``a very important event'' and should be taken into account by the United Nations in considering the question of sanctions on Iraq. </P>
<P> Iraq has announced its recognition of Kuwait and its border but has not taken legal steps to confirm its decision. </P>
<P> Juppe's remarks at the end of a three-hour visit to show solidarity with Kuwait spelled out France's split with Washington over how to handle Iraq following the latest crisis it caused in the Gulf by moving troops near Kuwait. </P>
<P> U.S. officials say Washington has the right and intention to use force if Saddam fails to comply with the U.N. resolution ordering its troops to leave southern Iraq. </P>
<P> Washington has also opposed easing U.N. sanctions, which are crippling the Iraqi economy, until Baghdad obeys all obligations imposed on it by the United Nations. </P>
<P> Juppe made clear that France differed with Washington on both issues. </P>
<P> Asked if the United States had a U.N. mandate to use force if Saddam did not pull back his troops, Juppe said: ``I think it belongs in this case to the Security Council to decide what must be done.'' </P>
<P></P>
<P> ``Not a new resolution. The secretary general and the Security Council have a role to play in that case and the permanent members and the members of the Security Council, too.'' </P>
