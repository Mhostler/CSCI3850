<DATELINE>MOSCOW (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The ruble soared a record 24.8 percent Thursday as the Russian central bank intervened to reverse Tuesday's 21.5 percent crash, but many dealers said the currency was now overvalued and set to fall again. </P>
<P> Youthful dealers clapped to celebrate the currency's meteoric rise on Moscow''s Interbank Currency Exchange, known by the acronym MICEX. </P>
<P> But they said a realistic rate for the ruble would be around 3,100-3,300 to the dollar. It was quoted in the interbank market around 2,900. Earlier the ruble leaped to 2,994 from Wednesday's 3,736 and Tuesday's all-time low of 3,926. </P>
<P> ``The authorities have pushed too hard as usual. This will not do any good,'' said one dealer. </P>
<P> Dealers said the ruble benefited from a huge initial offer of $361 million, much of which came from the central bank. </P>
<P> Alexander Selivanov of Kontinent Bank said the central bank had placed a huge sell order ahead of MICEX trading. </P>
<P> As the ruble rocketed the central bank was able to buy $155 million during the session, scaling back its initial action and appearing to intervene against the ruble publicly. </P>
<P> The central bank also intervened Wednesday, when bank chairman Viktor Gerashchenko said it had sold $90 million on MICEX to prop up the ruble. It has sold more than $600 million so far this month and over $3 billion in August-September. </P>
<P> The Russian currency has been rebounding on central bank support since Tuesday. Senior economists warn that the bank's foreign exchange reserves have been running at critically low levels of $1.5 billion and say the crisis is far from over. </P>
<P> Earlier, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin appointed ousted Finance Minister Sergei Dubinin's first deputy as Russia's new acting finance minister. But dealers said the ruble's rise had nothing to do with the appointment. </P>
<P> Dubinin, a reformer, was fired by President Boris Yeltsin Wednesday after the currency debacle. </P>
<P> Yeltsin asked the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, to dismiss Gerashchenko, but it postponed a decision to next week. Gerashchenko told the Duma's budget committee he saw no reason to go. </P>
<P> ``A change in names in the Finance Ministry does not mean anything,'' said Alexei Vasilyev of Sibirsky Bank. </P>
<P> ``The important thing is the central bank. It can really influence the ruble-dollar market. I doubt Gerashchenko will be sacked,'' said another dealer. </P>
