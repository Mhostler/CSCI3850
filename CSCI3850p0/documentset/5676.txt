<P>  Indian banks and major bourses were shut for a second day on Wednesday because of the death of former prime minister Morarji Desai, creating major difficulties for money and stock market traders caught short by the unexpected closure. </P>
<P> Thursday and Friday were already scheduled holidays, and Desai's death resulted in markets and government offices being effectively shut down for a whole week ahead of Easter. </P>
<P> Indian money market traders were particularly badly affected, with the inter-bank call money trade in a state of confusion. </P>
<P> ``The market is left high and dry and many fund managers are left with open positions,'' an angry bank treasury head said. </P>
<P> Bankers complained that authorities were slow to decide whether the banks would remain shut or open. </P>
<P> The Bombay, Delhi and Calcutta stock exchanges were closed, along with major commodities markets. </P>
<P> ``It's creating a lot of problems for us,'' said Bombay metals trader Surendra Parikh. ``Cheques are not being cleared, and since our market depends on international trade, we face a risk to imports and exports also.'' </P>
<P> ``It is bad for our business,'' said M.G. Damani, a senior Bombay broker and a director on the Bombay Stock Exchange. ``It has upset the plans of some brokers who were planning to mobilise funds during these two days before the four-day weekend.'' </P>
<P> Stock brokers said they were upset because some of them were stuck with unplanned outstanding positions. </P>
<P> The end of the current account period of the Bombay Stock Exchange for group A shares, scheduled on Wednesday, has now been postponed until next week. </P>
<P> Operations on the electronic National Stock Exchange (NSE) have also been affected with this week's pay-in and pay-out by the bourse postponed to next week. </P>
<P> Although the NSE was open on Tuesday and Wednesday, the bank closures will prevent brokers from submitting payments. </P>
<P> The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said it had rescheduled its 91-day and 364-day treasury bill auctions to Saturday from Wednesday. </P>
<P> Desai, prime minister from 1977-79, died in Bombay on Monday at the age of 99. His body will be cremated in the western city of Ahmedabad on Wednesday afternoon. </P>
<P> The Times of India said it was very unusual for banks to remain closed for four consecutive working days. The closures have left economic life in Bombay, India's commercial capital, at a virtual standstill, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> Many holidaymakers were stranded without cash. Very few banks in India have automatic teller machines. </P>
<P> ``There will be terrific confusion at the banks and there could be a shortage of cash when they reopen on Saturday and on Monday,'' said M.R. Pai, secretary of The All India Depositors Association, which represents bank customers. </P>
<P> The enforced closure could mean that banks may not meet their required cash reserves position stipulated by the central bank, said a bank treasury manager. </P>
<P> ``Many banks are short on their fortnightly cash ratio compliance. The central bank should have been better prepared,'' he said. </P>
<P> Banks have to report their fortnightly reserve position to the central bank every other Friday. </P>
