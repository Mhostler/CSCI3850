<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The lawyer for Edward Leary, the unemployed computer expert charged with firebombing a packed subway train earlier this week, said his client is innocent, The New York Times reported in Saturday editions. </P>
<P> The lawyer, Stephen Murphy, told the newspaper that Leary, 49, vehemently denied his guilt in Thursday's attack, which injured 48 subway riders in Lower Manhattan Wednesday. </P>
<P> Murphy said Leary has insisted on his innocence while handcuffed to a hospital bed and fading in and out of consciousness from the morphine dulling the pain of his burns. </P>
<P> ``He knows nothing more than anybody else does about it. And he's appalled by all these headlines and politicians and police calling him the mad bomber,'' Murphy was quoted as saying. </P>
<P> Murphy told the Times his client was just another victim of the explosion. </P>
<P> ``He vehemently denies his guilt,'' he said. </P>
<P> Law enforcement sources said Friday the explosion, which sent Lower Manhattan into a panic, was the first of several Leary had planned to terrorize New York City into paying extortion. </P>
<P> Authorities said the Scotch Plains, N.J., man was the bomber who set off a crude incendiary device aboard a train packed with Christmas shoppers in the Wall Street district. </P>
<P> Leary, who was arrested a day after the fiery incident, was among those injured by the blast, was covered with burns on almost half his body. </P>
<P> The bomb -- a mayonnaise jar filled with gasoline with a timing device ignitor -- set off flames that turned passengers on the train into human torches. </P>
<P> Leary faces numerous charges of assault when a grand jury convenes to hear the case. </P>
