<P>  Panic-stricken passengers held up a sign that read ``Help, drunken driver. Call the police!'' as their bus zigzagged down an Italian motorway. </P>
<P> The 90-minute nightmare ended with the arrest of the inebriated bus driver after a passing motorist spotted the SOS, scribbled on a piece of card in ballpoint pen, on one of the vehicle's windows and alerted police. </P>
<P> ``(The driver) was blind drunk,'' said one of the passengers. ``When we told him to drive more carefully, he took his hands off the steering wheel and laughed at us.'' </P>
<P> Tour company Ayala Viaggi on Wednesday said the hair- raising ride took place Monday when 20 Italians returning from a holiday in the Canary Islands were on their way from Milan's Malpensa airport to the northern town of Bergamo. </P>
<P> The driver, Attilio Turani, had his license taken away after police found him to be four times over the legal alcohol limit. Turani, 42, told police he had drunk just one glass of wine. </P>
<P> A representative for Ayala Viaggi told Reuters the incident was regrettable but added: ``these things happen.'' </P>
