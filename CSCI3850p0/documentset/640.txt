<DATELINE>LONDON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A controversial gathering of Muslim militants got under way peacefully in London Sunday, shielded by a tight police cordon after two anti-Israeli bomb attacks in the capital. </P>
<P> The International Muslim Khalifah Conference, billed as the biggest gathering of Islamic fundamentalists outside the Middle East, has been seen as a flashpoint between radical young Muslims and the Jewish community in Britain. </P>
<P> Its organizers deny any anti-Jewish message but are avowedly opposed to the state of Israel which they accuse of waging war against Muslims throughout the world. </P>
<P> ``There is nobody anti-Semitic who is going to be at this conference, there is nobody anti-Jewish,'' said Farid Kassim, a spokesman for the militant student group Hizb ut-Tahrir which dominates the conference organizer, Muslim Unity Organization. </P>
<P> Sympathizers say the conference is a ``family meeting'' to discuss political and cultural issues like human rights and the Islamic religious revival. Speakers include prominent fundamentalist dissidents from Saudi Arabia. </P>
<P> By mid-afternoon the only disturbance at the conference was the arrest of two gay rights protesters outside. Police broke up a demonstration by placard-waving homosexual rights campaigners at Wembley in northwest London. </P>
<P> ``Islamic bigots burn queers alive,'' read one placard left in the street after the protesters were hauled away. ``PLO and Hamas persecute queers,'' said another. </P>
<P> Kassim blamed the British media for much of the bad publicity preceding the conference in a tense atmosphere between Jews and Muslims after bomb attacks in London last month on the Israeli embassy and a cultural center. </P>
