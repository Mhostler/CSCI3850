<P>  A sexy ad for the fashion film ``Ready to Wear'' that features supermodel Helena Christensen wearing only a few feathers, stockings and high heels has sparked a fight between Miramax Films and the movie rating agency. </P>
<P> The Motion Picture Association of America has said it would pull the movie's ``R'' rating if the company used the advertisement, in which Christensen is lying on her stomach with her back covered with boa feathers but with her side uncovered. </P>
<P> The picture appeared recently in an advertisement by Columbia Records to promote the film's soundtrack, and included a line saying ``See the Movie.'' </P>
<P> The APAA contends the phrase was enough to turn the print spot into an ad for the movie. </P>
<P> Celebrity lawyer Alan Dershowitz accused the ASSOCIATION of abuses and censorship after they threatened to pull the film's ''R'' rating because of the ad. </P>
<P> ``What they wanted Miramax to do was to put fake bathing suit and underwear straps to create the illusion that Helena is wearing underwear and a bra,'' the lawyer said at a midtown Manhattan hotel news conference Thursday. </P>
<P> He said most theater owners will not run an unrated film even if the reason for being unrated has nothing to do with the content of the film. </P>
<P> ``This is just a ploy to get publicity,'' association President Jack Valenti said in a telephone interview. ``If they had gone by the rules, they could have appealed the matter directly to me. Of course, we will give them a hearing.'' </P>
<P> Miramax and Columbia Records want to run the ad in 40 markets on Christmas Day, the film's opener. </P>
<P> ``If any community is not ready for Helena Christensen's tush (backside), they can reject the ad,'' Dershowitz said. </P>
<P> The European supermodel said she could not understand the furor over the picture. </P>
<P> ``It's absurd that there would even be a problem,'' she said. ``The MPAA can run Sylvester Stallone with guns and project that to kids, but my left thigh is too much to bare.'' </P>
