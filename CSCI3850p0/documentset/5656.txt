<P>  The prime minister of Central African Republic, Jean-Luc Mandaba, resigned Tuesday, a day after opposition deputies in parliament laid down a motion of no confidence in his government. </P>
<P> The prime minister announced his resignation in a statement to radio and television, and presidency spokesman Alfred Poloko said it had been accepted by President Ange-Felix Patasse. </P>
<P> Mandaba, who was appointed in October 1993, is a member of Patasse's Movement for the Liberation of the Central African People (MLPC), which has 34 of the 85 seats in parliament. Mandaba named a coalition government but gave key posts to MLPC colleagues. </P>
<P> The poor, landlocked country of three million people was hard hit by a 50 percent devaluation of the regional CFA franc currency in January 1994 which pushed up prices of imports. </P>
<P> In February this year, Patasse accused a group of army officers and close associates of former president Andre Kolingba of preparing a coup against him. </P>
