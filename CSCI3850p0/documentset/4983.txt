<P>  Russia will carefully choreograph its World War II anniversary parade so that President Clinton will feel comfortable to attend, The New York Times, quoting Russian President Boris Yeltsin, reported Friday. </P>
<P> The newspaper said Yeltsin told foreign editors in Moscow on Thursday that Clinton wanted to come to Moscow for the 50th anniversary of the Allied victory in Europe but was ``a bit concerned about the whole scenario.''  To make it easier for Clinton to come, Yeltsin said, the V-E commemoration parade in May would be limited to war veterans and would exclude military equipment. </P>
<P> Of the World War II allies, only President Francois Mitterrand of France has said he will be in Moscow for the Russian celebration on May 9, the newspaper said. In the West V-E day is observed on May 8. </P>
<P> The New York Times said Yeltsin looked fit although five weeks ago he seemed unable to walk without assistance and had rumors swirling around him that he had been drinking heavily and needed medication for his back. </P>
<P> Yeltsin also said the two governments were drafting letters to address Russian concerns about NATO moving closer to its borders should some former Soviet bloc countries join the Western military alliance. </P>
<P> ``Now assume that some East European and Central European countries would join NATO and the border would move immediately closer to Russia, so the situation would appear to suggest that we would again have a bloc situation with NATO,'' the daily quoted him as saying. </P>
<P> ``Is it really consistent with all-European security? No, it is not. The situation will not be calm.'' </P>
<P> The United States wants Russia to join Partnership for Peace, an organization designed to maintain close links with NATO, the newspaper said. </P>
