<P>  A baby girl was born in the wreckage of a car after a man crashed while taking his wife to the hospital, British newspapers reported Thursday. </P>
<P> Anu Jagota, 26, was already in labor when her husband's car skidded off the road after hitting a patch of ice. </P>
<P> The car plowed through a hedge and down a six-foot embankment to end up in knee-deep water. </P>
<P> Neither was hurt and husband Anil, 29, called for an ambulance on a mobile phone, said the newspapers. </P>
<P> Ambulance attendant Robin Percy delivered the baby in the car after seeing that its head was beginning to show. </P>
<P> ``When I held up their baby they were both in tears and I only just managed to hold them back myself,'' Percy told the Today newspaper. </P>
<P> The couple, who already have a two-year-old daughter, said they would name their new baby girl Robin after the attendant. </P>
