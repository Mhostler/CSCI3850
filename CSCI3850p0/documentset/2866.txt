<P>  Angola's UNITA rebels Monday said government warplanes had bombed the northern village of Sumba over the weekend, killing 13 civilians in a new cease-fire violation. </P>
<P> UNITA radio said two children were among those killed in the bombing of the UNITA-controlled village about 15 miles east of Soyo, a support base for offshore oil production seized by government forces in October. The radio, monitored in the nearby island state of Sao Tome and Principe, said government forces had carried out public executions of UNITA officials in Uige province in northwestern Angola over the weekend. </P>
<P> The radio earlier said air force planes bombed the guerrilla-held town of Bailundo in the central highlands and army long-range guns shelled two other towns. It said two government fighter-bombers attacked Bailundo Saturday morning causing substantial casualties and material damage. </P>
<P> Bailundo is 50 miles north of Huambo, capital of the central highlands province of the same name, which government forces recaptured from UNITA earlier this month. </P>
<P> UNITA radio reported that government troops had shelled rebel positions at Ebo and Balingudo in Kwanza South province on the northwestern fringe of the highlands at the weekend. It said the incidents were the latest in a series of government violations of a six-day-old cease-fire that was supposed to halt fighting in the 19-year-old civil war. </P>
<P> There was no independent confirmation of the cease-fire violations listed by UNITA but a Reuter correspondent in Huambo reported continued fighting in the area. UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola) has been fighting the ruling MPLA (Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola) since independence from Portugal in 1975. </P>
<P> The two sides signed a new peace agreement Nov. 20 following collapse of an earlier accord reached in May 1991. </P>
