<P>  She wrote America's classic tales of family life -- ``Little Women'' and ``Little Men'' -- fought slave owners and beef-eaters, supported women's rights and come next fall she may become known as a good-old fashioned thriller writer. </P>
<P> Louisa May Alcott you've come a long way, baby. </P>
<P> Random House publishers announced Monday that it will publish next fall a previously unknown novel by the famed American children's book author who died in 1888 that is completely unlike her previously published novels. </P>
<P> Called ``A Long Fatal Love Chase,'' the 273-page novel set in Europe is about a woman, Rosamond, being chased by a drug-using cad twice her age, Philip Tempest, who wants to marry and imprison her while she fights for her freedom in and out of castles, convents and insane asylums and across moors. </P>
<P> There are fist-fights, murders and hints of sex, real and imagined. </P>
<P> Written in 1866, two years before she wrote ``Little Women,'' the novel was rejected by her publisher on the grounds of being too sensational, but Random House editor Ann Godoff says it is in fact, ``a very adult novel. I imagine it is the most adult work she ever produced.'' </P>
<P> Godoff says that as editing goes there is little she would change, even if there was a way that she could somehow commune with the author. But she says she is not a fan of the title since it gives too much of the plot away. </P>
<P> The work was housed for many years with Alcott's other papers in Boston's Houghton Library. Then Alcott's descendants put it up for sale and it was bought by Kent Bicknell, a rare book collector and founder of the Sant Bani school in Sanbornton, New Hampshire. </P>
<P> Since the book was never published, Bicknell said he also acquired the copyright. </P>
<P> ``The copyright does not automatically travel with the manuscript but I made it part of the deal. Had she published it, the copyright would have long been in the public domain.'' </P>
<P> Bicknell then struck an agreement with Random House to publish it, hoping for increased sales of the book, stirred by the new film version of ``Little Women'' that is opening shortly. The book will be out in September. </P>
<P> ``Alcott wrote a lot of Gothic short stories that have only been published since the 1950s. They will be republished next year under the title, 'Louisa May Alcott Unmasked.' She was a fascinating woman -- an abolitionist, a vegetarian, a fighter in the women's suffrage movement and the temperance movement,'' he said. </P>
<P> He added that next year she will be known as a thriller writer and who knows maybe Hollywood will film ``A Long Fatal Love Chase.'' </P>
