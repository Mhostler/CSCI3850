<P>  Workmen have begun freezing the ground around the Leaning Tower of Pisa as part of an ambitious project to stop it from falling. </P>
<P> Pisa officials hope the latest phase of the project, expected to be completed early next year, will allow them partially to reopen the white marble tower to tourists. </P>
<P> It was closed in 1990 after fears that it could collapse. </P>
<P> Workmen this week began pouring liquid nitrogen into 178 holes around the tower to freeze the ground. This will prevent dangerous vibrations at the base of the monument during the next phases of a salvage project. </P>
<P> Freezing the ground around the 12th century belltower, which Galileo is said to have used for his experiments on gravity, will help stabilize terrain while workmen remove cement and rocks from salvage attempts in 1870 and 1935. </P>
<P> The next phase of the project calls for a huge ring of cement to be placed underground around the foundation of the tower, built as a belfry for the adjacent cathedral in Pisa's lawned Piazza dei Miracoli. </P>
<P> Ten steel cables will link one side of the ring to firm layers of earth some 164-feet below. Each of the cables will be able to withstand some 100 tons of pressure. </P>
<P> Engineers say that will pull the 191 feet tower back one inch from its lean and stabilize its tilt at about 16.5 feet off the perpendicular. </P>
<P> Spokesman Cirano Galli said engineers believed the cable solution could last for at least 50 years. </P>
<P> An international committee of engineers is still studying a permanent project to save the tower. </P>
<P> Galli said Pisa officials hoped the tower could reopen to a limited number of visitors next year. </P>
<P> ``I don't think we will be able to return to the way it was before. At first we most likely will have to limit the number of people allowed to climb it,'' he told Reuters. </P>
<P> Until it was closed in 1990, nearly a million people a year made the frightening spiral climb up 294 steps to the top. </P>
<P> The 14,000-ton tower stopped leaning in 1993 after the first stages of the restoration project. </P>
<P> In the first stage, in 1992, steel rings were clamped around the walls of the lower storys to prevent the stones from buckling outward, which would cause the tower to collapse. </P>
<P> Later, 450 tons of lead counterweights were placed against the foot of the tower, reversing the tilt by one inch. </P>
<P> The tower, built in stages between 1174 and 1370, began to tilt when the ground settled. </P>
