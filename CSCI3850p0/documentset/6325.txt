<P> ``Despite much hard work and our efforts to look for creative solutions, the United States and Japan have been unable to reach an agreement regarding the auto and auto parts sector,'' Kantor said in a statement following a meeting with Japanese Minister of International Trade and Industry Ryutaro Hashimoto. </P>
<P> The failure of the last-ditch efforts to strike a deal on opening Japan's car and car parts markets means the United States is likely to carry through with its threat to impose punitive sanctions on billions of dollars of Japanese imports. </P>
<P> Kantor said Japan ``refused to address our most fundamental concerns in all areas. Discrimination against foreign manufacturers of autos and auto parts continues.'' </P>
<P> Kantor went on to say that President Clinton believes that closed markets ``have no place in an international trading system.'' He also accused the Japanese government of adopting ''a rigid ideological stance that appeared bent on failure, while we attempted to seek practical solutions to real problems.'' </P>
