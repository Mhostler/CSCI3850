<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Clinton appeared on the same platform Friday with embattled Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy to sign a bill, and the White House chief of staff said later that Clinton had confidence in Espy. </P>
<P> ``The president has confidence in the secretary of agriculture,'' declared White House chief of staff Leon Panetta when he was asked about Espy during a briefing to announce White House personnel changes. </P>
<P> Espy is under investigation for alleged ethics lapses, including accepting gifts from companies regulated by his department. He has begun paying back thousands in expenses he originally charged to private companies and taxpayers. </P>
<P> Panetta noted that the allegations against Espy are being investigated by an independent counsel, which is looking into possible criminal violations, and by the Office of Government Ethics, which is looking for ethics violations. </P>
<P> Earlier, Clinton appeared with Espy at a ceremony at the Agriculture Department to sign a bill creating a network of community development banks. </P>
<P> The fact that the Agriculture Department was the venue of the bill-signing was widely interpreted as a show of presidential support for Espy, although Clinton didn't sit next to him and only referred to him once during his remarks. </P>
<P> ``Secretary Espy has been especially active in the effort to change the way goverment functions here by increasing our ability to help the agricultural sector and redevelop rural America by drastically reducing the size of the Agriculture Department,'' Clinton said. </P>
<P> White House officials said the ceremony had originally been scheduled to be held at the White House, but was switched to the Agriculture Department as a rain venue. It didn't rain Friday, but the decision was made Thursday during a downpour. </P>
<P> However, the Agriculture Department released a statement headlined ``Espy Joined Clinton at signing of Community Development Bank Act,'' making sure Clinton's presence on Espy's turf was not lost on anyone. </P>
<P> The new law Clinton signed at the ceremony will help bring additional investment capital to urban and rural communities around the country. </P>
<P> Espy is the first agriculture secretary to be the object of an investigation by an independent counsel. The counsel, Los Angeles attorney Donald Smaltz, was appointed this month. </P>
<P> Espy says he has repaid anything that smacks of impropriety, including Tyson Foods Inc of Springdale, Arkansas, the largest U.S. poultry processor, for tickets to an NFL playoff game and a chartered plane to fly from Arkansas to Washington. </P>
<P> But new revelations keep surfacing. This week the news was about a leased car Espy was said to have kept at government expense. Espy's lawyers have been quoted as saying he paid back the $6,200 cost. </P>
