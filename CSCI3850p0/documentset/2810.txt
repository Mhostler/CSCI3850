<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Britain's Princess Anne visited the city many call the fairest Cape in the world Thursday, but spent her time in its teeming black shantytowns, stark legacies of South Africa's apartheid years. </P>
<P> She was greeted by ululating and dancing crowds when she visited two township nutrition schemes financed by the Save the Children Fund, of which she is president. </P>
<P> Her only view of the coastline that navigator Sir Francis Drake described in 1580 as ``the fairest Cape ... in the whole circumference of the earth'' was from her plane as she arrived. </P>
<P> Princess Anne inspected facilities used to offer thousands of impoverished children their single balanced meal of the day and spoke to staff, but she did not speak directly to the children. </P>
<P> ``She asked our background and our difficulties and where we got our funding. I told her we did everything -- even the toys we make with our own hands,'' said Miriam Nunu, who runs a creche. </P>
<P> Khayelitsha gained a fearsome reputation in the dark days of apartheid in the 1980s as a battleground for black factions in which scores of people died. </P>
<P> About 150 people shouting ``viva'' and waving clenched fists welcomed her. But not all could identify the woman dressed in red with white shoes and gloves. </P>
<P> ``I don't know who she is. Where does she come from? Is she maybe a princess?'' Vinah Dyantyi asked while feeding her baby. </P>
<P> Princess Anne was the first foreign royal visitor to Cape Town since her mother, then Princess Elizabeth, and King George VI came in 1947, the year before a white minority government formally implemented apartheid. </P>
<P> Her father, Prince Philip, visited Pretoria in May for President Nelson Mandela's inauguration as South Affrica's first democratically elected leader. </P>
<P> Queen Elizabeth is expected to visit South Africa in March. </P>
