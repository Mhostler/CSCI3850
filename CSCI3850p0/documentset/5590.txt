<P>  Four Malawian politicians murdered over a decade ago during the rule of former president Kamuzu Banda were given a state funeral Saturday. </P>
<P> Malawian President Bakili Muluzi told mourners his government would guard against ``the law of the jungle.'' </P>
<P> ``We are sending (a message) to all leaders in the land. Now and in the future. Never again in Malawi shall the law of the jungle prevail,'' Muluzi told 15,000 mourners packed at the Civil Service stadium outside the capital Lilongwe. </P>
<P> The remains were of Aaron Gadama, Dick Matenje, Twaibu Sangala and David Chiwanga were exhumed in March to help forensic investigations after Banda, his close associate John Tembo and four policemen were charged with the 1983 murders. </P>
<P> Muluzi told mourners: ``The forensic tests were found to be necessary for the cause of justice. There was a strong suspicion that they were murdered. If so, why were they murdered.'' </P>
<P> Banda, Malawi's autocratic ruler for three decades until ousted in last year's first multi-party elections, is under house arrest awaiting trial on charges of murdering the four. </P>
<P> Chairman of the Reburial Committee Sam Mpasu said the death of the ministers will haunt Malawians for many years to come. </P>
<P> ``It is a tragedy that will remain with us for many years,'' he said. </P>
<P> Tembo and the policemen have been in detention and Banda under house arrest since January after a government-appointed commission of inquiry found the four politicians were killed by police acting on official orders in May 1983. </P>
<P> The trial date has been provisionally set for April 24. </P>
<P> Banda's longtime companion Cecilia Kadzamira was put under house arrest last week in connection with the murders. </P>
