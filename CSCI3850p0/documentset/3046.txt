<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A man threatening to jump off the George Washington Bridge during the Wednesday morning rush hour called radio talk show host Howard Stern on a cellular phone and spoke to him on the air until police arrived. </P>
<P> The man talked with Stern for several minutes as he hung outside a railing on the bridge between New York and New Jersey, police said. </P>
<P> Identified later as Emilio Bonilla, 29, of the Bronx, he was taken to a local hospital for evaluation, police said. He was charged with reckless endangerment and drug possession because he was carrying cocaine in his pocket, police said. </P>
<P> Bonilla called Stern's live radio talk show from the bridge at about 8 a.m. (EST), saying his life was worthless and he wanted to jump. </P>
<P> ``I said I have to keep this man laughing,'' Stern said later on the nationally syndicated show. He estimated he spoke to the man for about seven minutes. </P>
<P> ``When I mentioned I had a movie coming out and he would miss it if he died, he laughed,'' Stern said. ``It caused him to say, 'Hey, wait a second, I want to stick around for the movie.''' </P>
<P> Police said the incident was neither a setup nor a hoax. </P>
<P> ``This appeared to be a bona fide distraught individual,'' said Port Authority Police Lt. Stanley Bleeker. </P>
<P> Asked why he thought the distraught man had called him, Stern said, ``You ever listen to the other jerks on the radio? Who would call them?'' </P>
<P> As Stern kept the man on the phone, Brooklyn resident Helen Trimble, who was driving across the bridge, stopped and grabbed Bonilla in a bear hug until police arrived. </P>
<P> ``If I had set this up, Helen would have been a stripper,'' Stern said. </P>
<P> ``This was a guy ready to go over the bridge. This was not a scam,'' he said. ``He said he didn't really see a reason to go on. He just felt like ending it all.'' </P>
