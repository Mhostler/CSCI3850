<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Fuel spouting from a leaking jet thruster Sunday forced Russian and U.S. engineers to draw up a new plan for Discovery's historic rendezvous with Russia's orbiting space station Mir. </P>
<P> With the meeting set for Monday, NASA all but abandoned plans for a close approach because of Russian fears that the spewing nitrogen tetroxide would damage the space station and a Soyuz capsule docked there. </P>
<P> ``It's really their call,'' Randy Stone, NASA's mission operations director, said Sunday. ``We have an agreement to fly in to 400 feet,'' Stone told a news conference after officials on both sides of the globe concluded two days of negotiations. </P>
<P> Stone told reporters that Discovery would fly no closer unless ground controllers and the astronauts found a way to fix the thruster, which sprung a leak minutes after the Friday liftoff from Florida. </P>
<P> ``I don't believe it's a closed issue,'' he said, adding that a decision to go on in could be made at any time during the rendezvous. </P>
<P> The repair attempts continued as the shuttle crew got ready to turn in for the night. The four men and two women were not in danger. </P>
<P> Stone described Russian engineers' work on the problem as ''extremely thorough'' and said their reluctance to let Discovery draw near was understandable. ``It's mostly the very methodical and conservative engineering approach that they take to things when they don't have a full knowledge of the system,'' he said. </P>
<P> Stone said a close approach was ``not critical to the success of our long-term program with the Russians.'' </P>
<P> Original plans called for Discovery to fly as close as 33 feet, then back away and circle the space station. </P>
<P> Before the flight, the United States and Russia agreed that the shuttle would stay at a distance of 1,000 feet unless certain of its 44 steering jets were working properly. The leaking thruster is not needed for the rendezvous, but is attached to the same manifold as another jet that is specified in the agreement. </P>
<P> The manifold is a system of pipes that supply propellant to the steering jets, which often leak when exposed to cold temperatures in space. The astronauts can stop Discovery's leak by shutting down the manifold, but their actions also would put the needed jet out of service. </P>
<P> NASA minimised the difficulties marring the mission intended as a pathfinder for another shuttle that will dock at Mir in June. </P>
<P> ``No matter what we do...we will still be getting a lot of good information for that flight, in testing our navigation sensors, our communication, and our flying qualities,'' co-pilot Eileen Collins said in an interview with Cable News Network. </P>
<P> Collins, NASA's first woman shuttle pilot, was assigned to monitor shuttle systems during the rendezvous and was not scheduled to be at the controls. For his part, Discovery commander Jim Wetherbee said Saturday that he would be ``very disappointed'' if he could not fly the rendezvous as planned. </P>
<P> A second, larger leak erupted in a thruster on Discovery's nose late Saturday, leading to a momentary scare. Wetherbee and Collins managed to stop the leak by closing a manifold and firing the jet to blow out an apparent blockage. </P>
<P> They tried the same procedure on the aft jet three times Sunday without success. ``We show no change in the jet,'' NASA Mission Control's Story Musgrave told Wetherbee from Houston. </P>
<P> Ground controllers told the crew the leak appeared to be diminishing and that they hoped it would ``heal itself'' in time for the shuttle's Monday appointment with Mir. </P>
<P> Sunday morning, Discovery was 2,300 miles behind the space station and gaining 219 miles with each 90-minute circuit of Earth. </P>
<P> Veteran cosmonaut Vladimir Titov, a member of Discovery's crew, helped prepare for the rendezvous by setting up navigation gear as well as a radio that will be used for direct communication between the two spacecraft. </P>
