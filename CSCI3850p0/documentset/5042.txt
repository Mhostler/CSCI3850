<NOTES> (Updates with banquet speeches by Mandela, queen)</NOTES>
<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Queen Elizabeth, making the first address by a British monarch to a South African parliament since 1947, paid tribute Monday to the post-apartheid nation as a force for regional stability and growth. </P>
<P> Welcoming South Africa's return to the Commonwealth last June, she said, ``You have an essential role to play as a new force for regional stability and growth.'' </P>
<P> The queen last visited South Africa 48 years ago with her father King George VI, when he opened parliament, her mother Queen Elizabeth and her sister Princess Margaret. </P>
<P> During the anti-apartheid struggle, which sometimes threatened to break the 51-nation Commonwealth apart, British officials said the queen supported certain moves to end legal racial discrimination. </P>
<P> At a later state banquet on the first day of the queen's six-day state visit, President Nelson Mandela welcomed her as British head of state, head of the Commonwealth and ``an avowed friend of our country.'' </P>
<P> He told the 420 guests, in a candle-lit setting: ``We knew, through the many years of privations, that Your Majesty's 'home from home' would one day emerge into the sunshine of the world community of democratic nations. </P>
<P> ``For this, we owe much to the support received from Your Majesty, Her Majesty's government and the people of the United Kingdom.'' </P>
<P> He accepted an invitation to visit Britain next year. </P>
<P> Mandela was dressed in a dark suit with the red and green ribbon of the Order of Merit awarded earlier by the queen. She wore a flowing white chiffon evening gown embossed with bouquets of gold and lame flowers, and a diamond tiara. </P>
<P> Monday was a day of pomp and ceremony, starting with the arrival of the royal yacht Britannia to a 21-gun salute in Cape Town harbor and a formal welcome from Mandela. </P>
<P> The queen, smiling in the sunshine, exchanged honors and gifts with Mandela, lunched in parliament after her speech and walked along a waterfront among thousands of admirers. </P>
<P> Other realities intruded. Police cleared about 100 black youths chanting ``We want food'' from the main gate of Mandela's Tuynhuis office before the queen arrived. </P>
<P> And a small group from Namaqualand in the remote Northern Cape sought the return of land taken away in the last century. </P>
