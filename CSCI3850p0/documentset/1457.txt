<DATELINE>GAZA (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  About 4,000 Palestinian mourners attended the Gaza Strip funeral of a police officer killed trying to break up a fight between secret police and armed militants of the Islamic Hamas movement, witnesses said. </P>
<P> Some held placards calling for action against the killers of Captain Yusri al-Hams, the first police officer killed in clashes with Palestinians since self-rule began in May. </P>
<P> The Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas, insisting it did not kill Hams, put out two statements within a few hours demanding the self-rule authority perform an autopsy to establish whose bullet killed him Saturday night. </P>
<P> Police reinforced security around the town of Khan Younis, sealing off the hospital where two Hamas members were being treated for bullet wounds from the incident. Police arrested three Hamas activists who turned up at the hospital. </P>
<P> About 1,000 of Gaza's 8,000-strong security forces attended the funeral in the southern town of Rafah, including their commander Major-General Nasr Yousef. </P>
<P> ``The Fatah movement demands the national authority deal in the appropriate way with the hired hands who create incidents,'' said one banner carried by mourners. </P>
<P> Activists in Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah group blamed Hamas for the killing. </P>
<P> Mohammed Dahlan, head of the secret police in Gaza, said the two wounded Hamas activists had stopped at a checkpoint but drove away shooting at the secret police. Hams was killed in the resulting exchange of fire. </P>
<P> Hamas denied opening fire. It said Hams was in the car with the Hamas activists, escorting them to a police station as a way of defusing the standoff between them and the secret police. </P>
<P> Hamas said the secret police fired on the car as it pulled away, fatally injuring Hams and wounding the other two men. </P>
<P> ``We put the full responsibility on the security apparatus,'' said Hamas, which is fighting the PLO's peace deal by attacking Israelis. The authorities buried Hams apparently without having examined the bullets that killed him. </P>
