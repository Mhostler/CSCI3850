<P>  Cuban socialism has to be defended because the island is not a country but an idea inspiring working people around the world, former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere said Monday. </P>
<P> ``If (Cuba) wins, it's a battle won by all the struggling people of the world,'' said Nyerere, who is president of the South Commission of developing countries. He spoke at a news conference during a visit to the communist-ruled Caribbean island. </P>
<P> ``Cuba is not just Cuba; Cuba is an idea. If Cuba loses, it's not just Cuba but all the struggling people of the world,'' he said. </P>
<P> Nyerere said he had been depressed by the idea of visiting Cuba, plunged into economic crisis by the collapse of communism in the old Soviet bloc, but was leaving encouraged by its efforts to survive. </P>
<P> His praise was accompanied by a stinging attack on Washington's longstanding economic embargo, aimed at pressuring Cuba into change. </P>
<P> ``To seek glory in beating little countries does not become a great nation,'' Nyerere said, adding the trade ban was an anachronism after the end of the Cold War. </P>
<P> ``What has remained is a history of hostility to Cuba, the reasons (for the embargo) have gone,'' he said. ``Courage should be directed at forgetting that history.'' </P>
