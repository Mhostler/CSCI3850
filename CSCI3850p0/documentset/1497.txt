<P>  Crooked British lawyers are on the increase and they could be involved in fraud totalling $63 million a year, a leading legal magazine said Tuesday. </P>
<P> The weekly newspaper ``The Lawyer'', said mortgage and pension fraud topped the league of attorney-related fraud, accounting for 75 percent of all cases. </P>
<P> It said the number of lawyers facing disciplinary tribunals has soared by two thirds in the past five months, but gave no reason for the startling rise. </P>
<P> The value of serious fraud cases involving lawyers hit $31.5 million in the first six months of this year and could top $63 million by the end of the year, the magazine said. </P>
<P> Fraud was not the profession's only problem, however. </P>
<P> Lawyers emerged from Britain's 2 3/8 year recession ``suffering from an acute alcohol dependency and cocaine addiction and ... lawyers are on average 55 percent more likely to die of cirrhosis of the liver than other people,'' it said. </P>
