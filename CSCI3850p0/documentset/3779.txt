<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Israeli cabinet ministers, their popularity plunging while inflation is rising, agreed Sunday to lower the volume on a public debate over who was to blame for their problems. </P>
<P> Police Minister Moshe Shahal stoked the embers before the meeting, sending a report to Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin full of scathing criticism of Finance Minister Avraham Shohat's economic policy. </P>
<P> Israeli media splashed Shahal's report across their front pages, quoting him as saying the government was ``hurtling full speed toward an economic disaster'' and describing economic policies as ``confused...shot from the hip.'' </P>
<P> When it was over, cabinet ministers did their best to halt the rhetoric. </P>
<P> ``I'm sure that each of the ministers wants to open a new chapter,'' Environment Minister Yossi Sarid told reporters after the meeting which lasted six hours, about two hours longer than the weekly average. </P>
<P> Polls show Rabin's popularity falling at a time of rising inflation. Government statistics released Sunday showed the cost of living index rose by 14.5 percent in 1994 -- the highest annual figure since 1991. </P>
<P> The cabinet approved a people-pleasing budget cut which had ministers sparring publicly since it was proposed last week. When the vote was over, they were all smiles. </P>
<P> Shahal, who according to some commentators aspires to Shohat's job, carefully avoided reporters after the meeting, smiling and waving as he sped away in his chauffeur-driven car. </P>
<P> Debate was put off for a week on another thorny issue -- renewed Jewish settlement activity in the occupied territories which Palestinians say threatens Israel-PLO peace talks. </P>
<P> ``It was explicitly stated that during this week there would be no further land confiscation,'' said Sarid, a leading negotiator in talks with Palestinians. </P>
<P> The $239 million budget cut, which Shohat said would lower inflation, was approved only two weeks after Israel's parliament passed its $49 billion annual budget. It passed 10-7. </P>
<P> But the cuts amounted to less than half a percent of the total budget, and the bickering was the focus of greater public attention. </P>
