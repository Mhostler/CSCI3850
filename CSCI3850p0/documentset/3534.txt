<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Vinny Testaverde threw for 268 yards and a touchdown in an error-free performance and Cleveland intercepted Drew Bledsoe three times as the Browns beat the New England Patriots 20-13 in an AFC wild card playoff game Sunday. </P>
<P> In an NFC wild card game, Steve Walsh completed 15 of 23 passes for 221 yards and two touchdowns as the Bears mauled Minnesota 35-18, avenging two regular-season losses to the Vikings. </P>
<P> With their upset victory, the Bears advance to a meeting with the heavily-favored San Francisco 49ers on Saturday. </P>
<P> The Browns, in their first post-season appearance since 1989, earned a trip to Pittsburgh for a second-round playoff game against the Steelers Saturday. </P>
<P> ``We get Pittsburgh again with a big chance to make amends for the regular season,'' said Testaverde of Cleveland's two losses to the Steelers this year. </P>
<P> In next Sunday's playoff games, the San Diego Chargers host the Miami Dolphins in the AFC and the defending Super Bowl champion Dallas Cowboys host the Green Bay Packers in an NFC second round contest. </P>
<P> In Cleveland it was a case of the pupil beating the teacher as Cleveland head coach Bill Belichick advanced at the expense of New England's Bill Parcells. Belichick was an assistant coach under Parcells with the New York Giants, a combination that led to two Super Bowl titles. </P>
<P> ``I know that I wouldn't be standing here if it wasn't for Bill Parcells,'' Belichick said of his friend and mentor. </P>
<P> Testaverde, in his first career playoff game, completed 20 of 30 passes, including his first 10 of the second half. He didn't throw a single interception against the Pats, who had won their last seven games. </P>
<P> Bledsoe completed 21-of-50 for 235 yards and one touchdown, but was picked off three times in New England's first playoff game since 1986. </P>
<P> Cleveland snapped a 10-10 halftime tie on Leroy Hoard's 10-yard touchdown run with 2:21 left in the third quarter. Hoard also caught a 25-yard pass from Testaverde on the drive. </P>
<P> Matt Stover's 21-yard field goal with 3:36 left in the game gave the Browns a 20-10 lead after Eric Turner returned an interception of a Bledsoe pass 28 yards. </P>
<P> Matt Bahr kicked a 33-yard field goal that drew New England to within 20-13 with 1:30 left. But the Pats were unable to capitalize after recovering Bahr's onside kick. </P>
<P> Stover kicked a 30-yard field goal on Cleveland's opening drive and Testaverde threw a five-yard touchdown pass to Mark Carrier with 3:53 left in the second quarter for the Browns' first-half points. </P>
<P> New England took a 7-3 second-quarter lead on Bledsoe's 13-yard touchdown pass to Leroy Thompson. They tied it 10-10 with 30 seconds left in the half on Bahr's 23-yard field goal. </P>
<P> ``Testaverde made a lot of good decisions with the ball. His performance cannot be overlooked,'' Hoard said. ``We beat the hottest team in the NFL.'' </P>
<P> At Minnesota, Walsh threw touchdown passes of nine yards to Keith Jennings and 21 yards to Jeff Graham. </P>
<P> The Bears also scored on a one-yard run by Lewis Tillman and a 29-yard run by Raymont Harris. Safety Kevin Miniefield's 59-yard fumble return for a touchdown with 3:05 left ended any hope of a comeback for the Vikings. </P>
<P> ``Our defense won the game,'' Walsh said. ``It stopped them, took the ball away from them and won it for us.'' </P>
<P> The Vikings scored on touchdown passes by Warren Moon of four yards to Cris Carter and 11 yards to Amp Lee, and Fuad Reveiz field goals of 29 and 49 yards. </P>
<P> Moon completed 29-of-52 passes -- both team playoff records -- for 292 yards. But he was picked off twice to extend his career playoff frustrations. </P>
<P> Moon has been in the playoffs the past eight seasons -- seven with Houston -- without reaching a conference championship game. </P>
<P> Minnesota grabbed a 3-0 lead 6:59 into the game on a Reveiz field goal after linebacker Ed McDaniel recovered a Tillman fumble at the Bears 6-yard-line. </P>
<P> Tillman made amends for his miscue with a touchdown run 3:14 into the second quarter. The play capped a 78-yard, 16-play drive that put Chicago ahead and they never again trailed. </P>
<P> Walsh took the Bears 71 yards in four plays on their next possession for a 14-3 when he hooked up with Jennings in the end zone. </P>
<P> The Vikings pulled within 14-9 on Moon's scoring pass to Carter with 19 seconds left in the half, but Moon threw incomplete on a two-point conversion try. </P>
<P> Chicago struck quickly in the second half, making it 21-9 with another four-play touchdown drive as Harris broke loose for his 29-yard scoring run. </P>
<P> Minnesota pulled to within 21-12 on Reveiz' 49-yarder with seven seconds left in the third quarter, but Graham gave Chicago a commanding 28-12 lead with his touchdown catch with 12:42 left in the game. </P>
<P> ``We weren't going to lose to them three times,'' Chicago coach Dave Wannstedt said. </P>
<P> ``I'm so proud of my team. We executed perfectly.'' </P>
