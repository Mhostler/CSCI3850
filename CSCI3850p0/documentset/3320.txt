<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Colombia's Marxist-led guerrillas have become a virtual drug organization onto themselves because of their heavy involvement in trafficking, the Bogota daily El Tiempo reported Monday. </P>
<P> Citing a national police report, the newspaper said guerrillas not only made money charging drug traffickers for protection but also grew their own illegal drug crops. </P>
<P> El Tiempo said the guerrillas grow marijuana in the northern part of the country and protect drug processing laboratories and clandestine airstrips in the southern jungles. </P>
<P> The levies charged by the guerrillas against drug traffickers for protection made up 30 percent of the total costs incurred by the traffickers in producing cocaine and heroin, it said. </P>
<P> Colombia is world's largest producer of cocaine. </P>
