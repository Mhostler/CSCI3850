<P>  Ecuador, ignoring pressure from the United States, rejected Monday a cease-fire proposal that had been accepted by Peru in arduous talks which lasted six days in Rio de Janeiro. </P>
<P> ``We still don't have a document acceptable to both parties,'' President Sixto Durn Balln told journalists in Buenos Aires after meeting Argentine President Carlos Menem. </P>
<P> ``I obviously can't go into details of the objections of one country or the other,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``Each and every one of the places where the two countries have clashed have been places attacked by Peru,'' he added. </P>
<P> Durn Balln arrived in Argentina Monday afternoon from Brazil and was due to leave immediately for Chile. Argentina, Chile, Brazil and the United States are mediating in the conflict, which broke out 12 days ago. </P>
<P> All are guarantors of the 1942 Rio de Janiero Protocol that ended an earlier border war between the two countries and which Ecuador rejected in 1960. </P>
<P> A document declaring a cease-fire was ready on the night of Jan. 30, Durn Balln said, and only lacked the hour at which it was to begin the following day. </P>
<P> But, he said, so many modifications were demanded that ''today we no longer have a final document acceptable to both parties.'' </P>
<P> Earlier Monday, Durn Balln met Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso to discuss the suspended talks. </P>
<P> The mediators suspended negotiations in Rio de Janeiro indefinitely Sunday when Ecuador requested more time to study a cease-fire proposal. </P>
<P> ``We are going to continue with the talks. We have to do so because nothing is going to be resolved on its own,'' Duran Ballen told reporters after meeting Cardoso. </P>
<P> Duran Ballen said new talks were expected to be held in Brasilia, but he did not give a date. </P>
<P> Brazilian Deputy Foreign Minister Sebastiao Rego do Barros said high-level diplomats from the mediating nations would continue to coordinate efforts to end the conflict. </P>
