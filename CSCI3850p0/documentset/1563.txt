<P>  Newspaper reports that a Beijing gunman went on a murder spree after his wife died during an officially requested abortion were scurrilous rumors, a China-backed newspaper in the British colony reported Friday. </P>
<P> The Wen Wei Po said army Lieutenant Tian Mingjian had been unhappy about being disciplined for hitting fellow soldiers. </P>
<P> Two Hong Kong newspapers Thursday quoted hospital sources as saying Tian began ran amok following his wife's death during an abortion urged on her by a military commissar after she became pregnant with a second child, a violation of China's one-child policy. </P>
<P> The Wen Wei Po reported that Tian had improperly turned down a soldier's request for leave. </P>
<P> The soldier complained to superior officers. Angered, Tian wanted to punish the soldier but was opposed by his unit commander and many others. He then twice hit out at people, the paper said. </P>
<P> Tian killed 14 people and wounded nearly 80 during his rampage at the army camp and in Beijing streets, Ta Kung Pao, another Beijing-backed Hong Kong newspaper said. </P>
