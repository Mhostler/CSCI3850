<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  An opinion poll conducted in the midst of Argentina's financial crisis Wednesday showed President Carlos Menem losing critical support that could jeopardize his re-election bid. </P>
<P> The poll conducted Dec. 27 to Dec. 30 by the French-Brazilian firm SOFRE-IBOPE showed the government losing 2 to 3 percentage points from earlier polls, placing support at 28.3 percent. </P>
<P> The poll comes a week into Argentina's financial crisis, a fallout from Mexico's devaluation of the peso. </P>
<P> Support for Menem would climb to 37 percent if the undecided votes were distributed proportionally among candidates. Argentine opinion polls often tally the undecided votes into their figures. </P>
<P> A 37 percent rating would place Menem for the first time below the minimum needed to win May 14's election in the first round. </P>
<P> Also, the poll showed a two percentage gain by main opposition Radical party's Horacio Massaccesi to 18.4 percent, or 24 percent after undecided ballots are factored in. </P>
<P> Candidates need 45 percent of the vote for a straight win in the first round, or 40 percent of the vote and a 10 point lead over the runner-up. </P>
<P> Otherwise, a second round is conducted, Enrique Zuleta Puceiro of SOFRE-IBOPE told Reuters. </P>
<P> For the first time, the poll showed Menem -- whose economic stabilization plan has won him strong popular support -- tied in a run-off second round with Massaccesi. </P>
<P> The poll of 1200 people had a margin of error of about 3 percent. </P>
