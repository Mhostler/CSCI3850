<DATELINE>KAMPOT, Cambodia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Khmer Rouge guerrillas have released hundreds of Cambodian hostages taken during a bloody train ambush in southern Cambodia but three foreign tourists are still being held, police said Friday. </P>
<P> Cambodian government officials said they were trying to determine the nationalities and identities of the three tourists taken hostage in Tuesday's raid in Kampot province, about 80 miles south of Phnom Penh. </P>
<P> ``We are very concerned about their safety. We are now in the process of investigating,'' provincial police commissioner General Seng Sokun told Reuters. </P>
<P> ``According to our reports they have been taken to Phnom Voir,'' he said, adding there had been no ransom demand. Phnom Voir is a Khmer Rouge stronghold about six miles from the scene of the attack, he said. </P>
<P> Two government soldiers, two railway militiamen and five passengers were killed when more than 30 guerrillas opened fire on the train after it was crippled by two landmines placed on the tracks. </P>
<P> The gunmen opened fire with rocket-propelled grenades and automatic rifles. Several passengers were seriously injured but the exact number was not known, officials said. </P>
<P> The guerrillas initially detained hundreds of passengers and forced them to carry items looted from the train to a rebel stronghold, police and witnesses said. Passengers said they saw the guerrillas forcing three foreign men into the jungle beside the railway line. </P>
