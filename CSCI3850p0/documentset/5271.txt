<P>  Lawyers in the murder case of accused serial killer Henry Wallace lost their bid Tuesday to bar the media from hearings aimed at suppressing chilling statements Wallace made to police without benefit of attorneys. </P>
<P> Mecklenburg County Superior Court Judge Robert Johnston ruled against closing the hearings to the press on constitutional grounds, saying it was required that court sessions be open. Both defense and prosecuting attorneys had asked that the hearings be closed, taking on media attorneys who argued the public's right to view the proceedings. </P>
<P> The defense argued the material could taint the potential jury pool and thwart Wallace's right to a fair trial. Defense lawyer Jim Cooney said ``wide-spread'' and ``inflammatory'' publicity stemmed from ``irresponsible'' media coverage that has already reached more than half the potential jurors in the county. </P>
<P> ``The fact of the matter is that before we can pick jury we've got to exclude half the county,'' he said. </P>
<P> Prosecutor Marsha Goodenow spoke on behalf of the victim families who are concerned that disclosing the information could lead to a change of venue. </P>
<P> At issue are 10 hours of taped statements Wallace made to Charlotte police during questioning last year in connection with murders and rapes of 10 women. His answers led to his arrest and a reported confession to the murders, most through strangulation. </P>
<P> Wallace, 29, is charged with nine counts of first-degree murder, one count of second-degree murder, first-degree rape and other sex offenses, and robbery. He pled not guilty in the case, which could bring a sentence of death. </P>
<P> Attorney John Buchan, who represented local media, told the court that open proceedings ``discourages decisions based on biases and encourages truthful testimony.'' </P>
<P> Family members of some of the victims were in court hoping the request to close the hearings would be approved. Dee Sumpter, whose 20-year-old daughter Shawna was found strangled in the bathtub in February 1993, has heard some of the tapes and said her concern was that Wallace may not get a fair sentence if he is convicted. </P>
