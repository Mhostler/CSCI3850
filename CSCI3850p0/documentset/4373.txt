<P>  President Boris Yeltsin Thursday denounced plans by NATO to expand to include East European states and said the West should stop suspecting Russia of harboring ``black designs.'' </P>
<P> In his State of the Nation address, Yeltsin appeared obliquely to be appealing to the West not to allow the bloody military conflict in Chechnya to damage the new strategic partnership. </P>
<P> ``With all contradictions of the transition period, Russia is adherent to the values of democracy... Europe will win if it decides to rely on Russia,'' he declared. </P>
<P> In a wide-ranging speech lasting an hour, Yeltsin pledged to follow a foreign policy line that was consistent, firm, flexible and pragmatic in which Russia would seek realistic partnerships with all countries including the United States, China, Japan and those of Western Europe. </P>
<P> Partnership with the United States, he said, remained a ``major direction of Russian foreign policy. </P>
<P> But he was unequivocal in condemning moves by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to bring Moscow's former communist allies in Eastern and Central Europe into its ranks before agreement on a new relationship with Russia had been reached. </P>
<P> NATO's plans for ``hasty expansion'' were detrimental to building a genuine security system across Europe, he said. </P>
<P> ``We do not hide the fact that this scenario does not suit us, which is why Russia objects to it,'' he added. ``This continent... has already generated two global military catastrophes, and we do not want Europe and the world to return to old or new division lines.'' </P>
<P> ``By expanding NATO, the West is intending, it alleges, to defend the East European countries from so-called 'black designs' of Moscow. </P>
<P> ``I state with all responsibility: they do not exist,'' he declared. </P>
<P> The comment appeared to highlight Yeltsin's awareness that the Chechnya crisis, which has involved huge loss of civilian life as well as those of troops and Chechnyan fighters, has altered perceptions of the New Russia in the West. </P>
<P> Both the United States and Germany, Russia's closest ally in Western Europe, have been critical of the level of force used to crush the separatist rebellion, though Western powers have recognised the crisis as an internal matter for Russia. </P>
<P> Yeltsin maintained the official line that Moscow wanted to see the creation of a new ``security mechanism'' in the next century to govern its relationship with the rest of Europe. </P>
<P> Yeltsin has brought up this nebulous concept -- under which NATO would disband itself -- before in international forums but there has been little response generally to the idea. </P>
<P> Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev said Wednesday that Russia was prepared to restore relations with NATO to the basis of last December, before Moscow refused to sign a cooperation agreement with the 16-nation bloc. </P>
<P> But he said then that Russia first wanted an answer as to why the Western partners had ``shifted the emphasis away from partnership to the expansion of the bloc.'' </P>
<P> RIA news agency Thursday quoted Dmitry Ryurikov, a foreign affairs adviser to Yeltsin, as saying the question of NATO expansion was the most difficult in Russia's relations with the United States and the West. </P>
