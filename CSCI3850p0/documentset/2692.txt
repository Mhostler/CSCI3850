<P>  The U.N. World Food Program (WFP) said Friday a growing number of Rwandan children were going hungry in Zaire's refugee camps because food distribution was controlled by corrupt Rwandan leaders. </P>
<P> The Rome-based agency said in a statement that the situation was especially bad in the Mugunga camp in Goma on Zaire's border with Rwanda, home to 200,000 refugees. </P>
<P> ``The number of children under the age of five who were suffering from severe malnutrition has more than doubled from August to 8.3 percent,'' the statement said. </P>
<P> ``More than 30 percent of the population of the camp are not receiving full rations. Those especially affected are the elderly, children and families headed by women.'' </P>
<P> The WFP, which delivers an average of 20,000 tons of food to Zaire every month for the refugees, blamed the rise in malnutrition on those who distribute the rations. </P>
<P> ``The more vulnerable groups do not receive enough food because of corruption and food leakages at the distribution level.'' </P>
<P> ``At camps, relief food is delivered to village heads, elders and officials of the old Rwandan hierarchy who keep the control of the food distribution,'' the statement said. </P>
<P> The food organization said food should be distributed ``based on a family/household level.'' </P>
<P> The former Rwandan Hutu administration was ousted by the Tutsi-dominated Rwanda Patriotic Front after Hutu militia and troops had massacred hundreds of thousands of Tutsis between April and July. </P>
