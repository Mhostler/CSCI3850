<P>  President Clinton's Middle East adviser has told an Arabic newspaper that radical Muslim groups Hizbollah and Hamas are on the verge of bankruptcy. </P>
<P> ``The more the group of peacemakers strengthens, the more the outlaws weaken,'' Martin Indyk of the U.S. National Security Council said in remarks published Saturday by the London-based daily al-Hayat. </P>
<P> ``Hizbollah and Hamas are now on the brink of bankruptcy,'' he said in an interview in Washington. </P>
<P> Indyk said Washington's Middle East peace policy aims at spreading peace between Israel and the Arabs and to try to contain threats to stability in the region from ``evil states.'' </P>
<P> He said once the Arab-Israeli conflict was solved, a group of regional states committed to stability like Syria will stand in the face of ``renegade states like Iran, Iraq and Libya.'' </P>
<P> Three Iranian-backed groups, Lebanon's Hizbollah, the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas and Islamic Jihad vowed Friday continue ``holy war'' against Israel. </P>
<P> Indyk said Damascus could do more to curb Hizbollah, which he said operates from Lebanese territories under Syrian control and receives Iranian military supplies through Syria. </P>
<P> ``We don't think that Syria moves Hizbollah or supports it... It is clear Syria has in the past two years exerted efforts to control Hizbollah and to stop acts aiming to push the peace process off track,'' Indyk said. </P>
<P> But he added: ``Syria can do more through an understanding or agreement between Lebanon and Israel. Lebanon will be able, through support from Syria, to do a better job to guarantee the security of the border zone and stop Hizbollah'' raids. </P>
<P> Syria is Lebanon main foreign power broker with 35,000 troops stationed over two-thirds of the country. Both countries are going hand-in-hand at peace negotiations with Israel. </P>
