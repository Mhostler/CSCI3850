<P>  Police in this south Texas town said Wednesday they are investigating the possible drugging of two teachers by students at a local high school. </P>
<P> A special education teacher was treated at a hospital and another suffered nausea and headaches after drinking Diet Cokes following a 45-minute blackout at the school last week, Los Fresnos police constable Juan Mendoza said. </P>
<P> Mendoza said several students were suspects, but that no arrests have been made. </P>
<P> He said the teachers had left the soft drinks in their classrooms during the power outage. </P>
<P> ``One teacher drank just a little bit and the other one drank most of it and the one who drank most of it was the one who got more sick,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``We don't know exactly what type of drug, if any, at this moment,'' said Mendoza, adding that police were waiting for lab results on the beverages. </P>
<P> Los Fresnos is about 15 miles north of the border city of Brownsville. </P>
