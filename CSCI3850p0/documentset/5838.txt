<P>  An Indian convicted of murdering a local woman was executed Tuesday in the United Arab Emirates, the Interior Ministry said. </P>
<P> A statement carried by the official WAM news agency said Abdul-Aziz Abdul-Meguid Ismail was executed in prison in the UAE state of Abu Dhabi. </P>
<P> Executions in the Persian Gulf Arab state, which this month added drug smuggling to the list of capital crimes to curb a rise in trafficking, are usually by firing squad. </P>
<P> A Sri Lankan maid, Sirri Faruq, was executed Thursday in the UAE state of Ras al-Khaimah after confessing to stabbing the 4-year-old daughter of her employer with a nail file. </P>
<P> Another maid, 16-year-old Filipina Sarah Balabagan, is currently standing trial in the UAE on charges of the manslaughter of her employer last July. She told a Sharia Islamic court in the city of Al Ain on April 11 she acted in self-defense when he raped her. </P>
<P> Her lawyer predicted the trial would spark the same kind of uproar as the Singapore hanging last month of Filipina maid Flor Contemplacion for double murder. </P>
<P> Monday Philippine Foreign Minister Roberto Romulo resigned in the wake of Comtemplacion's execution for the murder of another Filipina maid Delia Maga and a 4-year-old boy, which caused a furor in the Philippines. </P>
<P> Contemplacion confessed to the double murder but many Filipinos believe she was innocent and was tortured into making a confession. </P>
<P> About 75 percent of the UAE's two million population are expatriate workers and their families, mainly from Asia and Arab states. </P>
