<P>  Self-exiled Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin caused a stir at the U.N. social summit on Friday when she said that Islam in general, and not just fundamentalism, deprives women of freedom and justice. </P>
<P> ``It is true that fundamentalists oppress women. But I don't know that Islam allows any freedom for women. I have not seen any equality and justice in Islam,'' she said after a lecture on the summit sidelines. </P>
<P> The feminist writer fled to Sweden last August after Muslim fundamentalists threatened to kill her. She is being tried in her absence in Bangladesh on charges of ``insulting Islam and hurting the sentiments of Moslems.'' </P>
<P> The charges stem from an interview in India's Statesman newspaper which quoted the 32-year-old author as saying Islam's holy book, the Koran, should be ``revised thoroughly.'' She has said she was misquoted, but the writer stands by the interview. </P>
<P> In Copenhagen, a delegation of Muslim women from relatively secular Tunisia tried to persuade Nasrin to agree that fundamentalism, not Islam generally, was the oppressor of women in the Moslem world. </P>
<P> Nasrin's reply to them after the lecture at the Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) Forum, billed as the ``alternative summit,'' caused a minor uproar in what has otherwise been a relatively polite and conflict-free week. </P>
