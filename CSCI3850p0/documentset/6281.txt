<P>  A leading critic of Russia's military action in Chechnya said Thursday he expects Clinton administration officials to express concern about the conflict at a Moscow summit meeting next week. </P>
<P> ``The people I met did assure me ... that they will express their concern about the situation,'' Sergei Kovalyov told a news conference after a round of meetings with top U.S. officials including Secretary of State Warren Christopher. </P>
<P> The administration responded mildly when Russian forces entered secessionist Chechnya on December 11, saying it was an internal affair. But it has become increasingly critical of Russia's pummeling of the breakaway region. </P>
<P> Kovalyov, chairman of the Russian president's Commission on Human Rights, said ``typical Western politeness'' might not be enough to influence hard-headed Russian politicians. </P>
<P> ``I hope that President Clinton when he goes to Moscow will know he is going there to pay a debt to those who fought fascism,'' Kovalyov said of the ceremonies planned to commemorate World War II. </P>
<P> ``He should not go there with his eyes closed,'' he said, adding that Moscow's policies were dangerously close to inspiring ``a renaissance of fascism or something near it.'' </P>
<P> Kovalyov also charged there has been a return to old Soviet-era policies of propaganda, spying on citizens, wiretapping and eavesdropping. Such outspokenness has made him a thorn in Yeltsin's side, especially since he has issued daily reports on killings and alleged human rights violations in Chechnya. </P>
<P> In retaliation, he was stripped of his title of Human Rights Commissioner, although he remains head of the President's Human Rights Commission and is a deputy in the Russian State Duma. </P>
