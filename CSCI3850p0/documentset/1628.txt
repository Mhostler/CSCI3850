<P>  Jordan reasserted its refusal on Tuesday to let the Palestine Liberation Organization take control of Muslim holy places in Jerusalem. </P>
<P> ``It has been decided to continue Jordanian legal and adminstrative responsibility over Islamic affairs and Sharia law in Holy Jerusalem,'' declared a Cabinet statement which said religious endowments and Islamic courts in the rest of the West Bank were being turned over to the PLO. </P>
<P> The East Jerusalem shrines, in the Arab section oaf the Holy City captured by Israel from Jordan in 1967, include the Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third holiest site. </P>
<P> King Hussein's religious role in Jerusalem was recognized by Israel when the two countries ended their state of war in July. </P>
<P> That angered Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat, who fears it will undermine his claim to Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state. </P>
<P> Arafat's Palestinian self-rule authority said Saturday it would take over funding of Muslim holy sites in the Gaza Strip and West Bank, including Jerusalem, from next month. </P>
<P> King Hussein told the official new agency Petra after Tuesday's Cabinet meeting that officials of the Palestinian authority had tried ``to provoke a conflict with the kingdom over its legitimate historic role which had preserved the Arab and Islamic face of the holy sites.'' </P>
<P> The Cabinet statement, reported by Petra, said Tuesday's decision was taken because of ``the immortal nature of Jerusalem'' and ``to continue the Jordanian Hashemite role in caring for and protecting its holy sites from any danger or abuse.'' </P>
<P> Jordan renounced its legal and administrative powers in the West Bank in favor of the PLO in 1988 but retained religious affairs to block Israeli interference. It employed 2,400 people, including those in sharia courts and Islamic schools. </P>
<P> The decision to hand religious affairs outside Jerusalem to PLO was a continuation of the 1988 decision, the Cabinet said. </P>
