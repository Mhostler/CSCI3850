<P>  Police at Stockholm's airport said Tuesday they had been faced by a flood of Cuban asylum-seekers prior to Sweden's introduction of a visa requirement for Cubans beginning Jan. 1. </P>
<P> Kjell Edman, spokesman for Arlanda Airport police, said a steady stream of 15 to 20 Cubans arriving each day in recent weeks was swelled Monday by the arrival of about 100 on scheduled flights, mainly via Madrid. </P>
<P> ``Since then we have had a constant flow of between 15 and 20 per day.'' </P>
<P> Police said they suspected the large number that arrived Monday had been duped by confidence tricksters because most of them carried letters guaranteeing they would be maintained in Sweden by the same individual. </P>
<P> Eva Lindahl, spokeswoman for the Board of Immigration, said that so far in December about 350 Cubans had arrived in Sweden, bringing the total so far this year to around 1,200. </P>
<P> Lindahl said the government had not yet decided whether it would send back to Havana those whose asylum applications were rejected. </P>
<P> Only 68 Cubans have been granted asylum since July 1. </P>
<P> Another 196 have been turned down by the Immigration Board. Most of those have appealed and, pending a government ruling on test cases, none have yet been deported, Lindahl said. </P>
<P> That leaves about 900 waiting for their cases to be processed, many of them in state-funded accommodation centers. </P>
