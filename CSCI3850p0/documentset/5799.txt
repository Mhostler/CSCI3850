<P>  France is discussing with its partners ways to improve the safety of U.N. peacekeepers in Bosnia after snipers shot and killed two French soldiers in two days in Sarajevo, the Foreign Ministry said Monday. </P>
<P> Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and Defense Minister Francois Leotard will discuss the issue at an emergency meeting Tuesday but a withdrawal of the peacekeepers is not on the agenda, officials said. </P>
<P> ``We are looking to avoid a withdrawal at all costs,'' a foreign ministry official said. ``All the solutions we are proposing to our partners are aimed at avoiding a withdrawal, which in our eyes would be a solution of despair.'' </P>
<P> He said France's main concern was to achieve an extension of a crumbling four-month cease-fire between the Muslim-led Bosnian government army and the Bosnian Serbs, due to expire at the end of this month. </P>
<P> Sporadic clashes have increased as diplomatic efforts by the five-power Contact Group to persuade Serbia to recognize Croatia and Bosnia as the prelude to a negotiated settlement have run into a brick wall in Belgrade. </P>
<P> Six days before the first round of a presidential election, the center-right government sought to prevent France's role in former Yugoslavia from becoming a campaign issue. </P>
<P> Thirty-two French peacekeepers have died in ex-Yugoslavia, most of them in Bosnia where 4,200 are currently serving. </P>
<P> After Balladur's office and Leotard suggested Saturday that Paris was running out of patience and considering withdrawal, Socialist presidential candidate Lionel Jospin demanded that the government clarify its position. </P>
<P> ``If the government thinks that the Contact Group plan is the right approach, it is perhaps too early to start to envisage withdrawal, otherwise it suggests we don't believe in the political solution which we ourselves have drafted,'' Jospin said on France-3 television. </P>
<P> ``I think we should explore first of all ways to be tougher toward our interlocutors, particularly toward the Serbs ... to try to advance a diplomatic solution,'' he added. </P>
<P> ``If we indeed think this policy cannot succeed, then we should consider withdrawing our peacekeepers and lifting the arms embargo (on the Bosnian government),'' Jospin said. </P>
<P> The foreign ministry official said the U.N. peacekeeping force had not yet managed to identify which snipers killed the French soldiers Friday and Saturday. </P>
<P> Asked whether he believed the French were being singled out, he said: ``It's impossible to say but the coincidence of two killings in two days forces us to pose the question.'' </P>
