<P>  Cult high priestess Marina Tsvygun, whose doomsday prophesies sowed panic in Ukraine, went on trial Wednesday with other leaders of her White Brotherhood sect. </P>
<P> Tsvygun was charged with her husband, Yuri Kryvonogov, with organizing mass disorder, deliberately inflicting serious bodily injury, seizing a state building, and attempt to damage the health of citizens in the name of religion. </P>
<P> The charges relate to an incident on Nov. 10, 1993, when Tsvygun and Kryvonogov entered Kiev's 11th century St. Sofia cathedral with a group of followers. </P>
<P> They damaged priceless church decorations in a clash with police. </P>
<P> ``I have one child on earth...and 144,000 blood children,'' Tsvygun, 34, told a Kiev municipal court referring to the sect's estimated followers. </P>
<P> Asked about her schooling, she murmured she had ``higher heavenly'' education. </P>
<P> Tsvygun, the cult's ``living god,'' her husband who was known as the sect's ``chief prophet'' and a third person pleaded not guilty on all counts and refused legal representation. </P>
<P> The cult cast Kiev into a panic for weeks with claims that 144,000 followers would mass in a central square and be resurrected when the world ended Nov. 14, 1993. </P>
<P> Authorities feared mass suicides and set up a constant police presence around St. Sofia square, the cult's so-called ``closest point to the cosmos.'' </P>
<P> In court Wednesday, clad in a white robe and headdress, Tsvygun, nervous and perspiring, identified herself as Maria Devi Khristos, the name her followers called her. </P>
<P> About 10 cult followers, holding flowers, sat inside the courtroom, located next to St. Sofia square. </P>
<P> Some 800 followers had been detained in the build-up to the predicted end of the world. Hundreds of parents gathered in Kiev at the time looking for their children they feared had joined the cult. </P>
