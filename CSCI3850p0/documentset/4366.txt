<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Deng Xiaoping is now a ``totally retired old person,'' his daughter said Wednesday as she rejected claims that at age 90 he still holds final authority in China. </P>
<P> Deng Rong, in New York to promote the first volume of her biography of her father, told a news conference that he had one major dream left -- he wants to visit Hong Kong when it reverts to Chinese rule in 1997. </P>
<P> She also said her father was in good health for ``a 90-year-old man'' and added, ``health permitting he said he wanted to set foot in Hong Kong in 1997. He would be willing to go in a wheelchair. He still has this hope.'' </P>
<P> She added that he believed that Hong Kong would thrive and prosper under Chinese rule. </P>
<P> ``A period of colonial humiliation will be replaced by a Hong Kong returned to the motherland that will be more prosperous and more flourishing (than it is now),'' she said. </P>
<P> The health issue poppped up again and again at the news conference, as did the question of political succession in China once Deng Xiaoping passes away. </P>
<P> Deng Rong said there was no question of political succession, as it has already happened. </P>
<P> ``We have completed the transfer of power to a third generation,'' she said, adding that one of her father's greatest accomplishments was to establish the principle that Chinese leaders did not rule for their lifetimes but could, should and must retire. </P>
<P> ``He wanted China to move from the rule of persons to the rule of law. Father does not believe in lifetime rule ... He felt that for the destiny of an entire nation to depend on the rule of one person was dangerous. He took the lead by retiring,'' she said. </P>
<P> She added that her father felt that this was the best way to avoid the chaos that would follow if a leader died in office. ''That's why he went into retirement -- to prevent upheaval from taking place when he left the scene ... He is a totally retired old person,'' she said. </P>
<P> When a questioner asked for comment about a recent newspaper report that her father was in a coma, she smiled and said she had a friend in Hong Kong who kept track of the number of times her father had been reported seriously ill or even dead. </P>
<P> ``The number was up to 365. This is the 366th report,'' she said, adding that his health was fine for a man his age and that he had no serious illness. </P>
<P> Her book called ``Deng Xiaoping -- My father'' is published in English by Basic Books, which is owned by press baron Rupert Murdoch and she was asked how she felt about being published by him. </P>
<P> ``If I am going to get my book published in a capitalist society, I have to have a capitalist publisher,'' she said. </P>
