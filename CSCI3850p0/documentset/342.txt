<P>  Strikes to back demands for higher wages spread across South Africa Thursday as black workers flexed their muscles to attain the ``better life for all'' promised during the election campaign. </P>
<P> Workers ranging from the catering, metal, paper and oil industries to the municipal and judicial sectors have been involved in 35 separate protests since Tuesday last week. </P>
<P> Violence has marred a 10-day wage walkout by employees of the Pick'n Pay supermarket chain, while another strike over wages is also looming with South African Breweries. </P>
<P> ``Workers want to taste the fruits of what they voted for. We support their demand for improvements in their lives,'' said Zwelinzima Vavi, assistant general secretary of the Congress of South African Trade Unions. </P>
<P> Sam Shilowa, general secretary of COSATU, the largest union federation with about a million members, said President Nelson Mandela's government had been saying the economy was improving since the historic all-race elections in April. </P>
<P> ``But people are asking: Why is there no improvement in my pay packet?'' he said. </P>
<P> Announcing quarterly results Thursday for its gold mines, the giant Anglo American Corporation said the industry had lost about 15 tons of gold between April and June because of labor disruption. </P>
