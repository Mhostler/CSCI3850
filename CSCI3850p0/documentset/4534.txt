<P>  Despite bitter cold weather and chilling winds, Hillary Rodham Clinton brought warm smiles to hundreds of skaters on Ottawa's Rideau Canal Friday. </P>
<P> The U.S. First Lady impressed bystanders with her skating skills and disappointed members of the news media who may have been waiting for her to slip. </P>
<P> ``What fascinated me was there was not a moment's hesitation. She clearly had done it before, she stepped right off and away she went,'' said Ottawa resident Don Yeomans. </P>
<P> Dressed in a long green coat, Mrs Clinton, accompanied by Aline Chretien, the wife of Canada's Prime Minister, skated about a half a mile down the world's longest outdoor skating rink, toward a restaurant where they were to meet their husbands for lunch. The Clintons were in Ottawa as part of a two-day state visit. </P>
<P> After her brief skate, Mrs. Clinton ate part of an Ottawa delicacy, a sugary, cinnamon pastry called a beavertail, and was mobbed by spectators. The Clintons had lunch with Prime Minister Jean Chretien and his wife at a canal-side restaurant. </P>
<P> In a speech to Canada's Parliament Thursday, President Clinton spoke warmly about a family trip the Clintons made to Ottawa almost ten years ago when they saw the Rideau Canal for the first time and watched the skaters. </P>
<P> ``I came from a Southern state. I couldn't imagine that anybody could ever get on skates and stand in any body of water for very long,'' Clinton said. ``Hillary has had in the back of her mind all this long time how much she would like to be skating along this canal.'' </P>
<P> The Rideau Canal was built by British military engineers after the war of 1812, which pitted British against American troops. When it freezes over in the winter the canal serves as a popular 4.5 mile long skating rink. </P>
