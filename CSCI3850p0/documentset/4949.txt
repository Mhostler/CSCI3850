<P>  Two artistic roller skaters have been expelled from the U.S. team at the Pan-American Games after an altercation in the athletes' village, officials said Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``The two athletes withdrew from the team after a violation of the U.S. Olympic Committee's athletes code of conduct,'' USOC spokesman Mike Moran said. ``They left on Tuesday.'' </P>
<P> The USOC identified the athletes as Richard Saucedo, a figure skater from Hayward, California, and Steven Siegmann, a dancer from Baltimore, Maryland. </P>
<P> Moran would not comment on the athletes' violation, but U.S. sources said the two had fought in the athletes village after consuming alcohol last weekend. </P>
