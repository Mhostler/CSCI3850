<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  It was a topsy-turvy night at the Virginia Slims Championships Thursday -- for the winners. </P>
<P> The rollercoaster ride in sports is often reserved for the losers, but at Madison Square Garden it was the victors who felt the swings from high to low, and low to high. </P>
<P> ``Today was a different match, a whole different match than the other day,'' said Gabriela Sabatini after overtaking France's Julie Halard 2-6 6-2 6-3 to reach the semifinals of the $3.5 million, season-ending tournament. </P>
<P> ``It was kind of strange.'' </P>
<P> Mary Pierce, a 6-4 6-4 conqueror of top-seeded defending champion Steffi Graf, said: ``It was like day and night,'' when asked to compare Thursday night's work to Wednesday's first- round victory against South African Amanda Coetzer. </P>
<P> ``Yesterday I felt like a totally different person than today. Today I felt like the real Mary,'' said fifth seed Pierce, who sprayed 49 unforced errors around in her opening, three-set win. </P>
<P> Sabatini was coming off an opening round 6-4 6-2 demolition of Martina Navratilova, in an emotion-packed match that marked the end of the 38-year-old's singles career. </P>
<P> ``Today was a match that I had to win,'' explained Sabatini, entrenched in a tournament title dry spell that has covers 42 events stretching back to the 1992 Italian Open. </P>
<P> Sabatini kicked into gear in the middle of the second set, when at 2-2, 30-30, Halard lost her concentration after a bad call on a wide shot from the Argentine. </P>
<P> ``She gets very emotional sometimes, and I guess she got a little bit upset with that call in the second set. She didn't seem to be fighting too hard,'' said Sabatini. </P>
<P> ``I said, 'good for me.''' </P>
<P> Pierce, who had to climb back from a first-set loss to Coetzer and later complained she was still weak from a bout with the flu, was full of vim and vigor after beating Graf, who also fell to the hard-hitter in the French Open semifinals. </P>
<P> ``I was so happy after winning the match tonight, I just felt so great,'' said the 19-year-old Pierce. ``Yesterday I felt very slow, lethargic.'' </P>
<P> ``To beat Steffi is a very difficult thing to do. You have to really be playing well and it's a tough thing to do. So every time I can beat her is a great match for me.'' </P>
<P> There was no high for Graf, who has been getting treatment for an ailing back since her shocking first-round defeat at Wimbledon, only a bitter low for the world number one, who looked pale and weak against Pierce. </P>
<P> Graf played just two tournaments following Wimbledon before reaching the final of the U.S. Open nine weeks ago. Since then, she had not competed until this week. </P>
<P> Asked if she had holiday plans, Graf, who has residences in New York, Florida and Bruhl, Germany, said: ``No.'' </P>
<P> Any plans to go home? </P>
<P> ``What is home?'' she said. </P>
