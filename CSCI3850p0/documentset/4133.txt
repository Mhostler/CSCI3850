<P>  Italian Prime Minister Lamberto Dini gave his full support Friday to the U.S.-led rescue plan for Mexico and called for reforms of international financial bodies to avert such dangers. </P>
<P> Dini, speaking to reporters after a lunch with President Clinton, noted Italy had not joined six other European states in signaling their misgivings over the package at an International Monetary Fund meeting Wednesday night. </P>
<P> The IMF board meeting was called to approve a $17.8 billion IMF standby loan which is part of the overall rescue package of some $50 billion. </P>
<P> Dini, who is also finance minister in Italy's transitional government, said he supported the bailout ``in recognition of the systemic risk the spreading of a crisis in Mexico could have, a contagious effect, because of the globalized markets.'' </P>
<P> The Italian leader, who will attend a meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrialized countries in Toronto this weekend, said governments and institutions must be reformed to cope with the new challenge. </P>
<P> ``We are not well equipped through the present international financial institutions to cope with ... the new problems of financial instability that may arise ... as a result of deregulation, global markets and structural adjustments in certain countries,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``Larger resources than in the past are required because the capital that moves around frontiers today is of a magnitude that is unthinkable just a few years ago,'' he said. </P>
<P> Dini said he reassured Clinton of the basic solidity of the Italian democratic system despite the turbulence of the last few years and the recent collapse of the government of Silvio Berlusconi. </P>
<P> He also told Clinton that Italy expected the United States to provide leadership in the post-Cold War world. </P>
