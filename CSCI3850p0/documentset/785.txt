<P>  The United States applauded France Monday for apprehending the guerrilla known as Carlos, and said Sudan's involvement in the arrest was a welcome sign from a nation Washington regards as fostering terrorism. </P>
<P> ``Obviously, we applaud the government of France for its resolute efforts to bring to justice one of the most notorious terrorists of the past 20 years,'' State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said at a briefing. </P>
<P> ``The arrest of Carlos serves notice to all terrorists that their crimes will not go unpunished or forgotten by the international community,'' McCurry said. </P>
<P> Carlos, one alias for the guerrilla who was born Illich Ramirez Sanchez in Venezuela, was detained Sunday in Sudan and turned over to Interpol agents for extradition to France, where he was being held Monday. </P>
<P> ``We appreciate Sudan's actions,'' McCurry said, adding that this could mark the beginning of a Sudanese move ``to distance itself from international terrorism.'' </P>
<P> However, McCurry said there was no thought now to removing Sudan from the list of countries designated as sponsors of international terrorism by the U.S. government. </P>
<P> In Khartoum, government officials urged the United States to remove Sudan from the list. Sudan was added a year ago for granting sanctuary to such organizations as Hizbollah and Palestine Islamic Jihad, according to the State Department's latest report on ``Patterns of Global Terrorism.'' </P>
<P> The move cut off U.S. aid to the impoverished north African country. </P>
<P> The report did not state that Sudan was harboring Carlos, but McCurry said this may have been ``because ... in fact at that point we were tracking what we knew about his movements and doing so in a somewhat less than public way.'' </P>
<P> Carlos' arrest alone is not enough to get Sudan off the terrorism list, McCurry said, but it is an encouraging sign. </P>
<P> ``If they pursue this step now with further steps that would break the linkage between their tacit support of terrorist groups and their safe-havening and sanctioning of terrorist activities within Sudan, that would be a welcome development,'' he said. </P>
<P> Asked whether the United States was involved in Carlos' apprehension, McCurry would say only that, ``There have been international efforts to cooperate in combating terrorism. I think I'll just leave it at that.'' </P>
<P> The other nations on the U.S. list are Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea and Syria. </P>
<P> McCurry said there are no U.S. charges pending against Carlos. </P>
