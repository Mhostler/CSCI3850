<DATELINE>MADRID (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Thousands of angry farmers gathered in Madrid Thursday to demand action on a four-year drought that is parching southern regions of Spain and threatening drinking water supplies. </P>
<P> ``The countryside is dying. We are worried that the nation will go hungry, that people will go thirsty,'' a farmer from La Mancha told a crowd organisers estimated at 40,000. </P>
<P> ``We don't need stupid words and gestures from the government, we need more reservoirs and we need them now.'' </P>
<P> A fourth consecutive year of severe drought in southern regions threatens to drain drinking water supplies for 8.5 million people by fall, according to a government report published Thursday. </P>
<P> The report by the Public Works Ministry, published in the newspaper El Pais, said there is not enough water in storage, nor can it be brought from other parts of the country. </P>
<P> Agriculture Minister Luis Atienza has promised direct subsidies after the traditional rainy season in the spring, when the full size the of the problem will be better known. </P>
<P> When Public Works Minister Jose Borrell first presented the report to the cabinet in February, the government authorized emergency projects to transport water to thirsty regions from better-supplied areas. </P>
<P> But the plans triggered regional bickering between the haves and the have-nots and now languish in a knot of bureaucracy. </P>
<P> Hotels along the Costa del Sol, where the population swells from 1.1 to 2.5 million in summer, refuse to impose water restrictions on their guests, fearing complaints. </P>
<P> The region has only enough water reserves to last until November, while a plan to bring water down from the Sierra Nevada mountains is being held up over protests from environmentalists that it will damage the region's forests. </P>
