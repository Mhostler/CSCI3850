<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A group of minority lawmakers vowed Friday to battle a Republican-led move to strike down a tax incentive program that has encouraged sellers of broadcast properties to seek out minority buyers. </P>
<P> The House Way and Means Committee earlier this week voted to repeal a Federal Communications Commission policy that allows broadcasters and cable television companies to defer taxation by selling their outlets to minority-owned firms. </P>
<P> The panel's bill would block deals retroactively to Jan. 17, possibly killing Viacom Inc.'s planned $2.3 billion sale of its cable systems to Frank Washington, a black executive. </P>
<P> Minority preference programs have been designed to help blacks, Hispanics, women and other groups that have traditionally had difficulty in attracting funds needed to compete in capital-intensive communications industries. </P>
<P> Even so, only a tiny percentage of radio and TV stations, and an even smaller number of cable systems, are controlled by minorities. </P>
<P> Lawmakers who held a news conference at the Capitol to denounce this week's vote charged House Republicans with firing the first shot of what they predicted would be a racially divisive 1996 presidential election campaign. </P>
<P> ``This is just the beginning of tampering with affirmative action programs,'' said Rep. Harold Ford, a Tennessee Democrat. ''It is wrong and we must make a statement.'' </P>
