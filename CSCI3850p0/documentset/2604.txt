<P>  President Clinton, moving to calm anxious allies, Monday defended his decision to halt U.S. participation in enforcing an arms embargo on Bosnian Muslims. </P>
<P> He insisted Washington was still observing the ban. </P>
<P> ``We are not violating the arms embargo. We are observing the international arms embargo. We will continue to do it,'' he told a news conference in Jakarta on the eve of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. </P>
<P> Clinton directed U.S. military commanders to stop enforcing the embargo with ships in the Adriatic starting last Saturday. </P>
<P> Congress ordered funds for U.S. participation in enforcing the ban be cut off from Nov. 15 if Bosnian Serbs did not accept a peace plan by then. </P>
<P> ``We have been criticized by some of our allies, but I think they need to understand the situation,'' Clinton told reporters. </P>
<P> He argued that Congress was heavily in favor of having the United States unilaterally remove the U.N. embargo on Bosnian Muslims but the administration had arranged a compromise. </P>
<P> That involved a commitment to try to get the U.N. Security Council to lift the embargo on a multilateral basis and a pledge to stop spending U.S. tax dollars to enforce the embargo. </P>
<P> U.S. officials have said the U.S. decision will have little effect on the embargo since most arms shipments travel overland and European allies will continue to interdict any supplies that come by sea. </P>
<P> The officials said the action does not mean the United States will provide arms for the Bosnian Muslims or allow the sale of arms to the Muslims by U.S. firms. </P>
<P> ``The arrangement which we have adopted on enforcement is the product of intense negotiations in the United States Congress (and avoids) what I believe would have been a very serious mistake, which would have been a unilateral vote by Congress to lift the arms embargo,'' Clinton said. </P>
<P> He acknowledged that his top foreign policy aides, including Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Defense Secretary William Perry, have ``worked very hard in the last few days ... to explain to our allies exactly what we have done and what we have not done.'' </P>
