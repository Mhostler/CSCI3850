<P>  The Palestine Liberation Organization denied a media report Tuesday that Israeli police would try to teach their Palestinian counterparts how to quell demonstrations in self-ruled Gaza. </P>
<P> ``We have many professional and well-qualified police, and we don't need training like this,'' said Brig. Gen. Ghazi al-Jabali, Gaza police commander. </P>
<P> Israel's Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper said Tuesday 25 Palestinian police officers would attend an all-day seminar in Israel Wednesday on dispersing mass demonstrations. </P>
<P> The newspaper said the police ``kept the visit a secret for fear of negative public repercussions.'' An Israel police spokesman had said police were ``not denying the reports.'' </P>
<P> Palestinian police took over a year ago from Israeli troops who pulled out of Gaza under PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat's self-rule deal with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. </P>
<P> Jabali told Reuters the PLO-led police force now totals 20,000 men and women. </P>
<P> Armed Muslim militants are the target of a Palestinian police crackdown to curb suicide attacks against Israelis. The militants accuse the PLO police of doing Israel's bidding. </P>
