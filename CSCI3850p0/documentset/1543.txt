<P> The network said it was unclear which planes opened fire on the tank and there was no assessment yet on bomb damage. </P>
<P> CNN quoted its sources as saying the planes attacked the Bosnian Serb tank after two incidents outside the Bosnian capital, both involving French soldiers serving with United Nations peacekeeping troops. </P>
<P> In the first incident, Bosnian Serbs attacked a French anti-sniping unit, wounding one soldier. Another Frenchman was wounded when his armored personnel carrier was hit by fire from Bosnian Serbs, CNN said. </P>
<P> At the United Nations spokesman Ahmad Fawzi said the NATO warplanes hit ``one Serbian tank West of Sarajevo in response to the incident early today in which Serbian positions fired rocket-propelled grenades on a French armored personnel carrier.'' </P>
<P> Other sources said Yashushi Akashi, the chief U.N. representative in the Balkans, gave authority to hit the tank but turned down a request to strike a nearby ammunition dump. </P>
