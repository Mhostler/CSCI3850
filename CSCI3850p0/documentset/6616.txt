<DATELINE>TOKYO, May 17 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  As the United States and Japan edge towards a collision in their car trade feud, some parliament members and bureaucrats are mulling the use of an untested bargaining chip -- cutting U.S. agricultural imports. </P>
<P> ``The fact that American farm exporters depend heavily on our market can be a powerful weapon for obtaining concessions, if we want,'' said a senior policy adviser to the biggest party in the ruling coalition, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). </P>
<P> On Tuesday, the United States announced that it would subject 13 Japanese luxury car models to 100 percent punitive tariffs worth $5.9 billion if Japan failed to open its markets to U.S. cars and car parts by the end of June. </P>
<P> Japan has said the sanctions violate international trade rules and plans to take the dispute to the World Trade Organisation, but has so far refrained from announcing direct retaliation. </P>
<P> Trade minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said Japan ``reserves the right to take countermeasures.'' He did not elaborate. </P>
<P> While auto trade sanctions would hurt one of Japan's key export industries, the United States is vulnerable in other areas, officials in Tokyo said. </P>
<P> They said Japan would have to be very careful about using farm trade sanctions of its own because of the risk of sparking an all-out trade war with the United States. ``It could open a Pandora's box,'' an Agriculture Ministry official said. </P>
<P> The officials noted that the U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA) announced late last month that Japan was the largest export market for U.S. farm products in 1994. </P>
<P> Japan accounted for $9.3 billion of the record $45.7 billion in U.S. farm exports in 1994, compared to $8.7 billion in 1993, the USDA said. In second place was the European Union with $6.8 billion, and third was Canada with $5.5 billion. </P>
<P> According to Japanese Finance Ministry statistics, Japan last year imported 6,352,435 tonnes of wheat, 4,355,347 tonnes of corn and 4,731,308 tonnes of soybeans. </P>
<P> Of the total, 3,706,402 tonnes of wheat, 2,539,764 tonnes of corn and 3,540,131 tonnes of soybeans were bought from the United States. </P>
<P> ``This is a hypothetical question. But shifting wheat supply sources would be an option we could consider, for example,'' said another official at the Agriculture Ministry. </P>
<P> Japan imports wheat from three grain producers -- the United States, Canada and Australia. </P>
<P> ``I think we can find alternative supply sources, in case we reduce wheat imports from the U.S.,'' the official said. </P>
<P> ``European countries, particularly France, seem eager to promote wheat sales to Asia. There should be no problem if wheat quality and stable shipments are guaranteed,'' he said. </P>
<P> The LDP and Agriculture Ministry officials also said Japan is becoming a major buyer of American beef, and could use meat purchases as a bargaining chip. </P>
<P> Japan opened its beef market in 1991 and imported 588,498 tonnes in 1994, mainly from the United States and Australia, the Finance Ministry data showed. Of that, it bought 250,360 tonnes from the United States. </P>
<P> Last week in Washington, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman told the House Agriculture Committee that the U.S.-Japan row over automobilies was not likely to affect U.S. farm exports. </P>
<P> But Glickman said he had discussed the farm trade matter with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor. </P>
