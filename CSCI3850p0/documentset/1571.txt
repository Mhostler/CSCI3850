<P>  Texas gubernatorial candidate George W. Bush dropped in on his mother's book tour Friday, and said former first lady Barbara Bush gave him this advice: ''Smile.'' </P>
<P> ``She gives me a lot of advice, some solicited and some unsolicited, but I think just be myself and not take myself so seriously and endure,'' Bush said. </P>
<P> Barbara Bush in a purple-blue suit shook hands and chatted with a line of customers at a bookstore here, and said the tour for her autobiography has been similar to being on the campaign trail. </P>
<P> Her books were pre-signed because the first lady has arthritis, a bookstore spokeswoman said. </P>
<P> One customer quipped: ``I see you're riding on your mother's coattails,'' to which Bush replied: ``I'm standing as close to her as I can.'' </P>
<P> ``This isn't a campaign event, this is me dropping in on my mother,'' Bush said. </P>
<P> At one point each Bush lifted one of a set of 12-week-old twins in front of photographers. </P>
<P> Bush said he bought five of his mother's books to donate to a community center in Dallas. </P>
<P> The bookstore said Tom Landry held the record for number of books sold at a book signing there at 1,400 in two hours, former vice president Dan Quayle sold 1,100 in one hour and 15 minutes and Barbara Bush was estimated to have sold more than 1,000 in about an hour. </P>
<P> Asked about his opponent Governor Ann Richards, Bush said, ''I'm going to treat her with respect and focus on the issues.'' </P>
<P> Of her son, Mrs Bush said: ``I think he's going to win.'' </P>
<P> She said education and crime are important issues but said she wasn't speaking to the issues -- ``Both my sons are really articulate, and George is particularly articulate.'' </P>
<P> Jeb Bush is running for governor in Florida. Mrs Bush said she planned to throw a fundraising breakfast when she went there. </P>
<P> President Bush was playing golf in Scotland, she said. </P>
