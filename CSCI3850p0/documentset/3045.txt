<DATELINE>LONDON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Prince Charles was hounded Wednesday by British members of parliament and an animal rights group, furious that he had taken his two sons foxhunting. </P>
<P> More than 100 opposition Labor Party MPs signed a parliamentary motion regretting Charles' action and demanding that the government ban children from attending fox hunts. </P>
<P> Prince William, 12, and Prince Harry, 10, were pictured riding with their father at a hunt in October. </P>
<P> The attack coincided with a full-page advertisement in the Independent newspaper taken out by the International Fund for Animal Welfare condemning Charles for encouraging his sons to take part in a ``brutal and abominable'' sport. </P>
<P> The Fund highlighted what it saw as inconsistency between his support for hunting and the concern he expressed in 1988 about a ``diet of freely available and insensate violence'' on television that was likely to be a bad influence on children. </P>
<P> ``Surely the sight of a pack of dogs tearing another living animal limb from limb is far mmore disturbing than anything they could see on TV,'' the advertisement said. </P>
<P> The animal rights group cited an opinion poll last month showing that 74 percent of Britons disapproved of Charles introducing his sons to fox-hunting. </P>
<P> Charles has said it is right that his sons should learn about traditional country pursuits. </P>
