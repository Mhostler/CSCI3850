<P>  Police exploded a bomb found outside the Bremen office of Germany's liberal Free Democrats Party Monday, a police spokesman said. </P>
<P> A note with the bomb said it was a protest against FDP policies. The liberals have been in national coalition with Chancellor Helmut Kohl for 12 years and are junior partners in Bremen's state government, . </P>
<P> The party has had a disastrous run in elections over the past year, crashing out of six regional assemblies and the European Parliament. In Bavarian polls Sunday, it failed to win enough votes to stay in the state assembly. </P>
<P> An FDP employee found the bomb in a garbage bag outside the party offices in the north German city state. Police evacuated the area before undertaking a controlled explosion, which shattered nearby windows. </P>
<P> The police spokesman said the note left with the bomb contained quotations from Red Army Faction letters. The RAF urban guerrilla group has waged a campaign of violence against the German establishment since the 1970s. </P>
