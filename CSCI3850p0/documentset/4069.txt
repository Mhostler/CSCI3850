<P>  A police bomb squad blew up a suspicious-looking object found outside the courthouse where the O.J. Simpson trial was in progress Tuesday, but it turned out to be harmless, officials said. </P>
<P> The bomb squad was called out when a pipe wrapped with tape was spotted in a newspaper box near the main entrance of the Criminal Courts Building, said Officer Arthur Holmes, a police spokesman. </P>
<P> As a precaution, the street that separates the courthouse from the makeshift media encampment dubbed ``Camp O.J.'' was cordoned off, and photographers and camera crews normally positioned on the courthouse steps were ordered to temporarily clear out. </P>
<P> Using small explosive charges, bomb experts then blew up the newspaper box, Holmes said. </P>
<P> ``It turned out it wasn't an actual device,'' he said. ``But the officers took it very seriously. It end up being nothing.'' </P>
<P> Police said they were looking into whether the object was planted as a hoax. </P>
