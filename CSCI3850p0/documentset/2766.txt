<P>  U.S. and allied warplanes will destroy Serb warplanes in Croatia on any new raids if the Serbs again launch air attacks into Bosnia, Defense Secretary William Perry warned Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``If they go in tomorrow or the next day with another bombing attack, then we'll go back and blow up their airplanes,'' he said, defending Monday's NATO's bombing strike which pitted runways at a Serb airfield in Croatia but spared Serb aircraft. </P>
<P> He told reporters flying home with him from Argentina that the idea behind Monday's strike by 30 allied jets was to send a message to the Serbs without undue risk to U.S., British, French and Dutch pilots who took part. </P>
<P> ``We could have attacked their airplanes and certainly could have destroyed some of them. What we are trying to do is not blow up a lot of things in Croatia, but to deter the Krajina Serbs from doing anything like that again,'' Perry said. </P>
<P> Monday's limited response to Serb aerial attacks around the embattled enclave of Bihac in northwestern Bosnia has drawn some criticism in Washington because dozens of warplanes did not go after Serb jets which were parked in bunkers at the airfield. </P>
<P> In a news conference with reporters on his aircraft, Perry also repeated his criticism of Republican Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, who charged last week that President Clinton was not fit to be commander-in-chief of the armed forces. </P>
<P> ``I'm not trying to pick a fight with anybody,'' the secretary said in response to questions about the comment by Helms, who is in line to become chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee. </P>
<P> ``I am concerned about a very important issue, which is the constitutional role of the commander-in-chief over the military forces. I think it's important to support that every way we can, and I do not think it is appropriate to tear apart the fabric of that very important relationship.'' </P>
<P> Perry said he was pleased with his six-day trip to Brazil and Argentina to improve bilateral defense ties with those two countries, which are solidifying democratic political institutions and improving their economies. </P>
<P> He said the security situation in South America is better now than it has been in decades, although the threat of drug trafficking and violence that accompanies drugs are present. </P>
<P> Mentioning Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay in particular, Perry said perhaps it was time for a loose security alliance between some Latin American countries and the United States for joint peackeeeping training and minimizing the chance of conflict among those nations. </P>
<P> ``I anticipate a meeting of some hemispheric ministers'' after the upcoming hemispheric summit in Miami, he said. ``I'm not sure whether I want to propose all of the defense ministers coming, or whether to make it a more selective group -- say the countries I just mentioned -- where I can see a big potential payoff in getting a very vital relationship going rather quickly.'' </P>
<P> Perry said Argentina had presented the United States with a long list of arms that it would like to obtain from Washington, including M-113 personnel carriers, helicopters, two naval frigates and anti-tank weaopons such as ``TOW'' missiles. </P>
<P> ``It's a big list, because they realize that we and they are going to have to go over that list together because they don't have much resources,'' said Perry. </P>
<P> ``The operating budget for their entire navy is only $100 million, so that gives you some sort of flavor. We are looking at leasing them the ships because they can't afford to buy even used ships.'' </P>
