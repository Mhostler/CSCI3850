<DATELINE>TOKYO, March 28 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A Japanese court on Tuesday upheld a local government decision to release information about an anti-submarine warfare centre run by the Japanese navy on Okinawa island, southern Japan. </P>
<P> Presiding Judge Yasue Inaba of the Naha District Court said the court saw no reason why the state should block public access to floor plans as promised in the freedom of information act. </P>
<P> The state first filed the lawsuit in September 1989 against Naha city, capital of Okinawa prefecture, when its mayor said he would release information about the centre. </P>
<P> The defence ministry said the move would jeopardise the navy's anti-submarine operations, one of the most secret areas of Japan's military activities. </P>
<P> Japan's construction law requires that floor plans of public buildings be filed with local governments. </P>
<P> Since the late 1980's, Japan's navy has been cooperating closely with the U.S. Navy to detect, track and identify submarines belonging to third countries, especially nuclear ones that sail close to Japan's shores. </P>
<P> Similar anti-submarine centres are located in four other Japanese navy bases near Tokyo and in north, central and southwestern Japan. </P>
<P> The Naha facility was completed in 1990 despite local opposition. </P>
<P> Okinawans have a long history of mistrust for the post-war Japanese military, because of a genocide by Imperial Japanese Army in the April-June 1945 Battle of Okinawa. </P>
<P> The Japanese army forced thousands of Okinawans to commit suicide during the battle, based on an unwritten code that said all must die for the emperor. In total, about 150,000 islanders, or a third of Okinawa's population at the time, was killed in the battle. </P>
