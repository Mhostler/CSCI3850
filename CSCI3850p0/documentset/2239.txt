<P>  Japan's ruling coalition agreed on the basics of a long-neglected bill for atomic bomb victims Wednesday, opening the way for compensating those killed in the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings, party officials said. </P>
<P> The bill when enacted would open the way for bereaved families to receive about $1,400 for A-bomb survivors who died of radioactive diseases, such as leukemia, or other illness before 1969, said an official of the Socialist party policy board. </P>
<P> Since 1969, the government has been paying the same amount to registered atomic bomb victims, or hibakusha, who died after April 1, 1969. </P>
<P> The coalition would aim to have it enacted during the current session of parliament that ends in late November, the officials said. </P>
<P> There had been no provision for such payments for those killed immediately by the U.S. bombs -- some 140,000 in Hiroshima and 70,000 in Nagasaki, or those who died between 1945 and March 31, 1969. The total eligible families would be those related to about 300,000 victims, the Socialist official said. </P>
