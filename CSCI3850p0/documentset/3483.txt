<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The former head of the State Department counter-terrorism office has agreed to pay a $5,000 civil fine to resolve allegations of improper lobbying after leaving government service, the Justice Department said Thursday. </P>
<P> Ex-ambassador Robert Oakley was alleged to have improperly lobbied the government to lift restrictions on Lebanon's Middle East Airlines, banned from flying to the United States because of inadequate attention to the problem of terrorists using Beirut International Aiport. </P>
<P> Federal law imposes a lifetime ban on former officials trying to influence government action on a matter on which the ex-official participated while in the government. </P>
<P> Oakley was counter-terrorism chief from 1984 through 1986, taking part in the presidential decision to ban Middle East Airlines, according to public filings in the case. He also served as ambassador to Pakistan and special envoy to Somalia. </P>
<P> After leaving the State Department in 1992, he and his consulting company contracted with the airline to get the ban removed. He received a total of $100,000 in fees over two years, some of which was for improper lobbying activities, the Justice Department said. </P>
<P> The ban on the airline is still in effect. </P>
<P> The Justice Department charged that Oakley's actions violated the strict post-employment restrictions even though Oakley fully disclosed that he was representing the airline to officials he contacted and did not recommend the ban be lifted until Beirut's airport had tightened up security. </P>
<P> The Justice Department said the civil fine was equivalent to the maximum sentence available under sentencing guidelines in a criminal prosecution. </P>
