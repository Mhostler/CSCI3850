<DATELINE>TAIPEI, April 5 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Taiwan marked with reverence the 20th anniversary of the death of Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek on Wednesday but a biographer slammed him as only slightly less evil than his rival Mao Tsetung. </P>
<P> Author Lee Ao told Reuters that his latest book describes Chiang as a man who used foreign aid to bet on the stock market and a leader who quailed from fighting the Japanese in World War Two. </P>
<P> Generalissimo Chiang, a long-time ally of the United States and once almost worshipped on this island, arrested democracy in Taiwan and was not responsible for the island's economic miracle either, Lee said by telephone. </P>
<P> ``In the past we used to eulogise Chiang and bad-mouth Mao Tsetung. But the truth is that they were both bad,'' said Lee, whose book ``Chiang Kai-shek: A Critical Biography'' was due to be sold from April 25. </P>
<P> ``Mao was probably worse because Chiang was not as lascivious as Mao,'' added Lee, who is also a professor of history at Taiwan's prestigious Soochow University. </P>
<P> A recent biography of Mao by his former doctor Li Zhisui says that Mao had many young mistresses and believed that copulation with them would prolong his life. </P>
<P> ``We have investigated but we have not found any positive points about Chiang,'' Lee said. </P>
<P> Chiang's Nationalists lost the Chinese civil war against Mao's communists in 1949 and fled to Taiwan. </P>
<P> Lee, a famous author who had 96 of his 130 books banned in the martial law era which ended in 1987, said Chiang lost Japanese aid given to Nationalist Party founder Sun Yat-sen in the 1920s by gambling on Shanghai's stock exchange. </P>
<P> Instead of fighting the Japanese in China in World War Two, he tried on five occasions to secretly broker treaties with them, Lee said. </P>
<P> The generalissimo also lied that he had attended a Japanese military academy and he regularly altered photographs to fit his version of historical truth, Lee's book claims. </P>
<P> But on Wednesday, as usual, Taiwan paid its respects to the man immortalised in statues and portraits around the island. Chiang's only surviving son, Chiang Wego, wept as he knelt before his fathers' memorial in central Taipei. </P>
<P> ``We will not let you down,'' shouted Chiang Wego, emotionally punching his fist into the air at the memorial service. </P>
<P> President Lee Teng-hui also placed a wreath at Chiang's tomb near the northern Taiwan city of Taoyuan. </P>
