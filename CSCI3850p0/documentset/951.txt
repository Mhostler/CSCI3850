<P>  A mystery photographic archive of the 1937 Chinese-Japanese battle for Shanghai has surfaced in New Zealand, providing new evidence of atrocities and civilian casualties, a military historian said Tuesday. </P>
<P> Laurie Barber of the University of Waikato said the trove included pictures of Chinese Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek and his wife at a candlelit dinner, suggesting the photographer was a senior official, possibly an American, with privileged access. </P>
<P> ``There are 97 photos and they show, besides very good close-in action scenes, bombing raid casualties (and) punishments, either perpetrated by the Chinese Nationalist defenders or by the Japanese, we can't be sure,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``They give an idea of the degree of atrocity that went on, of the horrendous nature of casualties the civilian population took from bombing,'' Barber added in a telephone interview. </P>
<P> One of the pictures showed a severed head in a cage suspended in a tree, while another showed two men confined in a large wooden box, with only their heads showing. </P>
<P> Others show Chinese civilians lying dead beneath a wall, apparently victims of a firing squad, Barber said. </P>
<P> Pictures of Chiang Kai-shek with U.S. military advisers, and one showing a U.S. Marine officer, suggest the author of the collection may have been an American, the historian added. </P>
<P> He said some 2,000 U.S. Marines were rushed in to guard U.S. territory in Shanghai, then an international city in which Britain, France, the United States and Japan had their own zones of influence. </P>
<P> Chiang Kai-shek poured his best troops, trained and armed by German military advisers, into the three-month battle for Shanghai from September to November 1937. They suffered massive casualties as the Japanese captured the city. </P>
<P> ``For me, as a military historian, the most important point made by these photos is the German influence in the training, the arming, the uniforming and disciplining of Chiang Kai-shek's best armies,'' Barber said. </P>
<P> ``If they didn't have Oriental faces, you would think it was Western Front photographs of German soldiers advancing in France, say, in 1940,'' he said. </P>
<P> Japan's wartime role in episodes such as the 1937 army massacre in Nanking, which occurred shortly after the battle for Shanghai, is still an acutely sensitive issue for Tokyo and a source of tension in relations with its Asian neighbors. </P>
<P> The Shanghai photographs, taken with a box Brownie camera, found their way to Barber after being discovered on a shelf in the chimney of an old house that was being demolished in New Zealand's north island town of Huntly. </P>
<P> Barber said he was still engaged in ``detective work'' to find out how they made their way to New Zealand, but planned to recommend that they be placed in a national archive. </P>
<P> Although the collection was not unique, he said, it represented a fascinating view of events by a protagonist who was closely involved. </P>
<P> ``This one is particularly interesting in that it's taken by an interested party with a small camera, right up front, and I don't believe that they're part of a propaganda kit or anything like that. These are actual, spontaneous war photos.'' </P>
