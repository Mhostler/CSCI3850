<P>  A District Court Saturday jailed the host of Taiwan's most outspoken pirate radio station for eight months while angry protesters shouted and screamed outside the court and taxi-driver fans blocked streets. </P>
<P> Hsu Rong-chi, organizer of the underground Voice of Taiwan, was charged under a law banning illegal public gatherings after he mobilized hundreds of taxi drivers to blockade the Finance Ministry last February to protest high insurance premiums, a district court judge said. </P>
<P> ``The defendant refused to dismiss the gathering and that violated the law,'' the judge said. </P>
<P> ``Freedom of speech is not a crime,'' Hsu shouted after the judgment was read in the courtroom crowded with police and Hsu's supporters. ``This is political repression,'' he cried as police dragged him away. </P>
<P> Hsu also faces a charge of violating public order after hundreds of his taxi driver fans clashed with riot police last April when he aired a plea to supporters to converge outside the now-demolished headquarters of the ruling Nationalist Party to prevent the razing of what he said was a historic site. </P>
