<DATELINE>IFRANE, Morocco (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Monday that his people expected support for their claim over Jerusalem from Arab and Muslim countries attending a meeting in Morocco. </P>
<P> ``The Israelis are in the process of 'Judaising' Jerusalem by building settlements. How can we have peace without Jerusalem and how can we have stability without the respect of the sacred values of Jerusalem?'' Arafat told reporters. </P>
<P> ``The Palestinian people expect the support of their Arab and Muslim brothers over Jerusalem,'' he added. </P>
<P> Arafat is heading the Palestinian delegation at a two-day meeting of the Islamic Conference Organization (ICO) al-Qods (Jerusalem) committee being held at this Atlas mountain resort. </P>
<P> He made no mention of his quarrel with Jordan over custody of Muslim sites in the city holy to Muslims, Jews and Christians alike. </P>
<P> His language was reminiscent of the tone adopted by the ICO 25 years ago when it was set up in Jeddah to counter what was viewed as the ``Judaisation'' of Jerusalem following an arson attack on al-Aqsa mosque. </P>
<P> Committee chairman King Hassan of Morocco struck a moderate tone, accepting the political realities that followed the signing of peace treaties with Israel by several of the ICO's Arab members, including the PLO and Jordan. </P>
<P> ``The question of al-Qods is no longer the one for which this committee was set up,'' the king said in an opening speech. </P>
<P> He added that, on a political level, ``we do not want to have animosity toward any person but at the same time we do not want to be faced with a fait accompli...'' a reference to Jewish settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. </P>
<P> He urged the 16-member panel to set aside sentiment and work out a common strategy in closed session, an indication that the meeting would try to mend the rift between the PLO and Jordan which marred the last Islamic summit in Casablanca in December. </P>
<P> While other countries represented on the committee have sent foreign ministers or their deputies, Arafat's presence is proof of the importance he attaches to it. </P>
<P> Israel captured the Arab half of Jerusalem from Jordan in 1967 and later declared the city its undivided eternal capital. The ICO considers Jerusalem an integral part of Palestinian territories and capital of a future Palestinian state. </P>
<P> The argument over custody is not on the agenda but Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdul-Karim al-Kabariti said before leaving Amman Sunday that it could be raised as an emergency issue. </P>
<P> Kabariti said that his country would not give up its role as guardian of the Islamic sites unless Palestinians were capable of shouldering such duties. </P>
<P> Jordan is worried that the PLO, backed by Saudi Arabia, Syria, Morocco and Egypt, might ask the Ifrane meeting to name an independent Islamic body to look after the sites until Palestinians regain control over the city. </P>
<P> The last ICO summit issued a communique supporting Arafat's claim to Jerusalem as his future capital after rejecting a Jordanian demand to include reference to the supervisory role it was granted under its peace treaty with Israel. </P>
<P> Israeli-Palestinian negotiations on the final status of Jerusalem are not due to start before mid-1996. </P>
<P> The shooting of two Arabs by an Israeli security guard in Jerusalem Monday is likely to strengthen the argument by such countries as Iran that further disunity among Muslim ranks would prolong Israel's occupation of Arab land. </P>
<P> Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mohamed al-Khansali said on Monday he hoped the meeting would ``unify Muslim ranks in order to liberate the Palestinian people from Israeli occupation.'' </P>
