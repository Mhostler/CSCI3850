<P>  Cuban President Fidel Castro met the United Nations' top human rights official Friday night and offered Cuba's support and cooperation to help him carry out his mission, the official Cuban newspaper Granma said Saturday. </P>
<P> U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Jose Ayala Lasso was received by Castro at the end of a three-day working visit to the Caribbean island at the invitation of the Cuban government. </P>
<P> Granma said the Cuban leader and Ayala talked about the U.N. official's mandate to promote human rights throughout the world. ``Both sides agreed about the need to avoid the political manipulation of this important theme,'' the newspaper said. </P>
<P> It added the Cuban leader wished Ayala success in his work and offered him Cuba's support and cooperation. </P>
<P> The Cuban government, which has been censured by the Geneva- based U.N. Human Rights Commission for persecuting political dissidents, is very sensitive about international criticism of its human rights record and its one-party socialist system. </P>
<P> The government says the human rights accusations levelled against it are part of a politically motivated campaign being waged by the United States. </P>
<P> Ayala, who met both political dissidents and senior government officials during his three-day stay, told a news conference Friday that Cuba, like any other country in the world, could and should improve its human rights record. </P>
<P> But he emphasized he had not come to Cuba to either acquit or condemn Cuba over alleged human rights violations. Ayala said the very fact he had been able to travel to the island and start a dialogue was positive. </P>
