<P>  Four Bangladeshi U.N. troops were injured, one critically, Monday when their armored car was hit in a besieged Muslim enclave in Bosnia by a rocket fired by rebel Serbs in Croatia, U.N. officials said. </P>
<P> ``Our initial information is the attack came from the west RSK (Republic of Serb Krajina) positions,'' U.N. spokesman Thant Myint-U told Reuters. </P>
<P> ``The initial report said that the vehicle was hit by an RPG (rocket-propelled grenade),'' a U.N. official said. </P>
<P> The attack occurred at around 3:15 p.m. (11:15 a.m. EST) in the government-held town of Velika Kladusa in the north of the Bihac enclave, which has been under assault by rebel Muslims allied with Serb forces. </P>
<P> A U.N. spokesman in Sarajevo could not say if NATO had been asked to launch air strikes against the Serbs to punish them for the attack. </P>
<P> Last week the U.N. announced that 400 of the 1,200 Bangladeshis in Bihac would be withdrawn because of problems in resupplying them. However, they have been unable to go ahead because the Serbs in the breakaway Krajina area of Croatia have refused permission for them to cross their territory. </P>
<P> The attack came as Bosnian Serb forces appeared to be in a more conciliatory mood -- lifting their blockade of a fuel convoy to allow the hard-pressed U.N. mission in Bosnia to get its first supplies of gasoline and diesel in over three weeks. </P>
<P> The six-truck French convoy with 30 tons of fuel for the mission, whose supplies had run so low it had started cutting anti-sniper patrols and other vital operations, had been blocked at a Serb checkpoint outside Sarajevo for three days. </P>
<P> However the Serbs, demonstrating the brinkmanship they have employed virtually throughout the civil war in their relations with the peacekeeping mission, were still holding three Danish fuel tankers that were hijacked at gunpoint by Serb soldiers Saturday. </P>
<P> U.N. officials emphasized that the French convoy would provide only enough fuel to operate at normal levels for six more days, adding that many more convoys were needed. </P>
<P> The blockade was imposed by the Serbs after NATO carried out air strikes against Serb targets in a bid to stop them from attacking the U.N.-designated ``safe haven'' of Bihac in northwest Bosnia. </P>
<P> The U.N. commander for Bosnia, Lt.-Gen. Sir Michael Rose, was scheduled to meet Bosnian Serb leaders at their headquarters at Pale near Sarajevo Monday to protest the blockade and against a new Serb order banning U.N. troops from escorting civilian aid convoys. </P>
<P> On Saturday Rose was snubbed by rebel Serbs in Croatia, allies of the Bosnian Serbs, who stopped him from visiting Bihac. </P>
<P> Responding to the Serb ban on military escorts for U.N. humanitarian convoys to civilians trapped by the war, Thant said it would make it impossible to get aid to Sarajevo and Muslim enclaves in eastern Bosnia. </P>
<P> However the U.N. relief agency organizing the aid deliveries said Monday it was considering running convoys without escorts provided the drivers were willing. </P>
<P> A spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Kris Janowski, told reporters a Norwegian team was prepared to run a convoy into Sarajevo without an armored escort. </P>
<P> Elsewhere in Bosnia, U.N. officials were making contingency plans to operate without fuel. </P>
<P> In the besieged Muslim enclave of Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia, Dutch U.N. troops were considering rigging up a local water mill to power their communications equipment. </P>
<P> In another Muslim enclave, Gorazde, peacekeepers were planning to resupply their observation posts by mule. </P>
<P> Serb harassment of U.N. peacekeepers has prompted threats from Western nations to pull them out, but America and France said Monday it was important that the Blue Helmets stay in order to prevent an escalation of the fighting. </P>
<P> Meanwhile, NATO pressed on with plans to assemble a large fighting force to go in and rescue the lightly armed U.N. peacekeepers should the need arise. </P>
