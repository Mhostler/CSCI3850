<P>  A rare type of nitrogen molecule can be used to find how high up on the food chain an animal is, and thus how likely its flesh is to contain poisons such as mercury, Canadian scientists reported Wednesday. </P>
<P> Toxins such as pesticides and heavy metals accumulate in the bodies of animals, and animals and people that eat other animals also eat the accumulated poisons. </P>
<P> World health officials are worried about the effects on people of eating fish carrying pollutants and poisons -- especially in the Great Lakes lying between Canada and the United States. </P>
<P> A creature's position on the food chain is an important indicator of how vulnerable it is to such poisoning. </P>
<P> In a report in the science journal Nature, researchers at McGill University in Montreal said they had found an isotope (variety) of nitrogen known as nitrogen-15 that shows where lake trout are on the food chain. </P>
<P> Gilbert Cabana and colleagues said this varied widely depending on where in the lake the fish lived. They said their method could be a short-cut to finding which varieties of fish or other animals might be full of poison. </P>
