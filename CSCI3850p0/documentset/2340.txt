<P>  Somali warlord Mohamed Farah Aideed and nearly 300 delegates from allied factions opened a peace conference Tuesday, inviting all groups to attend after having snubbed rivals essential to any serious peace effort. </P>
<P> Speaking as his fighters battled for a ninth straight day in Mogadishu, conference chairman Mohamed Kanyare Afrah said he hoped the meeting marked a turning point after four years of strife. </P>
<P> He told 277 delegates in the heavily-protected ``Peace House'' venue that he hoped the reconciliation conference would lay the foundations for a united, non-clan Somalia. </P>
<P> ``This conference is open to all those factions who want to attend this serious national reconciliation conference in which we are trying to save the Somali people and establish a government of national unity,'' Aideed told the opening session. </P>
<P> Other leaders said those who failed to attend were ``servants of foreign elements'' who did not want to end Somalia's crisis. </P>
<P> The Peace House was ringed with ``technical'' battle wagons mounted with machine guns and multi-barrel anti-aircraft guns. </P>
<P> Diplomats from Egypt, Sudan, Eritrea and Ethiopia and some aid agency officials attended but a front row seat for a representative of the U.N. Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM) stayed vacant. </P>
<P> Kanyare's fighters battled militiamen loyal to self-styled president Ali Mahdi Mohamed, Aideed's main rival, as schoolgirls gave faction leaders at the Peace House flowers and sang the national anthem. </P>
<P> Ali Mahdi and most factions with his Group of 12 alliance were until Tuesday not invited to the conference, which officials of Aideed's Somali National Alliance expect to last more than three weeks. UNOSOM had demanded that the conference include everyone seen as vital to peace. </P>
<P> Ali Mahdi has warned of widespread fighting if the meeting elects an interim government for Somalia, which has been without a central government since 1991. </P>
<P> In the Medina and central Bermuda districts militiamen fought with heavy, medium and small weapons despite the meeting. </P>
<P> Mogadishu's Digfer Hospital said it had received a total of 37 people killed and 244 wounded since the clashes flared at the start of last week. </P>
