<P>  White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry Monday said Monday he is finding his new job humbling because there is ``so much I don't know.'' </P>
<P> McCurry, the State Department spokesman for the past two years, was named by President Clinton last week to replace Dee Dee Myers, who resigned. Noting that he has been concentrating on international issues at the State Department, McCurry told reporters he would wait until next week to hold his first formal White House briefing. </P>
<P> ``I've got a lot of homework to do,'' he said, adding that his new job has been ``a little bit humbling ... because I recognize there is so much I don't know.'' </P>
