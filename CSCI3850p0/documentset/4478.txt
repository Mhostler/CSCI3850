<P>  Advisers Shanghai's government have suggested euthanasia or mercy killing be allowed after a survey showed 90 percent of the residents of China's largest city approved of it, the Beijing Evening News said Wednesday. </P>
<P> A group of members of the Shanghai Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which is currently in session, suggested the municipal government allow euthanasia on a trial basis, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> It quoted a survey by the Number Two Military Medical University's Shanghai Hospital as saying 93.6 percent of 313 people interviewed approve of euthanasia. </P>
<P> The survey showed 98.4 percent of medical personnel, 90 percent of people in legal circles and 90.1 percent of the general public were in favor of mercy killing, it said. </P>
<P> The advisory body laid down several conditions under which euthanasia could be exercised. </P>
<P> It said the patient had to want to die by euthanasia; three doctors must agree a patient could not be cured and relatives and the city government must approve, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> Another condition was that there should be no inheritance or other legal disputes involved. </P>
