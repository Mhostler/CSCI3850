<P>  A California congressman Tuesday said extremists were increasingly threatening federal officials in Western states and accused members of Congress of making inflammatory statements. </P>
<P> Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., asked for an inquiry by the House Resources Committee into verbal and physical threats on public officials. In a letter to the committee's chairman, Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, Miller cited bomb explosions in offices of the Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service in Nevada and threats against federal employees in Nevada, Montana and Idaho. </P>
<P> At a news conference Miller said Americans in public office had a responsibility ``to end the casual demeaning of federal employees who risk their lives every day to defend public property and U.S. citizens.'' </P>
<P> He quoted politicians including Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, talking about a developing ``healthy fear'' of federal agents and Rep. Helen Chenowyeth, R-Idaho, who said citizens had reason to be afraid of their government. </P>
<P> ``These kinds of flippant statements roll easily off the lips of some Western politicians with extremist fringe groups in their states,'' Miller said. ``Their words can legitimize and incite and there are already more than enough dangers facing rangers and other enforcement officials.'' </P>
