<P> ``The (U.S.) embassy in Kuwait is in regular contact with UNIKOM (United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Obervation Mission), which is conducting an investigation into the detention of two Americans in Iraq,'' State Department spokesman David Johnson said. </P>
<P> U.S. officials were also in contact with Polish authorities, who provide services to American citizens in Iraq in the absence of U.S.-Iraq diplomatic relations, and with the families of the two Americans, Johnson said. </P>
<P> He declined to name the two but said they were believed to have been private citizens on business in Iraq and were not U.S. government employees. </P>
<P> U.N. sources in New York said they were thought to have worked for a contracting company and were detained on March 13. </P>
