<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin convened his Cabinet Thursday to consider a crackdown on the militant Muslim group Hamas after a suicide bomber killed at least 20 people and wounded 45 in the heart of Tel Aviv. </P>
<P> Rabin told Israelis stunned by Wednesday's attack that the country faced ``a big decision'' about separating Jews from Arabs permanently. </P>
<P> Rabin gave no hint of the measures he was planning at the emergency meeting in his Defense Ministry office in Tel Aviv. </P>
<P> Security sources said apart from sealing Israel's borders with the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which he did immediately after the bombing of a commuter bus, Rabin could do little except round up Hamas figures in the West Bank. </P>
<P> Rabin deported to Lebanon 415 suspected Hamas members after attacks in 1992. But the move backfired politically and Israel agreed to take back the men. Hamas took reponsibility for the attack in calls to local radio stations. </P>
<P> ``I intend to bring to the Cabinet...proposals which will enable the proper actions in the face of cruel and horrible Hamas terrorism,'' Rabin said Wednesday. </P>
<P> Rabin hinted that he was seeking a permanent separation between Israel's four million Jews and the two million Palestinians of Gaza and the West Bank who depend on the Jewish state for work. </P>
<P> ``The State of Israel is standing before a big decision -- it wants separation between us and the Palestinians, not only as a technical closure for several days, but as a way of life,'' Rabin said. </P>
<P> Police lowered their estimate of the death toll to 20 from 22. A police spokesman said the grisly task of assembling body parts, which were scattered over a wide area, was continuing. </P>
<P> Rabin said the carnage in Tel Aviv's main shopping street would not deflect him from peace talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Arab states. </P>
<P> ``We are sticking with the peace process and the peace treaty with Jordan will be signed next week. None of the enemies of peace will disrupt it,'' Rabin said on radio and television after rushing home from London Wednesday evening. </P>
<P> Rabin demanded that Yasser Arafat, head of the Palestinian self-rule authority, crack down on Hamas in its Gaza Strip stronghold. But he put less pressure on the PLO leader this time than after the Hamas kidnapping of an Israeli soldier last week to find those responsible. </P>
<P> ``I cannot demand from them responsibility when we are speaking of areas in the territories...where we are the military government,'' Rabin said, referring to the belief that the bomber came from the West Bank. </P>
<P> ``We are also committed to the Declaration of Principles as long as the Palestinian side proves its willingness in the war against terror, against terror coming from inside the territories at the moment under its authority, that is the Gaza Strip and Jericho,'' Rabin said. </P>
<P> He said Israel had still not found the mastermind behind two Hamas suicide bombings in Afula and Hadera in April which killed a total of 13 Israelis. </P>
