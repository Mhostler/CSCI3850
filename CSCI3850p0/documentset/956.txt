<P>  Federal mediators Tuesday held separate meetings with team owners and players' representatives to set ground rules for Wednesday's negotiations aimed at resolving the baseball strike, now in its 12th day. </P>
<P> Mediators met with the owners panel in the morning and held talks with the union group later in the day. </P>
<P> ``The owners met for three and a half hours with the federal mediators today,'' said Boston Red Sox owner John Harrington. ''They know where we stand and what we must have.'' </P>
<P> A panel of owners will join their chief negotiator, Richard Ravitch, for the first time on Wednesday, the first talks held since the day the players went on strike. </P>
<P> Players' union head Donald Fehr said he welcomed the help of mediators and the inclusion of owners in the talks, but he did not sound optimistic that Wednesday's session would produce a settlement. </P>
<P> ``If the owners were interested in serious negotiations we wouldn't be having these preliminary meetings, we would be in there negotiating,'' Fehr told reporters. </P>
<P> Bud Selig, the chairman of baseball's Executive Council, announced Monday a list of 12 owners and club officials who will attend the meetings. Selig said no more than five or six members of the group will participate in talks at one time. They are expected to represent a cross section of small, medium and large market teams. </P>
<P> A total of 154 games have been officially canceled through Tuesday in baseball's eighth work stoppage since 1972. It is the second longest baseball strike on record. A 50-day strike in 1981 forced cancellation of 712 games. </P>
<P> ``We have every intention of continuing to try in ablosute good faith to resolve this dispute and to come up with a new agreement and long term labor peace,'' Ravitch said. </P>
<P> But Ravitch suggested that the owners have not changed their position of demanding a salary cap, the issue at the heart of the dispute. The players have said they will never accept a salary cap. </P>
<P> ``We have not changed our view about of what the problems in the game are and how they have to be resolved,'' Ravitch said. </P>
<P> Fehr repeated his charge that a strike is what the owners wanted all along and said they could be in for a long one. </P>
<P> ``Joint meetings would have been going on long before this if the owners had had an interest in (resolving the strike),'' Fehr said. </P>
<P> ``They wanted to force a strike to begin with, maybe they think the players will break,'' Fehr continued. ``If they believe the players will break the only thing that will persuade them otherwise is the passage of time.'' </P>
<P> Said Harrington: ``It's worth noting that the owners are losing less than the three million dollars the players are losing daily.'' </P>
