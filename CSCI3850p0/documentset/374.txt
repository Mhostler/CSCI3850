<P>  When Congress opens hearings Tuesday into the Whitewater affair it will be a victory of sorts for soft-spoken Republican Jim Leach and his declared campaign to ensure that no politician is above the law. </P>
<P> From the start of revelations about President and Hillary Rodham Clinton's financial dealings in Arkansas, the Iowa Representative has demanded formal investigations first by a special counsel and then by Congress. </P>
<P> He has also conducted his own investigation and delivered a lengthy report on his findings to the House. </P>
<P> The initial hearings before the House of Representatives Banking Committee on which Leach, 51, is the senior Republican, will fall far short of the disclosure Leach wants. </P>
<P> They will be confined at first to the suicide a year ago of White House Deputy Counsel Vincent Foster and possibly improper contacts between White House aides and Treasury officials about a government investigation into the insolvent Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan, headed by Clinton's partner in the Whitewater Development Corp. </P>
<P> And the hearings could well turn out to be a public airing of a battle-by-letters between Leach and the committee's crusty chairman, Texas Democrat Henry Gonzalez. </P>
<P> The two have butted heads over the ground rules for the hearings and over Gonzalez's reluctance to get involved in Whitewater. </P>
<P> Leach's role as Republican point-man in the Whitewater affair is an unusual one for him, although he was been deeply involved in efforts to solve the 1980s savings and loans institution crisis. </P>
<P> He is known for a quiet thoughtfulness and moderation; his rumpled look and trademark sweater give him a professorial appearance. </P>
<P> Leach was elected to Congress in 1976 after stunning family and friends by quitting a promising diplomatic career in the Foreign Service to protest President Richard Nixon's firing in October 1973 of Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox during the Watergate scandal. </P>
<P> ``This symbolized the president putting himself above the law,'' Leach said. </P>
<P> He does not, however, consider the Clinton controvery to be in the same league as Watergate. </P>
<P> He said it was important because of its symbolism, involving obedience to the law, whether public office could be used for private gain and whether full disclosure was part of the traditional U.S. government. </P>
<P> Many characterize Leach, known as one of the most liberal Republicans in Congress, as a ``loner'' who does not always share Republican views. He formed the Republican Mainstream Committee in 1984 to give moderates a greater voice in the party's policies -- then dominated by conservative Ronald Reagan. </P>
<P> He is married with two children. </P>
