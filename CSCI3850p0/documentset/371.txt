<P>  The leaders of 25 Caribbean countries from Mexico to Cuba are set to arrive in Colombia Sunday to sign an agreement to create the framework for a regional free-trade bloc of 200 million people. </P>
<P> The first step towards consolidating the Association of Caribbean States will be the signing of a free-trade agreement between Colombia and the 13 member countries of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). </P>
<P> Presidents Carlos Salinas of Mexico and Fidel Castro of Cuba are among the heads of state and government expected to attend the signing ceremony in the colonial port of Cartagena. </P>
<P> The association will initially promote social, political and economic cooperation among its member countries before providing the structure for a trade bloc that would have an estimated gross national product of $500 billion. Its members will be Colombia, Cuba, Mexico, Venezuela, CARICOM and Central America. </P>
<P> Another 12 Caribbean territories like the British Virgin Islands will also be part of the association but as observers. </P>
<P> The free-trade agreement, which was reached last month between Colombia and CARICOM after more than a year and a half of negotiating, is to come into effect January 1, 1995. </P>
<P> The agreement is the latest in a series signed by Colombia with neighboring countries in recent years as part of its drive to open its economy to the world. </P>
<P> The last one it signed was with Mexico and Venezuela -- which together form the Group of Three -- during the Ibero- American summit in Cartagena last month. </P>
<P> Mexico is a member of the North American Free-Trade Agreement along with Canada and the United States. </P>
<P> Under the agreement with CARICOM, Colombia has agreed to gradually lower its tariff barriers to the community's products over three years, while the island countries will do the same over five years. </P>
<P> Colombia has had a relatively small presence in CARICOM. Bilateral trade is no more than $100 million a year, less than one percent of the South American country's total foreign trade. </P>
<P> CARICOM, which has a combined population of six million, includes Jamaica, Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago. </P>
