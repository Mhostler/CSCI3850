<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A Brooklyn man is accused of cutting down a stand of trees in order to improve his view of New York Harbor, earning him the nickname ``The Butcher of Bay Ridge'' in the waterfront community. </P>
<P> Local residents who walk their dogs in the early morning hours identified their neighbor Paul Dworan as the man who has been cutting down the trees with a handsaw, police Lt. Kevin Barry said. </P>
<P> Some of the trees were on private property and the others were on city park land in Bay Ridge, police said. Dworan was arrested Sunday and charged with three counts of felony mischief. </P>
<P> Dworan has denied the charges, police said. He could not be reached for comment. </P>
<P> The wild cherry, elm and silver maple trees, which started disappearing in February, stood between Dworan's terrace in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn and the nearby Narrows at the mouth of New York Harbor, police said. </P>
<P> ``We're assuming it was so he could get an improved view of the water,'' Barry said. Some 20 to 30 trees were felled, he said, adding ``We've been calling it our arbicide case.'' </P>
<P> Local residents had stronger words. Larry Morrish, head of the local parks council and an aide to Rep. Susan Molinari, R-N.Y., said he wants Dworan to ``get out of Bay Ridge. We don't want you.'' </P>
<P> ``We were trying to restore the park for families who can't afford to go anywhere else and we get this character who rips it to shreds, knowing he's the butcher he is,'' Morrish said. </P>
<P> City Parks Commissioner Henry Stern told a local newspaper the incident was ``a crime against nature.'' </P>
