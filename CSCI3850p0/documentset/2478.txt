<P>  Cuba said Tuesday it was a happy coincidence that it is hosting a ``world solidarity'' meeting just before a U.S.-organized summit of the Americas in December to which Havana has not been invited. </P>
<P> The meeting, aimed primarily as a rally against the long-standing U.S. economic embargo, would take on a special meaning given Cuba's ``unjust exclusion'' from the Miami summit, said Sergio Corriere, president of the Cuban Institute of Friendship with Peoples. </P>
<P> Communist-ruled Cuba is the odd man out at President Clinton's three-day summit, to which democratically elected presidents and prime ministers from all the Americas have been invited. </P>
<P> ``For us it is a cowardice, a manuever to isolate Cuba,'' Corriere told a news conference. </P>
<P> Some 2,223 people from solidarity-with-Cuba groups, political parties and trade unions in 105 countries, mostly in Latin America and Europe, had confirmed they would attend the Nov. 21-25 meeting in Havana, he said. </P>
<P> Corriere added that the ``World Cuba Solidarity Meeting'' was expected to ``give a big push against the blockade'' -- the 32-year-old U.S. economic embargo that Washington maintains to pressure Cuba into political and economic change. </P>
<P> People expected to attend include former French Communist Party leader Georges Marchais and former Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, Corriere said. </P>
<P> Participants at the meeting, to be addressed by a string of senior Cuban government figures, will also include nearly 500 people from the United States and Canada, and more than 50 Cuban-Americans, he added. </P>
