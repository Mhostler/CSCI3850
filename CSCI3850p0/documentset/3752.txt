<P>  Drums of radioactive uranium have been found dumped on a British farm, police said Friday. </P>
<P> Police sealed off the farm in the central English county of Northamptonshire and warned people they would be contaminated if they visited the area. </P>
<P> Officials probing the find said the farm had been used as an illegal dumping ground. The farmer had no idea the drums were radioactive and had sold some of them to a local scrap dealer, police said. </P>
<P> Police said the drums contained 100 pounds of Uranium 238. It may have been used in some sort of industrial process before being dumped. </P>
