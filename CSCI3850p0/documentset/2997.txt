<P>  Nobel Literature Prize winner Kenzaburo Oe said Sunday Japan must take responsibility for its wartime atrocities and stay on a peaceful path to prevent a dangerous and monstrous country from emerging. </P>
<P> ``Of course we are deeply guilty, especially for the people of Asia,'' Oe, 59, told a news conference on arriving in Stockholm to receive his Nobel prize. </P>
<P> ``Even today I believe we have a sense of responsibility about the Second World War and I think we must continue to compensate (for) our deeds during the war, especially for the Asian countries,'' he said, speaking English. </P>
<P> Tokyo says wartime compensation was settled once and for all by the 1951 San Francisco Peace Treaty or by bilateral pacts, but bowed to pressure from wartime survivors in August and announced a 10-year, $1 billion program to undertake cultural and vocational projects as a token of apology. </P>
<P> Many groups, however, including soldiers and other victims of Japan's actions, have said the plan is not enough and want compensation for individuals, like prisoners of war. </P>
<P> In his writing, Oe has championed the causes of the Japanese left, especially pacifism and anti-war struggles that spanned the first three post-war decades. </P>
<P> ``I have some criticism about our government, about their attitude today for the peace of the world,'' Oe said. </P>
<P> Oe said he believed the attitude set out in Japan's ``peace constitution'' imposed by the American occupation forces after the end of World War II must continue. </P>
<P> ``If we obliterate (it) I believe a very monstrous and very dangerous Japan can emerge,'' he said. </P>
<P> An outspoken critic of Japan's establishment, Oe snubbed Tokyo in October by saying he would turn down the country's top cultural award since it is closely connected with the state. </P>
<P> The Order of Culture was established in 1937 by the pre-war Imperial Japanese government to reward ``patriotic'' artists and scientists. </P>
