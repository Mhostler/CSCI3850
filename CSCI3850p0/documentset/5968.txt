<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss.(Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Former U.S. senator John Stennis, a conservative Democrat from Mississippi, died at 4 p.m. Sunday in St. Dominic's Hospital here, a hospital spokeswoman reported. </P>
<P> St. Dominic's nursing supervisor Susan Crowdus told Reuters she could not release the cause of death, but NBC News reported Sunday that Stennis, 93, died of pneumonia. </P>
<P> Stennis served four decades in the Senate, beginning in 1948. Throughout his long Senate career, he was known as a courtly gentleman, always with a friendly word for everyone, who believed in honor, patriotism and fiscal conservatism. </P>
<P> He stood out as soft-spoken opponent of civil rights laws and was best known during his Senate career as a leader of the congressional faction favoring a strong U.S. military. </P>
<P> Stennis was chairman of the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee from 1969 until 1981, wielding his influence on every aspect of U.S. defense power. </P>
<P> During the 1950s, Stennis was named to the committee investigating Republican Sen. Joseph McCarthy, whose free- swinging anti-communist accusations gave rise to the word ''McCarthyism.'' He later accused McCarthy of spilling ``slush and slime'' on the Senate through his innuendo and charges. </P>
<P> The Senate soon afterwards took the unusual step of voting to censure the Wisconsin Senator -- a move that pushed his career downhill. </P>
<P> He also served on the Senate Watergate Committee investigating the role of then-President Richard Nixon in the 1972 burglary of the Democratic Party headquarters. </P>
<P> In 1973, a gunman shot him in the stomach outside his Washington home but he soon overcame the serious injuries. </P>
<P> He had open heart surgery in December 1983 but returned to work in 1984. A year later, he had a cancerous leg removed. Stennis and his wife, Coy, had two children. </P>
