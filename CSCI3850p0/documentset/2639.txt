<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Defense Secretary William Perry flew to South America early Wednesday for a trip aimed at improving U.S. military ties with Brazil and Argentina. </P>
<P> Pentagon officials said Perry's trip stressed the economic and strategic importance of South America to the United States, even as Washington's attention is focused on issues ranging from the civil war in Bosnia to the U.S. trade imbalance with Japan. </P>
<P> Perry was to travel first to Brazil, where he was to make a refueling stop in Manaus en route to Sao Paulo. Before returning home Tuesday, he will meet top officials in Brazil and Argentina and discuss the possible purchase of military training jets by the U.S. armed forces. </P>
<P> On Thursday, Perry will get a close look at Brazil's ``Super Tucano'' training jet at the country's aerospace technical center at Sao Jose Dos Campos not far from Sao Paulo. He will then go to Brasilia for two days of meetings with outgoing Brazilian President Itamar Franco, President-elect Fernando Henrique Cardoso and senior defense officials. </P>
<P> Cardoso is a free market champion and is expected to lead a further expansion of Brazil's growing economy, which experts say could become one of the world's most powerful in decades to come. </P>
<P> Perry will also meet Argentine President Carlos Menem on Sunday and discuss Argentina's ``Pampa 2000'' training jet, which is competing with the Tucano and aircraft made by several U.S. aerospace firms for possible joint training use by the U.S. Air Force and Navy. </P>
<P> Several South and Central American countries, including Chile, have expressed interest in buying U.S. F-16 jet fighters. But defense officials said privately that Perry did not intend to raise that issue on his trip. </P>
<P> ``The secretary has pointed out repeatedly that he is not an arms salesman,'' one of the officials told Reuters. </P>
<P> The Pentagon staid that Perry's first trip to South America was significant because Brazil and Argentina had been steadily improving their democratic institutions and that he would would carry thanks from Washington to Buenos Aires for Argentine participation in international peacekeeping efforts in Haiti and Croatia. </P>
<P> He will fly to Argentina from Rio de Janeiro Saturday night and hold talks with Menem, Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella and military officials in Buenos Aires on Sunday and Monday before departing for Washington Monday night. </P>
<P> While in Buenos Aires, Perry will also hold talks with members of Argentina's House and Senate defense committees and go aboard an Argentine naval ship that took part in operations off Haiti. </P>
