<P>  Though he could face the death penalty, a former minister plans to serve as his own attorney, mount no defense and cross-examine no witnesses when he goes to trial this week for two abortion clinic murders. </P>
<P> Friends of Paul Hill, 40, said the anti-abortion activist is prepared to accept his sentence if he is found guilty of the July 29 shotgun killing of Dr John Britton, 69, and James Barrett, 74, in the parking lot of the Ladies Center, the Pensacola clinic where Britton performed abortions. </P>
<P> Barrett was a security escort for Britton and Barrett's wife, June, 68, was slightly injured in the attack. </P>
<P> ``He understands that the truth is being suppressed and he's willing to take the punishment that the state hands down,'' said Donna Bray, director of Defenders of the Defenders of Life, an anti-abortion group headquartered in Bowie, Md. </P>
<P> Bray said she speaks with Hill almost daily via telephone to the Escambia County Jail. </P>
<P> Hill's trial on two counts of first-degree murder, one count of attempted first-degree murder, and one count of shooting into an occupied vehicle is set to begin with jury selection Monday. Testimony could begin as early as Monday afternoon and the trial could be over within days. </P>
<P> Hill's trial earlier this fall on charges that the shooting violated federal law barring obstruction of clinic entrances lasted less than a week, as Hill also declined to defend himself. </P>
<P> Hill has chosen silence on the charges because he has been barred from arguing that Britton and Barrett's deaths were justified because Britton performed abortions. Hill believes the murder of abortion providers is justifiable homicide because it protects the lives of unborn children. </P>
<P> Bray said she and about two dozen other supporters will be on hand this week for Hill's trial. </P>
<P> Abortion rights advocates in Pensacola have said they also plan a presence during the hearings, and expect Patricia Ireland, president of the National Organization for Women, to attend. </P>
<P> Hill's trial will mark the second time within a year that a man accused of killing a doctor who performed abortions will be on trial for murder in Pensacola. </P>
<P> Last spring, Michael Griffin, 33, was sentenced to life in prison for the March 1993 murder of Dr David Gunn, 47, as he arrived for work at the city's other abortion clinic. </P>
<P> Hill was a vocal supporter of Griffin, protesting in front of the courthouse that Griffin's prosecution was unjust, and appearing repeatedly on television and radio to argue that Gunn's murder was justifiable homicide. </P>
<P> Rev. David Trosch, a Roman Catholic priest from Mobile, Ala., and an ardent believer in Hill's justifiable homicide defense who has called for a violent national campaign against abortion, said he will be among those on hand for the trial. </P>
<P> ``I'm a friend of Paul Hill, and I believe what he did was just. I believe he is not being given a fair trial,'' Trosch said. </P>
<P> Legal experts have said they believe Hill is more likely to be found guilty of murder because he was found guilty of violating the clinic access law, for which he may be sentenced to life in prison, in the trial that ended Oct. 5. </P>
<P> Some have also speculated that his apparent lack of contrition -- Hill has appeared in public since the shooting with a perpetual smile on his face -- might alienate a jury. </P>
