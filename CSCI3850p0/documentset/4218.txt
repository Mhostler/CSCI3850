<P>  Ultra-nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky Wednesday demanded the dismissal of Russia's interior minister and parliamentary speaker over the kidnap and killing of a deputy from his Liberal Democratic Party (LDPR). </P>
<P> Zhirinovsky told the State Duma lower house that Interior Minister Viktor Yerin and the chamber's chairman, Ivan Rybkin, had failed to protect Sergei Skorochkin, a 33-year-old deputy who was abducted and shot in the head last Thursday. </P>
<P> The Duma -- which observed a minute's silence in tribute to Skorochkin -- was expected to debate and vote on his demands later Wednesday. But the government will not be obliged to act, whatever the Duma's decision. </P>
<P> ``It was a purely political murder,'' Zhirinovsky said. ``We demand the resignation of Yerin and Rybkin because they did not defend the deputy corps.'' </P>
<P> Zhirinovsky said the LDPR, which became the largest single faction in the Duma after elections in 1993, would play no role in parliament until the two men were fired. He has announced boycotts before but always returned quickly to the chamber. </P>
<P> The flamboyant nationalist urged the Duma to create a security force to protect deputies. </P>
<P> He also demanded the resignations of Sergei Yushenkov, chairman of the Duma's defense committee, Viktor Ilyukhin, head of the security committee, and Viktor Ustinov, head of the geopolitical committee. </P>
<P> Rybkin said last week that the Duma's leadership had offered protection to Skorochkin, a businessman who shot dead a Georgian last May whom he said had been threatening him. A woman passer-by was also killed in the shooting. </P>
<P> Prosecutors ruled he had acted in self-defense. Skorochkin said he had been attacked by the local mafia for refusing to pay protection money and that he feared for his life. </P>
