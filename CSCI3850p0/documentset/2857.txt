<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Workers staged protest strikes Monday against planned job and pay cuts at Spain's national airline, Iberia, stopping domestic flights and bringing airports across the country to a virtual halt. </P>
<P> The union action came despite talks proposed for Monday by management of the state-owned airline on plans to stave off bankruptcy. Last week the board said it would start laying off 5,200 workers and was preparing to sell assets unless unions accepted a 15 percent pay cut. </P>
<P> Monday's action, which coincided with union meetings to discuss the restructuring plans, also hit other airlines. Iberia Lineas Aereas de Espana SA handles baggage and other functions for 95 percent of all flights passing through Madrid's Barajas airport. </P>
<P> ``All airports in Spain are paralyzed and we have information that not one Iberia employee is working,'' Francisco Codesal of the General Workers Union told airport workers in Madrid. </P>
<P> One local Spanair flight to Barcelona was able to leave Barajas after Civil Guard dispersed strikers who tried to block its path on the runway. </P>
<P> Passengers were able to check in for an Alitalia flight to Rome and a KLM flight to Amsterdam, but 40 minutes before takeoff they were forced to reclaim their baggage which was not loaded on the planes. </P>
<P> All Iberia flights from the other major cities of Barcelona, Valencia and Santiago were cancelled. Only a handful of flights by other airlines were able to leave. </P>
<P> Incoming international flights were able to land, providing they offloaded passengers at the terminal itself without having to use buses. Flights from New York, Buenos Aires, Caracas, Lima, Santo Domingo, Cancun, Miami and Los Angeles all landed. </P>
<P> Sunday, Iberia managing director Juan Antonio Saez said management still hoped to hold talks Monday. </P>
