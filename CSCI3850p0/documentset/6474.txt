<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A key congressional panel Thursday approved $275 million in debt relief for Jordan as a reward for its peace agreement with Israel, putting the aid on track for approval by Congress soon. </P>
<P> Negotiators for the House and Senate appropriations committees approved the $275 million to finance a write-off on Jordan's entire remaining $480 million U.S. debt, the full amount requested by President Clinton. </P>
<P> The White House had promised Jordan debt forgiveness before King Hussein signed a peace treaty with Israel last October, ending a 46-year state of war. </P>
<P> The debt relief will be considered by Congress as part of essential legislation providing emergency funds for government disaster aid and cutting federal spending by nearly $17 billion this year. </P>
<P> To spur congressional action, Hussein personally lobbied Congress for several days in March when the future of the debt relief seemed in doubt due to congressional zeal to cut federal spending. </P>
<P> After last year's White House ceremony in which Hussein and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin made peace, Congress approved a write-off of up to $220 million of Jordan's then- $700 million debt. </P>
<P> Under the plan pending for congressional approval, Jordan would be able to write off $50 million before October and the remainder in 1996 financial year. </P>
<P> The House and Senate appropriations negotiators must still work out differences in other parts of the spending bill before it can be sent to both chambers for final approval. However, barring lengthy debate on the spending cuts, passage is anticipated before the end of the month. </P>
