<P>  An outbreak of Legionnaire's disease aboard a cruise ship over the summer was linked to the vessel's hot tub, federal officials said Thursday. </P>
<P> The disclosure was made during a presentation by Dr Jo Hofmann at an annual epidemiology conference in Orlando, Florida, where microbiologists met to discuss infectious diseases. </P>
<P> One person died and 50 others became ill aboard the Horizon cruise ship in July. The ship, owned by Miami-based Celebrity Cruises, was en route to New York from Bermuda when the outbreak occurred. </P>
<P> ``(Scientists) found out that one of the filters in a whirlpool had been contaminated and as water recirculated through that filter it was probably responsible for the outbreak,'' said Bob Howard, spokesman for the U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. </P>
<P> Investigators discovered the bacteria in one of the whirlpool spas' sand filters. </P>
<P> The CDC expects to meet October 17 with representatives of cruise lines and hot tub makers to discuss prevention. </P>
<P> Legionnaire's disease is an acute pneumonia caused by the bacterium Legionella pneumophilia. Its symptoms include muscle pain, fever, cough, chills, and chest pain. </P>
<P> ``Legionnnaire's is a waterborne disease,'' Howard said, explaining that the germ is let loose in mists or fine sprays which in turn permeate the body and lungs. ``That's when the problem is caused.'' </P>
<P> He described the bacteria as ``ubiquitous,'' and said it takes to damp places such as cooling systems in office buildings and air conditioners. </P>
<P> The disease is treatable with antibiotics. </P>
<P> The Horizon discovery was made in July when a New Jersey doctor reported that three patients had gotten pneumonia after having sailed on the ship. </P>
