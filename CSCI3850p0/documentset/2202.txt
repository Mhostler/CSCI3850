<P>  Former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney -- the son of an Irish electrician -- left office a millionaire, according to a book published Monday entitled ``On the Take.'' </P>
<P> The book, by investigative reporter Stevie Cameron, said Mulroney's lavish, jet-setting lifestyle was financed by friends, his Conservative Party and taxpayers, supplementing his C$164,200 ($121,600 U.S.) a year income as prime minister. </P>
<P> When he left office last year, Montreal businessmen put together a retirement fund of C$4 million ($3 million U.S.) ``to help ease him back into private life,'' it said. </P>
<P> Mulroney's ostentatious lifestyle in the midst of a severe recession turned Canadians against him, and he resigned as Canada's most unpopular leader since public opinion polls started after World War II. </P>
<P> ``That his personal fortune is at issue at all is due to the flamboyant and lavish lifestyle he and his wife, Mila, enjoyed during their years in Ottawa, a lifestyle that could not be supported by a prime ministerial salary nor even the generous perquisites of office,'' the book said. </P>
<P> Mulroney, who refused to be interviewed for Cameron's book, could not be reached for comment Monday. </P>
<P> The book alleges that Mila was regularly given thousands of dollars by a party aide in the prime minister's office, and household staff were asked to deposit the cash at the bank. </P>
<P> ``Over the years, jewelry, clothes, rare wines, cosmetics and other gifts poured in from friends and well-wishers and visiting dignitaries,'' the book said. </P>
<P> Mulroney led the Conservative Party to a landslide victory in 1984 and was in office for nine years, until June 1993. </P>
<P> Friends quoted by Cameron said Mulroney was already well off when he became prime minister, since he had been president of the Iron Ore Co of Canada from 1977 to 1983, while others said he was not a wealthy man. </P>
<P> The Mulroney's bought a house worth C$2.2 million ($1.6 million U.S.) in Montreal's affluent Westmount neighborhood after leaving Ottawa last year. </P>
<P> The book's subtitle is: ``Crime, Corruption and Greed in the Mulroney years.'' </P>
