<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn.(Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  World No. 1 Pete Sampras repeatedly had third seed Todd Martin on the ropes Saturday, but instead suffered a surprising collapse as he fell in the semifinals of the $800,000 Kroger/St. Jude International tennis tournament. </P>
<P> Martin will be able to defend his title here after saving two match points en route to a 4-6, 7-6 (8-6), 6-4 victory over the top seed. </P>
<P> On Sunday for the title, Martin will face the winner of the late semifinal between 11th-seeded Dutchman Paul Haarhuis and unseeded fellow American Jonathan Stark. </P>
<P> Sampras served for the match at 5-4 in the second set but double faulted at 30-30 to give Martin a critical break point. Martin converted, making it 5-5, when Sampras dumped a short forehand into the net. </P>
<P> They both then held serve to force the tie-break, where Sampras again squandered his chances. </P>
<P> The top-ranked Sampras jumped out to a commanding 5-1 lead in the tie-breaker, but could not put Martin away despite two match points. </P>
<P> ``It was like a bad dream,'' said Sampras, who led the tour with a 29-8 tie-break record in 1994 but is a dismal 0-6 in the deciders this year. </P>
<P> ``I can't remember the last time I did this. Today I let him off the hook. I got all tight when it was time to close it out at 5-4,'' admitted Sampras, who was playing his first tournament since losing the Australian Open final to Andre Agassi. </P>
<P> ``He played loose when the pressure was on me. He had nothing to lose. When it was time to close it, I wasn't aggressive enough,'' Sampras continued. </P>
<P> ``I was waiting for him to miss and you can't do that against Todd. This is disappointing because I've never won here. I have to get over it. </P>
<P> ``I think Todd has a good chance to win now.'' </P>
