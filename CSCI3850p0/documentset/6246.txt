<P>  Argentina's air force and navy joined a chorus of confessions of ``dirty war'' kidnapping, torture and killings Wednesday while the former guerrilla leader they battled was criticized for a half-hearted apology. </P>
<P> A week after army chief General Martin Balza's historic mea culpa reversed the army's 20-year self-portrayal as savior of the nation, air force head Brigadier Juan Paulik acknowledged ''grave procedural errors and also horrors.'' </P>
<P> Navy chief Admiral Enrique Molina Pico, due to make a formal declaration later Wednesday, said he would make a ``revision of our history'' concentrating on the military's brutal rule from 1976-83, when 4,000 people were killed by security forces and at least 10,000 disappeared. </P>
<P> While the military's belated repetance earned applause across the continent, the leader of the left-wing Montonero guerrillas, Mario Firmenich, earned widespread scorn for refusing to repent for the 1970 killing of a former military junta president, General Pedro Aramburu. </P>
<P> Firmenich said the violence was a mistake, but insisted it was ``the people who decided'' Aramburu had to die. </P>
<P> President Carlos Menem said the guerrilla leader ``did not repent fully.'' Hebe de Bonafini, head of the white-scarved Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo rights group, was more outspoken. </P>
<P> ``I think he has been an absolutely detestable character all his life. He is of the same breed as Massera,'' she said, comparing him to infamous junta leader Admiral Emilio Massera. </P>
<P> In 1985 Firmenich was jailed for 30 years but was freed with Massera and other junta leaders by Menem's 1990 amnesty. </P>
<P> It is not just Montonero guerrilla supporters who have failed to show full repentance. </P>
<P> Ex-policeman Julio Simon, charged with tens of dirty war crimes but pardoned with other lower ranks under the 1987 Law of Due Obedience, admitted torture, killings and kidnappings. ``But I don't regret a thing,'' he said on television. </P>
<P> A group of old-guard retired generals have also protested Balza's speech, saying the military did nothing for which they should be sorry. </P>
<P> The Catholic Church, accused by rights campaigners of collaborating with the military, has put off its widely-expected public confession until December. </P>
<P> Meanwhile, the former navy captain who triggered the military's change of heart with chilling accounts of throwing drugged detainees into the sea from planes was reported to be under arrest on fraud charges unrelated to his testimony. </P>
