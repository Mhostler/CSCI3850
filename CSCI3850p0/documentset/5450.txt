<DATELINE>PARIS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  If you see a ``no smoking'' sign in France without a French translation, complain to the owner, call the nearest police station, the gendarmes, the local mayor, the state prosecutor or go to court. </P>
<P> If your imported silk dress is ruined because you misread the washing instructions in Korean, sue for damages. </P>
<P> Or call us and we'll help you do it. </P>
<P> This is some of the advice given by a state-subsidized body on how to enforce a controversial law shielding the French language against an invasion of foreign, mainly English, words. </P>
<P> The group, Avenir de la Langue Francaise (Future of the French Language), has printed user guides explaining the complex workings of the 1994 Toubon law, named after its author, Culture and Francophone Affairs Minister Jacques Toubon. </P>
<P> The booklets, to be distributed to the public, recall that all signs in public places must be in French, or carry a French translation in characters as large as the original. </P>
<P> Individual offenders face fines of up to $1,000, companies may be fined $5,000. </P>
<P> Products must be named in French, except if a foreign word has become commonplace in French. Hot-dogs, vodka and pizza are politically correct. Milk-shake is not. </P>
<P> Hamburger is accepted, but not cheeseburger -- forcing MacDonald's to advertise cheeseburgers as ``hamburgers avec une tranche de fromage'' (with a slice of cheese). </P>
<P> Signs on imported products must be in French -- including the words ``play'' or ``timer set'' on a cassette player. French state firms may not give products a foreign name. </P>
<P> Advertising slogans in a foreign language must be translated into French but foreign songs used as background to radio or television advertisments are OK. </P>
<P> The booklet also reviews a host of regulations on the use of the French language in broadcasting, work contracts, company regulations, congresses and meetings. </P>
<P> The law, which earned Toubon the nickname of ``Mr. Allgood,'' the English translation of his name, was the latest attempt to stop a creeping invasion of ``Franglais.'' </P>
<P> Avenir de la Langue Francaise said it ``combined defense of our language with openness toward foreign languages and cultures -- contrary to anglomaniac fundamentalism.'' </P>
<P> It said a Sofres opinion poll showed 93 percent of the French people supported the law, adding: ``Avenir de la Langue Francaise will see to it that it is implemented. Please report any offenses to us now.'' </P>
