<P>  House Speaker Newt Gingrich sent a letter Thursday to President Clinton accusing the administration of violating the law by failing to provide Congress with more information on the Mexico rescue package. </P>
<P> ``Your violation of the ... disclosure requirements means the administration's current expenditures on the Mexican assistance program ... are a direct violation of federal law,'' Gingrich said. </P>
<P> So far the U.S. administration has disbursed to Mexico $8 billion of the $20 billion it promised in February as part of a $50 billion international rescue plan. </P>
<P> Republican sources said Gingrich was not trying to kill the Mexico aid program, but was determined to force the administration to comply with the law.  ``We're not trying to excite the markets or get anybody thinking were trying to kill the Mexico program,'' a Republican source said. </P>
<P> He said Republicans expected the White House to cooperate, but were looking at options, including subpoenaing documents, if necessary. </P>
<P> The White House rejected Gingrich's accusations. Spokeswoman Mary Ellen Glynn said the White House had consulted with the Justice Department to make sure it was in compliance. </P>
<P> On April 10, Clinton signed legislation requiring the administration to provide certification to Congress on a variety of issues involving U.S. aid to Mexico. </P>
<P> Congress had attached the Mexico Debt Disclosure Act to a defense supplemental appropriation bill. </P>
<P> The administration has submitted a number of documents to Congress, but Gingrich said the administration had not met the specific standards in the law. </P>
<P> White House counsel Abner Mikva sent a letter to Gingrich on April 14 outlining the administration's willingness to comply but said certain documents should not be disclosed as to do so would be inconsistent with the public interest. </P>
<P> But Gingrich said the law gives ample protection to classified and other sensitive information. </P>
<P> ``If Congress allows the president to sign a bill into law and then blatantly violate that law, it's hardly worth the paper it's written on,'' Gingrich said in a press release accompanying a copy of his letter to Clinton.  But Mikva said in a statement that, ``Speaker Gingrich's suggestion that the White House is witholding documents improperly is baseless.'' </P>
<P> Mikva said he had both written and called to ``discuss precisely the type of accomodation that Speaker Gingrich is calling for'' but ``neither Mr Gingrich nor any other member of Congress has accepted that invitation.'' </P>
