<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The first question from the Japanese foreign minister when he met Secretary of State Warren Christopher Saturday was not about trade or even North Korean nuclear issues. </P>
<P> Like everybody else at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, Yohei Kono wanted to know about the Democratic Party's crushing defeat in mid-term elections. </P>
<P> Several hours later, one of the first questions at an APEC news conference was about the same thing. </P>
<P> Touring Asia in the wake of the Democratic debacle, Christopher repeatedly has been on the defensive, explaining the results and assuring allies American foreign and trade policies will continue as before. </P>
<P> Despite his efforts, it is more than likely Clinton will have to field similar questions when he arrives Sunday for an APEC summit. </P>
<P> America's Asian and Pacific Rim trade partners allies are understandably anxious about the likely effects of opposition Republican domination of Congress. </P>
<P> ``It's clearly something that's on the minds of a number of people here,'' State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said in something of an understatement. </P>
<P> The thirst for reassurance was such that Christopher amended his formal APEC statement on trade to tell ministers -- once again -- that the United States had a strong tradition of bipartisanship in foreign policy and he was confident that would continue. </P>
<P> He also stressed that under the U.S. constitution, foreign affairs were largely left to the president, meaning Clinton should have a freerer hand to pursue his own course in this area than in domestic policy. </P>
<P> But many experts say that while that may have been so in the Cold War era it is less true now in a world where issues and dangers are more diverse and less directly related to U.S. vital interest. </P>
<P> Posing for photographers with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, Christopher said: ``I don't discount the fact that there may be difficulties but my determination will be to work with the Congress and to produce a policy that reflects well on the continuity and bipartisanship of American foreign policy.'' </P>
