<DATELINE>TRENTON, NJ (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  An outbreak of E. coli poisoning believed to be linked to ground beef has spread beyond sparsely populated northwest New Jersey counties, health authorities said Wednesday. </P>
<P> Dr William Parkin, assistant health commissioner, said 35 cases in 10 counties have been reported in New Jersey and another dozen are being investigated. </P>
<P> Two cases have reached a serious stage involving kidney failure, he added, saying that New Jerseyans were still being exposed ``to something out there.'' </P>
<P> Ann McGuigan of the U.S. Department of Agriculture said the contamination was limited to ground beef. It probably originated in a slaughterhouse, she said, but the department does not know which one. </P>
<P> Supermarkets are not required to keep records on their meat suppliers, she added. </P>
<P> To avoid E. coli contamination, ground beef should be cooked thoroughly ``until the juices run clear,'' McGuigan recommended. </P>
<P> Similar outbreaks are being investigated in Buffalo and Messina, New York, in Vermont and near Hartford, Connecticut, by the Department of Agriculture. ``So far, no deaths have resulted,'' she said. </P>
