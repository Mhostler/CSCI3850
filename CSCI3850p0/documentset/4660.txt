<P> For the last eight years, Colombia has received full certification without the qualifying phrase about U.S. interests, and Wednesday's announcement amounted to a strong reproach to the government of President Ernesto Samper. </P>
<P> Colombia produces three quarters of the world's cocaine, but U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gelbard told a news conference that what concerned Washington was weak legal measures against traffickers who received mere ``slaps on the wrist''. </P>
<P> Other major drug producing or transit countries that were certified only in U.S. national interests were Bolivia, Lebanon, Pakistan, Paraguay and Peru. Certification was denied altogether to Afghanistan, Burma, Iran, Nigeria and Syria -- a move that means cutbacks in any U.S. aid and U.S. opposition to loans from multilateral banks. </P>
<P> In his annual ``presidential determination'' required by Congress, Clinton gave full certification to the Bahamas, Brazil, China, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, Hong Kong, India, Jamaica, Laos, Malaysia, Mexico, Panama, Taiwan, Thailand, Venezuela and Vietnam. </P>
