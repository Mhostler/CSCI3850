<P>  Israel suspended peace talks Tuesday with the PLO in Cairo following the kidnapping of an Israeli soldier by the Hamas Islamic Resistance Movement, Israeli and Palestinian officials said. </P>
<P> An Israeli offical said the head of the Israeli delegation, Maj. Gen. Danny Rothschild, had been recalled to Israel. </P>
<P> ``The head of the Israeli delegation to the Cairo talks was asked to come back to Jerusalem for consultations and actually this is a temporary suspension of the talks in Cairo,'' said Oded Ben-Ami, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's spokesman. </P>
<P> ``The Israeli side has informed the Palestinian Authority that the talks in Cairo have been suspended because of the (kidnapping) incident,'' said Nabil Abu Rdeineh, a spokesman for PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat. </P>
<P> Rabin told Arafat Tuesday that Israel held him responsible for the fate of the soldier kidnapped Sunday by Hamas in central Israel, Ben-Ami said. </P>
<P> Hamas said in a statement Tuesday it would kill the soldier unless Israel released by Friday a number of Muslim militant leaders being held prisoner. </P>
<P> Israel sealed off the Gaza Strip Tuesday night indefinitely, citing both the reported kidnapping and a bloody attack Sunday in Jerusalem in which two Israelis were killed by Hamas gunmen. Israeli troops also fatally shot two Hamas guerrillas. </P>
<P> Israel and Palestine Liberation Organization delegates reported no progress in their Cairo talks earlier Tuesday but said they would meet for a final scheduled round Wednesday. </P>
<P> Under the peace accord signed just over a year ago, elections were due to have taken place by July in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, now under Palestinian self-rule, and parts of the West Bank still under Israeli occupation. </P>
<P> No new date has been set, but Palestinians have said they want elections to be held by the end of the year. </P>
<P> The two sides are also deadlocked over the structure and nature of the Palestinian electoral council and its legislative and executive powers and responsibilities, delegates said. </P>
