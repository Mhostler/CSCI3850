<DATELINE>BRISBANE, Australia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Twelve people, most of them elderly widows, were killed Monday when a bus taking them on a shopping trip plunged down a steep embankment just north of the Australian city of Brisbane. </P>
<P> Police said 20 of 39 people taken to hospitals were in serious condition, most with severe fractures. </P>
<P> The 12th body was found in the wreckage several hours after the crash, about eight miles north of the city. </P>
<P> It was the worst bus accident in four years in Australia, which has a history of bad bus crashes. </P>
<P> The cause was unknown, but police said they were looking into the possibility of a mechanical fault. Witnesses said the bus's front wheels began to wobble just before it plunged into a gully beside a four-lane highway. </P>
<P> The driver survived but was badly injured. </P>
<P> ``We're trying to match limbs with bodies before they are removed,'' a police spokesman said. </P>
<P> Officials said the injured were taken to four Brisbane area hospitals by helicopters and 25 ambulances. </P>
<P> Police set up a temporary morgue near the crash scene. </P>
<P> A spokeswoman for the bus company, Wide Bay Tours, said the group, from Maryborough, 250 miles north of Brisbane, was on a day trip to a shopping complex south of the city. </P>
<P> Fifty-six people had booked the trip, but police said 51 were on the bus when it crashed. Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio said the dead included a two-year-old girl. </P>
<P> Barry Comer and his wife were among the first on the scene after the bus crashed. </P>
<P> ``The people inside were piled up in one big screaming heap,'' Comer told the Australian Associated Press. ``One woman had her arm torn off at the elbow and another man had his head jammed in one of the bus's roof vents.'' </P>
<P> Witnesses said the bus driver apparently lost control on the southbound lane of the highway and the bus bounced across a gully between the two highways before careening across the northbound lanes and plunging down a steep embankment. </P>
<P> In 1989, Australia's worst bus crash killed 35 people and injured 36 near the northern New South Wales town of Kempsey. </P>
