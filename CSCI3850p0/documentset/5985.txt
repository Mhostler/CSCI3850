<P>  Austrian opposition politicians Monday condemned the government for failing to set up a fund for victims of Nazism and said they planned to boycott events this week to mark the 50th anniversary of the Second Republic. </P>
<P> The Green Party said it was a national disgrace that the coalition of Social Democrats and conservative People's Party had yet to decide on a compensation fund for the thousands of people thrown into concentration camps on Austrian territory. </P>
<P> The Social Democrats, the former Socialist Party, and the People's Party have held power in Austria together or separately since 1945. </P>
<P> ``The government said last year that the fund would be ready in the spring, now they are saying, 'sorry, but there's not enough time','' Greens spokesman Stefan Schennach told Reuters. </P>
<P> ``There are about 25,000 people still living and this fund must be set up soon. It's already 50 years too late,'' he said. </P>
<P> Critics were also incensed that the proposed fund would not cover homosexuals or invalids who were wartime prisoners. </P>
<P> Greens European spokesman Johannes Voggenhuber told the Austrian news weekly magazine Profil that it was unlikely the government would fulfil a pledge it made last year to establish the fund by April 27 to coincide with national celebrations to mark the end of World War Two in Austria. </P>
<P> The Second Republic was set up on April 27, 1945, after Allied Powers took control of Austria two weeks before Nazi Germany capitulated. </P>
<P> ``If there is no solution, we are going to boycott the celebrations,'' Voggenhuber said. </P>
<P> Asked if Voggenhuber was speaking for the whole of the Green Party, Schennach said: ``Yes.'' </P>
<P> The Liberal Forum party, also angered by government footdragging, was expected to decide on a boycott in the next two days. There was no immediate comment from government spokesmen. </P>
<P> Far-right leader Joerg Haider said he would back the fund only if it included cash for Austrian soldiers interned or imprisoned by the Allies. </P>
<P> The question of compensation for Austrian Jewish victims has strained relations between Austria and Israel. Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres raised the subject with President Thomas Klestil last November on the first visit by an Austrian president to the Jewish state. </P>
<P> Of the 300,000 Jews in Vienna before Adolf Hitler's annexation of Austria in 1938, only a few hundred managed to survive in the city by the time Soviet troops took control. </P>
<P> Austrian historians have said Vienna was able for years to hide behind a 1943 Allied declaration describing Austria as the first victim of Hitler's Third Reich. </P>
<P> But in 1993, Vranitzky became the first Austrian leader to acknowledge that Austrians had not only been victims of Nazism but also its ``willing servants.'' </P>
