<P>  Three police officers in a remote town in Brazil have been taken hostage by farmers protesting the creation of an Indian reservation nearby, Brazilian television reported Tuesday. </P>
<P> An estimated 10,000 farmers poured into the small town of Montesalves, 500 miles from Sao Luis, the capital of Maranhao state, and are demanding the land earmarked for the Indian group, Globo television said. As well as holding the police officers, the protestors set fire to a bridge on a road to the site demarcated as a reservation, it said. </P>
<P> Globo showed groups of Indians armed with rifles at the site near Montesalves where armed police are protecting surveyors. ''We have to ensure the demarcation takes place,'' an Indian leader said. ``Without land, Indians are nothing.'' </P>
