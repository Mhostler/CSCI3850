<DATELINE>TEHRAN, Iran (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Iran, apparently unruffled by President Clinton's plan to impose a blanket trade embargo, said Monday the American move was ``disgraceful'' and would only hurt U.S. companies. </P>
<P> It said it had many other alternatives for its trade. </P>
<P> Tehran Radio broadcast reminded listeners of a recent statement by President Ali Hashemi Rafsanjani who said: ``economic relations with some U.S. companies have no value for Iran.'' </P>
<P> Iranian television said the U.S. move was ``disgraceful'' and a Foreign Ministry statement said: </P>
<P> ``If purchasing Iranian oil was in the interest of America, then any change in such policy will definitely be against the interest of American oil companies. </P>
<P> ``In our view, today's world of economy is the world of competition and Iran has various alternatives for its trade.'' </P>
<P> Clinton said Sunday he would cut off all U.S. trade and investment with Iran as a sign of Washington's ``unrelenting determination'' to thwart what he said was Tehran's bid to develop nuclear weapons and its support for terrorism. </P>
<P> Clinton said he would sign an executive order later this week. It will come into effect 30 days after he signs it. </P>
<P> Iran has repeatedly denied it was trying to develop nuclear weapons or that it supported terrorism and Tehran Radio said Clinton's move was part of an election campaign to gain the support of ``influential Zionist groups.'' </P>
<P> The embargo would have little effect on Iran which the radio said has been continually under a U.S. embargo since the 1979 Islamic revolution which toppled the shah. </P>
<P> Experts say the ban would have its biggest impact on U.S. oil firms which buy a large part of Iran's crude oil exports. </P>
<P> U.S. firms have been prohibited from buying Iranian oil and selling it in the United States, but to date they have been allowed to purchase and sell the oil elsewhere in the world. Their annual purchases of Iranian oil top $4 billion. </P>
<P> The latest action includes a ban on U.S. exports to Iran which last year totaled $326 million -- mainly industrial equipment and agricultural products. Equipment for oil production also was involved. </P>
<P> Oil experts say the ban will hit Iran's oil sector but the effect would only be short-term as Iran, one of the world's biggest oil producers, turns to non-U.S. firms. </P>
<P> Iran has in the past few years been trying to improve its trade relations with Asia and former Soviet republics. </P>
<P> Oil prices rose on news of the embargo and benchmark Brent futures were up by 30 cents. </P>
<P> U.S. pressure on Iran, which began with the 1979 revolution, has intensified since Clinton took office in 1993 and declared Iran a major ``terrorist state.'' </P>
<P> Relations have since deteriorated further and Iranian officials have repeatedly said they would not stop the struggle against the ``Great Satan,'' a name given to the United States by Iran's late spiritual leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. </P>
