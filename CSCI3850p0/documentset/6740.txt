<DATELINE>TOKYO, May 22 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Threatened U.S. trade sanctions against Japanese luxury car exports are already starting to bite, car makers and trade officials said on Monday. </P>
<P> Mazda Motor Corp stopped exporting two luxury car models to the United States as of May 20 because of the possibility of punitive U.S. tariffs, a company spokesman said. </P>
<P> ``The (sanctions) announcement has already started to have a negative impact on Japanese trade,'' Tomio Tsutumi, vice minister for international trade and industry, told reporters. </P>
<P> Punitive 100 percent tariffs on U.S. imports of 13 Japanese luxury cars will take effect retroactively from last Saturday if the two sides fail to settle their dispute over U.S. access to Japan's car and car parts markets by June 28. </P>
<P> Mazda's two luxury sedan models, the 929 and Millenia, were in a list of tariff targets unveiled by Washington last week. </P>
<P> The company decided to cancel shipments of some 1,000 cars that were scheduled to head for the United States in May. About 200 cars which have already landed there but have not cleared customs will be kept in a bonded area. </P>
<P> Honda Motor Co Ltd, whose Legend luxury car is also on the sanctions list, has stopped U.S. exports of the model for now, although a spokesman attributed the move to excess inventories rather than the sanctions announcement by Washington. </P>
<P> Toyota Motor Corp, Nissan Motor Co Ltd and Mitsubishi Motors Corp said they had no plans at present to halt exports. But a Mitsubishi spokesman said the firm would have to adjust exports in line with U.S. inventories, while a Nissan spokesman said nothing had been decided about June shipments. </P>
<P> A top Japanese business leader on Monday urged Japanese car makers and their U.S. counterparts to meet to try to end the trade dispute. </P>
<P> ``It is not decided yet, but Japan's car industry and America's car industry should meet to discuss the matter at the end of May or as soon as possible,'' Jiro Ushio, chairman of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives (Keizai Doyukai), told Reuters. </P>
<P> Tokyo has asked the United States to hold urgent talks under the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to resolve the dispute, arguing that the U.S. sanctions violate international trade rules. Washington also plans to complain to the WTO about Japanese auto market practices. </P>
<P> Ushio, who assumed his post earlier this month, said overall U.S.-Japan ties remained on a firm footing. ``No one wants to turn this into a trade war,'' he said in an interview. ``In terms of security, diplomacy and the North Korean issue, relations are quite smooth.'' </P>
<P> But he said government intervention in private management matters such as car makers' parts purchase plans was inappropriate. </P>
<P> Washington's demand that Japanese car makers publicly pledge to expand plans to buy U.S.-made car parts has been a major sticking point in the dispute. </P>
<P> Japanese trade negotiators have rejected the demand as beyond the scope of government control and, publicly at least, car makers are equally adamant in refusing to comply. </P>
<P> Some experts, however, said car makers might be more willing to bend than bureaucrats, given the damage to profits from the 100 percent tariffs on their luxury car exports. </P>
<P> ``(Trade minister Ryutaro) Hashimoto has political ambitions and so he has to demonstrate that he is a tough person in the talks,'' said Akitane Kiuchi, a former ambassador to France and one-time trade troubleshooter for the Japanese government. </P>
<P> ``But the car industry people are much more pragmatic.'' </P>
