<P>  Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk warned tourists to avoid his country after the execution of three Western hostages by their rebel captors, saying Cambodia is in a state of war and ``clearly insecure.'' </P>
<P> ``I condemn with the greatest severity the contemptible and unpardonable murderers who are reponsible for the deaths of these three young gentlemen,'' Sihanouk said in a statement dated Tuesday and issued to foreign media Wednesday. </P>
<P> Cambodia's Second Prime Minister, Hun Sen, confirmed the hostages' death Tuesday. </P>
<P> Briton Mark Slater, 28, Frenchman Jean-Michel Braquet, 27, and Australian David Wilson, 29, were taken hostage by the Khmer Rouge in a train ambush in southern Cambodia last July 26. </P>
<P> The three Westerners, three ethnic Vietnamese and an unknown number of Cambodians were marched at gunpoint to a nearby rebel base, at Vine Mountain, about 95 miles south of Phnom Penh. </P>
<P> No word had been received about their fate since the release of a videotape and letter received in Phnom Penh on Sept. 2. </P>
<P> The 72-year-old monarch called on the Cambodian government to ``condemn and severely punish'' those responsible for taking the hostages. </P>
<P> Sihanouk's warning follows a tough new travel advisory from the British embassy in Phnom Penh, ``The situation in Cambodia poses serious security risks. British visitors are advised not to visit the country.'' </P>
<P> A senior Khmer Rouge defector told Reuters Sunday the three Westerners and three Vietnamese had been killed on the orders of General Noun Paet, the rebel commander at Vine Mountain. </P>
<P> Under the leadership of Pol Pot, the Maoist Khmer Rouge rebels killed more than one million people during their rule of Cambodia from April 1975 to January 1979. </P>
