<P>  Candidates loyal to President Fidel Ramos maintained a solid lead on Saturday in the race for 12 seats in the Philippine Senate. </P>
<P> Former first lady Imelda Marcos complained she was being persecuted because of the refusal by election officials to proclaim her the victor in a congressional race where she was leading by a wide margin. </P>
<P> With more than 50 percent of the precincts tabulated by the National Movement for Free Elections in an officially sanctioned quick count, government candidates for the Senate had taken a 9-3 lead over the opposition. </P>
<P> The only opposition candidates who appear to be winning are Miriam Defensor-Santiago, a bitter critic of Ramos, coup leader Gregorio Honasan and Anna Dominique Coseteng. </P>
<P> The official count being conducted by the Commission on Elections (Comelec) was disrupted on Saturday when a brief torrential downpour knocked out power at a building in Manila where the count was being held. </P>
<P> In the official count on Friday from provinces known as strongholds of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, his son Ferdinand Jr was in the running for one of the 12 Senate seats. </P>
<P> Mrs Marcos, who faces dozens of graft and corruption cases filed by the government for alleged abuses during her husband's 20-year rule over the Philippines, urged Comelec to allow her to take her seat in Congress. </P>
<P> Comelec had disqualified her for failing to meet the one-year residence rule required for her to run in her native Leyte Island. Mrs Marcos claims that her secretary committed a mistake when she listed her time of residence as seven months. </P>
<P> ``I think the people have spoken. This should be moot and academic,'' Mrs Marcos told reporters. </P>
<P> More than 70 people have died in violence related to the elections. </P>
