<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Clinton said Monday he had been assured by the Indonesian government there would be no retribution against East Timorese demonstrators who had occupied U.S. Embassy grounds in Jakarta. </P>
<P> ``We have been assured there will be no retribution against them in exercising their political expression,'' he told a news conference at the home of the U.S. ambassador, about two miles from the embassy. </P>
<P> ``I feel comfortable the commitment we have received will be honored.'' </P>
<P> The United States, he added, ``had no problem with these young people coming and expressing their views in our embassy grounds, and we've talked with them and worked with them.'' </P>
<P> The 29 East Timorese invaded the embassy Saturday, demanding Clinton intervene to secure the freedom of their jailed independence struggle hero, guerrilla chieftain Xanana Gusmao. </P>
<P> The protest has distracted leaders arriving for a major economic summit. </P>
<P> Canadian Prime Minister Jean Cretien raised the embassy incident and weekend rioting in the capital of East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, with President Suharto Monday. </P>
<P> In Lisbon, Portuguese President Mario Soares appealed to Clinton to intervene on behalf of East Timorese dissidents. </P>
<P> At the embassy, divisions appeared Monday in the group of exhausted students. </P>
<P> Members of an Indonesian-appointed Human Rights Commission said after talks with them that eight would leave if they could be assured they would not be arrested. </P>
<P> The students, looking tired and bedraggled and saying they were hungry, told reporters Indonesian intelligence had threatened them with death if they left the embassy. </P>
<P> They also said they were no longer firm in their demand to meet Clinton or Secretary of State Warren Christopher but would accept talks instead with President Suharto or his foreign minister, Ali Alatas. </P>
<P> Defiantly, they threatened ``harder steps'' if their demands were not met, but said these might include a request for political asylum. While potentially awkward, that was unlikely to shake Indonesia's tough authorities, who appeared to be largely ignoring the protest. </P>
<P> ``This is just a small problem. We are a big country,'' State Secretary Murdiono, a close aide to Suharto, told reporters Monday. </P>
<P> Support demonstrations expected in the capital Monday on the eve of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit failed to materialise. </P>
<P> ``The students appear not clear about what they want. We are ready to help them but they cannot agree among themselves,'' said the commission's widely respected spokesman, Marzuki Darusman. </P>
<P> He said the commission was unable to get official guarantees of safe conduct. </P>
<P> In the East Timor capital Dili, university authorities said 600 students went on a rampage Monday morning, pelting police with stones in a brief renewal of weekend unrest. </P>
