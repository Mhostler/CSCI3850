<P>  The family of Lord Lucan, a British earl who vanished 20 years ago after the murder of his children's nanny, plans to launch a legal bid to have him officially declared dead, legal sources said Wednesday. </P>
<P> The move, to be initiated by family lawyers in the High Court, would clear the way for his children to inherit his estate and put his tax affairs in order. But ``Lucky Lucan'' could still stand trial for murder if he is ever found. </P>
<P> Lucan is accused of beating to death his children's nanny, Sandra Rivett, and attempting to kill his wife Veronica at their elegant London home on Nov. 7, 1974. </P>
<P> Police say they have kept the file open on one of Britain's most notorious missing persons cases and are still checking any reported sightings of the earl. </P>
<P> They act on up to 60 tips a year. </P>
<P> A police spokesman said: ``There is no evidence that Lord Lucan is dead and he still has an open file. The investigation is still going on.'' </P>
