<DATELINE>HERFORD, Germany (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A deaf mute woman from former Yugoslavia and her 11-year-old brother were killed in an arson attack on a refugee camp in northwest Germany Wednesday, and police later detained two suspects. </P>
<P> The police quickly discounted the possibility that there was a racist motive for the attack on temporary homes set up to house refugees in woodland near the town of Herford, and initially launched a search for the dead woman's former lover. </P>
<P> But investigators later said they had broadened their probe and Hamburg police detained two foreign men aged 40 and 43. </P>
<P> ``We are probing all directions,'' the Federal Prosecutor's office said in a statement. ``Primarily, we are following a lead that indicates it was a personal act of revenge.'' </P>
<P> Prosecutor's Office spokesman Rolf Hannisch said it was believed the act might have been directed at refugees other than the victims. </P>
<P> Hamburg police said the men they had arrested were possibly Turks or Kurds, but that their nationalities were unclear. </P>
<P> It was not clear whether either of the two detained might be the woman's lover, who had been described as an ethnic Albanian from the Yugoslav province of Kosovo. </P>
<P> A Herford police spokesman said the arsonist had apparently used fireworks to set off two 5.5-gallon cans filled with gasoline in the entrance to one of 40 container homes. </P>
<P> The 23-year-old deaf mute woman, Bukureje Haliti, and her brother Navgim Haliti, suffocated as their home burst into flames shortly after 4 a.m.. The boy had apparently died trying to rescue his sister. </P>
<P> At least six others were suffering from smoke inhalation or from cuts sustained when they smashed windows to escape. </P>
<P> At least 30 people have died since unification in 1990 in a surge in rightist violence directed against foreigners. </P>
