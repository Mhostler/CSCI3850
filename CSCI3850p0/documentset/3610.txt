<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Six villages that have in the past brought down three Belgian governments now are undermining the center-left coalition Cabinet of Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene. </P>
<P> Dehaene suffered a serious setback Friday when his proposal for a cooperation deal to defuse a series of conflicts between the French-speaking region of Wallonia in the south and Dutch-speaking Flanders in the North, was torpedoed. </P>
<P> ``There is ... no new element to sign such a cooperation agreement in the short term,'' Luc Van den Brande, prime minister of the Flemish regional government, said in a statement. </P>
<P> The most serious conflict is over Fourons (Voeren in Dutch), a cluster of six, mainly French-speaking, villages in a Dutch-speaking province near the border with the Netherlands, which has brought down three governments since the early 1970s. </P>
<P> One of the governments was sunk in 1987 by Jose Happart, a militant Francophone politician who refuses to speak Dutch, the official language of the region. </P>
<P> For this reason, Happart was stripped of his mayorship of Fourons in 1986 but he has since been repeatedly reinstated as acting mayor. </P>
<P> Belgium's highest constitutional court has ruled that he cannot again become mayor but he contests the ruling and is being supported openly by some Francophone politicians. </P>
<P> Pressure on Dehaene is expected to mount in the next few days as Happart plans to take over as acting mayor again next Wednesday. </P>
