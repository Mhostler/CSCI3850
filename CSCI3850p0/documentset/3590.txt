<P> Senior U.S. defense officials told reporters at a Pentagon briefing that North Korea was so far complying with the agreement to shut down its reactors, store spent graphite fuel rods and allow international inspectors to watch over a process that could take 10 to 14 years to complete. </P>
<P> ``Actual delivery (of heavy bunker oil) to North Korea is scheduled to be made before the January 23 deadline'' by two tankers in the first shipment of a promised 500,000 tons annually, said one official, who asked not to be identified. </P>
<P> ``The initial stage of compliance has been completed,'' the official said of North Korea's steps ending operations at one major nuclear reactor and stopping construction at two others. </P>
<P> The reactors will eventually be replaced by less-threatening light water nuclear power reactors built by an international consortium at a cost of some $4 billion, most of it supplied by South Korea and Japan. </P>
