<P>  Britain told Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams Monday that the IRA would have to make progress in laying down their arms if Sinn Fein wanted a ban on talks with London government ministers to be lifted. </P>
<P> ``Before ministers will engage in the exploratory dialog ...there has to be assurance of serious and constructive discussion from Sinn Fein about...the issue of decommissioning arms,'' Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew said. </P>
<P> The assurances must be ``intended to lead to concrete steps about decommissioning of arms,'' Mayhew told Belfast journalists just hours after Adams, whose party seeks to end British rule of Northern Ireland, returned from a U.S. visit that seriously strained British-American relations. </P>
<P> He said his party did not represent the IRA, which shares Sinn Fein's goals, but the party had done its best by securing the cease-fire in an attempt to end a conflict that has cost about 3,200 lives. </P>
<P> ``Sinn Fein does not have the weapons. Sinn Fein is not an army,'' Adams said. </P>
<P> He said the British army had tried and failed to defeat the IRA and capture its arms and Sinn Fein could not be expected to get the guerrillas to hand over their weapons until all arms were removed from Northern Ireland. </P>
<P> ``I am not superman,'' said Adams. ``We have silenced the guns. But there are five groups who hold weapons in Northern Ireland,'' among them the army, police and loyalist groups fighting to maintain British rule of the province. </P>
<P> Adams said he wanted the arms issue to be discussed at ministerial level along with all other issues including ``repressive legislation and prisoners.'' </P>
<P> Britain was dismayed at Adams' U.S. visit which was made possible by President Clinton, who granted him a visa, invited him to a White House St. Patrick's Day party and lifted a ban on his raising funds in the United States. </P>
