<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Rolling Stones played their first concerts in Africa this weekend, performing before virtually all-white audiences about love and revolution. </P>
<P> A total of about 100,000 people attended the two concerts at Johannesburg's Ellis Park Stadium, part of the British group's ``Voodoo Lounge'' world tour that continues in Tokyo. </P>
<P> Very few of South Africa's majority black population came to watch the band. ``They're too white,'' said one black journalist who turned down a free ticket. </P>
<P> Group leader Mick Jagger thanked the crowd in Zulu for their rousing response to songs like ``Streetfighting Man'' in which he declares ``the time is ripe for violence, revolution.'' </P>
<P> Revolution was one of the greatest fears of South Africa's whites during the apartheid years when the country was starved of international rock acts by a cultural embargo. </P>
<P> But the audience put their fears out of their minds even when Jagger sang ``Midnight Rambler,'' a song about the kind of late-night prowler that haunts the dreams of many in the crime-ridden country. </P>
<P> Jagger steered clear of controversy during a week-long visit, although a group called Young South Africans for a Christian Civilisation accused the Rolling Stones of promoting communism and immorality. </P>
<P> ``Shocking behavior and rebellion have been a Rolling Stones trademark since the 60s,'' the group said in a statement. ``Many of their songs clearly glorify amorality, violence and lewdness -- including the worst sexual aberrations.'' </P>
<P> Earlier this month South Africa's controversial deputy minister of arts and culture, Winnie Mandela, called the Rolling Stones racists for using a white promoter for the South African leg of their show. </P>
<P> Asked at a news conference if he considered himself a racist and if he had tried the local marijuana, Jagger replied: ``No to both questions.'' </P>
<P> He said he was involved in plans for a film about Sophiatown, a district of Johannesburg where blacks were forced out during the apartheid years to make way for a new white suburb called Triumph. </P>
