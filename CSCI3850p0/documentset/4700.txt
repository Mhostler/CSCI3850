<P>  A Chinese court has sentenced a man to three years in prison for helping his cancer-stricken wife to die, the Hubei Legal Daily said in an edition seen in Beijing Friday. </P>
<P> The Ningling County People's Court in central Hunan province convicted Liu Shabo, 54, of murdering his wife, Wu Xiuyun, last September by giving her tea containing pesticide, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> The couple had been happily married for 30 years and Liu could not bear to see his wife, who had liver cancer, in pain, it said. </P>
<P> Wu left her children a note saying she did not want to be a burden on them and had asked their father to help her end her sufferings, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> She pleaded with them not to blame their father, but the court said helping someone to commit suicide was tantamount to murder, the newspaper added. </P>
<P> Last month, a group of members of the Shanghai Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, an advisory body to the city government, suggested that euthanasia be allowed after a survey showed 90 percent of 313 people interviewed approved of mercy killing, the Beijing Evening News said. </P>
<P> The advisory body laid down several conditions under which euthanasia could be exercised, including a consensus by three doctors that a patient could not be cured. </P>
<P> The patient would have to agree to the mercy killing, with the approval of family members and the city government, the newspaper said, adding that there should be no inheritance or other legal disputes involved. </P>
