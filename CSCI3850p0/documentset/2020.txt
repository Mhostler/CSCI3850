<DATELINE>ROME (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  More than three million people took to the streets Friday during a four-hour general strike over Italy's belt-tightening budget for 1995 that turned into a mass protest against Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, unions said. </P>
<P> The turnout for demonstrations in all the country's major cities added up to one of the largest street protests since widespread industrial unrest in the 1970s. </P>
<P> As media magnate Berlusconi toasted Russian President Boris Yeltsin with champagne in Moscow, where he was on an official visit, the strike at home shut down the public sector. </P>
<P> ``The turnout was way beyond our wildest expectations,'' said a spokesman for the CGIL union. The Interior Ministry said it did collate national figures. </P>
<P> Rail and air transportation were seriously disrupted by the stoppage, which shut government offices, banks, schools, border posts and most hospital services and hit work in factories. </P>
<P> The demonstrations and strike, ostensibly against the deficit-cutting budget and planned cuts in pensions spending, rapidly turned into a protest against billionaire Berlusconi. </P>
<P> In Rome, the streets of the capital echoed to the chants of ``Berlusconi out!'' as demonstrators marched to the sound of whistles, banging drums and car horns. </P>
<P> Renaissance buildings and cathedrals in Florence served as a backdrop for 250,000 demonstrators furious at a budget they say hits the poorest hardest but lets tax dodgers off the hook. </P>
<P> Protesters on the island of Sardinia's exclusive Costa Smeralda holiday district massed outside one of Berlusconi's villas chanting slogans against the free-market prime minister. </P>
<P> ``Berlusconi's villa: 42 rooms, sea view, but it is our pensions that are sliced in half,'' read one placard. </P>
<P> Workers from Berlusconi's $7 billion a year Fininvest media empire joined the Milan protest and were cheered by the crowds. </P>
<P> A protester in Rome carried a mock coffin bearing the names of Berlusconi and neo-fascist Gianfranco Fini, leader of the National Alliance movement that is part of the coalition. </P>
<P> ``Italians have expressed a gigantic vote of no confidence in the budget and we shall continue to fight it,'' Pietro Larizza, leader of the UIL union, told marchers in Milan. </P>
<P> In Moscow, Berlusconi brushed off the protest saying he had not even asked aides what was happening in Italy. He said the protests would not change the budget. </P>
<P> ``I didn't make up the figures, I just found them when I arrived (in office),'' he told reporters. </P>
<P> Berlusconi, who entered politics this year promising an economic boom and an end to decades of chronic state overspending, has staked his credibility on a budget that aims to slash $33 billion from the 1995 deficit. </P>
<P> More than half the savings are due to come from cuts in pensions, health care, defense spending and other areas. </P>
<P> Protesters carried banners reminding Berlusconi that his $7 billion a year business empire was under the scrutiny of graft investigators and of his friendship with the prime casualty of Italy's graft scandals -- former prime minister Bettino Craxi. </P>
<P> Other placards said ``Forza Giudici'' (Go Judges) -- a play on Berlusconi's Forza Italia party. </P>
<P> The government, which is looking to save $5.1 billion next year through a freeze in early retirement pensions and a cut in benefits, says it has been forced to make the savings because money has run out. </P>
