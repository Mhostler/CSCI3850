<P>  Actor Martin Sheen said Saturday he tried to keep peace during a violent confrontation between 120 angry sealers and prominent conservationist Paul Watson in a remote archipelago in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. </P>
<P> ``It sounded like madness,'' Sheen said. ``It was all we could do just to maintain calm, and prayer was an integral part of that.'' </P>
<P> The American actor, interviewed by Reuters from Los Angeles, said the attack against Watson was terrifying. The actor and other members of Watson's 13-member group were in adjoining rooms when a group of about 50 sealers broke through the conservationist's hotel room door. </P>
<P> The altercation was violent and loud, Sheen said, and the sealers appeared determined to carry out threats made against Watson, president of the California-based Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. </P>
<P> ``It was a riot -- a mob of angry sealers bent on violence and destruction and venting their anger on one man, Paul Watson,'' Sheen said. </P>
<P> Watson was escorted through the melee to a waiting police cruiser. As the car moved away to rush Watson to the local airport, the sealers smashed a police cruiser window with a brick, slightly injuring Watson, he said. </P>
<P> Gil Theriault, coordinator of the Magdalen Island Sealers Association, said the sealers were not angry with Sheen but with Watson. He said Watson's role in generating international outrage over Canada's east coast seal hunt during the 1980s made his presence in the islands provocative to the sealers. </P>
<P> Watson, a founding member of the Greenpeace Foundation, headed several campaigns against the Canadian seal hunt, including one in the Magdalen Islands in 1983 in which he is alleged to have rammed two sealing boats. </P>
<P> Theriault said the sealers, who are able to earn income from fishing and hunting for only two or three months of the year, are not afraid of another international backlash against the proposed resumption of the seal hunt. </P>
<P> ``We are a lot more scared of continuing with 70 percent unemployment here during the winter,'' Theriault said. </P>
<P> Sheen, who has been an environmental activist for the last 10 years, had been in the area with Watson's group since Tuesday to promote a plan to transform the seal harvest into a fur fiber harvest that would not involve killing the seals. </P>
<P> Using a special glove, fur fibers could be gathered from molting baby seals for use as insulation in garments. </P>
<P> Earlier in the day, as sealers gathered outside the hotel, Sheen had asked them to go to a nearby Roman Catholic church to calmly discuss matters with Watson. </P>
<P> ``I had approached the mob down in the lobby before things got out of hand with an invitation to talk in the church on sanctuary ground,'' Sheen said. ``They just ignored me, laughed at me, and cursed me.'' </P>
<P> Later, at the height of the disturbance, Sheen asked the hotel manager to call the church's priest to intervene but did not receive a response. </P>
<P> Although Watson borded a charter flight for Moncton in New Brunswick Thursday evening, Sheen and the rest of the group remained behind. Sheen spent the night in his hotel room on the recommendation of the provincial police force, which flew a 10-person tactical unit to the islands to restore order. </P>
<P> He left the Magdalen Islands Friday morning on a commercial flight to Montreal. </P>
<P> Despite the confrontation, Sheen said he would like to return to the Magdalen Islands to explain the plan to the local sealers. ``There are a lot of good and decent people up there and I would look forward to going back,'' Sheen said. </P>
