<DATELINE>BOSTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Michael Jordan got 27 points as the Chicago Bulls earned their first win since his return to the NBA, beating the Boston Celtics 124-107 Wednesday and spoiling ceremonies honoring the late Reggie Lewis. </P>
<P> Jordan finished the game 9-of-17 from the field, made all eight of his free throws and grabbed three rebounds. </P>
<P> ``It was all right,'' said Jordan, when asked about his second NBA game since quitting baseball. ``I was a little bit more relaxed today.'' </P>
<P> He added: ``Coming into the Indiana game, I was kind of new, I had forgotten my game. I had to renew those thoughts a little bit.'' </P>
<P> Pippen added 18 points for Chicago, which has won all three meetings between the teams this season. </P>
<P> Sherman Douglas scored 23 points and Dominique Wilkins added 20 for Boston, a half-game behind New Jersey, Miami and Milwaukee for the last playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. </P>
<P> The 34-minute halftime ceremony to honor Lewis and retire his number 35, despite a swirl of allegations he used cocaine, featured statements by his widow Donna Harris-Lewis and Celtic president Red Auerbach. </P>
<P> Lewis, who collapsed and died while shooting baskets in July 1993, became the 19th player in Boston history to have his number retired, the first since Larry Bird's number 33 was raised to the rafters in 1993. </P>
<P> In Cleveland, Mark Price scored 23 points, including seven during a key third-quarter run, as the Cavaliers beat the Sacramento Kings 101-89. </P>
<P> Price, who finished 8-of-10 from the field, had eight assists in 26 minutes off the bench. </P>
<P> The win snapped a three-game losing streak for the Cavaliers, who are trying to hold off Chicago for the fifth playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. </P>
<P> In Atlanta, Kevin Willis scored 24 points and grabbed 18 rebounds as the Miami Heat defeated the Hawks 98-84 for their first regular-season victory at The Omni. </P>
<P> Miami, which won a playoff game at Atlanta last April, entered the game 0-12 in regular-season visists. </P>
<P> The Heat moved into a tie with New Jersey and Milwaukee for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. </P>
<P> At New Jersey, David Robinson scored 22 points as the San Antonio Spurs beat the Nets 102-85 for their fifth straight victory. </P>
<P> Vinny Del Negro added 19 points for San Antonio. </P>
<P> Armon Gilliam had 21 points and 14 rebounds for New Jersey, which has lost four straight. </P>
<P> At Indiana, Reggie Miller scored 13 of his 36 points in the fourth quarter and the Pacers held on for a 107-103 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers. </P>
<P> Rik Smits had 19 points and 11 rebounds for the Pacers, who have won seven of their last nine games and moved into a tie with Charlotte for first place in the Central Division. </P>
<P> Pooh Richardson scored 24 points and Loy Vaught added 22 and 10 rebounds for the Clippers, who have lost 14 straight road games. </P>
<P> At Utah, Karl Malone scored 23 points and the Jazz used a late burst for a 103-91 win over the Denver Nuggets that moved them into a tie for best record in the Western Conference. </P>
<P> Jeff Hornacek scored 18 points and John Stockton added 16 for the Jazz, who nearly blew a 17-point third-quarter lead. Utah and Pacific Division leader Phoenix are both 49-18, one-half game behind Orlando (49-17) for best in the NBA. </P>
<P> Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf scored 22 points for the Nuggets, who got within two points in the final 3 3/8 minutes but saw the Jazz score the final 10 points of the game. </P>
<P> At Los Angeles, Elden Campbell scored a career-high 32 points to lead the Lakers to a 121-114 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers. </P>
<P> Vlade Divac scored 21 points with 10 rebounds and Nick Van Exel added 18 points and 10 assists for the Lakers, who have won two in a row over the Blazers after losing eight straight. </P>
<P> Clifford Robinson scored 27 points and Otis Thorpe added a season-high 27 points and 14 rebounds for Portland, which lost for just the third time in its last 11 games. </P>
<P> In Philadelphia, Jeff Malone returned after a 41-game absence and scored 28 points as the 76ers ended an eight-game losing streak with a 119-102 rout of the Golden State Warriors. </P>
<P> Malone had not played since Dec. 22 because of a bruised right heel. </P>
<P> At Minnesota, Roy Tarpley scored nine of his 20 points in the fourth quarter and the Dallas Mavericks held on for their fifth victory in six games, 99-96 over the Timberwolves. </P>
<P> Jamal Mashburn scored 25 points for Dallas while Christian Laettner netted 26 for the Timberwolves. </P>
