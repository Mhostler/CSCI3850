<P>  Beijing authorities said Saturday they had executed 10 people convicted of murdering a policeman and other violent crimes after their appeals were rejected. </P>
<P> The official Beijing Daily said the condemned were put to death Friday in the Chinese capital in the usual manner -- a bullet fired into the back of the head. </P>
<P> The 10 included defendants who had been sentenced to prison terms but who had ``utterly failed at rehabilitation and wantonly carried out (new) criminal activities,'' it said. </P>
<P> ``This seriously threatened social harmony in the capital as well as the life, property and safety of the masses.'' </P>
<P> The newspaper singled out two suspects -- Liu Baosong and Yu Shuijun -- as particularly incorrigible, saying they had shot dead a police officer and a taxi driver during a highway robbery. </P>
<P> The other condemned people were identified as Wu Tao, Zhang Jianguo, Tang Weiwei, Lu Xuejun, Zhang Yuqi, Liu Qiang, Cui Laibin and Huang Futian. </P>
<P> The Beijing People's Supreme Court rejected appeals of their People's Intermediate Court convictions and ordered the executions be carried out, the report said. </P>
