<P>  A forest fire fanned by dry winds more than tripled in size Wednesday to engulf 18,000 acres of woodland in northeast California. </P>
<P> Erratic winds and the rough terrain thwarted firefighters' efforts to contain the blaze spreading through the Lassen National Forest, said a U.S. Forest Service official. </P>
<P> ``Last night, we had about 30 percent containment, today we have about 10 percent,'' she said. </P>
<P> The fire is still far from populated areas but is headed in the general direction of Sacramento. </P>
<P> The Forest Service warned hunters to stay out of Lassen National Forest and moved fire engines into the towns of Cohasset and Campbellville ``in case they need to evacuate,'' the official said. But the agency has not yet ordered an evacuation. </P>
<P> The fire started Sunday evening when lightning struck trees near Barkley Mountain. It grew to 5,500 acres by Tuesday night and then more than tripled in size Wednesday. </P>
