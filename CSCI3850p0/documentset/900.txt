<P>  The Cuban news agency Prensa Latina called Clinton's announcement Friday that Cubans picked up at sea will be taken to Guantanamo Bay naval base a ``new and dangerous element'' in U.S. immigration policy. </P>
<P> The Cuban government has not yet publicly reacted to Clinton's announcement that Cuban rafters will be turned away from the United States and taken to the U.S. base on the southeast tip of Cuba. </P>
<P> But Prensa Latina's remarks were an indicator of official thinking. </P>
<P> ``The main problem ... is the eventual threat to peace and security in the whole region that is entailed by the forced encampment of Cuban emigrants in the Guantanamo base,'' Prensa Latina said. </P>
<P> The news agency noted that the United States was already holding some 15,000 Haitian refugees at the base, in an unstable situtation which had been illustrated by riots at the camp in recent days. </P>
<P> The arrival of Cuban emigrants could be an ``extraordinary aggravation'' to the situation, Prensa Latina said. </P>
<P> It noted that Cuba had already denounced the use of the base as a camp for Haitian refugees. </P>
<P> The agency added that it was paradoxical that Washington should now start treating harshly the same people whom it had for many years encouraged to come to the United States. </P>
<P> Clinton's move, aimed at stemming a recent flood of Cuban rafters, was a switch in a 30-year policy of giving Cubans who arrive in the United States without papers automatic political asylum. </P>
<P> Cuba considers the land at the naval base, leased to the United States at the turn of the century, to be illegally occupied. </P>
