<P>  Pakistani police said on Monday they arrested five militants suspected of having killed at least 68 people in violence-hit Karachi. </P>
<P> ``We have arrested five memberOVRs of a gang of hit men responsible for the murder of at least 68 people killed during the last year,'' a police spokesman said. </P>
<P> Police recovered stolen vehicles and weapons including two assault rifles, a Sten gun and a pistol. The spokesman did not say when the men were arrested. </P>
<P> At least 800 people were killed in Karachi in ethnic and sectarian violence in 1994 and more than 360 have died this year. </P>
<P> The spokesman accused the five men of killing 20 Shi'ite Moslems in pre-dawn attacks on two mosques on February 25, and murdering seven men in a house last month. </P>
<P> ``The killings were politically motivated and the hit men are affiliated with political organisations,'' the spokesman said without revealing their groups. </P>
<P> Local newspapers quoted police as saying three of the arrested men were from the ethnic Mohajir National Movement (Haqiqi), or MQM (H), a splinter faction of MQM which includes many Urdu-speaking Indians who migrated to Karachi after independence from Britain in 1947. </P>
<P> The two others were Sunni Moslem militants from Sipah-i-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP), which draws members from Pakistan's main religious sect. </P>
<P> Police said they were hunting for other members of the two groups, which they said were working together. </P>
<P> Police in Karachi launched a massive security sweep after two U.S. consulate officials were gunned down on March 8. </P>
