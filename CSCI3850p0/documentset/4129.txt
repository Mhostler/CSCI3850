<P>  House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Friday the U.S. armed forces mission in Haiti was ``going much better than one might have hoped.'' </P>
<P> Gingrich made the remark to reporters at the start of a meeting with Haitian Prime Minister Smarck Michel, who is on a two-day visit to Washington. </P>
<P> Michel said Thursday that conditions in Haiti continued to improve, although many opponents of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide were still armed and the security situation remained ''fragile.'' </P>
<P> Gingrich said the U.S. operation ``has worked much better than many of us thought it would, at least up to now ... we hope it will all work out.'' </P>
<P> President Clinton acted unilaterally in Haiti last year to restore Aristide to power, but the peacekeeping operation is due to be handed over to the United Nations. </P>
<P> Gingrich reiterated his opposition to U.S. troops being put under United Nations command, noting that pending legislation in the House would ``cut off the American role of subservience to the United Nations.'' </P>
<P> He said that having U.S. forces serve under U.N. command was dangerous because of the difference in the quality of the command structure and the level of training. </P>
