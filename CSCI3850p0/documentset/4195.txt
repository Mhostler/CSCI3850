<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A defensive House Speaker Newt Gingrich vigorously denied Tuesday any ethical problem in his wife working for a company promoting a free trade zone in Israel. </P>
<P> But the Republican leader conceded during a news conference that there could be perceptions of an appearance of some ethical conflict. </P>
<P> He was asked about news reports that his wife, Marianne, was working for a company called Israel Export Development Co., an American firm that had been trying for several years to get Israel to set up a free trade zone. </P>
<P> Israel's cabinet in December approved setting up the zone and the American firm is trying to line up businesses to settle in the zone to get tax benefits there. </P>
<P> Mrs. Gingrich was hired last September, two months before Republicans swept congressional elections in November and gained control of Congress setting the way for her husband to become speaker, the third highest elected post in the nation. </P>
<P> ``I am confident that somebody will find an appearance problem in everything that my wife or I do the rest of our lives,'' Gingrich said. ``So if it's an appearance question, the answer is of course. There's an appearance problem literally with everything I do.'' </P>
<P> According to one account, she received the job, which pays $2,500 a month and commissions, after Gingrich spoke highly of the proposal, including communications with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin during a trip to Israel in 1993. </P>
<P> But Gingrich said he has long been a free trade zone activist and has never promoted the company his wife works for. </P>
<P> ``The fact is she works for a private company,'' he said. ''She does no lobbying of the U.S. government ... of any kind.'' </P>
<P> He called his wife ``a professional planner by background'' who was interested in creating jobs in the United States and in Israel.'' </P>
<P> ``And it seems to me that since no taxpayer funds are involved and it's an entirely private business, that she ought to be let alone,'' he added. </P>
<P> Gingrich himself has been under constant criticism from Democrats on several fronts, including a political action committee he is associated with and a controversial book deal in which he was first offered -- but later turned down after a political storm -- a $4.5 million advance. </P>
<P> On the House floor Tuesday, Democrats in a series of speeches demanded the House Ethics committee appoint an outside investigative counsel to examine the Georgia Republicans' activities. </P>
<P> They also criticized a dinner he is attending Tuesday night at $50,000 a plate for about a dozen wealthy people with the proceeds going to a conservative cable television channel, National Empowerment Television. </P>
<P> Gingrich defended the dinner during his press conference and said he has been investigated in the past on ethical matters and cleared but expects to be criticized constantly by ``liberal Democrats, the tax and spend Democrats.'' </P>
<P> ``There's sort of this let's beat up on Gingrich because we can't defeat the issues,'' he said. He also added ``my record of being investigated, scrutinized, smeared and attacked sort of rivals anybody in recent public life.'' </P>
