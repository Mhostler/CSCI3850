<P>  Triple Olympic champion Vreni Schneider clinched her sixth world slalom title Sunday despite finishing second to Sweden's Pernilla Wiberg in the penultimate World Cup slalom of the season. </P>
<P> Wiberg won her first World Cup slalom this season in an aggregate time of one minute, 17.31 seconds, but a spirited run in the second leg lifted Schneider from fifth to second place in an overall time of 1:17.68. </P>
<P> That was enough to lift the Swiss skier's slalom tally to 460 points, well beyond the reach of Germany's Martina Ertl who has 278 with one race left next week. </P>
<P> Schneider, second in the combined event after her 16th place in the downhill Saturday, has also now taken over the lead in the overall standings from German Katja Seizinger. She has 1,090 points compared with Seizinger's 1,055. </P>
<P> Schneider said: ``I wanted to prove I could do well on home snow. It has been an exciting weekend. I am glad that I have taken over the lead. I was nervous in the first leg but decided to go all out in the second and did much better. </P>
<P> ``The overall trophy has still not been decided. There are still four more races left and I still hope to take it.'' </P>
