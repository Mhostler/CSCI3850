<P>  Researchers said Tuesday they have identified a possible telltale gene in tissue abnormalities that may be a harbinger of prostate cancer. </P>
<P> Prostate cancer, a malignant growth on the prostate gland, is the second most common cancer in men. It usually afflicts the elderly. </P>
<P> Researchers found the expression of genes in a nonmalignant prostate condition known as prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) are similiar to the expression of these genes in invasive cancers. </P>
<P> ``There are certain changes that occur in the prostate gland before prostate cancer develops and we think one of changes that occurs is PIN,'' said Dr William Grizzle, a professor of pathology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who headed the study. </P>
<P> ``Our study looked at this particular pattern and found that the genetic markers expressed in this pattern were similiar to those expressed in invasive cancer and this suggests that this pattern is perhaps a forerunner of prostate cancer,'' he said. </P>
<P> Grizzle said it was a preliminary study that was being expanded. </P>
<P> ``It's a small step foward,'' he said, adding it was important people know ``there are some advances being made in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.'' </P>
<P> The findings will be published in the August 3 Journal of the National Cancer Institute. </P>
