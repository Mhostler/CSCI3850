<P>  Smokers who have routine chest x-rays are two to three times more likely to survive lung cancer than those who do not, researchers said Tuesday. </P>
<P> The American Cancer Society, the National Cancer Institute and the American Academy of Radiology currently recommend against routine x-ray screening for lung cancer but that position may need to be reviewed, the report from Harvard Medical School said. </P>
<P> ``The earlier the diagnosis, the more likely the disease can be effectively treated before it has spread to other parts of the body,'' said Gary Strauss, a researcher at Harvard's Brigham and Women's Hospital. </P>
<P> His report, released at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America, was based on a new analysis of four major earlier studies involving 38,000 men over the age of 45 who had smoked for 20 years or more. </P>
<P> ``Data show that smokers who have routine chest x-rays are two to three times more likely to survive the disease than those who do not,'' he said. </P>
<P> Strauss said the American Cancer Society and others do not recommend routine chest x-rays because studies have not demonstrated they lead to a reduction in mortality -- the total number of cancer deaths among the total number of people examined. </P>
<P> ``A more meaningful measurement may be the fatality rate, which relates the number of cancer deaths to the number of individuals with cancer,'' he said. When some of the earlier studies are analyzed on the basis of fatality rates, he said, ''a statistically significant advantage for screening was seen.'' </P>
<P> Since 1980, when the American Cancer Society stopped recommending annual chest x-rays and instead placed its emphasis on getting people to stop smoking, Strauss said, the number of smokers has dropped significantly in the United States. </P>
<P> ``At the same time the total number of lung cancer deaths has risen dramatically -- from 101,000 in 1980 to 153,000 in 1993,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``Survival rates would lead to the conclusion that there is a striking benefit associated with screening,'' he added. </P>
