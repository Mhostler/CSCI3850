<P> A police spokesman said Tuesday the value of the new device will be known only at the end of trials in London by 80 officers, already nicknamed ``Strobocops'' after the robot movie hero ``Robocop.'' </P>
<P> The light's inventor was quoted by the police magazine The Job as saying that although colleagues initially heckled the ``Strobocops'' and imitated the noise of police sirens, their attitudes soon changed to enthusiasm. </P>
