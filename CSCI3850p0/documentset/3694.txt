<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt said Tuesday he was crafting a proposal for a flatter income tax code that could result in four out of five Americans paying a 10-to-11 percent tax rate. </P>
<P> In testimony to the House Ways and Means Committee, the Missouri Democrat said Americans were sick and tired of the complicated tax system and wanted broad changes. ``People are driven crazy by this tax code. It's a disaster. It just doesn't work anymore,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``A number of Democrats are working on an alternative so-called flatter tax proposal. I don't think we can micromanage the economy through the tax code,'' he added. </P>
<P> Gephardt, who tried to craft a compromise bill in 1994 to provide universal health insurance, also said he would support a scaled-down health care plan, perhaps starting out with insurance market reforms and other relatively minor changes. </P>
<P> A spokeswoman for Gephardt, a chief architect of the 1986 tax reform act, said his proposal to even out income tax brackets would collect the same amount of revenue as the current income tax system, would not change the relative tax burden for different income classes and would tax both earned and unearned income. </P>
<P> His comments seemed to signal that Democrats are willing to compromise with leading House Republicans such as Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer and Majority Leader Dick Armey, both of Texas, who have advocated alternatives to the current income tax system. </P>
<P> ``I want to thank the minority leader for embracing that we need to replace the income tax code with perhaps a fairer system,'' said Archer, who has advocated replacing the current income tax system with a consumption tax. </P>
<P> Armey, who supports a 17 percent flat tax with high personal exemptions, thanked Gephardt for his comments. </P>
<P> ``The flat tax is clearly in America's future and if the minority leader's statement is not just political posturing, Congress can respond in a bipartisan manner to the public demand for a simpler, flatter, more fair tax code,'' he said. </P>
<P> Labor Secretary Robert Reich reacted cautiously to the proposal. ``I would have to know more about the program,'' he said on a trip to Illinois with President Clinton. ``We would just have to look at it very carefully.'' </P>
<P> Despite the outstanding proposals, a debate on scrapping the current tax code does not appear imminent. </P>
<P> House Republicans instead have promised a series of votes on tax cuts proposed in their Contract with America, including a reduction in the capital gains tax rate and a $500 tax credit for families with up to $250,000 in income. </P>
<P> In later testimony to the committee, Assistant Treasury Secretary Leslie Samuels increased the government's estimate of the cost of the various tax breaks in the Republican Contract to $725 billion over 10 years, up from a previous estimate of $712 billion. Samuels said the richest Americans would get half of the tax benefits in the contract. </P>
<P> Seeking to focus on the politically vital middle class, Gephardt has proposed a tax credit for individuals or families with annual incomes of up to $75,000. Clinton has come out with his own proposals, including credits for college tuition. </P>
<P> Currently, the top federal income tax rate is 36 percent. For people who have $250,000 in taxable income, a 10 percent surtax is applied, giving them an effective 39.6 percent rate on taxable income above the $250,000 amount. </P>
