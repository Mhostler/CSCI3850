<P>  The Netherlands Saturday honored a former nurse at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp who saved the lives of 46 Jewish children. </P>
<P> Polish-born Luba Fredrick, 78, who now lives in Miami, Fla., was awarded the silver medal for humanitarian aid. </P>
<P> Fredrick saved the children, whose fathers worked in Amsterdam's diamond industry, by concealing them in the nurses' quarters at the camp and feeding them secretly by night. </P>
<P> Almost all of those she saved were present during an emotional gathering in Amsterdam's city council chamber at which she received the medal from Amsterdam's deputy mayor. </P>
<P> She said she had been moved by the children's plight because she had lost a child of her own: ``God saved me because their mothers were taken away and my child was taken away.'' </P>
<P> Fredrick, nicknamed the Angel of Bergen Belsen by those she saved, was traced to the United States a few years ago by one of the children, Gerard Lamaker. </P>
