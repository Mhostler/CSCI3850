<P>  Even Italians who religiously carry their cellular phones while dining in restaurants or jogging in forests might draw the line against priests using them in the confessional box. </P>
<P> An Italian Catholic magazine has told priests who own such phones to keep them out of the confessional box or at least turn them off while administering the sacrament to the faithful. </P>
<P> ``Has good sense escaped even men of God,'' the monthly magazine Vita Pastorale (Pastoral Life) said in an editorial in its February edition. </P>
<P> ``Can't one distinguish between when to receive telephone calls and when not to? Have we become so addicted?'' it asked. </P>
<P> The editorial in the magazine, which specializes in parish affairs, followed a complaint by a woman in northern Italy who said she was shocked when the cellular phone of the priest who was hearing her sins rang in the confessional box. </P>
<P> The woman, in a letter to the Catholic magazine Famiglia Cristiana (Christian Family), said confessing her sins to a priest was stressful enough without being interrupted by a ring of a cellular phone in the dark box. </P>
<P> A cartoon in the left-leaning daily La Repubblica showed a priest in a confessional box holding a celluar phone to his ear while simultaneously hearing a member of the faithful confess. </P>
<P> ``Say three Our Fathers and three Hail Marys... No, no I wasn't talking to you,'' the priest says to the caller. </P>
