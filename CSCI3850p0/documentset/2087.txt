<P>  One of two main contenders for Haiti's top army post, a colonel who now heads the capital's fire department, has been promoted to general, strongly suggesting he will be the new commander-in-chief, sources close to the military said Tuesday. </P>
<P> Bernadin Poisson was promoted by interim leader Major General Jean-Claude Duperval as part of a new high command structure, said the sources, who requested anonymity. </P>
<P> Asd a general, Poisson will be the third-ranking officer in the military hierarchy, behind Duperval and his deputy, chief of staff Brigadier General Max Mayard. Both Duperval and Mayard are expected to leave office soon. </P>
<P> As the future army leader must hold the rank of general, the promotion of Poisson strongly suggests he will be named by Aristide to replace Duperval when he steps down after an interim period as military boss. </P>
<P> ``If he is the only one I don't think it is unwise to conclude he is the likely nominee,'' said one Haitian with a knowledge of the military. </P>
<P> Poisson, 46, had been considered the second most likely to assume control, behind another colonel, Mondesir Beaubrun. He began his military career in the police but was soon transferred to the fire department, which is under military jurisdiction. He was trained in fire-fighting techniques in the United States. </P>
<P> Both Poisson and Beaubrun were in Washington last week along with three other colonels for interviews with Aristide officials. The whole military structure is to be drastically reshaped and purged of officers who led or acquiesced with the 1991 military coup that toppled Aristide, who spent three years in exile before a U.S. intervention allowed him to reassume the presidency Saturday. </P>
