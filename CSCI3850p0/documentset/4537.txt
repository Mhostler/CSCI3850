<P>  The United States engages in economic counter-espionage to protect U.S. firms but does not itself spy on other countries' industrial secrets to benefit American companies, the State Department said Friday. </P>
<P> A department spokeswoman, commenting on a dispute in which five Americans were accused this week of spying in France, also backed away from a statement yesterday that all five would serve out their full postings in Paris. </P>
<P> The spokeswoman, Christine Shelly, admitted that the affair had caused temporary strains in Franco-U.S. relations but said she did not expect ``a significant long-term impact''. </P>
<P> The spy spat between the two NATO allies turned bitter Friday when the U.S. embassy in Paris accused French Interior Minister Charles Pasqua of lying about who leaked news of the dispute, first published Wednesday by the newspaper Le Monde. </P>
<P> Quoting testimony to Congress by Central Intelligence Agency chief James Woolsey, Shelly said the CIA gathered information on whether other countries were carrying out industrial espionage or engaging in unfair trade practices such as bribery. </P>
<P> This information was brought to the attention of the State Department, which might then decide whether, if U.S. companies were affected, the matter should be raised with the countries concerned, she said. </P>
<P> ``I would want to emphasize that this is a defensive or a reactive process. The intelligence community does not conduct industrial espionage to assist U.S. companies,'' Shelly told a news briefing. </P>
<P> ``It might make the State Department or other agencies aware of such practices directed against U.S. business interests, and where appropriate, we may make use of that information with the U.S. companies involved, if they are the targets.'' </P>
<P> The Le Monde report said the five Americans involved in the affair had attempted to recruit aides to French cabinet ministers for political and industrial espionage. Washington has called the report ``unwarranted'' but has not responded in detail to the allegations. </P>
<P> Shelly Friday refused to say whether the five, four of whom are reportedly diplomats, had been engaged in the type of counter-espionage she described. </P>
<P> But she qualified a statement she made yesterday that the diplomats would all serve out their postings as previously planned. </P>
<P> While declining comment on a Washington Post report Friday that one of the group had already returned to the United States, she said she would ``not specifically rule out'' that some of them might leave France early. </P>
<P> ``If I said something on a previous day that was misleading, I regret that,'' she said. </P>
<P> Other officials who asked not to be identified said one or two of the Americans might return early, but one said: ``The allegations on three of the five really don't stand.'' </P>
<P> Commenting on the often prickly relations between Washington and Paris, Shelly said: ``I think that the most recent incidents have certainly created some strains in that relationship for the present.'' </P>
<P> But, she added, ``I wouldn't expect there to be a significant long-term impact of an adverse quality.'' Senior French officials had also indicated their desire to keep the relationship on track, she added. </P>
