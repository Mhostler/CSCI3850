<P> ``It's impossible for us to predict at this time when and if Warrant Officer Hall might be released,'' McCurry told journalists. </P>
<P> The U.S. official, Thomas Hubbard, arrived in Pyongyang on Wednesday in a bid to secure the release of Hall, whose helicopter went down just inside North Korea on December 17. The body of Hall's co-pilot David Hilemon, who was killed in the incident, was returned last week. </P>
<P> McCurry said Hubbard, deputy assistant secretary for East Asian and Pacific affairs, held several meetings on Thursday with North Korean officials at a government house outside Pyongyang. The discussions ``made good progress'', he said, adding that more talks were expected on Friday. </P>
<P> McCurry said an alleged confession by Hall to ``illegal intrusion'' into North Korea, published on Wednesday by Pyongyang, appeared not to differ greatly from what Washington had already said on the matter. But he said the United States did not know under what circumstances it was prepared. </P>
