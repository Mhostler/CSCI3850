<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Britain denied Friday that it was treating Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, as a second-class partner in Northern Ireland peacemaking. </P>
<P> ``It's not a twin-track approach,'' Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew told a news conference after talks on the peace process with Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring. </P>
<P> But he insisted that ministerial talks with Sinn Fein, which are due to start within days, would not be upgraded from exploratory to full-blown negotiations until progress had been made on taking IRA guns out of service. </P>
<P> He said Britain would hold full talks with all political parties in Northern Ireland which had no links with violence and said Sinn Fein would have to show willingness to take IRA guns out of service to be treated the same way. </P>
<P> ``This is a single-track approach that leads to negotiations. Some participants are farther down that track than others,'' Mayhew said. </P>
<P> He said British Northern Ireland minister Michael Ancram would be meeting Sinn Fein ``within'' days and hoped that the party, which seeks the unification of Ireland, would accept that arms had to be taken out of service. </P>
<P> Britain says it cannot discuss a lasting settlement with Sinn Fein so long as the Irish Republican Army, which fought British rule for 25 years, has stocks of guns and semtex plastic explosive in its possession. </P>
<P> The British official said that the IRA would have to show some ``tangible decommissioning, a willingness to make arms no longer available'' to show its good faith. </P>
<P> Sinn Fein says it is willing to discuss decomissioning but wants all issues, including the withdrawal of British troops and the disbanding of the Protestant police force, to be broached as well. </P>
<P> Mayhew, in a slight softening of Britain's approach to the talks, said decommissioning was ``an important issue but not the sole issue,'' echoing the line of the Irish government. </P>
<P> Dublin wants Britain to make sure that the dispute over arms does not jeopardize a painstaking two-year process which persuaded the IRA to declare a cease-fire eight months ago. </P>
<P> Spring said the two governments had made a lot of progress in the past year and Mayhew reminded reporters that less than 12 months ago pro-British Protestant gunmen killed six Catholics in an attack on a bar in Loughinisland. </P>
<P> ``We need not be daunted by the difficulties. We are not yet up to the first anniversary of that hideous massacre in County Down,'' he said. </P>
<P> Protestant gunmen fighting to keep Northern Ireland British declared a matching cease-fire last October and their political spokesmen have also held exploratory talks with Britain. </P>
