<DATELINE>PARIS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  France confirmed Monday that a member of the staff of its embassy in Algiers was killed by Muslim fundamentalist gunmen aboard a hijacked French airliner. </P>
<P> The foreign ministry named him as Yannick Beugnet and said an embassy official identified the body at Algiers' Ain Nadja hospital. A ministry spokesman could not say if he had diplomatic status. </P>
<P> ``France condemns vigorously this odious and cowardly assassination which has angered all French people,'' the ministry said in a statement. </P>
<P> Algeria's official news agency APS earlier named the dead man, the third victim in Algiers' two-day hostage drama, as Eric Bonnier. The hijackers earlier killed an Algerian policeman and a Vietnamese believed to be a diplomat. </P>
<P> France has said two French embassy staff were among some 174 hostages still held on the Air France Airbus 300 commandeered Saturday by Muslim fundamentalist guerrillas. </P>
<P> After the killing of the French embassy staffer, Paris said Algeria had agreed to allow the airliner to fly to France. </P>
<P> France offered to send anti-terrorist units to help Algerian security forces but said Algeria had not taken up the offer and no French units had flown to Algiers. </P>
