<P>  ``Is that on the agenda?'' retorted former Norwegian Foreign Minister Thorvald Stoltenberg when asked Tuesday about his chances of being chosen secretary-general of NATO. </P>
<P> The question was slipped in at a meeting with reporters meant to focus on a recent trip he made as co-chairman of the international conference on the former Yugoslavia. </P>
<P> ``I've been in Serbia and Bosnia and I've seen it in some Serbian papers. But I must tell you, I am not prepared to talk about the future,'' he said. </P>
<P> Stoltenberg and former Italian Prime Minister Giuliano Amato have been mentioned in speculation about a possible successor to Manfred Woerner, the former West German defense minister who was NATO secretary-general from 1988 until his death last Saturday at the age of 59. </P>
<P> Stoltenberg expressed great regret at Woerner's death while noting that, as Norway's foreign minister, he had ``worked fairly actively against him being secretary-general'' and had supported the candidacy of former Norwegian Prime Minister Kaare Willoch. </P>
<P> ``I must say I have been very impressed with how Manfred Woerner had handled the job. And from the very first moment we were in close personal contact and I think we all have reason to regret that he's not there any longer.'' </P>
