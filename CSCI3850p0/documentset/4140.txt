<P>  U.S. relations with China are worsening because Beijing is ruled by cautious, prickly officials who are less responsive to U.S. pressure than ailing longtime Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, The Washington Post reported in Sunday editions. </P>
<P> Quoting unidentified U.S. officials and intelligence analysts, the newspaper said the Clinton administration's decision to impose trade sanctions against Beijing later this month was one sign of the new tensions. </P>
<P> U.S. officials concluded recently that the 90-year-old Deng no longer played any significant role in China's policy making, the Post reported. </P>
<P> The Clinton administration believes power has passed to ``a clique of technocrats and military officials'' led by president and Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin, according to the paper. </P>
<P> In recent interviews, the officials said they expected, at best, to see a slowdown or stagnation of political reform in Beijing and a continuing repression of basic human rights under the new leaders. </P>
<P> At worst, the administration may be confronted by more problematic actions, including an even harsher political crackdown, new military threats against Taiwan, and an unwelcome new flow of missiles and other weaponry to nations such as Iran and Pakistan, they told the Post. </P>
<P> Some senior U.S. officials expressed the fear that a key test for all who aspired to replace Deng, including those in Jiang's clique, would be how firmly they stood up to Washington, the newspaper said. </P>
