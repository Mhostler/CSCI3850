<DATELINE>GAZA (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Palestinian police Tuesday rounded up activists of a radical group that has claimed responsibility for killing an Israeli security guard in the Gaza Strip, Palestinian security officials said. </P>
<P> PLO leader Yasser Arafat vowed to fight ``fanatic and extremist forces.'' </P>
<P> Security officials in Gaza told Reuters police rounded up at least 40 supporters of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine. </P>
<P> The Syria-based DFLP, led by Nayef Hawatmeh, claimed responsibility in Damascus for Monday's shooting of the guard in a convoy delivering gasoline to Gaza. </P>
<P> Police also arrested ``a number'' of Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas and Islamic Jihad men, the officials said. </P>
<P> All three groups oppose the Israeli-PLO peace deal. </P>
<P> ``We have already taken major steps last night, yesterday, two days ago and we will continue. We will not permit these groups to harm, not only the Israelis, but also the Palestinians and the peace process,'' Arafat told reporters. </P>
<P> ``We will continue in our way to deal and to face all these fanatic and extremist forces and we will not allow them to continue in these activities. But I haven't a magic stick. But I do my best,'' he said. </P>
<P> Palestinian sources in the West Bank said Israeli forces arrested about 40 Palestinians in Hebron, most from the Islamic University including seven of nine members of the Hamas-controlled student council. </P>
<P> Israeli security sources said new procedures on the entry of Israeli citizens into Palestinian self-rule areas in Gaza had been decided upon after the shooting. They declined to elaborate. </P>
<P></P>
<P> ``We aren't encouraging citizens to enter the strip... The question is how to deal with problems when it's necessary to enter because of a problem of supply,'' such as gasoline. </P>
<P> The army has a longstanding bar, observed more in the breach, on Israelis entering the autonomous areas. </P>
