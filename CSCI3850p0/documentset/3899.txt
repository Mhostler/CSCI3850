<P>  A team of Canadian doctors Monday began a risky live-saving operation to separate two tiny Pakistani sisters who are joined at the head. </P>
<P> ``Without treatment these children would not survive,'' Dr. Harold Hoffman, who is leading the surgical team at Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children, told reporters. </P>
<P> The two-year-old twins, Hira and Nida Jamal, were brought to Canada after Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto read about their plight and promised to help get them the best care available. </P>
<P> Known as cephalopagus twins, the girls are joined by the brain and have a shared blood circulatory system, which Hoffman said increases the potential for complications. </P>
<P> ``There's obviously much more risk here because we have two infants who are joined by the brain but I think it's possible we may be able to separate them without any difficulty.'' </P>
<P> The operation, to be conducted by a team of about 20 doctors and nurses, began early Monday morning and is expected to last about 24 hours. </P>
<P> ``God has kept alive my daughters. I'm very hopeful,'' the children's father, Anwar Jamal, told reporters. </P>
<P> The Karachi, Pakistan-born twins have been in the hospital here since November for tests to prepare them for the separation, a rare prodedure which has been performed about 30 times before. </P>
<P> Either one or both of the twins died in about two-thirds of previous operations, but doctors at the Hospital for Sick Children, renowned as one of the world's best, say medical advances should improve their chances of success. </P>
<P> The separation is expected to cost about $464,000 Canadian ($327,000 U.S.) of which about $140,000 Canadian ($99,000) has been pledged by the Pakistani government and the rest collected through fundraising. </P>
