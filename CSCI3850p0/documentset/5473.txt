<P>  A painting created by naked female models dragging their paint-smeared bodies across a canvas could fetch up to $1.3 million, Christie's auctioneers said Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``La Grande Bataille'' by French artist Yves Klein was painted by three models who dragged each other across the canvas in a live performance where Klein ``conducted'' their movements to the accompaniment of a small orchestra. </P>
<P> The painting comes up for sale in London on June 29. </P>
<P> Klein, who died in 1962 aged 34, began using his models' bodies as human brushes in 1960. The term ``anthropometry'' was created to describe his work. </P>
<P> ``The anthropometries were an example of his eccentric attitude towards art making and they diverged greatly from the kind of art being celebrated within the art world at that time,'' wrote Sidra Stitch in the catalogue for a major exhibition of Klein's work at London's Hayward Gallery. </P>
<P> In 1994 the Tokyo Museum of Modern Art bought another of Klein's anthropometries for a reputed $2 million, Christie's said. </P>
