<P>  ``Red mercury,'' potentially the key ingredient of a miniature nuclear bomb, may really exist despite the skepticism of some experts and officials, Britain's New Scientist magazine said this week. </P>
<P> The substance could pose a serious threat to the world's efforts to control the spread of nuclear weapons, it said in a copy of the magazine released ahead of publication Saturday. </P>
<P> Several scientists, including at least one former designer of U.S. nuclear bombs, have cast doubt on its existence. </P>
<P> Nuclear weapons analysts quoted by the magazine said many cases of red mercury offered for sale at enormous prices have in fact turned out to be hoaxes. </P>
<P> But Sam Cohen, the American nuclear physicist who it calls the inventor of the neutron bomb, said: ``I don't want to sound melodramatic. But red mercury is real and it is terrifying.'' </P>
<P> ``I think it is part of a terrorist weapon that potentially spells the end of organised society.'' </P>
<P> Cohen said the chemical could be used to make a baseball-sized neutron bomb capable of killing everyone within 600 yards of the explosion. </P>
<P> Frank Barnaby, a nuclear weapons analyst interested in red mercury who is the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute's former director, said he was more cautious. </P>
<P> But he said he believed ``on the balance of probabilities'' a mercury-based explosive which could revolutionize the design of nuclear weapons was developed in the former Soviet Union. </P>
<P> Barnaby quoted documents leaked to the environmental protest group Greenpeace which apparently came from a former mercury production plant in South Africa. </P>
<P> The documents detail specifications for a semi-liquid compound of pure mercury and mercury antimony oxide, also known as ``cherry red'' because of its color. </P>
<P> Barnaby said he and colleagues had talked to four unnamed scientists in Russia who provided detailed information about the substance, created by binding mercury and antimony together after irradiating it for up to 20 days in a nuclear reactor. </P>
