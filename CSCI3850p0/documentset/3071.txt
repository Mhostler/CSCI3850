<DATELINE>VIENNA (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  North Korea is cooperating fully with the U.N. atomic safeguards agency over the freeze of its nuclear power industry, agency chief Hans Blix said Thursday. </P>
<P> In an address to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Blix said talks between the agency and North Korean officials in Pyongyang had been constructive and more negotiations were planned for January. </P>
<P> ``I can also report that (North Korea) has indicated its willingness to consider the designation of additional inspectors (and) to facilitate the granting of visas,'' Blix told a closed-door meeting of the IAEA's decision-making board of governors. His speech was later made available to reporters. </P>
<P> Blix said Pyongyang also offered to make arrangements for better communications between inspectors stationed in North Korea and the IAEA's headquarters in Vienna. </P>
<P> His report to the 35-member board, which includes the United States, Russia and China, was the most optimistic overview of relations between the IAEA and North Korea since a crisis over the communist state's nuclear program erupted nearly two years ago. </P>
<P> Just six months ago, North Korean delegates stormed out of an IAEA governors' meeting after the board withdrew technical aid to the isolated communist nation as a penalty for obstructing full inspections of its nuclear sites. </P>
<P> North Korea then became the first state to voluntarily pull out of the 121-nation organization. </P>
<P> Washington and its allies suspected that Pyongyang was developing a nuclear bomb and the dispute turned into one of the most serious military standoffs on the tinderbox Korean peninsula since the 1950-53 Korean war. </P>
<P> But the United States, heading off potential confrontation, concluded an agreement with North Korea in Geneva in October. Pyongyang pledged to freeze its suspect nuclear program in return for Western atomic technology. </P>
<P> Blix said an IAEA team in North Korea had informed the agency that North Korea was fully complying with the terms of the Geneva deal. </P>
<P> ``The team was able to confirm that the facilities subject to the freeze were not in operation and that construction work had stopped,'' he said. </P>
<P> North Korea had halted activities at its one operational reactor, a reprocessing plant and a fuel fabrication unit at a nuclear complex in Yongbyon, north of Pyongyang. </P>
<P> Building work on a 50-megawatt plant at Yongbyon and a 200-megawatt reactor in Taechon also stopped. </P>
<P> Despite the rapprochement, Pyongyang has yet to announce whether it intends reapplying for IAEA membership. </P>
<P> On the trafficking of nuclear materials, Blix said the IAEA had prepared proposals to intensify its help to nations attempting to combat the crime and more cash would be made available for 1995. </P>
<P> The governors were due to discuss trafficking Friday. The IAEA was expected to boost help in setting up nuclear monitoring systems, particularly in the successor states of the Soviet Union where smuggling appeared to be prevalent. </P>
<P> Germany, hit by four smuggling cases between May and August, urged the agency in September to act quickly to help member states toughen up controls of radioactive materials. It said trafficking was ``a challenge to the international system of non-proliferation.'' </P>
