<P>  Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord said Wednesday he would make several stops in Asia after attending the Association of Southeast Asian Nations meeting in Bangkok next week. </P>
<P> He told a State Department briefing his itinerary would include Malaysia, ``where we have major economic and security interests'' and Indonesia, the host of Asian-Pacific Economic (APEC) group meeting later this year. </P>
<P> In Australia, he will meet government officials and attend the South Pacific Forum, the annual U.S. dialogue with the key nations of the Pacific. </P>
<P> Lord, the administration's top policymaker on Asia, will then visit New Zealand in an effort to continue to improve a political and security relationship damaged by a dispute over nuclear issues. </P>
<P> He also plans to stop in Papua New Guinea and Hong Kong, where he will ``underline American interests and stakes in the prosperity and stability'' of that territory which is to revert soon to Chinese control. </P>
<P> The U.S. secretary of state normally would attend the ASEAN meeting, which is set for July 25-27 in Bangkok but Warren Christopher, who has been heading U.S. peace efforts in the Middle East, must be in Washington Monday for the first public summit between Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Jordan's King Hussein. </P>
<P> In his place, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott will lead the U.S. delegation to ASEAN, which also includes Lord. </P>
