<DATELINE>GAZA (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Tense young Palestinians gathered in the streets of Gaza City Saturday morning for the funerals of 12 people shot and killed during clashes between Palestinian police and demonstrators. </P>
<P> Gunfire rattled across the city, apparently shots fired in the air in gestures of defiance. </P>
<P> In the West Bank, still under Israeli occupation, demonstrators blocked streets with burning tires and hurled rocks at Israeli troops. The soldiers fired back tear gas and rubber bullets, wounding three Palestinians. </P>
<P> The killings Friday, which began when police stepped in to prevent a march led by Islamic militants, brought a crisis for PLO leader Yasser Arafat's Palestinian self-rule administration and threw his peace deal with Israel into question. </P>
<P> It was the worst violence between Palestinians since they took over running the Gaza Strip from Israeli occupation forces in May and has fueled alarm about a possible Palestinian civil war. At least 200 people were wounded in addition to the 12 dead. </P>
<P> Palestinian sources said Arafat and his aides debated late into Friday night how to assert authority over Muslim militant groups opposed to the peace deal without Gaza sliding into war. </P>
<P> Leaders from all factions met at the home of Haidar Abdel-Shafi, a former Palestinian negotiator and the elder statesman of the Gaza Strip. </P>
<P> A PLO official said it was agreed mourners would not carry weapons at the funerals; no masked men -- symbols of defiance of Arafat's administration -- would appear, and militants would not attack police. </P>
<P> But in the morning, protesters were firing into the air and signs of tension appeared between local leaders of Arafat's Fatah faction and the militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad, who have spearheaded Palestinian opposition to the peace deal. </P>
<P> Angry young men took control of the streets and every mosque blared out recitations from the Koran in mourning for the dead. </P>
<P> Palestinians also stormed an Israeli army checkpoint, forcing soldiers to flee to nearby Netzarim, one of 19 settlements left in Gaza. </P>
<P> Palestinian anger over the killings also spread to the West Bank Saturday. </P>
<P> In Hebron, hundreds of young men marched in the streets chanting slogans blaming Arafat for the killings. Soldiers fired rubber bullets at demonstrators, wounding three, witnesses said. </P>
<P> In scenes reminiscent of the seven-year Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule, students blocked streets with burning tires and hurled rocks and bottles at Israeli soldiers. The soldiers also fired volleys of tear gas. </P>
<P> In Gaza City's Zeitoun district, a crowd of mourners stopped a car driven by uniformed members of the Civil Aviation authority. Youths made them get out of the car and then burned it in the middle of the road. </P>
<P> At Shujaia police station, scene of clashes Friday, dozens of boys stood by the fence taunting police on guard there as ``collaborators'' with Israel. </P>
<P> They jeered policemen on the street. Other armed policemen took up position on rooftops but generally the security forces kept a low profile. </P>
<P> The causes of the clashes, which started outside the Palestine mosque, were still debated. </P>
<P> Witnesses say police opened fire on demonstrators who threw stones at them. But the Palestinian Authority and Fatah say Hamas militants opened fire on the police first. </P>
