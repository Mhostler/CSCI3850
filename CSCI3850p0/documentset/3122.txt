<DATELINE>MONTERREY, Mexico, Dec 11 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Mexican Julio Cesar Chavez retained his World Boxing Council super lightweight title by stopping a bloodied Tony Lopez of the United States in the 10th round Saturday. </P>
<P> As blood streamed down Lopez's face from cuts around both eyes, Argentine referee Eduardo Lamazon called in ringside doctor Romeo Garcia Benavides to check out the challenger. </P>
<P> On the referee's insistence, Benavides stopped the scheduled 12-round fight at 1:41. </P>
<P> ``The cut was really bad, there was no sense in letting it continue,'' referee Lamazon said. </P>
<P> ``If the people had seen the cut, they wouldn't have booed the stoppage,'' Lamazon said of the response of some in the Monterrey baseball stadium. </P>
<P> Lopez was one of those who angrily rejected the decision. </P>
<P> ``I could have gone the distance,'' said Lopez, a former lightweight and junior lightweight champion whose record fell to 45-5-1. ``It was two sorry little cuts and he stopped the fight. </P>
<P> ``I couldn't believe he stopped it, he shouldn't have stopped it.'' </P>
<P> Lopez was a bloody mess after the seventh round with blood dripping down his face from a cut over the left eye. Benavides looked in on Lopez's corner after the round. </P>
<P> Lopez's eye continued to swell up and shut as Chavez attacked it by snapping off short, crisp punches. </P>
<P> By the ninth round Lopez was cut in the corner of his right eye as he continued to take a pounding. </P>
<P> Despite the terrific beating he delivered, Chavez said he was not at full strength. </P>
<P> ``My left arm hurt a great deal and every time I threw my left, it hurt,'' he said. </P>
<P> Chavez's current reign as 140-pound champion marks the sixth time he has owned a title, in four different weight divisions. </P>
<P> The marathon card in an outdoor ring featured four other world title fights. </P>
<P> International Boxing Federation welterweight champion Felix Trinidad of Puerto Rico got off the canvas in the first round and went on to raise his record to 25-0 by stopping American Oba Carr in the eighth round. </P>
<P> Trinidad floored the previously unbeaten Carr twice in the round before referee Robert Gonzalez stopped the beating at 2:41. Carr is 32-1. </P>
<P> Frankie Randall retained his World Boxing Association junior welterweight title by stopping fellow American Rodney Moore in the seventh round. </P>
<P> Randall, 51-3-1, had rocked Moore, 34-9-2, with a straight right and the challenger was draped up against the ropes when referee Kenny Bayless of the United States waved off the fight at 1:43. </P>
<P> A battered Jorge Castro of Argentina came off the ropes in the ninth round to floor American John David Jackson three times and retain his WBA middleweight title in the night's most dramatic bout. </P>
<P> Bleeding from cuts around both eyes and from his nose, with his right eye nearly swollen shut, the Argentine connected with a left hook to the jaw that toppled the undefeated former champion. </P>
<P> Jackson, 32-1, wobbled to his feet to beat the count, but the American quickly went down a second time. Again he got up, but went down for a third time when South African referee Stanley Christodolou stopped the fight at 2:43 of the round. </P>
<P> ``He was beating the heck out of me, but I never gave up. I never thought of quitting,'' said Castro, 96-4-2. </P>
<P> WBA strawweight champion Ricardo Lopez of Mexico, 39-0, knocked out challenger Yamil Caraballo, 13-4-1, in the first round. </P>
