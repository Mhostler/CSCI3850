<P>  Former basketball star Michael Jordan, probably the biggest attraction at baseball's spring training this year, said Saturday he will step aside if he is caught in the middle of the players' strike. </P>
<P> ``I'm not a replacement player,'' he insisted. ``That's not what I'm here for.'' </P>
<P> Jordan, who retired from the NBA's Chicago Bulls in 1993, played last year for the Birmingham Barons in the White Sox's minor league system and is expected to be promoted to the triple-A Nashville franchise this year. </P>
<P> As such, Jordan is not considered a strikebreaking replacement player. The Major League Players' Association has said, however, that anyone who plays in an exhibition game where admission is charged will be considered a strikebreaker. Jordan said he would not play in such a game. </P>
<P> Under normal circumstances, spring training exhibition games where admission is charged feature major league players and a players hoping to make major league rosters. </P>
<P> ``I don't want to put myself in the middle of this,'' Jordan said following a light workout at the Chicago White Sox camp here Saturday. ``If somehow I'm caught in the middle, I'm not a pleased person and I'll have to re-evaluate my situation.'' </P>
<P> ``If I become such a focal point in this strike situation where you're worrying about me instead of settling the strike, I'd rather step aside and see if you can solve the situation and then I'll come back.'' </P>
<P> But Jordan prefers not to have to make such a tough decision. He said he hoped the strike, which started Aug. 12, would be settled quickly so he can get his mind back on pursuing his dream of getting to the major leagues through dedication and hard work. </P>
<P> Jordan did not have to report for camp until next week, but he showed up early, hoping to get in some extra work on his hitting and fielding skills. </P>
<P> ``I'm more aware of what it takes now (to be a baseball player),'' he said, adding: ``I'm starting to believe in myself.'' </P>
<P> Jordan took batting practice with the catchers Saturday and, after some early jitters and a lot of ground balls, he began hitting line drives. He even smacked a home run over the 340-foot mark in left field, to the delight of several fans watching there. </P>
<P> ``Physically, I'm building myself up to where I can swing the bat more aggressively,'' he said. ``Last year I was just trying to make contact, but that may have been a mistake.'' </P>
<P> Jordan batted just .202 for Birmingham and hit three home runs -- hardly major league material but the White Sox apparently are pleased with his progress. </P>
<P> ``He looked fine,'' said Chicago General Manager Ron Schuler. ``He's using his legs better and should hit a lot more home runs. I see a lot of improvement.'' </P>
<P> Jordan admitted, though, that 1995 is his ``make-or-break'' year. He said he would be content to remain in the minor leagues only if he continues to make progress, adding that he nearly gave up at one point last year. </P>
<P> ``I had to change my whole outlook,'' he said. ``I was trying to be seven out of ten and it was a real battle with myself to accept that in baseball the success rate is three out of ten.'' </P>
<P> Jordan added: ``You have to actually go through it before you believe it. It was tough for me to accept such a high failure rate.'' </P>
<P> The real success for Jordan is that he is still in professional baseball one year after many nay-sayers said he would wash out in his first year. </P>
<P> ``Those people didn't know me as a person,'' Jordan responded. ``I'm just happy I was able to prove the ones who didn't expect this wrong.'' </P>
