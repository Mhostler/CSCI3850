<P>  The commander of the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front Tuesday said it would form a broad-based government within days and would then declare a unilateral cease-fire. </P>
<P> ``The RPF will declare a broad-based government of national unity within days,'' Major General Paul Kagame told reporters at Kanombe barracks in the Rwandan capital of Kigali. </P>
<P> ``The RPF should now be considered as the government and the former government should be considered as rebels,'' said Kagame, adding that he expected the international community to recognize the new government. </P>
<P> He said as soon as it was formed the RPF would declare a unilateral cease-fire. </P>
<P> Kagame hit out at France for what he said were statements that came across as threats after French forces were ordered Monday stop an RPF advance westwards by force if necessary. </P>
<P> ``The manner in which this is being handled is uncalled for,'' he said. ``The French must recognize our sovereign rights in our own country. We don't mind having zones where civilians will be protected but the way the matter is being handled raises questions.'' </P>
