<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Jailed Equatorial Guinea opposition leader Severo Moto has asked President Teodoro Obiang Nguema for clemency after making a public declaration recanting his political line, an opposition spokesman said Wednesday. </P>
<P> Moto, leader of the Progress Party (PP), the biggest group opposing Obiang's 15-year hardline rule, recorded a television and radio appeal for a pardon Tuesday after being taken to the presidential compound in Malabo. </P>
<P> He told PP members ``to act with more calm and patience'' and denied reports that he had received poor treatment at Malabo's Black Beach jail. </P>
<P> An opposition spokesman in exile from the former Spanish colony said he suspected the action was a strategy by Obiang to grant clemency in return for Moto's promise to leave politics. </P>
<P> ``Everything about this smells like pressure,'' PP deputy leader Armengol Engonga told journalists. ``Knowing Severo like I know him, he only could have made these declarations with a pistol at his neck.'' </P>
<P> Moto is serving a two and a half year sentence for insulting the president and trying to bribe a policeman. </P>
<P> But PP members, who staged a protest for his release in Madrid Tuesday, said he was now facing charges that he had attempted to stage a coup and could receive the death sentence. </P>
<P> Moto had been preparing to take part in municipal elections in May. </P>
