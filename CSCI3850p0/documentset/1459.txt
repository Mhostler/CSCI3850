<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt's center-right government was defeated in a general election Sunday, according to two exit polls. </P>
<P> The polls showed Bildt's four-party coalition would not win enough seats to form a majority government, while the opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP) should be able to form a government with the aid of smaller parties. </P>
<P> Both exit polls, carried out by television channels, gave the opposition Social Democrats the largest share of the votes with 44 percent in the first poll broadcast on private television channel TV4 and 43.7 percent in one broadcast by national news channel TV1. </P>
<P> The Left and Green parties, which have pledged to support the Social Democrats, together took 11.2 percent of the votes in the first poll and 11.9 percent in the latter. </P>
<P> Bildt has said he would only carry on as Prime Minister if his coalition won its own majority in the 349-seat parliament (Riksdag). </P>
