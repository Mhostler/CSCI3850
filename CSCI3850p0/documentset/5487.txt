<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Nearly 150 House Democrats wrote to President Clinton Wednesday asking him to veto a law they say contains a special break for media magnate Rupert Murdoch. </P>
<P> Democrats charge that House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., who has a book deal with Murdoch's Harper Collins publishing firm, helped secure the special deal -- a charge Gingrich denies. Gingrich's book deal is under review by the House Ethics Committee. </P>
<P> Democrats are also angry that Republicans deleted a separate provision of the bill that would have imposed a tax on wealthy expatriates, designed to stop rich Americans from renouncing citizenship to avoid billions in taxes. </P>
<P> The provision was struck by a joint House-Senate committee that worked out the final, compromise version of the bill. </P>
<P> ``This legislation creates a special tax break worth tens of millions of dollars for one billionaire who has a special relationship with (Gingrich), while at the same time it fails to crack down on billionaires who leave the country,'' the Democrats' letter to Clinton said. </P>
<P> The bill contains a repeal of a tax break for firms that sell facilities to minority broadcasters. </P>
<P> The committee accepted an amendment by Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun, D-Ill., that made sure that a deal between Murdoch and the Chicago-based Tribune Co. and minority investors, including record executive Quincy Jones, was not affected by the broadcast repeal. </P>
<P> The agreement between the Tribune and Murdoch was reached before the January 17 cutoff date, but Moseley-Braun wanted to make sure it would not be affected by a change in the terms of the contract. Murdoch, selling an Atlanta television station to the Tribune, could receive millions under the tax break. </P>
<P> Republicans angrily denied that Gingrich had anything to do with the decision to accept Moseley-Braun's amendment. </P>
<P> The Democrats promised that if Clinton vetoed the bill, they would work to pass a measure to reinstate the health insurance tax deduction for self-employed people before the April 17 income tax filing deadline. </P>
<P> Clinton said Tuesday he supported the overall bill, but was troubled that the tax on expatrites was eliminated. </P>
<P> ``I am deeply troubled that the conference committee took out a payment mechanism by simply asking billionaires, who made their money as Americans ... to pay the taxes they owe,'' Clinton said. </P>
<P> The overall legislation reinstates a tax break allowing self-employed individuals to deduct health insurance. The bill allows a 25 percent deduction for 1994, increasing it to 30 percent in 1995 and making it permanent at that level. </P>
<P> The repeal of the tax break regarding minority broadcasters is intended to pay for the health insurance deductions. </P>
