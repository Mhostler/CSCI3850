<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, May 7 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Ethiopians voted in their first multi-party general election on Sunday, flocking to polling stations for an almost certain victory for the country's ruling coalition. </P>
<P> The election started with a trickle of voters making their way up the mist-shrouded hills of Addis Ababa at dawn past early joggers and churchgoers to polling stations but picked up in mid-morning. </P>
<P> The Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) led by President Meles Zenawi, 41, ends four years of transitional rule with the one-day polls, which will cement the division of the country into nine new federated states. </P>
<P> Officials said voting was normal except in the eastern town of Dire Dawa, where polling stations failed to open as designated local observers did not turn up because they wanted to be paid. </P>
<P> ``From what we've seen so far it's progressing very smoothly but we've visited only two of the 49,000 polling stations,'' British diplomat and election observer Jeremy Astill-Brown told Reuters in Addis Ababa. </P>
<P> Most of the opposition boycotted the election, making an EPRDF landslide victory virtually inevitable across Ethiopia, which is twice the size of France and has 55 million people. </P>
<P> The election for a 548-seat national parliament and regional councils in the new nine zones is an attempt to tackle problems governing more than 80 ethnic groups, speaking 70 languages. </P>
<P> But members of the boycotting opposition said the election was a sham designed to put the EPRDF back in power and give it a bolt-hole by allowing ethnic regions to secede if they want. </P>
<P> Voting was postponed in three of the nine regions until May 27 because of what the government said were administrative and logistical problems. Regional council polls in Dire Dawa were also delayed due to boundary disputes between ethnic groups. </P>
<P> The National Electoral Board said more than 15 million people registered to vote for parliament and regional councils and 2,832 candidates were standing including more than 900 independents. Final results will be announced on May 23. </P>
