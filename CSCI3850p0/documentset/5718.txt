<DATELINE>HAVANA, (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Cuba condemned the United States Thursday for expelling two Cuban U.N. diplomats over an alleged assault on New York City policemen last August, calling the move ''ridiculous''. </P>
<P> A Foreign Ministry statement said ``this ridiculous decision ... shows without any doubt the attitude of the U.S. authorities in the face of pressure by fascist little groups and ultraconservative elements in U.S. society.'' </P>
<P> Asked at a regular weekly news briefing whether Cuba might respond to the expulsions with similar measures against U.S. diplomats, Foreign Ministry spokesman Miguel Alfonso declined to comment. </P>
<P> ``Our country energetically rejects this crude anti-Cuban maneuver and reiterates again that Cuban diplomatic officials will never stop fulfilling the sacred duty of defending our interests and our principles, both with words and with action at the moment when that is necessary,'' the statement, published by state media, said. </P>
<P> The timing of the expulsion order was ``suspiciously close'' to talks due to start next week in New York between Cuba and the United States on immigration issues, it added. </P>
<P> ``It is also a clear sign of the isolation of an agressive, hostile and cold-warring policy that the U.S. government insists on continuing towards Cuba despite the fact that it has been universally condemned,'' it said, referring to the longstanding U.S. economic embargo against Havana. </P>
<P> The United States, which denies the expulsion was politically motivated, has given the two diplomats until midnight Sunday to leave the country. A spokesman for the U.S. mission to the United Nations, announcing the move Wednesday, identified the two as Edmundo Suarez Hernandez, a counsellor and the fourth-ranking diplomat in Cuba's U.N. mission, and Saul Hermida Griego, a lower-ranking attache. </P>
<P> A third Cuban envoy, Alexis Bandrich Vega, a former third secretary now believed to have left the country, was also accused of ``attempted assault in the second degree.'' </P>
<P> The Cuban statement reiterated Havana's position that New York police were to blame for the Aug. 30 scuffle because they failed to provide adequate protection for Cuba's U.N. mission. </P>
<P> The dispute, which injured several police officers, broke out when police tried to dislodge protestors opposed to the government of President Fidel Castro who had chained themselves to the gate of the mission about 10 blocks from U.N. headquarters. </P>
<P> The United States last month asked Cuba to waive diplomatic immunity for the envoys so they could be charged in court or face possible expulsion. Cuba replied April 5, disputing the charges and saying police were to blame for allowing demonstrators to block the entrance to the mission. </P>
<P> Alfonso said this sort of dispute with the United States was part of the 36-year-history of the Cuban revolution and was nothing extraordinary. The expulsions are the latest upset in a long history of tense relations between Washington and Havana since the 1959 revolution that brought Castro to power. </P>
