<P>  Burundi denied asylum to 317 Rwandan refugees Tuesday and expelled them back to their country, the U.N. refugee agency said. </P>
<P> Spokesman Chris Bowers said most of those expelled were among the 10,000 Rwandan Hutus who managed to cross into Burundi last month when Rwanda closed camps for more than 200,000 internally displaced people. </P>
<P> Burundi breached the 1951 U.N. refugee convention by denying asylum and expelling the Rwandans to their homeland against their will, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) officials said. </P>
<P> Many of the refugees expelled Tuesday were young males, Bowers said. Rwanda's government is arresting thousands of Hutu men and investigating them for alleged crimes during last year's genocide of up to 1 million Tutsis and allied Hutus. </P>
<P> The 317 were handed over by Burundi at Kanyaru Bas and transported to a transit center in Butare, southern Rwanda. </P>
<P> The UNHCR said it believed Tuesday's expulsion was the first of its kind from Burundi to Rwanda and was part of a worrying regional trend. </P>
<P> Tanzania closed its border this year to any more Hutu refugees escaping Burundi and Zaire last year expelled a group of Hutus to Rwanda whom it accused of being troublemakers. </P>
<P> Both these decisions broke the 1951 convention. </P>
<P> There are an estimated two million Hutu refugees in Zaire, Tanzania and Burundi who fled there after their government and army lost last year's civil war against the mainly-Tutsi Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF). </P>
<P> Bowers said about 2,000 of the 10,000 Rwandans who made it into Burundi last month later managed to cross into Zaire, which they consider a sanctuary. </P>
<P> This meant Tuesday's expulsions could be followed by others. </P>
