<P>  Lebanon's Maronite Christian patriarch, in an Easter message, painted a bleak picture of the country, citing lack of sovereignty, human rights breaches and an acute economic crisis. </P>
<P> Patriarch Nasrallah Boutros Sfeir, speaking few days after Lebanese marked the 20th anniversary of the start of the country's devastating 1975-90 civil war, warned the situation must be rectified ``before it is too late.'' </P>
<P> ``Our national will is captive, human rights are not always respected, the administration is worn-out, patronage is prevalent,'' Sfeir, widely seen as the last effective Christian voice in Lebanon, said at a weekend sermon attended by Maronite President Elias Hrawi and other officials. </P>
<P> ``Lebanese are suffering at this stage of their national life more than in the past few years,'' he said in the speech from his seat of Bkirki in the Christian heartland north of Beirut. </P>
<P> A national reconciliation pact signed in Taif, Saudi Arabia, in 1989 ended the civil war a year later and the country has since launched a slow-paced reconstruction campaign. </P>
<P> Referring to grievances among Lebanon's 1.4 million once-dominant minority Christians they are being discriminated against, he said: ``Rule, contrary to what is stipulated in the (Taif) national accord, is not balanced.'' </P>
<P> Many Christians who say their community emerged weakened from the 1975-90 civil war argue the Arab-brokered Taif pact which divided power equally between Christians and Moslems is being implemented in a way disfavouring them. </P>
<P> Traditionally opposed to Damascus' political stranglehold over Beirut, many Christians argue Lebanon will not be truly free until Syria's 35,000 troops, acting as peacekeepers, and Israel's 1,000-strong occupation force in south Lebanon leave. </P>
<P> The Christians, most of whom boycotted parliamentary polls in 1992 saying they wanted elections free of Damascus' tutelage, say they are not well represented in government and parliament. </P>
<P> Sfeir, also a cardinal, said rivalry over public jobs on a sectarian basis has overburdened the cash-starved treasury and the economic crisis gripping the country was exhausting Lebanese. </P>
<P> ``Debts are accumulating one month after another,'' he added. </P>
<P> Lack of trust in post-war Lebanon was preventing hundreds of thousands of Lebanese who emigrated during the war from returning ``at a time when the homeland is in dire need to their energies and brains,'' Sfeir said. </P>
<P> ``All of this needs to be rectified before it is too late,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``If the train of (Middle East) peace arrives and we are still in this situation and have not prepared the plans which allow us to join the march, we don't know what our fate will be.'' </P>
<P> The government of Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri has launched a multi-billion dollar reconstruction campaign, hoping Lebanon would regain at least part of its role as a business and financial centre in a peaceful Middle East. </P>
<P> But the priorities and pace of his programme have been under fire and many Lebanese are bitter at the economic hardships they still face. </P>
