<P>  A white Zimbabwean doctor at the center of a race uproar over accusations he experimented on blacks was ordered Wednesday to spend six months in prison at hard labor for causing the deaths of two patients. </P>
<P> Richard Gladwell McGown, 58, an anesthetist of Scottish descent, appeared shocked as High Court Judge Paddington Garwe said he had been negligent, especially in the treatment of a 20-month-old boy who died hours after a circumcision. </P>
<P> The boy was given a heavier-than-normal dose of morphine and was discharged immediately after the operation. </P>
<P> ``The accused was grossly negligent ... and we find a prison and labor sentence appropriate -- not a fine or some community work sentence because of the sanctity of life,'' Garwe told a packed courtroom as he imposed a 12-month jail term, six months of which was suspended. </P>
<P> McGown, who took Zimbabwean citizenship after immigrating here in 1968, looked straight at the judge, blinking several times. His wife and two of his three children sat still on a bench just behind the dock. </P>
<P> He was also ordered to pay a $1,250 fine in the death of a teen-age girl who the court said received inadequate care after a morphine dose. </P>
<P> The case has aroused enormous interest in Zimbabwe, where many of the majority blacks resent the economic power wielded by whites, some of whom remain from Rhodesian colonial times. </P>
<P> But only a dozen or so Harare university students, demanding a death sentence for McGown, attended the court Wednesday in contrast to the hundreds who besieged it on the day McGown was found guilty two weeks ago. </P>
<P> McGown, who pleaded not guilty to the charges of culpable homicide and was acquitted on three other similar counts, appealed against both conviction and sentence. </P>
<P> The judge said he would rule later Wednesday on whether McGown can continue free on bail while the case goes to the supreme court. </P>
<P> The charges against McGown, who was born in India to Scottish parents, were first made in 1992 after a parliamentary committee said he had killed patients between 1986 and 1992 while testing the side-effects of spine-injected higher morphine doses on black women and children. </P>
