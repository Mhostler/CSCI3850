<P>  A grenade was thrown into the courtyard of a Sunni Moslem mosque in Pakistan's central Punjab province on Saturday, a local official said. </P>
<P> The official said no-one was hurt, but the private PPI news agency reported that one worshipper had been wounded. </P>
<P> The blast at the Hamza mosque in the town of Chakwal, about 100 km (60 miles) south of Islamabad, went off soon after dawn prayers, shattering windows of the mosque and nearby buildings. </P>
<P> There was no immediate claim of responsibility. </P>
<P> Scores of people, many of them Shi'ite Moslems, have been killed and wounded in Pakistan in gun, grenade and bomb attacks on mosques by rival sectarian groups in recent months. </P>
<P> Chakwal has been at the centre of a controversy in Pakistan over a seismic centre being built there with U.S. assistance to monitor nuclear explosions in the region. </P>
