<DATELINE>LONDON, April 6 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Rwanda's judicial system was shattered by last year's brutal civil war and refugee exodus, and some government soldiers are taking the law into their own hands, Amnesty International said on Thursday. </P>
<P> The human rights watchdog body said in a report that many judges and lawyers were killed during the conflict that decimated the country's population between April and July 1994. </P>
<P> The war's victors, the Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) led by the minority Tutsi tribe, had generally been seen as well disciplined, Amnesty said. But some of their soldiers had been tempted to take revenge for the mass killings. </P>
<P> The RPF defeated the former government's Hutu-led army, whose hardline militia units the West blames for sparking the genocide of up to one million Tutsis and moderate Hutus. </P>
<P> An estimated 30,000 prisoners languish inside Rwanda's squalid jails waiting to face charges that they took part in the carnage. </P>
<P> But attempts to ease the backlog had prompted a crackdown by the military, Amnesty said. </P>
<P> The former president of the high court in the capital Kigali, Gratien Ruhorahoza, disappeared in October 1994 shortly after listing ``80 prisoners he intended to release for lack of evidence.'' He may be in detention in a military camp. </P>
<P> It also charged that that RPF soldiers were re-arresting or ``disappearing'' prisoners released by judicial officials who ruled they had been detained unlawfully. </P>
<P> Meanwhile, Amnesty added, supporters of the ousted Hutu government continued to kill and terrorise their compatriots in refugee camps in Zaire and Tanzania, where aid agencies estimate some two million people fled during the fighting. </P>
<P> Despite the terror in the camps, ``many refugees are refusing to return to Rwanda because of these arbitrary arrests and ``disappearances', which take place despite official promises that they have nothing to fear,'' Amnesty said. </P>
<P> It cited the case of former high court magistrate Jean Mukuralinda, who was ``arbitrarily arrested when he returned at the invitation of the new minister of justice.'' </P>
<P> Amnesty confirmed reports that Rwanda's prisons were badly overcrowded, resulting in the deaths of some detainees. </P>
