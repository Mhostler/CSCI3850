<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A witness in the federal trial of an alleged drug cartel member accused of blowing up a Colombian airliner identified him Friday as the explosives expert in charge of the bombing. </P>
<P> Victoria Uribe testified that defendant Dandeny Munoz-Mosquera and her late boyfriend, both alleged Medellin cartel members, planted the suitcase bomb in the Avianca Airlines plane that exploded over Colombia in 1989. </P>
<P> The explosion killed all 107 passengers. </P>
<P> Uribe testified that her boyfriend, Carlos Mario, had told her that the late Medellin cartel chief Pablo Escobar ordered the bombing because drug agents were on board the plane. </P>
<P> Munoz-Mosquera is being tried in U.S. District Court on 14 charges of conspiracy and murder. If convicted, he could face life in prison. </P>
<P> Speaking through a Spanish interpreter, Uribe also said she had earned $20 million as a cocaine carrier and money launderer for the cartel before her arrest in 1993. </P>
<P> She once had a job photographing air drops of cocaine into the sea off San Juan, Puerto Rico, and sending the film to Colombia as proof of the success of the smuggling, she said. </P>
<P> Defense attorney Kenneth Ramsur said Uribe was one of a parade of convicted Medellin defendants cooperating with prosecutors in hopes of winning reduced sentences. </P>
<P> On Thursday, Carlos Botero, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence on a drug and conspiracy conviction, named Munoz-Mosquera as a key aide to Escobar. </P>
<P> Escobar was killed by Colombian police in 1993. </P>
<P> Botero, a former architect and university professor turned cocaine and weapons shipper for the cartel, also testified that he had helped arrange shipments of drugs through Cuba with the aid of Raul Castro, the brother of Fidel Castro. </P>
<P> Botero also named former Haitian leader Raul Cedras as one of three Haiitian military officials at a 1988 meeting with Escobar. According to Botero, Haiti was a key shipping point for arms and drugs for the cartel and earned a share of cartel profits. </P>
<P> Munoz-Mosquera's trial began Oct. 24. Closing arguments were expected to start next week. </P>
<P> The trial is the second for Munoz-Mosquera. His first trial ended in a hung jury last July. </P>
<P> Although the explosion occurred on a domestic flight in Colombia, the trial is being held in the United States because two Americans were on board. </P>
