<P>  Brazil's embassy said Tuesday former president Itamar Franco had delayed delivering his credentials as ambassador to Portugal for ``personal reasons,'' possibly his relationship with his girlfriend. </P>
<P> ``He has delayed his arrival for personal reasons, but we are hoping he will arrive here by the end of the month,'' spokesman Joao Solano told Reuters. ``There is no fixed date.'' </P>
<P> A Portuguese foreign ministry spokesman told Reuters that Franco, Brazil's previous president who was named ambassador to Portugal in February, had not handed over his credentials as scheduled May 2. </P>
<P> Asked to comment on press speculation that Franco's relationship with his Brazilian girlfriend June Drummond may have caused the delay in taking up his appointment, Solano said: ``I imagine that, yes.'' </P>
<P> Brazilian and Portuguese newspapers have said one reason for the delay was that Drummond wanted to marry Franco, who is divorced, so that she would not be his unofficial escort on his posting. </P>
<P> Solano said he did not believe that Brazil had given reasons to Portugal for Franco's failure to deliver credentials. </P>
<P> ``There is no urgency for Mr Franco to arrive. The embassy is in capable hands,'' he said. </P>
<P> President Fernando Henrique Cardoso postponed an official visit to Portugal May 3 because he had to stay in Brazil during debates on the revision of the constitution, Solano said. </P>
<P> ``There was a phone conversation between President Cardoso and the Portuguese President Mario Soares about a week ago to explain the reasons for the postponement, and President Soares fully accepted those reasons,'' Solano said. </P>
