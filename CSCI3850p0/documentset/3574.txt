<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole introduced a bill in the new Congress Wednesday to break the Bosnia arms embargo despite opposition from President Clinton's administration and European allies. </P>
<P> Dole told the Senate the bill would put true pressure on Bosnia Serbs to accept a peace agreement by requiring Clinton to break the U.N. embargo by May 1 if there is no peace in order to help Bosnian Muslims arm and defend themselves. </P>
<P> ``We have an opportunity to take real action, to take meaningful action by terminating this illegal and unjust arms embargo on Bosnia-Herzegovina,'' Dole said. </P>
<P> But Britain and France have warned they would be forced to withdraw their peacekeeping forces from Bosnia because of refueled warfare if Washington pulled out of the embargo. </P>
<P> The State Department sharply criticized Dole's action, saying his timing was particularly bad because the four-month ceasefire won by former president Jimmy Carter is holding. </P>
<P> ``We continue to believe that it is just the wrong thing to do at this very important point in the crisis in Bosnia,'' State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said. </P>
<P> ``Perhaps Congress, as it considers Sen. Dole's resolution, might want to think about what that four-month period offers by way of an opportunity for negotiations,'' he told a news briefing. </P>
<P> McCurry said the State Department would discuss this with Dole and others in Congress. ``We think we can argue effectively that we're at a point in the diplomacy based on the work the contact group has done that we need to see if we can't use this new diplomatic opportunity to build on the opportunity for peace,'' he said. </P>
<P> Officials of the contact group -- the United States, Russia, Britain, France and Germany -- are meeting Thursday in Bonn to discuss current peace efforts. </P>
<P> McCurry also said that if the United States unilaterally lifted the embargo it would take on the moral responsibility to arm, equip and train the Bosnian government, which has been hit by the ban in its conflict with Bosnian Serbs. </P>
<P> ``How that could be achieved without massive use of U.S. force unilaterally, and very very likely the introduction of U.S. ground troops, is a question that someone I hope will pose to Sen. Dole,'' he said. </P>
<P> But Dole said his bill breaking the embargo would not undermine Carter's cease-fire, and instead would apply pressure on Bosnian Serbs to accept peace. </P>
<P> ``Since when does leverage undermine diplomacy?'' Dole said. </P>
<P> ``The bottom line is that if this legislation is passed and no peace settlement is reached, (Serb leader) Radovan Karadzic and his thugs will have to face greater consequences than another meeting of the contact group,'' he said. </P>
<P> Dole did not say how soon he would put the legislation to a Senate vote. It would also have to be approved by the House of Representatives, which would be likely, and signed by President Clinton to become law and take effect.  McCurry said he did not know if Clinton would veto such legislation. </P>
