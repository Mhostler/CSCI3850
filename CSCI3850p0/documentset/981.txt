<P>  South Korea said Thursday it will work out measures to cope with any change in the situation in communist North Korea caused by problems with the leadership succession. </P>
<P> ``The government is keeping a close watch on North Korea as there seems to be uncertainty regarding the change of power,'' a statement by the Unification Ministry said. </P>
<P> ``We will work out measures to cope with the changing situation,'' it said without elaborating. </P>
<P> The statement was issued after a meeting of senior policymakers led by Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hong-koo. </P>
<P> Seoul said Wednesday it was concerned by the prospect of instability in the North after several indications Kim Jong-il was facing problems consolidating power following the death of his father, president Kim Il-sung, on July 8. </P>
<P> South Korean President Kim Young-sam was quoted by an aide Wednesday as saying there had been a number of ``significant movements'' in the North and people in the South ``should be prepared for any eventuality.'' </P>
<P> More than six weeks after Kim Il-sung's death, the communist North is still without a formal head of state. </P>
<P> Kim Jong-il, 52, was groomed for more than two decades as his father's successor and continues to be hailed as such by Pyongyang's official media. </P>
<P> But he still has not been confirmed in key positions his father held until his death -- state president, general secretary of the ruling Korea Workers' Party and head of the party's military commission. </P>
<P> German diplomats in North Korea said they had been told that leaflets calling for the overthrow of the government had been scattered in the diplomatic compound in Pyongyang late last week. </P>
<P> The report of the rare act of defiance in one of the world's most regimented societies surfaced amid other signs of opposition to Kim Jong-il. </P>
<P> A North Korean radio commentary on Sunday hinted at opposition to the succession. It said the country's revolutionary work should not end with just one generation. </P>
<P> ``Historical experience shows that if the succession issue involving takeover of great revolutionary works of the leader failed to be resolved correctly, it could result in damaging the party and revolution through acts of betrayal by ambitious people and conspirators,'' it said. </P>
<P> This ``could also bring about a grave disastrous result,'' the commentary added. </P>
