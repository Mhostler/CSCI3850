<P>  The Muslim militant Hamas newspaper al-Watan, shut down by the PLO for three months accused of incitement, Monday condemned the closure as the act of a ``dictatorship.'' </P>
<P> Sayid Abu Musameh, Hamas leader and editor at al-Watan, was jailed by the Palestinian Authority's military court Sunday for writing seditious articles, inciting and tampering with security. The paper was ordered closed for three months. </P>
<P> ``This is a step unprecedented in oppression, dictatorship and silencing mouths...the weak self-rule authority arrested chief editor Sheikh Sayid Abu Musameh and tries him in the military court and sentences him to two years in jail,'' the statement signed by the newspaper's administration said. </P>
<P> Abu Musameh was the first senior Hamas official tried and sentenced by the military court. The Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas, the PLO's main rival, opposes the PLO-Israel peace deal and has vowed to wreck it. </P>
<P> PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat personally approved the licensing of al-Watan newspaper last September. </P>
<P> The statement said the trial was carried out without a defense lawyer or witnesses. </P>
<P> It said the Islamic Jihad newspaper had also been closed and four of its reporters jailed for several months, following a suicide attack carried out by Islamic Jihad militants which killed 21 Israelis in January. </P>
<P> ``It seems the authority does not want newspapers but mouthpieces...but the authority members should know that oppressive states do not last,'' it added. </P>
<P> A PLO official said the editors were called in several times and warned against ``incitement and publishing false information about the Palestinian Authority, however they pursued their policy of spreading lies and inflaming the public with false accusations.'' </P>
