<P>  Haitian President Jean- Bertrand Aristide Wednesday asked President Clinton to visit American troops in Haiti, extending the invitation through National Security Adviser Anthony Lake. </P>
<P> ``We hope we may have the honor to have President Clinton coming soon to visit the troops in Haiti,'' Aristide told Lake at the beginning of a dinner party at the president's gleaming white home outside of Port-au-Prince. </P>
<P> Lake said he was certain Clinton would love to visit Haiti, but made no commitments about the president's possible plans. </P>
<P> Lake, on the first day of a two-day visit to Haiti, said he ``was moved by seeing people ... just living normal lives after all of the nightmare'' of three years of dictatorship. </P>
<P> Before they appeared before photographers and television crews, Lake, Aristide and the National Security Council staff director, Nancy Soderberg, met privately for 15 minutes. </P>
<P> Aristide's choice for prime minister, Smarck Michel, several members of his Cabinet and others were among the guests at the dinner, held in a dining room off the large, round living room in Aristide's freshly refurbished home. </P>
<P> The dining table was decorated with tropical flowers and small American and Haitian flags. </P>
