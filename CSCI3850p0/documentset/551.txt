<P>  A man accused of stalking pop star Madonna was ordered Tuesday to undergo psychiatric tests and to stand trial for allegedly trespassing on the singer's Hollywood estate. </P>
<P> Todd Lawrence was arrested July 19 after he allegedly scaled an eight-foot wall to get onto Madonna's property. He is charged with two counts of trespassing and one count each of battery and interfering with a peace officer. He remains jailed on $13,000 bail. </P>
<P> A security guard who detained Lawrence until police arrived told officers Lawrence claimed to be Madonna's husband, and was coming home. </P>
<P> Municipal Court Judge Michael Mink set a trial date for August 16, and said he would order a 72-hour psychiatric evaluation of Lawrence at the request of his public defender. </P>
<P> Lawrence said nothing during a brief court appearance Tuesday. He was not asked to make a plea in the case. His public defender, Denise Daniels, declined to answer reporters' questions outside the court. </P>
<P> Deputy City Attorney Ken Kambara said Lawrence faces 2 3/8 years in jail if convicted on all charges. </P>
<P> Madonna, 35, who claimed that Lawrence had stalked her, sought and received a temporary restraining order in Los Angeles Superior Court barring Lawrence from making contact with her. </P>
<P> A hearing is scheduled for August 8 to determine if the order should be made permanent. </P>
