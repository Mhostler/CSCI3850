<P>  The United States welcomed Turkey's announcement Tuesday that it was pulling out the bulk of its invasion force from northern Iraq and indicated it would like to see all the troops leave soon. </P>
<P> Turkey said it had withdrawn some 20,000 troops, leaving about 12,000 of the 35,000 who crossed the border March 20 to attack bases of the separatist PKK guerrilla group. But Prime Minister Tansu Ciller warned they could return if needed. </P>
<P> ``This is obviously a positive development,'' State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told a news briefing. </P>
<P> ``It is consistent with the assurances given to the President and the Secretary of State last week by Prime Minister Ciller that Turkey would meet its commitment that this incursion would be limited in scope and duration. </P>
<P> ``That's a very important assurance and we fully expect that this will be fully implemented in the near future.'' </P>
<P> The United States, bound to Ankara through the NATO alliance, initially looked sympathetically on the Turkish action but became increasingly reserved as the operation dragged on, reportedly causing civilian casualties. </P>
<P> ``We believe that Turkey has a right to try to cope with a very serious problem of terrorism that has emanated not only from northern Iraq but from within Turkey's own borders in the southeast region of its country and we support them in that effort,'' Burns said. </P>
<P> ``But as you know, we believe that their incursion into northern Iraq ought to have an end date.'' </P>
