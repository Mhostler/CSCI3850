<P>  Federal regulators announced Friday that broadcasters could sell time to politicians in the same time periods they sell to commercial buyers, opening the way, a consumers group said, to more ``sound-bite'' politics. </P>
<P> The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) made its ruling in response to a National Association of Broadcasters request for its policy on selling political candidates odd time lengths, such as five minutes. </P>
<P> In the ruling, the FCC said that stations had to make those sales if such five-minute slots had been sold in the past year to commercial advertisers. </P>
<P> Spots of 30 and 60 seconds and program-length slots of 30 and 60 minutes have regularly been sold to politicians. </P>
<P> Andy Schwartzman, spokesman for the Media Access Project, a public interest group, said stations sell few if any five-minute commercials, so the new FCC ruling will in effect, limit most candidates to 30- and 60-second comments. </P>
<P> He said, ``I think this is more encouragement for sound-bite politics and 'attack-ettes' -- more hype and less substance.'' </P>
