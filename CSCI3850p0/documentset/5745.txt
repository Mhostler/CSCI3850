<DATELINE>ZAGREB, Croatia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Rebel Muslims backed by Serb artillery are taking advantage of spring weather to mount an offensive in the Bosnian enclave of Bihac, U.N. observers say. </P>
<P> Militiamen loyal to rebel Muslim leader Fikret Abdic have launched a two-pronged assault south and east of the town of Velika Kladusa, their stronghold. </P>
<P> Bosnian government lines in the northwestern enclave have been pounded by more than 1,000 artillery shells since mid-week. </P>
<P> As many as 2,000 Serb troops from the breakaway Krajina enclave in adjacent Croatia may have entered the Bihac region with heavy artillery to bolster Abdic's ragtag infantry over the past few months, United Nations sources say. </P>
<P> ``Virtually the entire artillery effort is Serb. Combined Abdic-Krajina Serb forces are now trying to advance on two fronts -- Mala Kladusa on the road south of Velika Kladusa and Vrnograc to the east,'' said one source. </P>
<P> Lt. Col. Walt Natcynczyk, a U.N. force spokesman, said U.N. observers believed rebel forces had gained a few miles of ground toward Vrnograc this week, trying to ``pinch'' the town from the west and north. </P>
<P> Abdic's Velakton radio also claimed Friday that his forces had gained gound and inflicted heavy casualties on the Bosnian government 5th Corps. </P>
<P> ``We went through a quiet period but now the weather is getting a bit better and so (rebel) forces have stepped up the tempo of their push,'' Natcynczyk told Reuters. </P>
<P> U.N. observers spotted busloads of troops entering Velika Kladusa from Serb-held Croatia this week but their uniforms were tattered and lacked insignia so it was hard to tell whether they were Abdic Muslims or Krajina Serbs. </P>
<P> ``In any case, the 5th Corps had been anticipating this push and have dug a series of defensive positions in what is very hilly, broken terrain,'' said a U.N. source who asked not to be identified. </P>
<P> Abdic and Krajina Serb forces seized the northern end of the Bihac enclave -- about 10 to 15 percent of the total area -- after invading from Serb-held Croatia late last year. </P>
<P> Ringed by hostile Serb-held territory, Bihac stretches 35 miles from north to south and 15 miles from east to west. It has a mostly Muslim population of 180,000. </P>
