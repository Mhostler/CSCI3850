<P> (Eds: Tops with Panetta comments, grafs 1-5)  President Clinton's chief of staff accused Republican Senator Jesse Helms Sunday of recklessness for saying Clinton is not fit to be the U.S. military's commander in chief. </P>
<P> ``Well, they're certainly reckless,'' Leon Panetta said in a CNN interview of Helms' comments. ``They send terrible signals abroad to both our enemies and our allies about our ability to come together on foreign affairs issues.'' </P>
<P> Panetta said the comments by Helms, R-N.C., who is expected to be chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also send terrible signals to U.S. troops and, perhaps worst, he said, to children who learn to respect the office of U.S. president. </P>
<P> ``When we demean presidents, when we criticize them, when we try to tear them down, we don't just hurt the president we hurt this country,'' Panetta said. </P>
<P> Helms replied in a recent CNN interview when asked whether he thought Clinton was up to the job of commander in chief, ``No, I do not. And neither do the people in the armed forces.'' </P>
<P> Senate Majority Leader-to-be Bob Dole differed with Helms Sunday, saying Clinton is capable as commander-in-chief. </P>
<P> ``I must say, I had reservations early on,'' Dole said on ABC Television's ``This Week With David Brinkley'' program. </P>
<P> ``I think he's up to the job now,'' Dole said, adding, ``I'd prefer maybe somebody else in '96.'' Dole is expected to seek his party's Republican presidential nomination. </P>
<P> ``My view is that he is the commander-in-chief. I think he's done a little better in the last -- with Haiti, maybe with the Mideast,'' Dole said. ``I think he's doing better all the time.'' </P>
<P> But another party leader sided with Helms. </P>
<P> ``I think that Senator Helms is probably upset about the concessions that have been made to North Korea, the mess that Haiti is becoming, and of course the buyoff of the Haiti leaders, General Cedras and others ... and of course the long time that it took to lift the sanctions with regard to Bosnia,'' Utah Republican Orrin Hatch said on the CBS ``Face the Nation'' program. </P>
<P> When asked if he agreed with Helms' commander-in-chief comment, Hatch said, ``Well I wouldn't say that personally but I can see why Senator Helms may feel that way.'' </P>
<P> Hatch, who is expected to become chairman of the Judiciary Committee when the Republicans take control of Congress in January, added, ``He (Helms) takes a very strong position in foreign policy and he really does quite a good job. But I think we have to back whoever is president and do the very best we can to help him to do a good job...'' </P>
<P> Hatch said he had been ``very alarmed'' by some of the Clinton administration's foreign policies but he thought the president ``has been doing better in foreign policy over the last while.'' He did not elaborate. </P>
<P> Hatch said he expected Helms to ``keep the president on his toes,'' adding, ``I think the president, who will have to move to the center and not continue to cater to the far left of his party, ... I think the president will be better off, and I think he and Senator Helms will probably get a long a little better.'' </P>
<P> Democratic Sen. Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, appearing on the same program, said he thought it was particularly inappropriate for Helms, in his new high-profile role, to attack Clinton. </P>
<P> ``You can almost say this is coming close to aiding and abetting insubordination of the commander-in-chief,'' Dodd said. ``I think it is very, very reckless and I regret deeply that he said it. And I would hope he would apologize.'' </P>
<P> Dodd, who is campaigning to be minority leader in the new Senate, said other recent statements Helms had made, including suggestions about ending negotiations between Syria and Israel and about invading Cuba, were ``extreme positions.'' </P>
<P> ``I don't think this is what the American public expected on Tuesday (election day Nov. 8),'' Dodd added. </P>
<P> On plans by incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., for a vote by July 4 on a constitutional amendment to allow voluntary school prayer, Dodd said most members of Congress supported allowing school districts to have a moment of silence or reflection. ``But I think there is a real reluctance ... to amend any part of the Bill of Rights,'' Dodd said. </P>
<P> He and Hatch agreed the school prayer issue should not be a top priority for the new Congress. </P>
<P> ``I would prefer to solve the economic problems first ... but if a really good school prayer amendment is drafted of course i would support it,'' Hatch said. </P>
