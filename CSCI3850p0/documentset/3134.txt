<P>  In a surprise change of strategy, O.J. Simpson's defense team wants to skip lengthy hearings on DNA evidence in the double-murder case and proceed directly to opening trial statements, the Cable News Network reported Sunday night. </P>
<P> Citing sources close to the defense, CNN said the football legend's attorneys now believe it would be a waste of time to challenge the admissibility of DNA tests on blood stains because Judge Lance Ito has already signaled that he will allow the prosecution to introduce the results. </P>
<P> Simpson's all-star defense team, which has spent months preparing for a grueling round of hearings that were expected to last up to a month, could file a motion as early as Tuesday, CNN reported. </P>
<P> If the judge grants the request, opening arguments in what has been billed as the ``murder trial of the century'' could begin by early to mid-January -- barring any further delays. </P>
<P> Jury selection in the case was completed last Thursday, but most legal experts had predicted that the trial proceedings would not begin in earnest before February because of the scientific complexity of the hearings on DNA evidence. </P>
<P> Prosecutors hope to use DNA test results on blood samples and hair found at the crime scene and at Simpson's mansion in an effort to link him to the June 12 murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman. </P>
<P> Simpson has pleaded not guilty to charges that he stabbed the two to death outside his ex-wife's townhouse in Los Angeles' exclusive Brentwood section. </P>
<P> One source was cited as saying the decision on the DNA hearings finally fell to Simpson, who wants to get the trial proceedings underway as soon as possible. </P>
<P> By taking its challenges to DNA evidence directly to the jury instead of to Ito in hearings that would exclude the panel, Simpson's defense would not have to show its hand on the strategy it plans to employ. </P>
<P> Defense attorneys, who hammered out the change in strategy Saturay, also hope that by putting the trial on the fast track prosecutors might not have enough time to get all their test results back from the crime labs, CNN said. </P>
<P> But a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office was quoted as saying ``we're ready to go with what we have.'' </P>
<P> In addition, Simpson -- whose $10 million fortune has been decimated by the cost of retaining a virtual ``dream team'' of attorneys and experts -- would save $200,000 in legal fees, the network said. </P>
<P> Simpson's attorneys could not be reached for comment on the report. </P>
<P> Before openings arguments and testimony can get underway, a number of other issues have yet to be resolved. </P>
<P> Ito had ordered all jurors and alternates to be in court Monday to receive further instructions, presumably about how to avoid the avalanche of publicity surrounding the case. </P>
<P> Ito is also expected to hear arguments this week about possible juror misconduct, about the admissibility of evidence of violence in Simpson's marriage to his ex-wife and about jail conversations between Simpson and former football star Rosey Grier that were overheard by a guard. </P>
<P> The case will be in recess for the holidays from Dec. 23 through Jan. 3. </P>
