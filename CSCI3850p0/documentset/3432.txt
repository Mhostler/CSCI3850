<DATELINE>CHICAGO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  It was just a typical Bulls-Knicks game Sunday, a tense 107-104 overtime victory for Chicago that saw a buzzer-beater, a controversial ejection and Scottie Pippen in the thick of things as usual. </P>
<P> Pippen tied a season high with 36 points, including all seven of Chicago's points in overtime, and grabbed 16 rebounds as the Bulls handed the Knicks their fifth straight loss. </P>
<P> ``It was a great win,'' said Pippen, who played all 53 minutes. ``We didn't want to spoil our Christmas, just theirs.'' </P>
<P> New York's Hubert Davis, who last year made two game-winning free throws after a questionable foul call on Pippen in the Eastern Conference semifinals, sent the game into overtime with an improbable 3-pointer with four-tenths of a second left in regulation. </P>
<P> ``They made a great effort at the end of the game, which is typical of this New York team,'' Bulls coach Phil Jackson said. </P>
<P> The Bulls, who beat New York for just the second time in their last seven meetings, were facing the Knicks for the first time since being eliminated by New York in last year's playoffs. </P>
<P> Chicago, which won its second straight game after losing three in a row, won its fifth straight game on Christmas Day.  Patrick Ewing had 30 points and 13 rebounds before fouling out in the final seconds of regulation for the Knicks. </P>
<P> Toni Kukoc, who made a buzzer-beater in another playoff game last year as Pippen sat on the bench pouting because Jackson didn't call his number, had 25 points off the bench. </P>
<P> Kukoc hit one of two free throws with three seconds left in regulation, giving the Bulls a 100-97 lead. But New York's long desperation pass was batted by Chicago's Steve Kerr right into the hands of Davis, who hit the game-tying 3-pointer on the fly. </P>
<P> But Pippen took over in overtime as New York was just 2-of-10 from the field. Pippen blocked New York's last two shot attempts as the extra period expired. </P>
<P> Charles Oakley finished with 20 points, while Derek Harper and Charles Smith each had 12 for the Knicks. </P>
<P> New York's John Starks was ejected with 9:37 left in regulation for throwing the ball at Chicago's Pete Myers. </P>
<P> The Knicks' five-game losing streak is the longest in Riley's coaching career. </P>
<P> ``We're just caught in the throes of something right now,'' Riley said. ``We've had so many opportunities like this to win. We've been finding ways to lose. We'll bounce back.'' </P>
<P> In Denver, Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf scored 12 of his 23 points in the fourth quarter, including four during a 9-0 run midway through the period, as the Nuggets held on for a 105-96 victory over the Seattle SuperSonics. </P>
<P> Rodney Rogers added 22 points, Reggie Williams contributed 17 and Dikembe Mutombo had 15 points and 10 rebounds for Denver, which won for only the third time in its last eight games. </P>
<P> Detlef Schrempf and Kendall Gill each scored 21 points to lead Seattle, which had its four-game winning streak snapped and lost for just the third time in its last 14 games. </P>
<P> Shawn Kemp scored 10 points before fouling out with 8:04 to play for the Sonics, who were facing Denver for the first time since being upset by the Nuggets in the first round of last year's playoffs. </P>
<P> ``When you're playing against somebody with revenge on their minds, you can tell,'' Mutombo said. ``It's like a boxer, you can tell if they're trying to knock somebody out.'' </P>
<P> ``It was good to get this game over with because it's been on our minds since last year,'' said Schrempf. </P>
<P> Seattle, which fell to 0-10 on Christmas Day, was outrebounded 41-29, including 16-5 on the offensive glass. </P>
<P> ``We had spells where we didn't rebound like in the second period, the third where we didn't shoot and the fourth where we threw the ball away,'' Seattle coach George Karl said. </P>
<P> Gary Payton added 16 points for the Sonics, but was held scoreless in the fourth quarter. </P>
<P> Denver has won five straight home games against Seattle, including the playoffs. </P>
