<P>  People who suffer from migraine headaches are at higher risk of stroke, though more research is needed to determine how the ailments might be related, a study said Wednesday. </P>
<P> Using data from the Physicians' Health Study covering 22,071 male doctors in the United States, researchers at Brigham and Women's Hospital said those reporting migraine headaches had an 80 percent increased risk of suffering a stroke. </P>
<P> Of 1,479 physicians who reported having migraines, 1.3 percent had strokes. </P>
<P> ``The mechanisms by which migraine could cause an increased risk of stroke are unclear,'' researcher Julie Buring wrote in the Archives of Neurology, a medical journal published by the American Medical Association. </P>
<P> But she noted that previous studies have shown abnormal function of blood platelets in the brains of migraine sufferers, which might predispose them to blockages in blood flow that could result in stroke. </P>
