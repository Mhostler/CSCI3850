<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A U.S. advisory panel Tuesday endorsed federally funded research on human embryos outside the womb under strict guidelines. </P>
<P> The 19 ethicists and scientists presenting their report said they recognized the ethical and emotional complexities, but believed that such research could have profound benefits in understanding and eventually treating infertility, genetic diseases, birth defects and certain cancers. </P>
<P> ``It is acceptable public policy to fund this research subject to stringent guidelines,'' said panel co-chair Patricia King of Georgetown University Law Center. ``There are promises of benefits for couples, families and individuals.'' </P>
<P> Some religious and anti-abortion groups, which believe that life begins at conception, blasted the recommendations as immoral or even evil. The panel would only allow research on embryos for the first 14 days, but to its critics, that tiny cluster of undifferentiated cells is a human life. </P>
<P> This research would all involve tiny embryos in laboratories. They would not be implanted in a woman's uterus, and cannot develop long outside the womb. </P>
<P> It does not involve fetal tissue obtained through abortion, a separate but similarly controversial issue. </P>
<P> The panel's report is nonbinding but will play a central role as the National Institutes of Health works out a policy. </P>
<P> Embryo research, without any federal funding and of varying quality, is already widespread in private laboratories and clinics across America, NIH officials say. </P>
<P> The NIH Human Embryo Research panel, which issued its report after eight months of study, urged the NIH to set up a special ad hoc panel to keep monitoring the issue. </P>
<P> In most cases, the embryos would be ``spares'' from attempts at in-vitro fertilization, better known as test-tube babies. </P>
<P> For most research, scientists would have to draw from that ''surplus,'' with the explicit consent of the donors, and would not be permitted to harvest eggs from women specifically to create embryos for research purposes. </P>
<P> In limited cases, researchers would be allowed to start from unfertilized eggs and create research embryos. </P>
<P> Signaling that they did not want to make manufacturing embryos commonplace, the panelists wrote, ``Because the pre-implantation human embryo merits respect as a developing form of human life, the panel recommends that the deliberate fertilization for research be allowed only two conditions.'' </P>
<P> This would be allowed only if that was an integral part of the research, for instance a study of fertilization itself and related reproductive disorders. </P>
