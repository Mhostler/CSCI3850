<P>  Iranian security officials Tuesday discussed sealing their border with northern parts of Iraq and Turkey and measures to improve security in Iran's Kurdish-populated areas, Tehran Radio said. </P>
<P> It said a meeting of a top-level council on security in western Iran, chaired by Interior Minister Ali Mohammad Besharati, heard a report on improved security in the region. </P>
<P> ``In view of the presence of foreign forces in the Persian Gulf and the situation in northern Iraq, the need to mobilize all forces to establish better ... security and ... seriously seal the border was raised,'' it said without elaborating. </P>
<P> Tehran's Islamic government faces a low-intensity guerrilla war by Kurdish groups based mainly in Iraq. </P>
<P> The rebel Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan accused the government this month of destroying four villages along the Iraqi frontier and ordering residents in another 22 to leave as part of a plan to raze all Kurdish border villages. </P>
<P> The radio said the council was attended by governors of three Kurdish-populated provinces which share borders with Turkey and Iraq. </P>
<P> Iran and Turkey have agreed after a series of security meetings since 1992 to prevent opposition groups from operating in each other's territory. </P>
