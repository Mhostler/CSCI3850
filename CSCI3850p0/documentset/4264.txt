<P>  Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev Thursday described Russia's millitary intervention in Chechnya as a huge mistake that would cost the country dearly. </P>
<P> In an interview with BBC television, Gorbachev said he had warned Russian President Boris Yeltsin about the consequences of sending in troops and had offered to act as a mediator. </P>
<P> ``They've unleased terrible bloodshed, they've set the army against its own people, because these are our own people. They've sent untrained boys to fight, who don't know what war is,'' Gorbachev said. </P>
<P> ``It's a huge mistake. And it's going to cost us dear. Not just in economic terms but especially politically and morally. Those in power have put themselves in a corner.'' </P>
<P> Western nations have criticized Russia's military campaign to end Chechnya's bid for independence. Thousands of people have died since Russian troops were sent into Chechnya in December and human rights activists have accused them of gross violations. </P>
<P> Gorbachev, who during his seven years in power led the Soviet Union from communism to democracy, said the intervention was a great defeat for the Russian government. </P>
<P> ``They've lost in Russia, they've lost in the Caucasus, they've lost in the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States), they've lost in relations with the West.'' </P>
<P> Gorbachev, who heads a think tank in Moscow, added that instead of frightening rebellious regions the Russian government had encouraged them. Forces wanting to pull away from Moscow had already started to get together. </P>
<P> No one supported the military action, he argued, and even those who sympathized with the motivation of maintaining Russia's territorial integrity said it was not the best way to deal with the problem. </P>
