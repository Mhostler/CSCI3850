<P>  The Terminator has bought the 45-ton tank he drove as an army conscript and he's shipping it to the United States. </P>
<P> Defense Ministry officials in Vienna said Thursday Austrian-born actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, star of the ``Terminator'' movies, had snapped up the surplus U.S.-designed M 47 tank -- the very one he drove during his military service in 1966. </P>
<P> ``Schwarzenegger has not bought it to drive around his garden,'' said ministry spokesman Wolfgang Pucher, who declined to reveal the price tag. </P>
<P> Pucher said Schwarzenegger wants to site the tank outside one of the restaurants he jointly backs with two other screen tough guys, ``Rambo'' star Sylvester Stallone and ``Die Hard'' hero Bruce Willis. </P>
