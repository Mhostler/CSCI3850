<P>  A Lebanese prosecutor charged two Muslim guerrillas Wednesday with blowing up a statue of Jesus Christ in south Lebanon and demanded a life sentence with hard labor against the men. </P>
<P> An indictment said Judge Nasri Lahoud charged Ahmad al-Saadi and Shehadeh Jawhar -- both of whom remain at large -- with blowing up the statue at a cemetery in the southern port city of Sidon last August 21. </P>
<P> The two Palestinians, described as loyal to Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasser Arafat, blew up the statue ``to instigate sectarian strife, create a state of fear among people and bring the country back to the atmosphere of war,'' it said. </P>
<P> Lebanon's 15-year-long civil war ended in 1990. </P>
