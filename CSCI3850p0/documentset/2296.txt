<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Egyptian police Saturday arrested a Sudanese man for arranging sales of human kidneys from hard-up Sudanese men and women to wealthy Gulf Arabs, security sources said. </P>
<P> They said 36-year-old Habib Gamal al-Din forged letters from the Egyptian Doctors' Syndicate authorizing Cairo hospitals to remove kidneys from ``volunteer'' donors and give them to the ailing recipients. </P>
<P> In one operation, Gamal al-Din was paid about $3,000 by a Saudi Arabian woman. The Sudanese woman donor received just $600 for her kidney, the sources said. </P>
