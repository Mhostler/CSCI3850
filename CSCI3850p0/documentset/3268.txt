<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Liberia's security force has arrested an officer of the Armed Forces of Liberia militia in the hunt for gunmen who massacred 48 civilians -- more than half of them children -- in a Monrovia suburb. </P>
<P> An eyewitness in the city's Paynesville district said he saw security force Black Berets arrest a senior AFL officer Thursday shortly after uniformed men rampaged through the suburb, shooting, looting and setting fire to houses. </P>
<P> Meanwhile, a Ghanaian foreign ministry official told Reuters Friday in Ghana's capital Accra that leaders of all Liberia's seven warring factions had agreed to attend talks there Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``The Liberians are being given a last chance by Ghana to achieve peace for themselves,'' he said. </P>
<P> Ghana, chairman of the Economic Community of West African States, has given a warning it will pull its troops out of the ECOMOG African peacekeeping force if there is no progress by year's end. Wednesday it sent officials for consultations to Nigeria, which leads the force. </P>
<P> Thursday's slaughter prompted demonstrations in the city center later in the day during which angry Liberians paraded the charred and bloodied corpses of those who had been killed. </P>
<P> The killers' identity is so far unknown but several witnesses said they spoke the language of the Krahn tribe, which dominates the AFL, and appeared to have attacked from the direction of the militia's barracks in nearby Scheifflin. </P>
<P> An estimated 150,000 people have died in Liberia, a state set up by freed American slaves in 1847, as a result of the war launched by militia leader Charles Taylor on Christmas Eve 1989. </P>
<P> The Black Berets were set up by former civilian president Amos Sawyer as an elite, multi-tribal security force but disbanded after protest from the AFL, the former national army which was under nominal control of Sawyer's government. </P>
<P> The Berets were revived last September to track down AFL renegades under former general Charles Julue, who stormed government headquarters in a coup attempt. The coup collapsed 14 hours later when Julue's men fled an ECOMOG artillery barrage. </P>
<P> Witnesses said the Paynesville raiders were shouting that they intended to free Julue, currently on trial in nearby Fendell, and would destroy Monrovia if he remained in custody. </P>
<P> The witnesses said the killers, dressed in combat fatigues and wearing flak jackets, torched six houses with the occupants inside. Monrovia's pathologist said 28 of the victims were under 10 years old and many of the corpses were badly burned. </P>
