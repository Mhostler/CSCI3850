<DATELINE>PARIS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Jacques Delors's bombshell decision to duck out of the 1995 presidential race has handed the French Right victory on a plate, paving the way for it to monopolize all levers of power, political commentators said Monday. </P>
<P> ``Good-bye Delors, Ciao the Left, Hello Balladur-Chirac,'' headlined the daily Le Parisien after the Socialist European Commission President turned a deaf ear to left-wing pleas and announced Sunday he would not stand next spring. </P>
<P> Newspapers of both left and right paid tribute to the dignified nature of Delors' decision and stressed it played into the hands of the conservative presidential hopefuls Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and Gaullist leader Jacques Chirac. </P>
<P> ``If Mr. Delors has ruled himself out, it is for a strange reason which will surprise everyone: (he) has never been a power-seeker. He has too high an esteem for politics. He has never had it in his blood,'' the conservative daily Le Figaro said in an editorial. </P>
<P> ``Delors's non-candidacy is like a bucket of icy water on the heads of a band of agitated people. It gives dignity to politics,'' echoed the left-wing Liberation, hailing his decision not to bow to the opinion polls which had put him in the lead. </P>
<P> In an interview with French TF1 television Sunday night, Delors, 69, said personal concerns and political worries that he would be unable to carry out campaign promises had convinced him not to run. </P>
<P> The franc weakened after Delors's announcement, losing 70 centimes to trade at 3.4390 against the mark. </P>
<P> After weeks of feverish speculation, commentators wrote off the Left's chances in the April/May contest but cautioned against fuelling divisions in the right. </P>
<P> ``The right now has a clear road ahead and, unless something unexpected happens, a right-wing president will enter the Elysee Palace in 1995,'' Le Parisien said. </P>
<P> Socialist Party leader Henri Emmanuelli acknowledged on Monday that the Socialists, in opposition since they were trounced by the right in March 1993, had a tough few months ahead of them. </P>
<P> ``The left faces a difficult period. We have lost our best player and so we have a difficult match to play,'' he told France-Inter radio. </P>
<P> He announced an emergency party congress for January to seek a new savior to succeed Socialist President Francois Mitterrand in May, but prospects seem gloomy. </P>
<P> An opinion poll by TF1 showed 67 percent of voters reckoned Delors's renunciation meant a rightist would win the Elysee Palace. Other polls have shown no one on the Left has a chance. </P>
<P> But euphoria on the right was muted by fears that Delors's decision would aggravate fratricidal rivalries in the absence of another credible left-wing candidate. </P>
<P> ``The left has just lost its best chance of winning the election,'' said Patrick Devedjian, a Gaullist deputy and ally of Balladur. ``But we already have too many candidates. There is a risk that there will be even more.'' </P>
<P> Balladur's center-right coalition swept to power in March 1993 when voters dumped the Socialists, tainted by economic stagnation and corruption scandals. Mitterrand has since lived an uneasy ``cohabitation'' with Balladur. </P>
<P> The president can dissolve parliament in an emergency but the next legislative elections are not due until 1998. </P>
