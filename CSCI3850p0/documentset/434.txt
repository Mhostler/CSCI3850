<P>  Israel launched a U.S.-built missile boat Wednesday slated to be the navy's frontline warship into the next century, a military spokesman said. </P>
<P> The Eilat, the first of Israel's Saar 5-class fast missile corvettes, will carry a range of armaments including a helicopter, electronic warfare equipment and sophisticated surface-to-surface and anti-missile missiles. </P>
<P> The boat was produced by Ingalls Shipbuilding of Pascagoula, Mississippi, a subsidiary of Litton, and incorporates arms and electronic components from several Israeli companies. </P>
<P> The Eilat is the fourth Israeli vessel to bear the name. </P>
<P> The second, a converted British destroyer, served as Israel's flagship for 12 years until October 1967, when it was attacked and destroyed by the Egyptian navy. </P>
