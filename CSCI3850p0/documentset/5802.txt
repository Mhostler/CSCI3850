<P>  Canadian ships sailed home in triumph Monday from guarding fish stocks in the Northwest Atlantic after the European Union (EU) finally agreed to far-reaching conservation measures. </P>
<P> About 800 Newfoundlanders, hard hit by the decimation of once-lucrative fish stocks, greeted vessels of the Canadian Coast Guard and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans that had been patrolling the Grand Banks. </P>
<P> Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin could not resist a parting shot at the European Union (EU), against which he had mounted a six-week campaign of diplomatic and patrol-boat skirmishes to protect the turbot, or Greenland halibut. </P>
<P> ``Emma Bonino, the European Union's fisheries commissioner, called me an outlaw last week, but now we are in-laws,'' Tobin said as he welcomed the vessels after they steamed through a fog bank into a sunny St. John's harbor. </P>
<P> ``She said that she hopes Canada has learned a lesson. I think that Canada has learned a lesson and that is when you take a stand, stick by it.'' </P>
<P> Tobin said he hoped the fisheries agreement reached Saturday between the EU and Canada will be a significant step toward preserving fish stocks worldwide. </P>
<P> The Grand Banks off Newfoundland, where unemployment now runs over 20 percent, was once teeming with fish until it was largely ruined through Canadian and European overfishing in a virtually unregulated free-for-all. </P>
<P> Spain and Portugal are the main Europeans in the area, and their fishers are furious at the reduced catch and the inspection to be forced on them to try to prevent cheating. </P>
<P> But Tobin had warned that without conservation measures there would not be any fish left to catch. </P>
<P> Canada had seized the Spanish trawler Estai in international waters March 9, accusing it of overfishing, and a few weeks later it cut the expensive nets of another. </P>
<P> ``It was only when we took tougher action and took enforcement action that we really have seen results,'' Earle McCurdy, president of the local fisheries union, said in an interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corp (CBC). </P>
<P> The new agreement provides for the first time for independent observers to be on all fishing vessels in the area, as well as other inspection and conservation measures. </P>
<P> Some have questioned the independence of the observers, since they are to be appointed by the country where the trawlers originate, but said it was nonetheless a major step. </P>
<P> ``This is something for the whole world. The agreement might save a few fish stocks,'' said Willis Whyatt, a stocky 50-year-old fisherman from the north of the province. </P>
<P> Three Canadian vessels were heading back out to the Grand Banks Monday after a crew change. Spanish trawlers were fishing in the area under the new quotas allocated to them, a government official said. </P>
