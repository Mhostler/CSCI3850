<P> The families of Danny Applegate and Tommy Tyrving received letters dated late January in which the two wrote they were in good health and being treated well. </P>
<P> The two were abducted Dec. 14 by members of a Marxist guerrilla group while on their way to the Urra Hydroelectronic Power Project dam where they were employed by construction firm Skanska. </P>
<P> ``We have studied the letters and after comparison with other documents we can confirm that they are written by Danny and Tommy,'' Anders Herslow, Skanska administrative manager in Colombia said in a statement. </P>
<P> The letters reached the families in Monteria, Colombia, with assistance from the Catholic church, Skanska said. </P>
<P> The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) is also suspected in the kidnapping of an American engineer Jan. 19. At least a dozen Americans are held by the group and ransoms as high as $5 million have been demanded. </P>
<P> So far no price has been set for the Swedish engineers, but Sweden has said it would not pay. </P>
