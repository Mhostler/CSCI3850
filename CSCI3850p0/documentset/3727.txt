<DATELINE>MOSCOW (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Ultra-nationalist film-maker Alexander Nevzorov, the accursed bane of Russian liberals, is back on familiar ground. </P>
<P> Four years after he horrified democrats by glorifying Soviet troops who shot or crushed to death more than a dozen unarmed protesters in Lithuania, the leather-clad director has focused his lens on the bloody conflict in Chechnya. </P>
<P> The result was a 15-minute film called ``Ad'' (Hell), broadcast at prime time Wednesday evening by Commonwealth television, the most sympathetic of the major channels toward the Chechnya campaign. </P>
<P> Nevzorov's message is simple -- the ordinary Russian soldier is winning, despite stubborn Chechen opposition and criminal neglect by self-serving politicians. </P>
<P> Opposition to the war in Russia is widespread, but in Nevzorov's eyes it is nothing less than a holy crusade. </P>
<P> ``In this hell, in this fire and blood, something is being reborn, something which has always reverberated through the ages on Earth, in the underworld and among the angels in the heavens above -- the character of Russia and its greatness is being reborn again,'' he said. </P>
<P> The grainy film, punctuated by deafening bursts of solemn music, purported to follow one unit as it fought its way through the outskirts of the Chechen capital Grozny, which has been under fierce assault since New Year's Eve. </P>
<P> Machinegun fire tore chunks out of a two-story building, wounded soldiers groaned in agony as they lay bleeding in the mud, yet the troops still found the time to help a lame old woman walk through a courtyard to safety. </P>
<P> ``In the streets of Grozny, where you can be shot at from every window and the gunfire is wild, where trained specialists are burning our tanks like matches, these guys are riding on top of the armor rather than behind it, a sign of contempt for death and the enemy,'' he said in the film. </P>
<P> ``Yes, there are very few of them in our great Russia, the true dogs of war who know how to fight and die...the ones here can be counted on your fingers when we need 40,000 of them.'' </P>
<P> Nevzorov poured scorn on the politicians who he said had both denied the army much-needed cash and ignored the Chechen problem since the North Caucasus region declared independence in November 1991. </P>
<P> ``We are here for Russia. This is our land. I am a Cossack, my forefathers founded this town, and if necessary I will die here,'' said one soldier, dressed in a dirty tankman's cap. </P>
<P> ``If we give them Chechnya we will lose Russia,'' he said, his voice half-drowned by a fresh burst of violins. </P>
<P> Experienced Nevzorov watchers would not have been surprised. </P>
<P> The St. Petersburg journalist rose to prominence as host of of the wildly-popular ``600 Seconds'' television crime show, which ruthlessly bared the corruption, vice and crime gnawing away at Russia's second city. </P>
<P> But he badly tarnished his reputation after Soviet troops and tanks attacked the television tower in Vilnius in January 1991, killing at least 14 civilians. </P>
<P> Nevzorov's response was to produce ``Nashi'' (Ours), a short film which glorified the crackdown and insisted the three Baltic republics remain under Moscow's control. </P>
<P> The film showed soldiers alleging Lithuanians had thrown themselves under tanks and claiming they had been under constant Lithuanian sniper fire. </P>
<P> But the gloss faded when a member of the film crew later admitted some of the dramatic action scenes had been filmed the day after the attack. </P>
