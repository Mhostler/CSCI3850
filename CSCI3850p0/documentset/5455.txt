<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole accused President Clinton Tuesday of ignoring financial problems in the Medicare program and called for sharp reductions in future spending under the system. </P>
<P> Referring to a report issued Monday by Medicare trustees that estimated the federal health program for the elderly will run out of money by 2002, Dole accused Clinton of ``a complete abdication of responsibility'' for not proposing major reforms in his most recent budget. </P>
<P> ``The president wants to have it both ways and not do anything. He's out there bashing us (for suggesting cuts),'' Dole, R-Kan., told reporters. ``I think it's time for the president to become relevant in this process and join us.'' </P>
<P> Senate Finance Committee Chairman Bob Packwood, R-Ore., said Clinton had done ``zippo.'' He suggested Congress should cut the annual rate of growth in Medicare to 4-6 percent a year from the current level of 10 percent. </P>
<P> Packwood also said he supported forcing wealthy seniors to pay more for Medicare services and called for expanding the use of managed care programs to cut costs. </P>
<P> The Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund had been expected to run out of money in 2001. Monday's report by the trustees set that back by one year, to 2002, but stressed the need for reforms before the funds are depleted. </P>
<P> Clinton called for major changes in Medicare as part of his health reform plan that died in Congress last year. But the White House did not seek big reductions in the program this year, saying Medicare should be cut only in the context of broader health care reform. </P>
<P> Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala Monday called for health care reform that would include Medicare. </P>
<P> ``The condition of the (Medicare) Hospital Insurance Trust Fund illustrates again the need for reform of the health care system to reduce the rate of growth in spending,'' she said. </P>
<P> Congressional analysts Tuesday also cautioned lawmakers to use care in crafting proposals to give states control of the Medicaid program of health insurance for the poor, saying block grants could result in spending reductions. </P>
<P> House and Senate Republicans have been negotiating with a group of state governors who would like control over Medicaid, one of the fastest growing areas of the budget. </P>
<P> The General Accounting Office told the House Budget Committee that spending could be reduced under the program unless Congress required governors to continue allocating state funds under any block grants. </P>
<P> Congressional Budget Office Director June O'Neill said block grants would give the federal government much more control over spending under the program. </P>
