<P> Despite losing, Holmes gave a magnificent display of tricks, dirty and otherwise, throughout the fight. </P>
<P> He used elbows as sharp instruments to keep McCall off him, raked his gloves down McCall's face and constantly tied up his arms. And, of course, Holmes held onto the top rope several times until referee Richard Steele ordered him to let go. </P>
<P> Twice Holmes had to return to his corner to have his gloves re-tapped and once again when the referee ordered his corner to wipe grease from his face. Sometimes those things happen, but in a Holmes' fight, it is difficult to believe it was accidental. </P>
<P> ``Larry Holmes came to fight,'' McCall said. ``He fought his heart out.'' </P>
<P> McCall, who is nicknamed ``The Atomic Bull'', claims to throw ``atomic bombs, baby.'' </P>
<P> They were far from that, but certainly good enough to win, as McCall landed by far the harder punches. </P>
<P> McCall was clearly frustrated by Holmes' tactics, especially in the early rounds. </P>
<P> In the fifth round, a McCall left-right to the head sent Holmes reeling up against the ropes. But a few moments later the crafty veteran, resting against the ropes where he does some of his best counter-punching and covering up, waved McCall toward him. </P>
<P> McCall, however, did not come in and the bell rang. </P>
<P> McCall was circling away from Holmes in the sixth round, but Holmes caught up with him and landed two quick jabs and a right to the head that jarred McCall. Holmes won that round unanimously. </P>
<P> Holmes came out quickly in the seventh and eighth rounds and landed almost identical overhand rights to the head. McCall complained to the referee, saying ``He used his thumb.'' </P>
<P> Holmes won the eighth round on all judges' scorecards. </P>
<P> But Holmes was bleeding from the mouth by the ninth round when McCall pinned him in the corner and landed several hard punches, including a head-snapping left uppercut, followed by a right, left combination to the head. </P>
<P> McCall unanimously won that round, which was fairly typical of the rounds won by the champion. </P>
<P> Holmes tried to buy some extra time by staying on his stool after the bell rang for the 10th round, and then he was sent back to have the grease wiped off. </P>
<P> If Holmes stays retired, which is likely, he finishes with a 61-4 record. McCall is now 26-5. </P>
