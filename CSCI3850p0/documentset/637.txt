<P>  Dominican Republic President Joaquin Balaguer proposed Saturday that the nation hold new elections within two years, but the 87-year-old leader said he would not run for re-election. </P>
<P> ``We are proposing new elections, and I believe this has already the support of a grand part of public opinion,'' Balaguer said. </P>
<P> But Balaguer, 87, said in a news conference that for reasons of ``age and health'' he would not run for re-election in that contest. </P>
<P> The Dominican presidential election was held May 16, but no final result was announced until last Tuesday because of widespread allegations that Balaguer's narrow victory over Jose Francisco Pena Gomez was aided by fraud. </P>
<P> Balaguer Saturday also proposed some election reforms, though he reiterated that he believed there had been election ''irregularities,'' rather than fraud. </P>
<P> The Dominican vote was closely watched by the international community because of the nation's relationship with Haiti, which which it shares the Caribbean island Hispaniola. Smuggling over the two nations' long border is considered a major reason for the weakness of economic embargoes intended to oust Haiti's military-backed regime. </P>
<P> The Dominican Central Election Board's announcement Tuesday that Balaguer had defeated Pena Gomez by about one percent of the three million votes cast was condemned by the United States. </P>
<P> Balaguer, who is blind, hard of hearing and has difficulty walking, was seeking his seventh non-consecutive term as Dominican president. </P>
