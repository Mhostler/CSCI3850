<P>  Taiwan's Nationalist Party celebrated its 100th anniversary Thursday, fighting to keep its mandate in Taiwan 45 years after it lost mainland China. </P>
<P> ``Our party is once again facing a serious challenge. We feel the great responsibility of this deeply,'' President Lee Teng-hui said at a flag-raising ceremony. </P>
<P> One of the world's longest enduring parties, the Nationalists (KMT) are facing their biggest electoral test Dec. 3 at a time when the party's principles are being softened and blurred. </P>
<P> The party traces its roots back to Nov. 24, 1894, when the Nationalist Party founder, Sun Yat-sen, established a political grouping which later developed into the KMT. </P>
<P> In its heyday under the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek, the KMT ruled most of China. But in 1949, Chiang lost a civil war to Mao Tse-tung's communists and fled to Taiwan. </P>
<P> In the three decades that followed their island refuge became one of Asia's economic miracles. New riches spawned demands for greater freedoms and in the late 1980's the KMT softened its autocratic style. </P>
<P> ``What we face is an opposition which wants with all its heart to change the mandate of heaven, to change the state system in the Republic of China (Taiwan),'' Lee told a crowd in one of Taipei's central squares. </P>
<P> Flags fluttered in a breeze across the square as Lee's voice rose to a crescendo. </P>
<P> ``If there had not been a Nationalist Party, there could not have been a Republic of China,'' he said. Lee is also chairman of the Nationalist Party. </P>
<P> On Dec. 3 the electorate will for the first time choose the governor of the island, the highest position here ever to face popular election. </P>
<P> They will also elect the mayors of Taiwan's two biggest cities, Taipei and Kaohsiung, along with members of the provincial assembly and city councils. </P>
<P> ``Any election for us is a test, but this one of course is certainly by far the most important one,'' said Hansen Chien, director general of the KMT's Department of Cultural Affairs. </P>
<P> Chien said the party had changed in many ways since martial law was lifted in 1987, heralding an end to autocratic rule. </P>
<P> Under Chiang, Taiwan claimed to rule all China and vowed to re-take the mainland. In 1991, it renounced an ``administrative sovereignty'' over the mainland which, in reality, it never had. </P>
<P> Airlines banned from flying to the People's Republic of China directly also use a circuitous route through third territories or countries. </P>
<P> Even in telephone connections a facade is maintained. Calling China from Taiwan is instant but the lines go through Hong Kong. </P>
