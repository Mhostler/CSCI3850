<DATELINE>ULUNDI, South Africa (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  South Africa's Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party pulled out of the assembly drawing up the country's new constitution Saturday, but analysts said the move did not threaten the fledgling democracy. </P>
<P> Inkatha leader Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi told reporters his party -- the main black rival to the ruling African National Congress (ANC) -- would not accept the post-apartheid constitution if it was written before international mediation had taken place. </P>
<P> ``They can write their own constitution. We will not accept their constitution,'' Buthelezi said. </P>
<P> Buthelezi had given President Nelson Mandela's government until April 5 to call mediators to rule in a dispute over whether the constitution should give South Africa a federal or unitary system of government. </P>
<P> Inkatha wants strong powers for regional governments and the status of the Zulu monarchy entrenched in the constitution. </P>
<P> Buthelezi distrusts Mandela and Vice President F.W. de Klerk and believes he will get a better deal from international mediators. </P>
<P> Mandela and his coalition government, of which Inkatha is a junior partner, rejected the ultimatum. </P>
<P> Saturday's resolution by Inkatha's policy-making body said: ``... IFP members of the Constitutional Assembly shall suspend participation in the Constitutional Assembly and any of its sub-structures until the present crisis is resolved.'' </P>
<P> Political science professor Alexander Johnston said Inkatha's move posed no threat to the democratic process. </P>
<P> ``The fact that they are not going to recognise the constitution is a long-range warning shot that poses no threat for the time being,'' Johnston said. </P>
<P> Inkatha's announcement came as Mandela was starting a tour of Gulf states to boost ties with the oil-rich region and seek support for his reconstruction program. </P>
<P> Buthelezi led his party temporarily out of parliament on February 21 after accusing Mandela and de Klerk of reneging on a mediation agreement that drew Inkatha into last year's all-race elections at the last minute. </P>
<P> Mediators led by former U.S. secretary of state Henry Kissinger and ex-British foreign secretary Lord Carrington packed their bags and left before the elections when the South African leaders failed to agree on their mediation terms. </P>
<P> The Constitutional Assembly writing South Africa's definitive constitution is made up of the lower house of assembly and the senate sitting together. </P>
