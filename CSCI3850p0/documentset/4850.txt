<P>  Mexico's tough new economic plan breathed life into the country's battered financial markets Friday as investors said the government's program finally was on the right track. </P>
<P> The combination of massive spending cuts, higher taxes and tight money supply announced by Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz late Thursday was bitter medicine for Mexico's sick economy, but sweet music to a financial world disappointed by an earlier rescue plan. </P>
<P> The peso, which plunged to new lows Thursday, jumped 80 centavos to a buy-sell rate of 6.55/6.75 vs. the dollar, while the key index of the Mexican bolsa, or stock market, climbed 49.46 points to 1,590. </P>
<P> Traders said the peso also got a boost from market intervention by the Banco de Mexico in a drive to reach what Ortiz told reporters Friday was the government's goal of six pesos to the dollar. </P>
<P> The central bank drew $3 billion from a $20 billion U.S. aid package Friday and used some of the money to buy pesos, the government said. </P>
<P> The economic plan was a revision of one issued in January that investors universally derided as not tough enough. The new version, although warmly received by the markets, promises hard times for Mexico. </P>
<P> Ortiz said the economy would shrink 2 percent this year, government spending would be cut 9.8 percent, and the national sales tax would rise from the current 10 percent to 15 percent. He also said inflation would rise to 42 percent. </P>
<P> So steep will be the recession that the government said the country's current account deficit, a towering $28 billion at the end of 1994, would drop to $2 billion in 1995. </P>
<P> Still, analysts said it was necessary shock therapy for an economy that has collapsed since a pre-Christmas peso devaluation. </P>
<P> ``They are taking the medicine that needs to be taken now ... this is a good, solid, well-thought out plan,'' said Claudio Brocado, director of research at Valores Finamex. He said it would reduce Mexico's reliance on foreign money to finance its economy and make the country more competitive. </P>
<P> The bolsa's solid moves were a bit of a surprise since some analysts expected a short-term fall accompanying the peso's dramatic rise and the realization that Mexican companies were headed for a rough recessionary ride. </P>
<P> But investors seemed to agree with Ortiz, who said the next 90 days would be the hardest, followed by a second-half recovery. They were also relieved the plan did not include further tax hikes. </P>
<P> ``Although the plan is tough, everything which was feared and rumored about income taxes and other taxes finally didn't happen. That was a key point,'' said one trader. </P>
<P> Brocado said he was already recommending that investors get back into Mexican blue chip stocks like Telefonos de Mexico and some of the big banks while prices, driven down by weeks of uncertainty, were still low. </P>
<P> ``Right now there are compelling bargains,'' he said. </P>
<P> Despite the initial embrace of the plan, analysts said a central concern was the response of the Mexican people, who will bear the burden of the new austerity. </P>
<P> ``The main risk of the program is that it meets strong resistance, leading either to political or social instability or to another reversal in economic policy later in the year,'' said Barings analyst Damian Fraser. </P>
