<P> ``I agree with your proposal to start negotiations without any preconditions and to personally head a government delegation of the republic (for talks),'' Dudayev was quoted as saying in a telegram to Yeltsin sent at 9 p.m. (1 p.m. EST). </P>
<P> Dudayev also said he had ordered his forces to stop hostilities against Russian forces and to cease all Chechen troop movements in the breakaway region, where Russia sent troops on December 10 to crush its three-year independence bid. ``I am addressing you with the proposal for a similar step,'' the telegram said. </P>
<P> Russia's powerful Security Council had invited Dudayev to talks after a meeting Saturday in the hospital where Yeltsin is recovering from an operation to his nose. </P>
<P> But Chechen vice-president Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev said Dudayev had rejected the invitation for the talks in the North Ossetian town of Mozdok, which were scheduled for six p.m. (1000 EST). Dudayev's latest proposal for talks could not be confirmed independently. </P>
