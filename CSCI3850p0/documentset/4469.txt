<P>  Baseball fans who plan to cross the picket lines of striking major League ball players to watch replacement players may have to bring their own beer. </P>
<P> Teamsters Union President Ron Carey said Tuesday his members will not deliver, beer, soda and other refreshments to ball parks if it means they have to cross the players' picket lines. </P>
<P> ``We will honor the picket lines,'' Carey told reporters at the annual winter meeting of the AFL-CIO's Executive Council of which he is a member. </P>
<P> ``Anyone who crosses a picket line is a scab,'' he said. </P>
<P> Teamsters Union drivers normally make deliveries to 23 of the 26 major League ball parks, union officials said. </P>
<P> Basball owners and striking players held talks through special mediator W.J. Usery in Milwaukee Tuesday. </P>
<P> The White House has already said that President Clinton will not throw out the traditional first ball at the start of the season, which begins April 4, if the owners follow through on their threat to use replacement players. </P>
<P> The Clinton administration has tried unsuccessfully to bring about a settlement of the dispute. </P>
