<P>  PLO police have arrested five Palestinians for planting thousands of opium plants, in the biggest crackdown on drugs since Palestinians took control of the Gaza Strip last year, a police spokesman said Saturday. </P>
<P> ``We have arrested five people from the same family who planted 4,066 opium plants on land they own,'' the police spokesman said. The raid occurred Friday, he said. </P>
<P> ``This is the largest amount of drugs we have found yet in Gaza, and opium is as dangerous as cocaine and its effect on individuals is stronger than hashish or marijuana,'' he said. </P>
<P> The spokesman said the opium originated in Latin America and got into self-rule Gaza through Israel. </P>
<P> ``We have caught many drug dealers, but they are usually released on bail because the Palestinian police does not have forensic laboratories in which we could examine the drugs and thus implicate dealers,'' he told Reuters. </P>
<P> The spokesman said police had also arrested several chemists who sold drugs illegally to residents. </P>
<P> ``There's a strong trend among drug addicts to go to pharmacies to buy illegal drugs, and this is a dangerous thing, but here we also have a problem because we don't have centers to cure addicts,'' the spokesman said. </P>
<P> ``We are very worried that Gaza might become a center for drug trafficking because it is a border area,'' he said. ``Since we don't have the means to stop drug dealers, we are appealing to the United Nations to help us in this field.'' </P>
