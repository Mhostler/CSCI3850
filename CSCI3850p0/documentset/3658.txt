<P>  NATO Secretary-General Willy Claes urged Russia Monday to halt the violence against the Chechen people immediately and said Moscow was already feeling the heat of world protest over the bloodshed. </P>
<P> ``I had the feeling that they (the Russian authorities) were seriously impressed by the reactions coming from a lot of points in the world,'' Claes told reporters some hours after he met Deputy Foreign Minister Georgy Mamedov at NATO headquarters. </P>
<P> Claes was speaking after an address to a Belgian Catholic conference during which he appealed for a quick end to the fighting. </P>
<P> ``I am looking to the Russian authorities to decide without delay, not to say immediately, to end the violence against the Chechen people and to promote a peaceful settlement of the issue,'' he said in his speech. </P>
<P> Claes told reporters Mamedov had confirmed Russia's readiness to accept discussion of human rights issues arising from the Chechen conflict in the framework of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. But he repeated that other aspects of the problem were an internal matter for Russia. </P>
