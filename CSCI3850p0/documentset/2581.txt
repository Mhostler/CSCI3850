<P>  George Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev, who as leaders of the United States and former Soviet Union helped bury the Cold War, stole the show at an international brain-storming session for statesmen Sunday. </P>
<P> Bathed in a sea of television lights, the two leaders who presided over the fall of the Berlin wall and the re-unification of Germany embraced each other warmly at the gathering, in the Adriatic resort town of Rimini. </P>
<P> Bush, handed the 1994 ``Man of Peace'' award by the Pio Manzu Institute which organizes the annual event, praised Gorbachev, the last president of the Soviet Union before it fell apart. </P>
<P> ``It was a pleasure working with him,'' said the former Republican president. Gorbachev returned the compliment, saying that without Bush and his predecessor Ronald Reagan, East and West could not have ended to 45 years of tension. </P>
<P> During the conference, Gorbachev said the West should avoid closing itself off to the countries of the former Soviet block through the creation of large isolationist trading blocks. </P>
<P> He repeated calls for a European regional security system open to both the West and the former eastern block. </P>
<P> ``We are increasingly heading toward regional (security) systems and so we should create a European one,'' he said. </P>
<P> The ``Woman of Peace'' award went to Hanan Ashrawi, the commissioner-general for the Palestinian Independent Committee for citizens' rights. </P>
<P> Other figures attending the conference included Bush's national security adviser at the time, Brent Scowcroft, as well as John Hume, the leader of the moderately nationalist Social Democratic and Labor Party in Northern Ireland. </P>
