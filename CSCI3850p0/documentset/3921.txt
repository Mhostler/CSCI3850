<P>  Investigators probing the murder last year of Mexico's ruling party presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio have returned to the theory that the killing was a conspiracy, newspapers said Tuesday. </P>
<P> They reported that the special investigator in the case, Pablo Chapa, is convinced that two men shot Colosio at a campaign rally in the northern city of Tijuana last March 23. </P>
<P> Colosio was killed with a bullet to the brain and another to the abdomen. </P>
<P> The original chief investigator at first claimed a plot but then abandoned that theory to conclude that the confessed gunman, Mario Aburto, had not only fired both shots but also acted without support. </P>
<P> Although Aburto was late last year sentenced to 42 years in prison, few Mexicans believe he acted alone and Chapa pledged to fully review all evidence when he took over the case last month. </P>
<P> The newspapers La Jornada and El Economista, citing a source close to the investigation, said the two-gunmen theory is based on forensic reports, recent interviews with witnesses and photographs and videos taken at the time of the murder. </P>
<P> They did not name the other suspect but said investigators are focusing on two men who formed part of Colosio's security team. </P>
<P> In a separate development, Chapa's team presented the judge in the case with a detailed report Monday accusing another man, Tranquilino Sanchez, of blocking Colosio's closest bodyguards and opening a path for Aburto to move in, press his gun against the candidate's head and fire the fatal shot. </P>
<P> The state-owned newspaper El Nacional, which obtained a copy of the report, said it alleges that Sanchez violently pushed his way to Colosio's side and then made way for Aburto. </P>
<P> It said he met with the killer almost two weeks before the murder and was again seen talking with him at the rally. </P>
<P> Sanchez had also been hired to join the security detail for the Tijuana rally. </P>
<P> Colosio was the candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, and was virtually certain of victory in presidential elections last August. </P>
<P> While his death has inspired many conspiracy theories, most center on the power struggle inside the PRI between free-market technocrats and democratic modernizers on one side and old-style politicians on the other. </P>
