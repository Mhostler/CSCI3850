<P>  At least 200,000 Filipinos massed beside Manila Bay Saturday in an emotional outpouring of religious fervor to hear Pope John Paul say Mass. </P>
<P> Long before dawn, the crowds began streaming into the area carrying food and mats to secure a spot where they could get a glimpse of the 74-year-old pontiff. </P>
<P> The pope, who arrived Thursday at the start of a four-nation Asia-Pacific pilgrimage, was to celebrate Mass to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the founding of the formal Roman Catholic hierachy in the Philippines. </P>
<P> ``This is the joy of the Filipino faith,'' said Father Bong Guerrero as he rehearsed the crowd on how to welcome the pope when he arrived. ``When he comes let us shout, 'JP Two we love you'.'' </P>
<P> Jean Lee Lucero, 16, said she came to pray to God that one day she would be able to walk again. ``That is my prayer for today for myself. For the country I will pray for peace,'' she said, sitting in a wheelchair as a friend pushed her through the throng. </P>
<P> Lucero said she was crippled after being given an overdose of drugs when she fell victim to polio as a child. </P>
<P> The Mass is the high point of the four-day visit for ordinary Filipinos. Another huge outdoors Mass for World Youth Day will be celebrated Sunday before the pope leaves for Papua New Guinea Monday. </P>
<P> This is the toughest working day for the 74-year-old pontiff who has been in ill health for months. </P>
<P> Apart from the Mass, he is to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Catholic Radio Veritas Asia, speak to Philippine bishops and join youth from all over the world for a night vigil before Sunday's Youth Day. </P>
<P> The pope was forced to cancel several trips last year and now walks with difficulty since surgery on his right leg last April. </P>
<P> But after a hesitant arrival following a long flight from Rome, the pope seems to have been energized by the rapturous welcome he received and showed little sign of ill health Friday. </P>
<P> Officials said he ignored elevators installed at the Malacanang presidential palace and walked up a long flight of stairs to meet President Fidel Ramos. </P>
<P> In the evening, drawn onto a balcony of the Apostolic Nunciature where he is staying by serenading choirs and chants of ``We love you,'' he stood and listened fondly to the singing. </P>
<P> ``Filipinos have marvelous voices,'' he told the singers. </P>
<P> Officials quoted the 74-year-old John Paul as calling ``unique'' his reception in the Philippines, the first stop in a four-nation tour that will also take him to Papua New Guinea, Australia and Sri Lanka. </P>
<P> More than a million people turned out to welcome him on Wednesday and crowds continued to pack the streets as he traveled from event to event, erupting in cheers as he waved at them from inside his armored ``popemobile.'' </P>
