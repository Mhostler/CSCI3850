<DATELINE>SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  U.N. peacekeepers said Wednesday Bosnian Serb forces were closing in on the Muslim town of Bihac as the Muslim-led Bosnian army struggled to halt the Serb advance. </P>
<P> U.S. officials said NATO was considering a ban on heavy weapons in the area to protect civilians threatened by the Serb onslaught in northwest Bosnia. </P>
<P> The Bosnian Serb army was steadily advancing from the east and southeast toward Bihac town as fighting raged on high ground above the town, a U.N. spokesman in Zagreb said. </P>
<P> U.N. peacekeepers in the area reported Tuesday heavy artillery fire southeast of Bihac and that the Serbs were gaining territory from the south at a pace of about one mile a day. </P>
<P> ``The BiH (Bosnian government army) is holding isolated pockets but that is considered normal in the case of a rapid advance, U.N. spokesman Col. Tim Spicer told Reuters. ``Their resistance is not considered militarily significant.'' </P>
<P> Spicer said it was still unclear who held the high ground east of town, known as Grabez plateau. </P>
<P> BSA chief of staff Gen. Manojlo Milovaniovic, commander of the Bihac operations, said his men were in control of the Grabez and Grmusa plateaux and were only three miles from Bihac, the Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA said. </P>
<P> The Muslim 5th Corps took the Serbs by surprise two weeks ago when it launched an attack that captured 95 square miles of territory. The better armed Serbs, who control 70 percent of Bosnia after 31 months of war, have since recovered much of the lost ground. </P>
<P> NATO is considering establishing a heavy weapons-exclusion zone around Bihac town, which is a U.N.-declared ``safe area,'' the U.S. Defense Department said Tuesday. </P>
<P> U.S. officials said privately the United States had raised the issue and that the allies, at a meeting Tuesday of NATO ambassadors in Brussels, agreed to look into the proposal. </P>
<P> An exclusion zone would allow the use of allied air power to prevent Serb forces from overrunning Bihac. </P>
<P> But U.S. officials expressed pessimism about the prospects of getting Bihac town declared a no-weapons zone, saying European nations were likely to object that ground troops and not just air power would be needed. </P>
<P> Fighting gripped Bosnia elswehere with heavy shelling reported Tuesday in the Muslim towns of Tuzla and Kladanj. Several artillery or mortar shells hit Tuzla town in northern Bosnia Tuesday, killing at least one civilian. </P>
<P> Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic called the battle for Bihac a ``real drama.'' </P>
<P> ``We will see who is going to come out as the winner. If we manage to resist, the Serbs will never try anything similar again,'' he was quoted by Sarajevo radio as saying. </P>
<P> The United Nations said Serbs from the breakaway Krajina region of neighboring Croatia were shelling the Muslims in support of their fellow Serbs in Bosnia, but there was no sign that Krajina ground troops had entered Bosnia. </P>
<P> U.S. ambassador to Croatia Peter Galbraith said his government was ``very concerned about the situation in Bihac'' and especially about the role of Krajina Serbs in the fighting. </P>
<P> ``Bihac is a U.N. safe area and any effort that has as its goal the seizure of Bihac town or taking the Bihac pocket would have enormous humanitarian consequences and very, very serious political and military consequences,'' he said. </P>
<P> The entry of rebel Muslims into the zone to fight alongside the Serbs was bound to confuse matters even more. </P>
<P> A large force of Muslim rebels was being equipped by their leader Fikret Abdic, ousted from the enclave three months ago with some 30,000 followers, to join in the Serb onslaught on Bihac, the United Nations said. </P>
<P> ``Our estimate is that Mr Abdic is presently mobilizing a force of at least 5,000 from refugee camps,'' U.N. spokesman Michael Williams told a news conference. </P>
<P> The U.N. said a humanitarian crisis threatened thousands of civilians in the Bihac pocket because of a months-old Serb blockade. Basic supplies are so scarce in Bihac that the sick and injured must provide their own fuel if they want to be driven to hospital, a U.N. aid official said. </P>
