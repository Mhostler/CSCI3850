<P>  The shadowy founder and spiritual leader of the sex-for-salvation Children of God, a sect said to promote indiscriminate sex in the name of Jesus, has died at age 75, the group said Thursday in a statement. </P>
<P> David Brandt Berg, known to his followers as Chairman Mo, was believed to have died earlier this month, Jason Spain, a local organizer for the group said in a telephone interview. </P>
<P> Spain, a supervisor in Washington, D.C., said group members had been told about Berg's death earlier this week, but that it had taken place earlier this month. </P>
<P> Berg was believed to have been in hiding after Argentine authorities asked Interpol last September to track down and detain him for inciting child abuse and other crimes. Other sources said he was hiding in Japan. </P>
<P> Berg founded the Children of God in 1968 among former drug addicts and hippies in Huntington Beach, Calif., and built it up into an international sect claiming some 9,000 full-time members in 43 countries. </P>
<P> According to the Cult Awareness Network, which monitors such groups, the group's adult members and its children sleep with each other indiscriminately, believing that salvation comes through sexuality. </P>
<P> The group did not say when or where Berg had died. </P>
<P> Spain said Berg's death ``will not deter our movement''. </P>
<P> He said group members believed Berg was being persecuted by ``a great anti-Christian movement''. </P>
<P> ``He castigated rulers and those who propagated their ungodly personal agendas. So he got bad press, and his name was slandered,'' he said. ``But we believe that all who live in godliness will suffer persecution.'' </P>
<P> Cult awareness experts said Berg, a dissident Pentecostal Christian missionary, preached sex for salvation and prostitution as a way to raise funds and win over followers. </P>
<P> They said the Children of God, also known as the Family, continued the practice of sexual evangelism and had used minors to attract converts. </P>
<P> The religious group said in a statement Thursday that in the 1970s and 1980s Berg encouraged his followers to engage in a form of ``sexual evangelism'' known as ``Flirty Fishing.'' </P>
<P> It said that although it had discontinued the practice in 1987, Berg's ``teachings on sexual freedom resulted in a degree of notoriety for him and his followers.'' </P>
<P> Last September, Argentine authorities took 300 minors and 30 adults from the group into custody. Among those held and subsequently released were children from Ireland, Norway, Greece, France, Britain, Canada, and the United States. </P>
<P> Similar police actions against the Family and the Children of God also took place in France, Spain and Australia. </P>
<P> One group organizer told Reuters the group would now be led by Berg's wife, known only as Maria or ``Mama.'' </P>
