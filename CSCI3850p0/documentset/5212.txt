<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Firing automatic weapons at police and prison guards, about 1,600 inmates began a riot during visitor's hours at a southwestern Colombian prison early Sunday. </P>
<P> The Caracol radio network said the inmates had taken partial control of the Villahermosa District Prison despite efforts by police to quell the riot with tear gas and water cannons. </P>
<P> It also said no deaths had been reported but a few inmates were said to have been injured. </P>
<P> The network said two inmates armed with automatic weapons were firing at police and prison guards trying to get near the prison, located in Cali, about 180 miles southwest of Bogota. </P>
<P> Others were tearing at the roofs of two patios and wrapping wet rags and towels around their heads to protect themselves from the effects of the tear gas, it said. </P>
<P> ``The situation is difficult,'' a prison guard told the network. </P>
<P> During the interview, bursts of gunfire were heard amid frantic screams. </P>
<P> ``Help us please!'' cried one woman, who was visiting the prison when the riot broke out. </P>
<P> Another woman told the network many visitors were caught inside the prison and inmates were destroying whatever they could get their hands on. </P>
<P> ``The prisoners are breaking walls and security bars,'' she said. </P>
<P> The network said soldiers had begun to arrive at the prison. A police spokesman declined to comment until he had more information on the riot. </P>
