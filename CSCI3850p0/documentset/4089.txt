<DATELINE>ROME (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  He may have invited the cream of Roman high society, but fashion designer Prince Egon von Furstenberg made one thing clear at his haute couture show on Wednesday -- when it comes to selling clothes, he is no snob. </P>
<P> Von Furstenberg, nephew of Fiat chairman Gianni Agnelli and scion of a noble Austro-German family, showed off an unusually low-priced collection in soothing pastels at Rome's spring and summer 1995 fashion shows. </P>
<P> ``I have bills to pay -- like rent, electricity and gas -- so I have to make money,'' von Furstenberg told Reuters backstage. ``I really believe that haute couture cannot be fantasy alone -- the designer has to make money too.'' </P>
<P> Haute couture clothing, the most expensive in the world, is made by hand from only the most luxurious fabrics and is fashioned to fit the client. </P>
<P> Depending on fabrics and the work involved, the price tag can range from about $8,000 to hundreds of thousands of dollars. </P>
<P> Compared to most haute couture, von Furstenberg's clothes are a steal. </P>
<P> His simple pastel pink or green suits -- some of which had small white pearls sewn in swirls around the waist -- have a price tag between $625 and $750. </P>
<P> His evening wear costs between $1,250- $3,100. </P>
<P> Most designers consider haute couture a ``laboratory'' where they can experiment with new methods and materials. Almost all know from the start that some designs will be too extravagant for the world's 3,000 or so haute couture customers to wear. </P>
<P> Von Furstenberg said he knows exactly what will sell. ``I design for my clients. I know they need to go to weddings and embassy receptions and what suit will be appropriate,'' he said. </P>
<P> His clients, who include many of Rome's contessas and principessas, said the collection would sell in a snap. </P>
<P> ``This collection appeals not only to Egon's traditional customers, but to their daughters too,'' said one woman who attended the show. </P>
<P> Some industry watchers have criticized von Furstenberg for ``cheapening'' Rome's world of haute couture with his low prices. </P>
<P></P>
<P> ``There are only a few very good designers left in Rome and he is one of them. Why should it matter if he sells his clothes for less? That is no reflection on their quality.'' </P>
<P> Von Furstenberg sent his models down the catwalk in navy blue and white silk mini-dresses, black silk dresses with white collars and sand-coloured suits with curlicues of small white beads around the waist. </P>
<P> For evening, there were short, swingy pink trapeze dresses in silk chiffon with sparkling beads and sequins stitched in rows down the front. </P>
<P> Pastel pink or green evening gowns were studded with pink, lavender, yellow and green beaded swirls, vines and flowers. </P>
