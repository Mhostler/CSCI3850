<DATELINE>MOSCOW (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Russian President Boris Yeltsin ordered a halt to bombing raids on the Chechen capital Grozny but faced fresh criticism Thursday over a five-day assault which has failed to seize the city from rebel fighters. </P>
<P> There were no early reports of the situation in Grozny. Officials in the city, which was held by Chechen rebels Wednesday, could not be reached for comment. </P>
<P> Reuter reporter Derek Thomson witnessed only light shelling of the villages of Assinovka and Arshty on Chechnya's western border with the Ingushetia region Thursday morning. He also saw a column of 12 armored vehicles heading toward Grozny. </P>
<P> Liberal Russian newspapers, most of them appearing for the first time since the assault began because of the New Year's holiday, lambasted the country's leaders and the army for their handling of the operation to smash Chechnya's independence bid. </P>
<P> ``In the Chechen crisis, the Russian authorities have shown their inability to see the immediate consequences even one or two moves ahead,'' the daily Izvestia said, likening Russia's leaders to bad chess players. </P>
<P> ``There is no power left, no truth and no president,'' the daily Komsomolskaya Pravda wrote in a banner headline above a montage photograph of Yeltsin toasting the nation on New Year over the bodies of dead Russian soldiers. </P>
<P> The newspapers appeared to have been put together before Yeltsin halted bombing, but indicated the depth of opposition to force in Chechnya. </P>
<P> France said Thursday Russia had a right to defend its territorial integrity, but it criticized the use until now of planes and tanks, reflecting growing concern abroad. </P>
<P> ``Russian leaders must understand that attacking civilians with planes and tanks when the balance of forces is 100 to one is not part of the European democratic model,'' European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure said on France-Inter radio. </P>
<P> Yeltsin sent troops and tanks to the tiny region in southern Russia Dec. 11 to ensure it remained part of the giant Russian Federation. Warplanes have bombed Grozny frequently in the last month, killing civilians and arousing fierce criticism. </P>
<P> The death toll rose sharply after Russia launched a tank-led assault on Grozny Saturday. It has so far been repulsed. </P>
<P> Yeltsin's press service said he decided to halt bombing of Grozny after hearing reports from ministers, politicians and ordinary citizens. The move was ``based on his aim of preventing further deaths among the civilian population.'' </P>
<P> Yeltsin's chief spokesman, Vyacheslav Kostikov, said Wednesday the president was upset at the hostile reaction to his deployment of tank columns to oust separatist leader Dzhokhar Dudayev in the mainly Muslim region of about one million people. </P>
<P> ``Boris Nikolayevich was not ready for such a reception. I know that he is very deeply upset by this ...'' Kostikov told independent NTV television. </P>
<P> He said the army could have stormed Grozny if it had wanted and that, to preserve morale, there would be no dismissals among the military pending completion of the Chechen operation. </P>
<P> Other Yeltsin allies predicted Russian forces would take Grozny within a day or two at the most. </P>
<P> Deputy Prime Minister Nikolai Yegorov, who is coordinating the Russian military operation, told Moscow Ostankino television that Grozny would fall ``without a fight'' Thursday or Friday. </P>
<P> Itar-Tass news agency quoted well-informed sources as saying Yegorov was due to go to Grozny Thursday in an armored vehicle for the ``working day.'' It gave no details. </P>
<P> Russian officials said opponents of Dudayev would go to Grozny Thursday to prepare to take over from the separatist leader, believed to be hiding in a bunker near the capital. </P>
<P> Western countries have watched uneasily as carnage from the Russian advance and bombing flashed across television screens. </P>
<P> In Washington, the State Department urged Russia to ask the European security organization to help end the conflict. Iran has said the fighting could hurt Moscow's ties with the Islamic world. </P>
<P> Russia's migration service said the crisis had created 130,000 refugees. Turkish officials said Thursday a military cargo plane left Ankara with 11 tons of humanitarian aid to civilians uprooted by the fighting. </P>
