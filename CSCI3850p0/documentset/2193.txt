<P>  An oil tanker captain whose vessel was intercepted in the Gulf on suspicion of violating U.N. sanctions admitted Monday he had loaded diesel fuel in Iraq for export in violation of the embargo. </P>
<P> Izzat Abdulhadi Khalifa, master of the Al Mahrousa, told a news conference he had loaded 3,162 tons of diesel oil in the Iraqi port of Zubayr between Oct. 16 and 19 and then sailed south, away from Iraq, into international waters. </P>
<P> Asked if he knew that he had broken the embargo, Izzat, an Egyptian, replied in English: ``I knew all that, but what could I do at that time. All the people (the crew) knew.'' </P>
<P> But he insisted when he left Dubai on Oct. 11 at the beginning of the voyage he did not know he would be ordered to go to Iraq. </P>
<P> He said he was told by his charterer that he would be heading to the Iranian port of Abadan. </P>
<P> But when he anchored in international waters in the northern Gulf on Oct. 14, he received new instructions from an Iraqi agent of his charterer. </P>
<P> He said the agent, whom he named as Nassar Yacoub, came to his vessel in a tug and came on board to deliver the orders. </P>
<P> Some crew members told Reuters that the location where they had anchored in the Gulf indicated to them that a prior intention existed to go to Iraq. </P>
<P> A U.S. warship, part of a four-year-old ship monitoring operation, stopped the Honduran-flagged tanker in international waters in the northern Gulf Saturday. </P>
<P> U.S. Navy and Coast Guard personnel boarded it to check whether it was violating the U.N. oil embargo imposed on Iraq over its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. </P>
<P> The U.S. Navy transferred the vessel into the custody of the Kuwaiti navy and coast guard Saturday. The Kuwaitis escorted the vessel to Shuaiba port south of Kuwait City on Sunday for further investigation. </P>
<P> At the news conference held aboard the vessel Izzat said, ``My instruction from the charter, after loading, was to go to (Siri) island off Dubai and to wait for new instructions (as to) where I should discharge this cargo.'' </P>
<P> The boarding was the second in 10 days and occurred amid heightened tension in the Gulf region as a result of Iraq massing troops near the Kuwaiti border early in October. </P>
