<P>  Jose Francisco Pea Gomez, leader of the Dominican Republic's opposition Dominican Revolutionary Party, traveled to Cleveland, Ohio, this week for medical treatment, his doctors said Friday. </P>
<P> Pea Gomez, 58, narrowly lost this year's Dominican presidential election to incumbent Joaquin Balaguer in an election clouded by allegations of fraud. </P>
<P> William Jana, Pea Gomez's physician, said he was being treated for an ulcer and recently detected cancerous cells in his stomach. He said Pea Gomez was expected to remain in the United States for two weeks. </P>
<P> Jana said that Pea Gomez was not gravely ill and had responded to treatment since his problems were discovered during a visit to Caracas last week. </P>
<P> Pea Gomez is expected to run for the presidency again in elections scheduled for May 16, 1996. If elected, he would be the nation's first black president. </P>
