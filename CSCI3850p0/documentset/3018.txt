<DATELINE>LONDON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Queen Elizabeth has given a Canadian oilman the go-ahead to drill in the grounds of Windsor Castle for what could be a giant oil bonanza for Britain. </P>
<P> The monarch, plagued by family splits and income tax demands from the government, will not earn a penny from the venture but at least her view from the Norman landmark won't be spoiled. </P>
<P> Oilman Desmond Oswald has promised not to turn her back garden into a 1920s-style oil field studded with derricks. </P>
<P> Oswald told Reuters Tuesday up to 100 million barrels of oil could be found. ``That is a very large structure. It is one of the biggest onshore.'' </P>
<P> A spokesman for Buckingham Palace confirmed: ``Permission for exploration to take place is required because it is Crown Estate Land and that was given.'' </P>
<P> Oswald, managing director of Canuk Exploration Ltd, said: ``We will be about half a kilometre (0.3 mile)) from the castle in the grounds. We hope to start drilling next summer.'' </P>
<P> He stressed that the site, with drilling to a depth of 984 feet, was purely exploratory and would not affect the beautiful parkland around the castle. </P>
<P> ``We would drill the well, the site would be abandoned and then returned to its original condition. We would then look to digging a directional well from a less sensitive area.'' </P>
<P> Windsor mayor Dennis Outwin, fearful of what could happen to one of the most enduring symbols of Britain, said: ``I don't believe you can get 100 million barrels of oil just through a small pipeline. It's bound to lead to Windsor Great Park being turned almost into a second Dallas.'' </P>
<P> ``I feel the Queen, whom I greatly admire and who has never put a foot wrong since she ascended to the throne, has for the first time made a bad mistake, or she's been badly advised.'' </P>
<P> Oswald dismissed nightmare visions of Windsor echoing to the constant pump of oil rigs and gas burnoffs lighting up the night sky around the national monument. </P>
<P> ``People are talking about Dallas in the 1920s when everything was wild. With this, there is no smell, nothing to be seen,'' he said. </P>
<P> Some oil analysts described his estimate of 100 million barrels as optimistic. But Oswald, a geologist with 40 years experience, said: ``The rocks round Windsor look attractive.'' </P>
<P> The biggest onshore oil field in Britain is Wytch Farm in a protected rural area of Dorset in southern England. It has 350 million barrels of reserves and produced 98,000 barrels per day in September. Offshore fields from Britain's huge finds in the North Sea produced 2,489,000 barrels a day. </P>
<P> Windsor Castle, the queen's favorite royal home, was ravaged by a fire two years ago and repairs will cost up to $93.57 million. </P>
<P> Royalties from the oil field would not go to the monarch but to the Treasury. ``The Queen would not benefit from it. The money would go to the government,'' the palace spokesman said. </P>
