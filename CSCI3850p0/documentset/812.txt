<P>  Canada said Tuesday it will preserve the world's biggest coastal temperate rain forest by setting aside a vast area on its Pacific coast. </P>
<P> The province of British Columbia said it would preserve the Kitlope Valley, a 783,000-acre mountainous area that boasts massive 800-year-old trees. The area -- roughly the size of the U.S. state of Rhode Island -- is about 875 miles north of Vancouver. </P>
<P> ``This decision forever protects the Kitlope, one of the world's great natural and cultural treasures. It ensures that this unique rain forest ... will never be logged,'' said provincial premier Mike Harcourt. </P>
<P> Temperate rain forests, which are rarer than their tropical counterparts, used to blanket North America's west coast and parts of Russia, Europe and Asia but have now mostly been cut. </P>
<P> The Kitlope dwarfs all other remaining temperate coastal rain forests, most of which have been marred by logging and road-building, environmentalists said. </P>
<P> The Kitlope has survived intact largely because it is inacessible. The decision by a timber company to relinquish its rights to fell the trees paved the way for the area to be set aside. </P>
<P> Environmentalists hailed the move. ``Protecting this area creates a wilderness heritage site of a truly world-class standard,'' said Ric Careless of the World Wildlife Fund. </P>
<P> Harcourt called for a worldwide effort to protect temperate rainforests. </P>
