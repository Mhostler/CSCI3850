<P>  At least two Beijing sex shops have closed for lack of interest, the Beijing Youth Daily newspaper said Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``Selling sex commodities is not like other products,'' it quoted Wen Jingfeng, manager of Beijing's most successful sex shop, as warning his competitors. </P>
<P> The Beijing East Loving Spirit Health Care center appeared to have fallen into that trap and has closed, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> Business at the store, which opened early last year, had never been brisk. But toward the end of 1994 local residents reported that hardly anyone entered the shop and it closed its doors, it said. </P>
<P> The Haidege Health Care Center, selling similar sex items, including contraceptives and various sex aids, appeared to have also stopped business, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> China has about 200 sex shops, with 10 in Beijing, the newspaper said. </P>
