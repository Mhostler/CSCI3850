<P>  Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani will not step down next Tuesday -- the deadline set by the United Nations -- as no mechanism exists for a transfer of power, a spokesman for Rabbani said Saturday. </P>
<P> U.N. special envoy Mahmoud Mestiri has set March 21, the Afghan new year, for Rabbani to hand over power to an interim council but he concedes there could be a delay of a few days. </P>
<P> ``He will not step down on March 21 because the mechanism is not ready,'' Rabbani's spokesman Masood Khalili told Reuters in Pakistan. </P>
<P> ``We should not go calendar-wise, we should go process-wise,'' he said. </P>
<P> Rabbani, whose self-extended term expired Dec. 28, had been due to hand over power to a U.N.-proposed interim council in February. </P>
<P> The timetable was upset by the spectacular defeat of main opposition leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar by the Taleban student militia, after which Mestiri set a new deadline of March 21. </P>
<P> Rabbani, who was in Islamabad earlier this week to attend a summit meeting of the 10-nation Economic Cooperation Organization, told a news conference Thursday that he was waiting for a ``reliable and objective mechanism.'' </P>
<P> Khalili said the president had agreed to a new U.N. formula, under which the interim council will have two members each -- rather than one as proposed earlier -- from Afghanistan's 30 provinces besides 15 to 20 other nominated members. ``But it will take time.'' </P>
<P> ``The U.N. is ready with its plan but we have a very difficult task -- to wrest power from Mr. Rabbani,'' Mestiri said in an interview published Saturday in the Pakistani newspaper Dawn. </P>
<P> Taleban, which says it has control of nine provinces in southern and eastern Afghanistan, said Saturday its forces had captured the southwestern province of Nimroz. </P>
<P> Khalili denied the report and said government forces were planning to oust the student militia from their Charasyab base south of Kabul. </P>
<P> Official Kabul Radio said Friday that government forces had ousted Taleban from several strategic positions around the Afghan capital and killed more than 100 guerrillas since Thursday. </P>
