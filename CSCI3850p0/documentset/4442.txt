<P>  Iran Monday called for ending U.N. sanctions against Iraq, saying the United States was using them to keep the Arab world divided. </P>
<P> Tehran radio said Washington was opposed to ending the United Nations oil embargo against Baghdad because it was easier to advance Middle East peace plans and to give ``legitimacy'' to Israel in the wake of the division of Arabs. </P>
<P> The radio commentary said Washington, having just made statements about Baghdad breaking the embargo, would probably circulate further reports in the next few days about Iraq defying the U.N. economic and military sanctions. </P>
<P> The White House said Thursday that the United States believed Iraq was defying the U.N. ban and estimated that between 80,000 and 100,000 barrels a day were being sold covertly. </P>
<P> Iran Friday denied any role in helping Iraq export oil in violation of U.N. sanctions, rejecting a report by the New York Times that said Iraq had devised a secret system to export crude oil and refined products to neighbours Turkey and Iran. </P>
<P> ``The Iraqi attack on Kuwait was an aggression committed by the regime ruling in Baghdad and one cannot punish the people of Iraq for a sin committed by their rulers,'' the radio said. </P>
<P> ``It is also not acceptable to maintain the sanctions against the tyrannised people of Iraq just because U.S. policy requires (it) at this time,'' it added. </P>
<P> Iran and Iraq fought an eight-year war, which ended in 1988 with Tehran's acceptance of a U.N. cease-fire resolution. </P>
