<P>  The 15-nation European Union will not follow the United States in imposing economic sanctions on Iran, a European Commission spokesman said Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``We are not going to respond to this initiative. Our position is that we want to maintain a critical dialogue with Iran,'' the spokesman said. </P>
<P> He added that it was EU policy that firms should have a free hand to deal with Tehran. </P>
<P> ``If there is any change it will be in the context of CFSP (Common Foreign and Security Policy), but I don't think there will be such a change,'' the spokesman said. </P>
<P> ``It is in our interests to continue talking with a country that is a major power in the region,'' he added. </P>
<P> President Clinton said Sunday he would cut off all U.S. trade and investment with Iran as a sign of ``unrelenting determination'' to thwart its bid to develop nuclear weapons and support terrorism. </P>
<P> The United States set out Monday to persuade its major world partners to follow its lead. </P>
<P> ``Iran is an outlaw state. Its repugnant behavior has not changed .... A regime with this kind of record simply cannot be allowed to get its hands on nuclear weapons,'' U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said. </P>
<P> ``(Clinton's) action deserves the support of our friends .... I'll be redoubling my own efforts through various diplomatic steps and means to ensure such support is forthcoming,'' Christopher added. </P>
