<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The judge in the O.J. Simpson murder trial temporarily pulled the plug on TV coverage Monday just after the prosecution presented its most damning evidence yet against the former football hero -- a trail of blood from the crime scene to his home. </P>
<P> As the sensational case shifted into high gear and millions of TV viewers looked on, Judge Lance Ito suddenly put a stop to live broadcasts of the proceedings after a remote control camera inadvertently showed the face of an alternate juror for 8/10ths of a second -- a violation of the judge's rules. </P>
<P> Simpson's attorneys, who had been ready to deliver their opening statement, protested the decision, saying their client's right to a fair trial was placed in jeopardy because they were not allowed to immediately counter the prosecution's scathing presentation. </P>
<P> Ito, who has had a running battle with media since the took over case last July, said he would hear arguments Tuesday morning on whether to reinstate television coverage for the remainder of the trial. </P>
<P> The latest bizarre development came on the first day of opening statements in a case that has captivated America for the past seven months, with millions following every twist and turn like loyal soap-opera fans. </P>
<P> In an impassioned presentation, Deputy District Attorney Christopher Darden told jurors that behind Simpson's smiling public persona was a violent bully so obsessed with controlling his ex-wife that he killed her because he could not stand losing her. </P>
<P> In the most damaging evidence yet against Simpson, another prosecutor said DNA tests showed a ``trail of blood'' belonging to the football legend and his alleged victims -- ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman -- leading from the murder scene to his car and finally to his house. </P>
<P> Deputy District Attorney Marcia Clarke dropped the bombshell dropped during the prosecution's opening statements. </P>
<P> She said a glove found on Simpson's grounds was stained with his blood as well as that of Nicole Brown Simpson and Goldman. Its match was found at the murder scene two miles away. </P>
<P> ``The mere fact that we find blood where there should be no blood in the defendant's house, in the driveway, in his car and in a sock at the foot of his bed, that trail of blood ... is devastating proof of his guilt,'' Clark told jurors. </P>
<P> When Clark finished her presentation and the judge shut down the courtroom camera, Simpson's lawyers complained that it was unfair for them to be denied a chance to immediately respond before the jury to the prosecution's accusation. </P>
<P> Simpson lawyer Robert Shapiro appealed to Ito to turn the cameras back on Tuesday for the defense opening statements and then shut them down again for the remainder of the trial. </P>
<P> ``We are representing a man whose life is at stake in this trial and we believe that the evidence will show he is wrongly charged and therefore his life after this trial in the world of public opinion is also at stake,'' Shapiro told the judge. </P>
<P> But Clark said the prosecution wanted a total TV blackout imposed, declaring ``we're not playing to the world, we're playing to the jury.'' </P>
<P> The Court TV cable television channel -- which operated the courtroom pool camera that picked up a fleeting image of the woman alternate juror -- issued an apology and promised to take steps to prevent a recurrence. Ito has shielded the identities of the jury to guard their security. </P>
<P> The offending camera, which picked up a fleeting image of a woman alternate, was operated as a pool feed by Court TV. </P>
<P> Before jury selection began last September, Ito had threatened to pull the plug on TV coverage of the trial because of a constant drumbeat of news leaks that he said was hurting Simpson's chances of getting a fair trial. But he later decided against such restrictions. </P>
<P> During Tuesday's ssession, Clark said Nicole's blood was found on a sock in Simpson's bedroom and that Simpson's blood and that of the two victims were found inside his white Ford Bronco. She said hair and fiber samples also linked Simpson to the June 12 stabbing deaths outside Nicole Brown Simpson's luxury Brentwood townhouse. </P>
<P> The damning revelations were the centerpiece of the prosecution's opening statement, which began with Darden telling jurors that jealousy and obsessive love drove Simpson to murder his ex-wife. </P>
<P> Goldman, a 25-year-old aspiring male model, was killed simply because he was ``in the wrong place at the way, Darden said. </P>
<P> The prosecution's opening statement had jurors leaning forward to catch every word and brought the victims' families to tears. Simpson squirmed uncomfortably in his seat in the crowded courtroom. </P>
<P> Jurors gasped and victim's relatives sobbed when the prosecution showed a gruesome photograph of Nicole Brown Simpson's body curled up in a fetal position on a bloodstained walkway. </P>
<P> Darden vowed to expose the terrible ``private face'' behind Simpson's public persona as an all-American nice guy. He said ''the you will see and the man that you will see is the face of a batterer, a wife beater, an abuser, a controller. You'll see the face of Ron and Nicole's murderer.'' </P>
<P> Ito ruled earlier that Simpson could bare his scars for jurors in an effort to prove that injuries he suffered in his rise to football stardom deprived him of the power necessary to slash two people to death. But Ito denied a defense request to let Simpson address the jury during opening statements. </P>
