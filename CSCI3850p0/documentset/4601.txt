<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Peru dispached elite troops to a disputed border zone Monday as Ecuadoran forces stepped up attacks on Peruvian positions in their month-old conflict, press reports said. </P>
<P> Papal envoy Cardinal Carlos Furno, meanwhile, arrived in Lima in a bid to persuade the two Andean countries to stop fighting and respect a cease-fire and peace treaty negotiated by international mediators and signed in Brazil 10 days ago. </P>
<P> Radioprogramas del Peru, quoting military sources at El Milagro base in the northern town of Bagua, said the press would be banned from two key border posts for ``security reasons'' over the next four days during the troop deployments. </P>
<P> El Comercio newspaper, in a report from the border, said military commanders had ordered fresh elite troops to the border after Ecuador launched mortar attacks Sunday near the Cueva de los Tayos and Base Sur posts. </P>
<P> The newspaper, quoting military officials, said up to 1,000 Ecuadoran soldiers had infiltrated the area where skirmishes have taken place for four weeks, adding that troops exchanged machine-gun and artillery fire. </P>
<P> ``We saw them spread out and open fire against our positions,'' El Comercio quoted one of the officials as saying. </P>
<P> President Alberto Fujimori denied Sunday night that Peru was increasing the number of personnel in the zone and said the new troops would relieve forces already in the zone. </P>
<P> In a television interview, Fujimori said clashes were occuring around Tiwinza, a key hilltop post which both sides claim to control, but he did not mention the fighting in the area of Cueva de los Tayos, a base he visited last week. </P>
<P> EL Comercio said at least 20 wounded had been evacuated from the zone of conflict to El Milagro base over the weekend, some of whom were suffering from gunshot wounds. Military officials were not available to confirm the reports. </P>
<P> The fighting, which has left dozens of dead on both sides, broke out in late January in dense, mountainous terrain at the headwaters of the Cenepa River along a 48-mile stretch of border yet to be demarcated by a 1942 treaty. </P>
<P> Papal envoy Furno was due to meet with Fujimori on Monday afternoon, officials in Government Palace said. </P>
<P> A Vatican spokesman said Furno would relay Pope John Paul II's concern over the continued fighting. </P>
<P> The two countries fought a two-week war in 1941. In the Rio de Janeiro Protocol negotiated a year later, Ecuador gave up its historical claim to a vast region of Amazon jungle. </P>
<P> The treaty was rejected by Ecuador in 1960, and fighting has broken out several times in the unmarked bo2rder area. </P>
