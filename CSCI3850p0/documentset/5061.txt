<P>  President Clinton, due to visit Ukraine in May, has sent Ukrainian leader Leonid Kuchma a letter supporting his reforms, the foreign ministry said Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``Kuchma received a warm letter from Bill Clinton in which he accepted an invitation to visit our country ... and stressed that the United States will support the reforms of Kuchma's administration,'' a ministry spokesman told a news conference. </P>
<P> He said Ukraine was preparing a reply to settle the timetable of Clinton's visit. He is due to attend ceremonies in Moscow on May 9 marking the 50th anniversary of the allied victory in World War II, and arrive in Kiev the following day. </P>
<P> Clinton made a brief stopover in Kiev last year on his way to Moscow to sign a deal with Russia and Ukraine providing Ukraine with compensation for giving up its share of the former Soviet nuclear arsenal. </P>
<P> Kuchma made a state visit to the United States last November. </P>
<P> Kuchma last year elaborated and secured parliamentary approval for Ukraine's first post-Soviet economic reform program, backed by the International Monetary Fund. </P>
