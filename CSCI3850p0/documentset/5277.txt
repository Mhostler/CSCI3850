<P>  A non-binding privately financed vote on the issue of casino gambling in Bridgeport Tuesday won overwhelming support, backers of the measure said. </P>
<P> Bridgeport Yes, the casino booster group, said 86 percent of the 21,000 registered voters who cast ballots in the non-binding referendum approved of casino gaming in Bridgeport for a turnout of about 40 percent overall. </P>
<P> Supporters of the measure rented city polling places and voting machines to hold unofficial balloting. </P>
<P> Las Vegas gaming developer Steve Wynn, whose company Mirage Resorts has teamed up with Bridgeport Jai Alai to option 50 acres of Bridgeport harbor front property, put up more than $90,000 to campaign in favor of a casino. </P>
<P> ``The outcome and the size of the victory is astounding,'' said Mark Rivers, a Mirage Resorts vice president, moments after the tally was complete. ``No one projected these numbers in anyone's office pool. The people of Bridgeport have answered with a strong mandate and a call to action to the legislature.'' </P>
<P> Anti-casino forces had been considerably outspent. ``It is not how I wished it to go,'' said Noel Furie, head of Bridgeport Residents Against Casino Gambling, the grass roots organization that spent about $5,000 to get its message out. </P>
<P> ``I feel very strongly that it is the wrong way for Bridgeport to go and in the end it will be a very negative thing for our community.'' </P>
<P> Both side marshaled armies of volunteers to drive voters to the polls and man phone banks urging more to vote. Mayor Joseph Ganim toured polling places to shake hands and persuade voters to say yes to a casino in Bridgeport. </P>
<P> Earlier in the day Gov. John Rowland told reporters he believed in the referendum, adding, ``It is important that the rest of the state see the type of support there is in Bridgeport.'' </P>
<P> The city of 160,000 has been struggling with high crime and a shrinking tax base. Supporters of a casino claim it would create 12,000 jobs. </P>
