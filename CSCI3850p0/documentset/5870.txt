<P>  Vice President Al Gore, spearheading a U.S. campaign in support of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), Wednesday urged the world to seize a ``one-time option'' to extend it indefinitely. </P>
<P> Gore made his appeal to 178 countries attending a United Nations conference called to decide whether to prolong the 25-year-old treaty -- a cornerstone of the struggle to prevent atomic war -- forever or for a limited period. </P>
<P> ``The United States believes that it is vital that we take advantage of this one-time option to extend the treaty indefinitely without conditions,'' he said. </P>
<P> But many Third World states say this would kill incentives for the five declared nuclear powers -- the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France -- to disarm entirely. Syria, Malaysia and Venezuela Wednesday opposed the U.S. move. </P>
<P> Washington has been campaigning for a year for permanent extension of the pact, which bars nuclear powers from passing on atomic arms and other countries from acquiring them. </P>
<P> The United States says it has the 90 votes needed for a simple majority to extend the treaty unconditionally, but it fears the NPT would be considerably weakened by a less than resounding vote from the 178 signatories. </P>
<P> Speaking on the third day of the four-week conference, Gore devoted much of his address to rejecting ideas that the treaty should be held hostage, through what he called ''periodic live-or-die votes,'' to faster disarmament progress. </P>
<P> Because of the long life of nuclear weapon systems, he said, ``rolling periods of renewal can have the same consequences for nuclear planning as would a decision taken right now to terminate the treaty.'' </P>
<P> Such a move would also ``encourage would-be proliferators to lie low and clandestinely pursue their objectives'' in the hope that the treaty would eventually collapse, he added. </P>
<P> Gore said the debate on the treaty came at a ``moment of unusual opportunity and great risk'' when the danger of superpower nuclear war had faded but countries seeking nuclear arms had increasing technical opportunities to acquire them. </P>
<P> Washington gained one valuable ally when South Africa, which secretly built nuclear weapons during white rule in the 1980s but later dismantled them and joined the NPT in 1991, came out in support of indefinite extension. </P>
<P> ``The termination of the treaty -- whether this comes about by placing conditions on its future existence or by extending it only for a fixed period -- is not an acceptable alternative,'' Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo told the conference. </P>
<P> Syria, as expected, spoke strongly against a permanent extension of the treaty because of Israel's alleged possession of nuclear weapons and refusal to join the NPT. </P>
<P> ``Syria cannot agree to the extension of the NPT unless Israel accedes to the treaty and subjects its nuclear installations to international inspection,'' Foreign Minister Farouk al-Shara said. </P>
<P> While European countries fell into line behind the United States, Malaysian diplomat Hasmy Agam called the NPT ``neither a fair nor a just treaty'' and followed his country's neighbor Indonesia in proposing a limited extension. </P>
<P> Venezuelan delegate Adolfo Taylhardat called for regular 25-year extensions. Indefinite extension ``would deprive the international community of a valuable instrument for exerting pressure'' on the nuclear powers to disarm. </P>
