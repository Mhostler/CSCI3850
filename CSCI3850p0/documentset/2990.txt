<DATELINE>APIA, Western Samoa (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The sound of Scottish bagpipes was mixed with Samoan songs Saturday as Western Samoa paid glowing tribute to author Robert Louis Stevenson on the 100th anniversary of his death. </P>
<P> The opening ceremony on this tropical South Pacific island marked the start of a week of celebrations that includes the re-opening of Stevenson's residence, Vailima, and a series of sports and cultural events. </P>
<P> The day began with a parade led by the Samoan police band along the capital's foreshore. Following was a lone bagpiper, a procession of schoolchildren and floats. </P>
<P> Minister of tourism and deputy prime minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi officially opened the centenary by quoting directly from the requeim Stevenson wrote for himself, which is printed on his tomb on the summit of Mount Vaea. </P>
<P> And the hunter home from the hill.'' </P>
<P> Tuilaepa told the crowd, which included Stevenson enthusiasts from his home country of Scotland and from Monterey, Calif., where he lived briefly, that Samoans took special pride in knowing he chose their country as a place to live and die. </P>
<P> ``We believe the Tusitala knew that this was where his roots and his home were,'' Tuilaepa said. </P>
<P> The Tusitala -- the teller of tales -- was a special title bestowed on Stevenson by all Samoans. </P>
<P> Tuilaepa said Stevenson was compassionate -- which was a tribute to Scotland and a tribute to the country in which he chose to live. </P>
<P> ``He found here a people he could relate to in a meaningful way. It is especially touching that Stevenson chose Samoa as a place to live and die.'' </P>
<P> Stevenson, who wrote ``Treasure Island,'' ``The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde'' and ``Kidnapped,'' was a proponent of a free Samoa as the colonial superpowers vied for control in the late 19th century. </P>
<P> His arrival here in 1890 ended his worldwide search for a country that would be kind to his health after contracting tuberculosis in early childhood. </P>
<P> Biographies of the famous Scot say Samoa's regular mail service, which allowed him to send his letters to magazine publishers on a routine basis, was another attraction for living on the South Pacific island. </P>
<P> Sunday, there will be a dawn service at the entrance of the Road of Loving Hearts and a walk up the summit of Mount Vaea to Stevenson's tomb. </P>
<P> Monday Vailima, which was almost destroyed by cyclones Ofa and Val in 1990 and 1991, will be officially re-opened after a major renovation. </P>
