<P>  The Palestine Liberation Organization, hoping to break a logjam in Middle East peace talks, said Tuesday it could possibly accept an Israeli handover of West Bank towns in stages rather than all at once. </P>
<P> Top Palestinian officials reiterated the offer, subject to certain qualifications, ahead of a crucial summit Thursday between PLO leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin at the border between Israel and the Palestinian-ruled Gaza Strip. </P>
<P> They said Palestinians would accept a West Bank handover in stages, starting with the towns of Jenin and Bethlehem, so long as it was accompanied by an acceptable overall timetable. </P>
<P> PLO officials said Israel so far had said it was ready to experiment, redeploying away from Jenin and Bethlehem, but without agreeing to an overall timetable. </P>
<P> Israel turned over most of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho to Palestinians in May. Under their peace deal, it was due to withdraw troops from other Arab West Bank towns last July to prepare the way for Palestinian elections. </P>
<P> But Israel is reluctant to go forward as long as Islamic militants opposed to the deal are killing scores of Israelis. It says Arafat must do more to crack down on militant groups. </P>
<P> Tayeb Abdel-Rahim, general secretary of Arafat's Palestinian Authority, said: ``We are prepared to accept gradual redeployment from Jenin and Bethlehem first if the Israelis agree to a timetable for redeployment from other West Bank cities.'' </P>
<P> Ahmed Korei, the authority's economics chief agreed, telling Reuters: ``We have no objection for implementation of a comprehensive agreement on redeployment from all West Bank cities, but this agreement has to be reached in advance. </P>
<P> ``We are afraid, if no comprehensive agreement is reached, that once they withdraw from Jenin and Bethlehem, they might not withdraw from other cities,'' said Korei, also known as Abu Alaa. </P>
<P> Rabin, under domestic pressure to halt attacks on Israelis, promised progress Tuesday in talks with the Palestinians but added: ``The main obstacle to realizing what will be achieved and how it will be achieved in the negotiations is terror.'' </P>
<P> Palestinian police have made dozens of arrests and Arafat has ordered creation of a military court to try cases. </P>
<P> But Rabin said the West Bank and Gaza would remain closed off, barring tens of thousands of Palestinians from going to work in Israel, until measures were taken to reduce violence. </P>
<P> Israel imposed the closure Jan. 22 after two suicide bombers from Gaza killed 21 Israelis at a bus stop in Israel. </P>
<P> ``We are doing what we can, which will not threaten or jeopardize stability in self-rule areas,'' Abu Alaa said. </P>
