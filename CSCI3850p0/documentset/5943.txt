<DATELINE>BONN, Germany (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A Moscow official was quoted Saturday as accusing Germany of staging a nuclear-material smuggling scandal last year to make Russia look like ``Upper Volta with plutonium.'' </P>
<P> Moscow's criticism of Germany in Der Spiegel news magazine came shortly after state prosecutors in Munich admitted they had known in advance that smugglers were bringing dangerous plutonium to Germany on a plane, but did nothing to stop it. </P>
<P> Opposition parties threaten to force a full parliamentary investigation in Bonn next week into the scandal which has dogged the state's BND intelligence service and in particular Bernd Schmidbauer, the government official who oversees it. </P>
<P> Three men, arrested last August at Munich airport trying to smuggle 12.8 ounces of radioactive plutonium into the country from Moscow, are due to go on trial next month. </P>
<P> Schmidbauer and the BND have denied a Spiegel report earlier this month that the BND staged the whole affair in order to justify its existence in the post-Cold War era. </P>
<P> Officials in Moscow's nuclear energy ministry have denied the plutonium was of Russian origin and accused the Germans of staging the whole thing to sully their reputation. </P>
<P> ``Munich was the big deal, the high point of Operation 'Let's Get Russia','' Moscow's Deputy Nuclear Energy Minister, Yevgeny Mikerin, told the latest edition of Der Spiegel. </P>
<P> ``We were supposed to end up looking like Upper Volta with plutonium,'' he said, implying Russia would then appear to be nothing but an underdeveloped country saddled with a dangerous technology it could not control. </P>
<P> Other officials in his ministry say Bonn's aim was to sow fear about nuclear safeguards in Russia so Moscow would agree to greater Western supervision of its nuclear industry -- which it did after the Munich affair. </P>
<P> Last year's seizure caused alarm around the world, prompting fears a ``nuclear mafia'' was trading fissionable material from the former Soviet bloc, putting nuclear bombs within reach of criminals and non-nuclear states. </P>
<P> Bonn's opposition Social Democrats say they suspect the discovery of the smuggling was not the straightforward policing triumph it had been presented as. </P>
<P> And Dieter Emrich, a senior prosecutor in the Bavarian capital Munich, told German television that his office had been informed in advance that the plutonium was coming on a scheduled Lufthansa passenger flight from Moscow. </P>
<P> They had decided the move, to snare the smugglers, was not irresponsible and was safer than letting them bring the plutonium by car or train, and so had done nothing to stop it. </P>
<P> Another weekly news magazine, Focus, Saturday quoted top intelligence sources as saying the two Spaniards and a Colombian awaiting trial had also been in touch with mafia circles in the French port of Marseilles. </P>
<P> ``We had to fight the competition to get hold of the plutonium,'' one intelligence agent said. </P>
