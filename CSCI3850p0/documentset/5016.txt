<P>  British actor Nigel Hawthorne attended the European premiere of his film ``The Madness of King George'' Sunday, but said he didn't think he had much chance of winning the Oscar he has been nominated for. </P>
<P> He told reporters his chances of clinching an Academy Award for best actor were ``minimal'' and that he was already nervous about the ceremony in Los Angeles next Friday. </P>
<P> ``The chances of a British actor in that galaxy must really be sensibly considered as slender,'' he said. ``So I don't really think about it in any other terms than that I'll wait and see.'' </P>
<P> ``This is good practice for Oscars night, which is a real circus, so it's useful to have an inkling of what it will be like with banks of people and cameras and red carpets,'' he said as he was mobbed by fans at a London cinema. </P>
<P> ``It's a lovely send off,'' said the 65-year-old. </P>
<P> ``The Madness of King George,'' which opens in Britain Friday, has been nominated for four Oscars: Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress for Helen Mirren, Best Screenplay for Alan Bennett and Best Art Direction. </P>
<P> ``It would be great if we got at least one,'' said Hawthorne, who has been catapulted to international stardom late in his career with the surprise success of the low-budget film. It cost $11 million to make. </P>
<P> He recreates his acclaimed stage role as George III in the film about the descent to madness of the king who died in 1820. </P>
<P> Also at the gala charity premiere at London's Lumiere Cinema were the film's financiers, Channel 4 television chief executive Michael Grade and Hollywood mogul Samuel Goldwyn junior. </P>
<P> The film's success follows the surprise popularity last year of another low-budget British production, ``Four Weddings and a Funeral.'' </P>
