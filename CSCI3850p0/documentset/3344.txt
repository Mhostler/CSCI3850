<P> The Mexican police commander, a member of the Chiapas judicial police who declined to give his name, said his men had orders to clear all roads in the area and to reach Simojovel, which was occupied Monday by armed peasants presumed linked to the Zapatista National Liberation Army. </P>
<P> When asked what his orders were, the commander told Reuters, ``to get to where it's blocked.'' </P>
<P> Asked why his units were backed by some 400 troops, two small tanks and other military hardware, he replied: ``They're for support. Let's hope it's not necessary.'' </P>
<P> Earlier, reporters were turned back on the road to Simojovel by masked peasants who had set up a roadblock. Above the roadblck were handpainted signs declaring the area Zapatista-held territory. </P>
