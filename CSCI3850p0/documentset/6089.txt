<DATELINE>LONDON (Reuter) - X</DATELINE>
<P> rays of people claiming compensation for exposure to asbestos are not always good indicators of whether they are liable to asbestos-related lung cancer, researchers said Friday. </P>
<P> In several countries, including Britain, compensation is paid for lung cancer caused by exposure to asbestos only if there is X-ray evidence of thickening of the lung tissue (fibrosis) or the lung lining. </P>
<P> But British researchers, in an article in the medical magazine Lancet, said the presence of fibrosis (judged off X-ray film) might not always be a good indicator of asbestos-related lung cancer. </P>
<P> Asbestos exposures that do not cause ``shadows'' on a chest X-ray may still increase the risk of lung cancer, they said. </P>
<P> ``This needs to be considered by those responsible for industrial hygiene and compensation of workers with asbestos-related lung disease,'' they said. </P>
<P> The researchers reviewed the health histories of 271 people with confirmed cases of lung cancer and 678 control patients. X-ray film taken at the time of first diagnosis was evaluated. </P>
<P> Researchers found patients who had worked in a job with definite or probable exposure to asbestos more than 15 years before diagnosis had a higher risk of lung cancer than those who had not. </P>
<P> A doubling of the risk was seen in patients who had evidence of fibrosis as shown by X-rays. But patients who did not have this clear X-ray evidence still had a 56 percent increase in risk of suffering from lung cancer. </P>
