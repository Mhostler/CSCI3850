<P>  A 10-year-old boy who dove into a swimming pool to save his mother from drowning, said Thursday he had copied his heroes from ``Baywatch,'' the television series about lifeguards. </P>
<P> Jason Brazier used a classic lifeguard's hold learned from ``Baywatch'' to rescue his mother Shirley, a 40-year-old novice swimmer, after she went underwater at a swimming pool in Portmadoc, north Wales. </P>
<P> She said: ``I knew I was drowning and managed to shout for help. The next thing, I felt two little hands underneath me and I was grabbed in a life-saving hold. It wasn't until I was recovering at the side of the pool I realized I owed my life to my son.'' </P>
<P> Jason, who learned to swim at the age of five, said: ``I realized my mum was in trouble. I didn't stop to think, I just knew I had to jump in and save her. When I reached her side I remembered how the lifeguards on 'Baywatch' rescue swimmers and tried to copy them.'' </P>
