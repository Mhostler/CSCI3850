<P>  Maverick businessman turned politician Bernard Tapie will be asked to run for the French presidency when Francois Mitterrand steps down next year, his party's head said Sunday. </P>
<P> ``I'll try to persuade him to be a candidate because I think that when you get 2.5 million votes (in a European parliament poll) you're no longer completely your own master,'' Jean-Francois Hory, president of the Left Radicals Movement (MRG) told Radio-J. </P>
<P> ``The issue that matters is no longer Bernard Tapie's personal comfort but what he represents and the hopes he embodies,'' he said. </P>
<P> Tapie, a European and French parliamentarian who owns the Marseille soccer club, had ``the right caliber'' to run in the race to succeed Socialist President Mitterrand, who will step down in May. </P>
<P> Hory acknowledged however that Tapie may prefer, as he has said in the past, to dedicate himself to a bid for the city hall in the Mediterranean port of Marseille next year because he fears seeking higher offices could land him in deeper legal trouble. </P>
