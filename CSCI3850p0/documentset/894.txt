<P>  Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali told the Security Council Friday a U.N. presence would probably be needed in Rwanda for years, a senior U.N. official said Friday. </P>
<P> The U.N. Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR), now comprising about 2,560 troops, is slowly building up to a strength of 5,500 authorized by the council in mid-May. </P>
<P> Giving reporters details of a briefing which Boutros-Ghali gave council members on a number of topics, Assistant Secretary-General Alvaro de Soto said: ``He put the council on notice of his opinion that a U.N. presence in Rwanda will be required probably for years.'' </P>
<P> It would have to consist of both military and humanitarian personnel, in view of the difficult security situation, banditry and chaos. </P>
<P> An estimated 500,000 people have been massacred in Rwanda since April, mostly members of the Tutsi minority and opponents of the recently overthrown Hutu-led government. Hundreds of thousands of others have fled to Zaire and other nearby countries. </P>
<P> Concerning Burundi, whose ethnic make-up is similar to neighboring Rwanda's and where a similar explosion is feared, Boutros-Ghali told the council preventive action was needed. </P>
<P> He had hoped to establish a ``fairly substantial humanitarian presence at Bujumbura airport, possibly with military elements,'' to help calm the situation and act as a deterrent, de Soto said. But the Burundi government had not agreed to such a presence. </P>
<P> De Soto gave no reason for its refusal, but another source said the Tutsis, who control the army, opposed a U.N. force. </P>
<P> The Security Council, which recently sent a mission to Burundi, was therefore considering a number of alternatives. </P>
<P> These included the deployment of U.N. guards equipped only with sidearms; the dispatch of perhaps as many as 150 human rights observers; bolstering the U.N. humanitarian agencies already in Burundi; visits by ``personalities'' -- de Soto offered no names -- to help calm the situation; and the convening of a regional conference. </P>
<P> Boutros-Ghali suggested that, until the potential crisis in Burundi had been defused, countries such as the United States and France should not abruptly withdraw the mostly logistical troops they had sent to Zaire to assist with humanitarian operations in Rwanda. </P>
<P> ``He has not made any formal proposal to the Security Council that a mandate be given to them now. He has merely asked them to stand by and not leave the region while possible preventive action in the case of Burundi is considered,'' de Soto added. </P>
