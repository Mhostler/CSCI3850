<P>  Caribbean Community (Caricom) leaders say they have persuaded the United States to consider addressing some of their trade concerns during an upcoming Summit of the Americans in Miami. </P>
<P> Caricom chairman and prime minister of Barbados, Owen Arthur, has written to President Clinton about U.S. opposition to the European banana regulations, which give Caribbean producers protected access. </P>
<P> Caricom, during its two-day meeting of heads of government that ended Friday, said they found ``no merit'' in the complaints lodged by U.S. banana growers and wanted the issue addressed at the Dec. 9-11 summit. </P>
<P> The leaders met with a U.S. delegation led by Clinton counselor Thomas McLarty late Thursday, according to one Caricom official. As a result, the United States has agreed to consider Caricom's position. </P>
<P> The four Caricom states of Dominica, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and Grenada, get over 50 percent of their export earnings from bananas sold to Europe. Caricom argued that since they control only 16 percent of the European market, U.S. opposition was unfair and unnecessary. </P>
<P> The region has also requested NAFTA parity with Mexico for several categories of exports, and will be raising the issue when the summit considers the proposed Americas Free Trade Area. </P>
<P> The United States also agreed to consider a Caricom proposal to institutionalize the hemispheric summit on a regular basis within the politicial grouping, the Organization of American States. </P>
<P> The region's leaders also reiterated their position that in reforming the OAS, the membership of Cuba must be addressed. </P>
<P> Jamaica's prime minister P.J. Patterson noted if the United States could open relations with North Korea and Vietnam, there ``can be no basis why diplomatic relations can't exist with Cuba.'' </P>
