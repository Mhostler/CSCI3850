<P>  A Filipino man armed with a fully loaded 15-round semi-automatic pistol was arrested when he tried to enter a stadium where Pope John Paul II was to celebrate Mass Tuesday, police said. </P>
<P> Police chief superintendent Denis Samin said police believed the man, Perfecto Santos, was a serious threat to the pope. </P>
<P> ``The pistol was loaded with a 15-round magazine. We regard it as a serious threat,'' Samin told reporters. </P>
<P> ``We have no way of knowing what was on his mind. It does seem unusual to bring a pistol to a Papal Mass,'' he said. </P>
<P> Santos, 40, a resident of Papua New Guinea, was stopped by police at the entrance to the Sir John Guise stadium only minutes before the pope arrived, said assistant police commissioner Philip Taku. </P>
<P> A metal scanner detected Santos was carrying a 9mm Sig-Sauer semi-automatic pistol, fully loaded, Taku said in a statement. </P>
<P> Santos is licensed to carry the gun for use in a pistol club, but not to carry it in public. </P>
<P> He was charged with an unlicensed firearms offense and will appear in court Thursday. </P>
