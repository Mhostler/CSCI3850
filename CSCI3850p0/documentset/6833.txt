<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The U.S. Senate Wednesday killed an effort to drop language in its budget resolution which would require opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling. </P>
<P> The Senate's budget guidelines include projected revenue of $2.3 billion from the sale of leases in ANWR, which has long been off-limits to development. </P>
<P> By a vote of 56-44, senators voted to set aside an amendment introduced by Senator William Roth, R-Delaware, to take the projected revenue out of the budget and replace it by closing a tax loophole for expatriate billionaires. </P>
<P> In line with language in the Senate's budget resolution, the House last week passed a budget bill which included $1.25 billion in revenue from ANWR leases. </P>
<P> The lease revenue figures in the two budgets differ because the House assumes the federal government would take 50 percent of the total $2.5 billion expected from lease revenue. </P>
<P> The Senate version assumes the federal government would take 90 percent of the revenue, with Alaska taking the rest. </P>
<P> Environmental groups concerned about the budget move see it as a quiet way for Congress to open ``America's Serengeti'' to drilling without open debate on the issue. </P>
