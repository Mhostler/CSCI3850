<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A Federal Judge ruled Thursday against the Clinton administration's ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' policy barring gays serving openly in the U.S. military, saying it was discriminatory. </P>
<P> A Defense Department spokesman said the Pentagon was likely to request that the Justice Department appeal the ruling in the case, viewed by legal observers as a test to the constitutionality of the National Defense Authorization Act of 1993, which states that a service member may be discharged for saying he or she is gay or engaging in homosexual acts. </P>
<P> ``Congress may not enact discriminatory legislation because it desires to insulate heterosexual servicemembers from statements that might excite their prejudices,'' Judge Eugene Nickerson of Eastern District Court in Brooklyn wrote in his ruling on the first direct constitutional challenge to the policy by six servicemembers. </P>
<P> Attorneys for the two active and four reserve servicemembers had argued during hearings March 13 to 16 that the policy violated their constitutional rights to free speech and equal protection under the law. </P>
<P> Government attorneys argued that overturning the policy, which took effect in February 1994, could damage military effectiveness because gays serving openly in the armed forces would disrupt unit cohesiveness. </P>
<P> But in his 39-page ruling, Judge Nickerson said the government failed to make its case and that efforts to discharge the six servicemembers were invalid under the First and Fifth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. </P>
<P> Nickerson had granted a preliminary injunction in April 1994 that prevented the military from discharging the six while the case was active, and Thursday's ruling also only extends to the plaintiffs. </P>
<P> ``Whether the government intended to prevent the commission of 'prohibited acts' or appease heterosexual prejudices defendants failed to make the required showing,'' he wrote. </P>
<P> The military has acknowledged for years that homosexuals serve in the armed forces, but the issue has become whether they may do so openly. The so-called ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' policy was worked out as a compromise by President Clinton, who had promised during his 1992 presidential campaign to lift the ban on gays serving in the military. </P>
<P> ``They (the defendants) say that the policy seeks to accommodate the privacy interests of servicemembers,'' the judge wrote. ``This seems to the court the most incongruous of arguments. After passage of the Act, the showers, the latrines and the barracks became no more private than they were before.'' </P>
<P> The White House declined immediate comment on the ruling. Officials travelling with President Clinton in Florida said they first wanted to read the judge's full opinion. </P>
<P> However, a Pentagon official said an appeal was likely. </P>
<P> ``We just got the ruling. We're reviewing it right now but it looks like we will request that the Justice Department appeal it,'' said an official who spoke on condition he not be quoted by name. </P>
<P> Justice Department spokesman Carl Stern said, ``We believe the challenged policy is constitutional and we remain committed to defending it.'' </P>
<P> Lawyers for the plaintiffs, who were represented by the American Civil Liberties Union gay rights project, Lambda Legal Aid and Defense Fund and other attorneys, hailed the ruling. </P>
<P> ``I'm thrilled obviously that my clients' constitutional rights have been vindicated,'' said attorney David Braff. ``I have no doubt the court of appeals will sustain it.'' </P>
