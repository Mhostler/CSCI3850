<P>  California's legislature has passed the first bill in the nation calling for doctors to be allowed to prescribe marijuana to chronically ill patients, a legislative aide said Friday. </P>
<P> The bill was approved by the state Assembly on Thursday night on a 46-21 vote, said Chad Randolph, an aide to state Senator Milton Marks, a San Francisco Democrat who authored the bill. </P>
<P> The bill, already passed by the state Senate, now goes to California Governor Pete Wilson, who may decide to sign it or veto it. </P>
<P> Even if Wilson signs it, the law could not take effect without a change in federal law, which bans the medicinal use of marijuana. </P>
<P> Some seriously ill people and support groups have campaigned for marijuana to be legalized for medical use. They say smoking marijuana helps dull the pain of illnesses like cancer and AIDS or helps them cope with chemotherapy. </P>
<P> Some Californians with AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) have been growing marijuana for their own use, running the risk of arrest. </P>
<P> The bill passed with support from both majority Democrats and Republicans in the Assembly, Randolph said. </P>
<P> It seeks to have marijuana listed as a Schedule II drug under federal and state drug classifications, which would enable doctors to legally prescribe it to critically ill patients. </P>
<P> At present, marijuana is a banned Schedule I drug. Possession of marijuana is a crime in California, even if used for medical purposes. </P>
<P> Randolph said 36 states have passed resolutions asking the federal government to reclassify marijuana as a Schedule II drug to allow its use for medical purposes. </P>
<P> But California's legislature is the first to go beyond that and pass legislation seeking to do that, he said. </P>
