<DATELINE>LONDON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Legendary British gangster Reggie Kray will be released briefly from prison next week to attend the funeral of his twin brother, Ronnie, prison officials said Thursday. </P>
<P> The 61-year-old murderers, who terrorized London's East End during the 1960s, were both sentenced to life in prison in 1969. </P>
<P> Ronnie Kray, who died in hospital Friday after suffering a heart attack, had previously been diagnosed a paranoid schizophrenic and was serving his sentence at Broadmoor psychiatric hospital in Berkshire, west of London. </P>
<P> A spokesman for Maidstone Prison in southeastern England said Reggie Kray would go to the funeral, scheduled for next Wednesday in east London, accompanied by three guards. ``He will be brought straight back here as soon as the funeral service is finished,'' the spokesman said. </P>
<P> The service at St Matthew's Church in east London's Bethnal Green district is expected to draw a huge crowd attracted by the legend of the Kray twins, who have been glamorized in books and a film as ruthless gangsters with a sense of honor. </P>
