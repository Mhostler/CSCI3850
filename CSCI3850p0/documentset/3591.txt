<P>  Leftist Israelis demonstrating against the expansion of a Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank scuffled Thursday with Jewish settlers who tried to block their protest, witnesses said. </P>
<P> They said several people from both sides suffered bruises during the shoving match, which broke out at the entrance to the Bethlehem-area settlement of Efrat, focus of a dispute which has threatened the 1993 Israeli-PLO peace deal. </P>
<P> Last month settlers broke ground for an expansion of the settlement, prompting clashes between Israeli troops and Palestinian villagers who said they owned the land. The Palestine Liberation Organization has warned continued settlement could wreck the peace process. </P>
<P> Protester Ofer Shytrit said of the settlers Thursday, ``They tried to stop us from demonstrating in the entrance of the settlement. </P>
<P> Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin last week stopped work on 500 housing units on a disputed hilltop near the Arab village of al-Khader. But he gave permission for settlers to build on an alternative site closer to Efrat. </P>
<P> ``The army and the police tried to come between us and them, but they did not help,'' said Shytrit, who heads a youth group of the leftist Meretz movement, coalition partner of Rabin's ruling Labor party. </P>
<P> Meretz views the expansion of Jewish settlements, where more than 100,000 Israelis live among one million Palestinians on the West Bank, as threatening the agreement on self-rule. </P>
