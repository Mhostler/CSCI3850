<P>  Cuba hosts a meeting next week of a cooperation commission with the Caribbean regional organization Caricom, hoping to boost ties in economic and other areas. </P>
<P> Deputy Foreign Trade Minister Orlando Hernandez told reporters the Caricom (Caribbean Community) delegation to the two-day meeting from Jan. 17 would be headed by its secretary general Edwin Carrington, from Trinidad and Tobago. </P>
<P> The meeting, the second of the the Cuba-Caricom cooperation commission, would look at all aspects of cooperation, including trade, investment, culture, the environment and tourism, he added. </P>
<P> Two-way trade between Communist-ruled Cuba and the Caricom members in 1994 was worth around $35 million, with Cuban exports of about $7 million to $8 million, he said. This was a slight increase on 1993's figures, he added. </P>
<P> Cuba's main exports to the region are construction materials such as cement, as well as medicines and salt. </P>
<P> The island has also established three joint ventures in tourism and construction materials with firms from Jamaica and Guyana. </P>
