<P>  An American professor being investigated by Singapore for possible criminal defamation left for the United States Thursday to visit his sick father in Atlanta, sources close to the academic told Reuters. </P>
<P> An airline source at Singapore's Changi airport confirmed that Christopher Lingle, 46, had checked into the departure lounge for a flight to Los Angeles via Taipei. </P>
<P> One source told Reuters that Lingle planned to submit his resignation from his National University of Singapore (NUS) post, to be effective in 30 days. </P>
<P> Lingle, a senior fellow in European studies at NUS, was questioned by Singapore police Monday ``in connection with investigations into contempt of court and criminal defamation arising from an article'' he had written, a Singapore police spokesman said in a statement Tuesday. </P>
<P> Lingle's Oct. 7 opinion piece in the International Herald Tribune newspaper criticized Asian governments, among other things referring to unnamed ``intolerant regimes'' and compliant judiciaries. </P>
<P> He is 13 months into a two-year contract at NUS. </P>
<P> Lingle ``intends to return to Singapore within seven days'' after visiting his 79-year-old father, the source said. He said Lingle requested compassionate leave in writing from NUS Thursday after learning of his father's condition. </P>
<P> Officials from NUS were not immediately available for comment. </P>
<P> Lingle said Monday he gave police about 100 periodicals from his office and home after they asked to see the research material he used to write the article. </P>
<P> ``Up to now I've been treated with dignity and professionalism by the police, and I'm convinced that if my comments are judged fairly, the matter will go no further,'' he said. </P>
<P> In Paris Wednesday, Singapore's Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong appeared to defend the investigation of Lingle after Goh was asked a general question about differences between Singapore authorities and the domestic and foreign press. </P>
<P> ``When a journalist, for example, writes that a judge is not independent, it is normal that the police question him to verify his arguments,'' Goh told the French newspaper Le Monde. </P>
<P> ``Everything happens in an open fashion. He can be defended by a lawyer of his choice,'' Goh said. </P>
<P> Though he did not name the professor, Goh's remark appeared to refer to Lingle. The academic has published about 12 articles in the international press over the last year. </P>
