<P>  San Diego quarterback Stan Humphries and running back Natrone Means survived their first Super Bowl blitz Tuesday -- from the swarming hordes of reporters and photographers on the traditional ``media day.'' </P>
<P> In stark contrast to the Buffalo Bills, who were downright ornery coming in the past two years as two- and three-time losers, the Super Bowl novices from southern California were a loose and joyful bunch at Joe Robbie Stadium Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``There's no pressure on us, there's none whatsoever on us,'' said Humphries, who leads a team of unprecedented 20-point underdogs into Super Bowl XXIX against the high-scoring San Francisco 49ers. </P>
<P> ``Nobody expected us to be here. Nobody's giving us a shot. All the pressure is on them,'' added Humphries, whose two 43-yard touchdown passes in the second half of the AFC championship game killed Pittsburgh's dream of blitzing their way back into the National Football League's big show. </P>
<P> Humphries was an ignored backup to Mark Rypien with the Redskins in Washington's Super Bowl XXVI victory. On Tuesday he was basking in the attention. </P>
<P> ``I wasn't a big media deal like I am now,'' said the 29-year-old seven-year veteran, breaking into a wide grin. </P>
<P> ``When we went to the Super Bowl in Minnesota, I didn't really feel that much a part of it. It was a situation where I was kind of just along for the ride.'' </P>
<P> Humphries pointed out that opposing quarterback Steve Young also watched his team win a Super Bowl from the sidelines as backup to the great Joe Montana. </P>
<P> ``It's a lot more fun being the guy on the field,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``Me and Steve both have a ring as backups and now it's an opportunity for one of us to get a ring as a starter.'' </P>
<P> And if he does win on Sunday? </P>
<P> ``It's just something that you've always dreamed about and that if it happens to come true, it's something that you will remember forever.'' </P>
<P> Humphries said he expects some of the younger Chargers to be overwhelmed by the media crush, but clearly Means was enjoying the circus atmosphere. </P>
<P> ``They said to expect a lot of reporters, but I can't say I expected this,'' said the bullish back who is the key to San Diego's ball-control running game. </P>
<P> Asked what he would ask himself if he was conducting the interview, Means stood up, grabbed a microphone and said: ''Natrone, at 22, with all this pressure on you, how can you approach your first Super Bowl so loose?'' </P>
<P> Staying loose and having fun is the key to victory, according to the playful second-year professional. </P>
<P> ``We cannot come out tight. If we come out tight like we did in the first game, then the game is going to be over in the first quarter,'' he said, referring to San Diego's 38-15 regular-season loss to the 49ers. </P>
<P> ``I ain't gonna let them tighten up,'' Means said of his teammates. ``I'm going to be in the locker room on the day of the game cracking jokes. </P>
<P> ``I'm keeping everybody loose, that's my role. </P>
<P> ``If I see anybody getting tight I'm going to have to jump on their back and rub 'em on the head a little bit.'' </P>
