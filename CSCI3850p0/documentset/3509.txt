<DATELINE>ZAGREB, Croatia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Up to 15,000 followers of a Bosnian Muslim rebel warlord who fled a government offensive last summer have poured back into their native Bihac region in northwest Bosnia, U.N. officials said Saturday. </P>
<P> Refugees in long rag-tag convoys of cars, buses, tractors and horse-drawn carts have re-entered the town of Velika Kladusa since its recapture in mid-December by renegade Muslim forces opposed to Bosnia's Muslim-led central government. </P>
<P> ``Up to 15,000 refugees have returned in the past two days to the Kladusa area, including about 10,000 yesterday (Friday) alone,'' Peter Kessler, a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, told Reuters. </P>
<P> Bosnian government troops last August crushed a revolt by Bihac Muslims under separatist entrepreneur Fikret Abdic and about 30,000 of his followers fled Velika Kladusa, his base town, to adjacent Serb-held Croatia. </P>
<P> The refugees, including relatives of the millionaire Abdic, were living in two squalid camps inside the rebel Krajina Serb enclave of Croatia which had supported his breakaway fiefdom in Bosnia's remote Bihac region. </P>
<P> But the refugees started trickling back to Kladusa in late December after Abdic forces backed by Krajina Serb artillery and infantry wrested the town back from Bosnian government troops in fierce street-to-street fighting. </P>
<P> A Bosnia-wide cease-fire between the Sarajevo government and the separatist Bosnian Serbs took effect Dec. 24. But it has been largely ignored around Bihac, a Muslim enclave surrounded by hostile Serb forces since June 1992. </P>
<P> Abdic and Krajina Serb forces were pushing south in a bid to roll back government troops toward Bihac town. </P>
<P> U.N. observers reported continued fighting close to the main road south of Kladusa Saturday. </P>
<P> Kessler said UNHCR had not assisted the refugees' return, aside from providing small amounts of fuel and food, because it considered the Kladusa region too dangerous for civilians. </P>
<P> ``UNHCR is not helping because this return is unsafe. The refugees are trying to go back into their homes but there's a large amount of damage from fighting in the past two months. </P>
<P> ``In addition, there is a lot of hostility between people who stayed behind in Kladusa after Abdic fell last summer and the (pro-Abdic) refugees who are returning now,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``Then there is still considerable shooting along the southern confrontation line. It's a very tense area.'' </P>
<P> Bihac town, a U.N. designated ``safe area,'' was pounded by Serb heavy artillery Friday despite the cease-fire accord and a U.N. peacekeeping soldier was injured. </P>
