<P>  President Clinton told in an interview how he had ``decked'' someone who bullied him as a child and said the world had learned through his handling of the Haiti and Iraq crises that he means what he says. </P>
<P> In the interview with Time magazine, the text of which was released to media Sunday, Clinton talked about foreign policy successes in Haiti and Iraq, saying: ``We're doing it better; we're making fewer mistakes.'' </P>
<P> Clinton said an incident when he was at school was ''revealing''. Someone picked on him ``and I felt sort of sorry for him because I knew he had a difficult life, and he was always in a sour mood. And I let him throw a hit on me. </P>
<P> ``He walked home one day; I was walking home from school. I bet that fellow followed me for 30 minutes trying to hit me on the shoulder. And finally I turned round and decked him and he ran off.''  Clinton added: ``I told him not to do it and he didn't believe me. And the people who are dealing with me in the United States will find that out. I realize -- since the people that I deal with around the world may not know me as well as the people I grew up with and may never have seen that story -- that's something that I have to be very clear and explicit about. </P>
<P> ``And I would hope that what happened in Haiti and Iraq would make it clear for all other countries in the future for as long as I'm sitting here,'' he said. </P>
<P> Clinton said there had been no appeasement in his handling of Haiti, where U.S. troops entered peacefully to restore the deposed president, and ``we could not have been any quicker, any more forceful, any more decisive'' in bolstering forces to counter Iraq's recent buildup of forces on the Kuwait border. </P>
<P> ``We're not the world's policeman, but we do have certain responsibilities,'' Clinton said. </P>
