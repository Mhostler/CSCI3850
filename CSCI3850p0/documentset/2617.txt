<P>  French Muslim youths set fire to six cars in the northern town of Amiens during a second consecutive night of anti-police protests, officials said Tuesday. </P>
<P> A few dozen youths demonstrated in the streets without clashing with police and no injuries were reported, the office of the prefect (government representative) said. Over the weekend, about 16 police were injured, some by shotgun pellets, in a riot by 200 people. </P>
<P> Two rioters have been detained. </P>
<P> The youths are children of Harkis -- Muslim French army veterans. They have accused police of using tear gas to break up a teenagers' party Saturday night and say the incident highlights discrimination against them in French society. </P>
<P> The prefect's office says there was no such police intervention. </P>
<P> Harkis were self-defense groups raised by the French army to fight nationalist guerrillas during Algeria's 1954-62 war of independence. When Algeria became independent many Harkis fled and settled in France. </P>
<P> Struggling to integrate into French society and ostracised by other North African immigrants, the estimated 250,000 Harkis and their families have often protested against their living conditions. </P>
