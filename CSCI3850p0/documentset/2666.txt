<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The incoming Republican chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee said Thursday he will seek local control of education and workplace issues but has no plans to dismantle the Education Department. </P>
<P> Rep. William Goodling of Pennsylvania also suggested a way might be found to allow prayer in schools. </P>
<P> Goodling is one of a number of prospective committee chairman named by party leaders to take over when the new Republican majority Congress convenes in January. </P>
<P> At a news conference Goodling said: ``We must empower Americans through local decisions. People, not the federal government, should make key decisions affecting their lives.'' </P>
<P> The Reagan administration came into power in 1981 planning to abolish the Education Department but dropped the idea. </P>
<P> Goodling, a former public school teacher, said he had not seen the need for an education department but added: ``We don't want to spend a lot of time dealing with the past. The Department of Education is there.'' </P>
<P> He said he wanted to make sure it did not interfere with the local operation of the school systems. </P>
<P> On school prayer, a controversial issue on which President Clinton this week indicated flexibility, Goodling said he believed legislation proposed by Rep. Ernest Istook, R-Okla., ''would serve the purpose and not offend people.'' </P>
<P> Istook's proposal would allow local decisions on school prayer but bar forced participation or composition of the prayer by government entities. </P>
<P> Goodling noted he had introduced legislation calling for streamlining and consolidation of workforce preparation programs and providing flexibility to states. </P>
<P> He also suggested that some programs, laws and regulations should have ``sunset'' provisions under which they automatically go off the statute books unless renewed. </P>
<P> He questioned whether the ``current spiderweb of statutes and regulations'' governing the workplace served the need for economic expansion and supported changing the philosophy of the Occupational Safety and Health Adminstration from confrontation between employees and employers to cooperation. </P>
