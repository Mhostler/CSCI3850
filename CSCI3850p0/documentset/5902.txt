<DATELINE>HADDON HEIGHTS, N.J. (Reuter) -</DATELINE>
<P>  A New Jersey police officer was killed and two others were wounded Thursday when they tried to serve a search warrant for weapons, Camden county officials said. </P>
<P> The suspect, whom neighbors said was a transexual, was barricaded inside a house in this middle-class suburb. </P>
<P> Police officer John Norcross was killed and his brother Richard was wounded in the gunfight, said Assistant County Prosecutor Joseph Audino. </P>
<P> An unnamed prosecutor's detective was also shot but his condition could not be immediately determined because he was still outside the house and officers could not get to him. </P>
<P> Police identified the person who was the subject of the warrant as Glenn Nelson. Neighbors said Nelson undertook sex change surgery two years ago. </P>
<P> The neighborhood was startled by an eruption of gunfire -- as many as 100 shots were fired, said neighbor Todd Shaner. </P>
<P> Camden County Undersheriff Tom Gallagher said the county officer, backed by the two local policemen, was trying to serve a search warrant for weapons and an arrest warrant early in the afternoon when the fight broke out. </P>
