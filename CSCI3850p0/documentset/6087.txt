<DATELINE>MOSCOW, April 27 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Moscow told Washington about a blast on a Russian pipeline on Thursday after a U.S. satellite detected flames from the explosion, Itar-Tass news agency said. </P>
<P> ``The Russian side routinely informed the U.S. about the accident on the gas pipeline in the region of the Russian town of Ukhta,'' Tass said, quoting a U.S. State Department official. </P>
<P> Tass said a U.S. spy satellite detected a large fireball after the gas caught fire early on Thursday morning. </P>
<P> An official from the U.S. embassy in Moscow declined to comment on rumours the blast may have set off a security alert in Washington. ``You'll have to ask the CIA or the Pentagon to find that out,'' he said. </P>
<P> Intelligence sources in Washington said they were initially concerned by the size of the flames, which shot hundreds of metres (feet) into the air, but that they quickly established their origin. They did not mention a security alert. </P>
<P> Russian officials played down the blast, which they said had probably been caused by a spark setting fire to a gas leak, but residents in nearby towns said the flames were so bright they thought war had broken out. </P>
<P> The first news of the fire came from the crew of a Japanese Airlines (JAL) jumbo jet heading from Frankfurt to Tokyo who reported seeing flames rising to between 3,000 and 6,000 metres (10,000 to 20,000 feet). </P>
<P> Tass said the flames rose only 100 metres (300 feet). </P>
