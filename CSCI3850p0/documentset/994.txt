<P>  The Security Council Thursday endorsed a proposal to reduce the 18,760-member U.N. force in Somalia by 1,500 troops. </P>
<P> At the same time they warned that continuation of the billion dollar-a-year U.N. operation depended on the Somali factions' resolving their differences. </P>
<P> The troop cut was proposed by Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali in a recent report which said the U.N. Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM II) should be further trimmed as soon as possible to a total of 15,000. </P>
<P> The council gave its approval in a statement read at a brief formal meeting which also strongly condemned a ``premeditated attack on U.N. peacekeepers'' by an armed group near Baidoa August 22 in which seven Indian U.N. soldiers were killed and nine wounded. </P>
<P> The statement, which extended condolences to the Indian government and the bereaved families, expressed grave concern at the ``deteriorating security situation in Somalia'' and deplored attacks and harassment directed at U.N. and other personnel. </P>
<P> The council said it was gravely concerned by the lack of progress in reconciliation among Somali factions, especially the fact that a national reconciliation conference originally scheduled for May 15 had not taken place. </P>
<P> The council said it believed the secretary-general's proposed initial troop reduction ``is appropriate in the circumstances prevailing in Somalia'' and stressed the need to give priority to ensuring the safety and security of U.N. and other international personnel. </P>
<P> ``The council stresses that the nature and the duration of the international support and resources the international community is committing to Somalia, including the continuing presence of UNOSOM II, depend very much on the resolve of the Somali parties to achieve political compromise.'' </P>
<P> It reminded the Somali factions that ``the future of their country lies in their hands'' and again urged them to make every effort to advance the process of political reconciliation. </P>
<P> This echoed a warning by the secretary-general in his recent report that the United Nations would have to reconsider its Somalia operation if rival factions failed to make progress toward reconciliation by the end of September. </P>
