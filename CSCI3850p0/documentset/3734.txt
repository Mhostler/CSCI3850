<P>  Honest produce workers gave back an estimated $80 million worth of negotiable traveler's checks Thursday after finding them in boxes they believed had contained fresh basil for a market, police said. </P>
<P> Herman Marino and his son Keith had driven to John F. Kennedy International Airport to collect the shipment of basil, but when they opened the container at their food distributor in the Bronx, they instead found 39 heavy boxes of tightly-bundled traveler's checks. </P>
<P> Police said the blank checks were fully negotiable. </P>
<P> ``If anyone complained that we didn't ship basil today we had a legitimate excuse,'' quipped another worker, Stephen Weinberg. ``The bank's got it probably, they're handing it out for traveler's checks.'' </P>
<P> Police said another worker, night supervisor Jim Bidetti, called the police and turned over the checks, which were destined for Citibank. </P>
<P> ``Officials at Citibank say that based upon their records the amount of the checks is close to $80 million,'' Police Sgt. Joe O'Connor said. </P>
<P> He said a misreading of container labels by airline workers at the airport had caused the error, but the food distributor collected the basil later and it was still fresh enough to deliver to their customers. </P>
