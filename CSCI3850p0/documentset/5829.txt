<DATELINE>CHICAGO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  About 5,000 people lined up to apply for sewage treatment jobs billed as work in ``unpleasant surroundings and ... very unpleasant odors,'' officials said Tuesday. </P>
<P> What the job seekers apparently smelled was the pay -- $12.88 an hour. </P>
<P> The Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago said the one-day application period Monday drew 5,000 people who will be given a shot at the jobs through a lottery. </P>
<P> The number of jobs, perhaps a dozen or so, will depend on budget considerations. </P>
<P> The scene called to mind the winter of 1992 when 3,000 people lined up in bitter cold outside a new Chicago hotel to apply for jobs. Those positions, by contrast, paid from $5.75 to $9 an hour. </P>
