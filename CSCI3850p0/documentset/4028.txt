<P>  More than 30,000 Sierra Leoneans have fled into Guinea after a rebel attack on the northern town of Kambia last week, overwhelming towns in the border area, local officials in Guinea say. </P>
<P> An emergency committee headed by the prefect of Pamelap, Mohamed Mounir Camara, told a reporter who visited the area on Saturday more than 30,000 refugees from northern Sierra Leone had been registered and the final number could be higher. </P>
<P> Camara said food and drugs were urgently needed. </P>
<P> The border town of Pamelap is six miles north of Kambia on the road between the Sierra Leonean and Guinean capitals. </P>
<P> Rebels struck Kambia last Wednesday, kidnapping seven foreign nuns and a number of local people. The refugees said several people were killed in the attack. </P>
<P> At the Gbalamouya border crossing, refugees carrying their belongings on their heads were crossing into Guinea, while others were heading back to collect their belongings. </P>
<P> Many said the army did nothing to protect them when the rebels attacked. </P>
<P> ``They held the town for completely six hours without meeting any resistance,'' said one refugee. ``Nearly 100 troops deployed in the town disappeared mysteriously.'' </P>
<P> ``The soldiers are looting,'' said one young man carrying a wooden bed on his head. ``They are dismantling beds and other furniture and taking them away in stolen vehicles... Kambia is a ghost town with no food and security.'' </P>
<P> Paramount chief Kandeh Sadou said his home town of Kukuna, 26 miles northeast of Kambia, was virtually deserted and most of the inhabitants had fled. </P>
