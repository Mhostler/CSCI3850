<DATELINE>PALMA DE MAJORCA, Spain (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Three Algerians armed with a knife and a coffee-grinder hijacked a plane Sunday, forced it to fly to Majorca, then surrendered without any demands being met, officials said. </P>
<P> ``At no time have we acceded to any of their demands,'' Gerard Garcia, central government representative in the Balearics, told a news conference. </P>
<P> The three men, said to be in their 20s, set free 35 passengers and four crew members on board the Fokker 27 plane eight hours after landing in Majorca. </P>
<P> The hijackers had threatened to blow up the plane if their demands were not met. The demands included releasing political prisoners in Algeria, resuming elections interrupted in 1991 and refueling the plane to fly to Marseille. </P>
<P> But Garcia said they were armed only with a knife and a shoe-box containing a coffee-grinder. The hijackers said the box contained a bomb. </P>
<P> Airport sources said the hijackers had asked not to be sent back to Algeria. </P>
<P> Algerian ambassador to Spain Abdelaziz Rahabi flew to Palma Sunday to follow the negotiations but did not intervene. Garcia said it would be up to a judge whether they would be extradited. </P>
<P> An airport spokeswoman said the passengers were in good shape and recovering in the VIP lounge. They were expected to fly back to Algeria Monday. </P>
<P> They were released shortly after one of the hijackers left the control tower of the airport where he had been negotiating with Spanish authorities. </P>
<P> Garcia said the Spanish authorities refused to give the hijackers water, fuel or medicine, or to refuel the plane. The Air Algerie plane was surrounded by special Civil Guard and army units during negotiations. </P>
<P> The hijackers described themselves as members of the ``Union of Peaceful Citizens of Algeria'' and threatened to blow up the plane if they were not allowed to fly to Marseille. </P>
<P> Airport director Pedro Meauria said the hijackers had burst into the cockpit soon after takeoff on a regular flight between Algiers and Ouargla, 340 miles to the south in the Sahara desert. </P>
