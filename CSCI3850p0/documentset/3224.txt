<P>  President Ernesto Zedillo moved Wednesday to head off war in the southern state of Chiapas by instructing Congress to form a multi-party commission to seek peace in the troubled state. </P>
<P> A stern-looking Zedillo, in a nationally televised address, said the Chiapas conflict, which broke out New Year's Day when Maya indian rebels seized several towns, has held Mexico hostage for nearly 12 months and that it was time to change the situation. </P>
<P> ``The conflict represents a constant threat to public calm, peace and justice,'' he said. </P>
<P> Zedillo said the commission would consist of seven members of the Mexican Congress selected by the four parties represented in the legislative body. </P>
<P> The commission's multi-party makeup would assure its independence and neutrality in seeking peace with the rebel Zapatista National Liberation Army, the president said. </P>
<P> He said the commission should immediately seek negotiations with the rebels, who this week said renewed war was ``imminent'' in Chiapas after 11 months of cease-fire. </P>
<P> The move appeared to be a desperation measure by Zedillo to stop a war he said no one wants. </P>
<P> The Zapatistas, who say they are seeking improved democracy and justice for indigenous people, issued their threat of fresh fighting after ruling party Gov. Eduardo Robledo took office last week. They and other Robledo opponents claim he won last August's state election fraudulently. </P>
<P> More than 145 people died in nearly two weeks of fighting last January between the rebels and the Mexican army before both sides agreed to a cease-fire January 12. </P>
<P> The Mexican government negotiated a preliminary peace accord with the rebels last March which gave sweeping economic and political concessions, but the Zapatistas later rejected it. </P>
<P> Zedillo, speaking at the presidential residence Los Pinos, said the Zapatistas had rejected earlier peace overtures from him, but that he was determined to have peace in Chiapas. </P>
<P> ``In Chiapas there must not be violence. No one wants it,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``I am sure the Zapatistas do not want violence,'' Zedillo said. </P>
