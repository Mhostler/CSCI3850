<P>  The Masila oilfield in eastern Yemen resumed production Wednesday, a Canadian Occidental Petroleum official in Sanaa said. </P>
<P> The CanOxy official, who asked not to be named, said there were no reports that civil war fighting had damaged any facilities in the Masila field, its pipeline or terminal. </P>
<P> Production was suspended Tuesday while northern troops were capturing the area of its Gulf of Aden terminal from forces of the breakaway south. The terminal is located east of Mukalla, a key port city which northern forces reported capturing Monday. </P>
<P> The terminal was under the control of northern troops but there did not appear to be forces of either side in the oilfield itself, the official said. </P>
<P> Shipping sources in the Gulf confirmed that the terminal at least had changed hands and was now under northern control. </P>
<P> They said a northern commander visited the terminal early Wednesday and told operators they could continue to work normally. </P>
<P> ``Production began again this morning,'' the CanOxy official said. </P>
<P> The company announced the shutdown of from its Calgary headquarters Tuesday, saying it was a precaution. </P>
<P> The closure of the field lasted from Tuesday afternoon to Wednesday morning. </P>
<P> No tankers are currently loading at the terminal but the company has had no notice that scheduled arrivals would be delayed or cancelled, the official said. </P>
<P> The field, which was in South Yemen before the 1990 merger of north and south, has been producing an average of about 150,000 barrel per day (bpd). </P>
<P> Oil industry sources and diplomats say Yemen's share of export revenue from Masila has been paid to an escrow account, since the south declared the merger disolved on May 21. </P>
