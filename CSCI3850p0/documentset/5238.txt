<P> ``A number of questions have been raised about Dr Foster's nomination, and he hearing will examine those issues carefully,'' she said. </P>
<P> ``The committee also needs to hear from Dr Foster himself about hsi goals and plans if he is confirmed to be the nation's Surgeon General,'' she added. </P>
