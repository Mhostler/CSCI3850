<P>  The self-styled ``rebel governor'' of the troubled southern state of Chiapas said his team will lead Mexico toward democracy -- just as soon as he has enough money to buy a desk and chair. </P>
<P> Speaking Friday, one day after declaring the formation of a ``parallel'' government for Chiapas' majority indigenous population, leader Amado Avendano said the rebel state is in financial crisis. </P>
<P> ``We are starting from zero,'' Avendano said at his offices, which an indigenous peasant group is lending to the rebel administration as it tries to establish itself as an alternative to the official ruling party state government of Eduardo Robledo. </P>
<P> ``At the moment, we don't have a desk or a chair where we can sit peacefully, or paper or pens,'' Avendano told reporters. </P>
<P> The Zapatistas launched a bloody rebellion on New Year's Day and this week threatened fresh attacks to force Robledo from power and give formal power to Avendano. </P>
<P> Avendano, the Zapatista rebels and leftist peasant and indigenous groups say Robledo and his ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party stole the August elections through fraud, and have pledged a campaign of civil disobedience to make the state ingovernable. </P>
<P> Robledo took office Thursday in a ceremony attended by President Ernesto Zedillo. </P>
<P> The ``rebel governor'' said he will call on supporters in indigenous villages across the state to stop paying taxes to Robledo's government and instead make contributions to the rebel administration. </P>
<P> Contributions will also be requested from civilian groups around the country and abroad, he said. </P>
<P> His team will at first focus on serving the dozens of villages that have already declared autonomy from the formal state government. He said he believed more and more communities would join the rebel government. </P>
<P> ``This is the launching pad of democracy in Mexico,'' Avendano said. </P>
<P> Chiapas has been hit by a string of violent land seizures and clashes between peasants and landowners in recent weeks and many are waiting to see what the Zapatistas' next move will be. </P>
<P> But there were no reports of violence in Chiapas Friday and the streets of San Cristobal, which was one of several cities the rebels seized in January and quickly abandoned, were quiet. </P>
