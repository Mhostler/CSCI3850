<P>  Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole said Friday he would announce in February or March whether he will run for president in 1996, adding New Jersey Governor Christine Whitman would make a good running mate if he did. </P>
<P> ``She's certainly qualified,'' Dole told Cable News Network's ``Larry King Live'' when asked if he could envision choosing Whitman to be his running mate. </P>
<P> ``If I were the nominee, I'd have to make that decision. She's certainly qualified. She'd be on the list....the short list,'' the Kansas Republican said. </P>
<P> Dole said ``there'll be a lot of good candidates'' in the race for the Republican nomination for the 1996 presidential race. </P>
<P> Texan Republican Senator Phil Gramm Thursday said he will officially declare himself a candidate for the presidency in February, just before setting off on a tour of three states with early primary elections. </P>
<P> The senator is the first among about a dozen prospective GOP presidential candidates -- including Dole and former Vice President Dan Quayle -- to announce a firm date for his candidacy declaration. </P>
<P> Whitman, who defeated incumbent New Jersey Governor Jim Florio in 1992, has become a Republican star by cutting taxes. </P>
