<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Swedish election winner Ingvar Carlsson took the first steps toward forming a minority cabinet Monday, saying he would seek a ``government of cooperation.'' </P>
<P> Carlsson, whose Social Democratic Party (SDP) won Sunday's general election, was speaking after Prime Minister Carl Bildt handed in his center-right coalition government's resignation to the speaker of parliament. </P>
<P> Bildt's coalition won just 147 seats in the 349-seat parliament, far short of the 175 needed to govern. Carlsson's SDP won 162 seats, 13 short of a majority. </P>
<P> ``My aim is to build an effective government of cooperation,'' said Carlsson, indicating he would seek approval for legislation from a variety of potential partners before the cabinet needed to be voted upon in parliament. </P>
<P> Carlsson could seek support from either of two leftist parties -- the Green and the Left parties -- or from the centrist Liberal Party he had earlier hoped might join in forming a permanent coalition. </P>
<P> The 59-year-old Carlsson, prime minister from 1986 to 1991 before being ousted by Bildt, said he would meet the speaker of parliament again Monday evening after she had met other political party leaders. </P>
<P> He named solving the country's economic ills and driving the country's application for European Union (EU) membership as his two main tasks. Swedes will vote on November 13 on membership. </P>
<P> Carlsson named a team of advisers who would be responsible for organizing the transition of power to a Social Democratic government. </P>
<P> Leftist parties have declared they are ready to cooperate with the center-left SDP but Carlsson has said he would prefer to cooperate with the centrist Liberal Party. </P>
<P> The election results showed a strong swing to the left across the country, but Bildt said after handing in his resignation that the shift was tactical rather than ideological. </P>
<P> ``They were protest votes rather than an ideological movement to the left,'' he told reporters. </P>
<P> The 45-year-old conservative, whose moderate monetarist policies proved too dry for Swedish voters, warned Carlsson that the shift to the left would not provide any answers to Sweden's pressing economic problems. </P>
<P> Financial markets agreed Monday and marked down shares, bonds and the Swedish crown, although the fall was controlled and not as drastic as some market players had expected. </P>
