<DATELINE>BUJUMBURA, Burundi (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Gunfire and the boom of grenades blasted the Burundi capital, Bujumbura, as night fell Monday, 24 hours after three Belgians and two government soldiers were murdered in an ambush outside the city. </P>
<P> Hundreds of soldiers patrolled the streets shortly before curfew as the capital of this ethnically-volatile country prepared for another night of shooting and conflict. </P>
<P> The shooting started after a day of ethnic clashes in the city followed the Hutu ambush whose victims included a four- year-old Belgian girl. </P>
<P> As night fell, witnesses said the Hutu stronghold of Kamenge was virtually sealed off by troops, while southern suburbs where Tutsi gangs were known to operate were being patrolled by units of Hutu and Tutsi soldiers. </P>
<P> The normally bustling central market place was dead, closed by Tutsi hardliners earlier Monday after four people were killed in stone-throwing battles between youths of the Tutsi minority and Hutu majority there. </P>
<P> The city was particularly tense after the ambush in which a convoy of cars was targeted as it travelled back to Bujumbura from Njenda Sunday night. </P>
<P> Prime Minister Antoine Nduwayo said he would give no toll for Sunday's attack to avoid scaring people. </P>
<P> A police officer who refused to be named said 17 people, including the Belgians, were killed on a main road seven miles southeast of Bujumbura. Six people were wounded. </P>
<P> Western diplomats and state-run Burundi radio put the toll at three Belgians, including the little girl, and two Burundians killed. A Belgian doctor who treated the wounded said he knew of no more than five dead. </P>
<P> He said a total of eight Belgians in a convoy of three cars were returning late to Bujumbura from a sporting event when they came under fire at Nyamutenderi. </P>
<P> The driver of the lead vehicle, Etienne Waltzing, was shot in the hand. He stepped out of the car to show the gunmen he was white, not Tutsi, but was killed by a bullet in the head. </P>
<P> The doctor said a Belgian woman and her four-year-old daughter were then also killed. Three other Belgians were wounded, including a nine-year-old. </P>
<P> One diplomat said, ``Other foreigners have died, but by accident. This was deliberate.'' </P>
<P> At the scene Monday, the body of one of the attackers still lay in bushes near the road as troops secured the area. </P>
