<P> The Norwegian daily Aftenposten said Tuesday the prize had gone to Rabin and Arafat for their contributions to the 1993 Israeli-PLO peace pact but that the decision had caused a row in the five-member Nobel committee. </P>
<P> The source confirmed the paper's report that Kristansen, a pro-Israeli member of the panel, had said he would step down in protest when the prize is announced Friday because he considered Arafat a former terrorist. </P>
<P> The source said Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres was pressing to be one of the laureates but added ``my feeling is that the decision is definite.'' </P>
<P> The secretive committee has refused to acknowledge it has even taken a decision. It had been reported to be weighing splitting the $950,000 award among Rabin, Arafat, Peres and possibly a second Palestinian. </P>
