<P> ``In an effort to deter more Cubans from risking their lives, effective immediately, the Immigration and Naturalization Service will detain all individuals interdicted. The detention of these people will continue at appropriate facilities pending a determination of how they should be processed,'' Reno said. </P>
<P> The attorney general did not specify where the Cubans would be held. Earlier Thursday, Air Force personnel began building a tent city at the Homestead Air Force Reserve base 30 miles south of Miami. </P>
<P> Under a state emergency plan, the Monroe County sheriff said Thursday he could temporarily shelter up to 2,000 Cubans in the basement at the Key West jail. </P>
<P> The state also plans to use the Boca Chica Naval Air Station in Key West if necessary. </P>
<P> ``I am delighted with the announcement I've just heard,'' Florida Governor Lawton Chiles said on Cable News Network. He called Reno's announcement ``a good firm statement in regard to (Cuban President) Fidel Castro that we're not going to allow him to dictate immigration policy.'' </P>
