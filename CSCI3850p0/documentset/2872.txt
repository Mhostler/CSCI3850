<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The European Union lifted its eight-year arms embargo on Syria Monday, angering Israel which called the move a mistake. </P>
<P> The embargo, imposed in 1986 after allegations of Syrian involvement in a thwarted attempt to smuggle explosives onto an Israeli El Al airliner in London, was lifted at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels. </P>
<P> The move drew immediate fire from Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres who called it a mistake. </P>
<P> ``What should have been lifted is (Syria's) embargo on negotiations, not the embargo on arms,'' he told reporters. </P>
<P> But his Syrian counterpart Farouq al-Shara welcomed the decision which he said was a rebuff to Israeli attempts to meddle in other countries' internal affairs. </P>
<P> He said it was an important step in the direction of securing a complete Middle East peace, but repeated his government's position that Israel must withdraw from the Golan heights captured during the ``six-day'' war. </P>
<P> ``Israel has to withdraw completely from the Golan if there is to be peace in the region,'' he told Reuters. </P>
<P> British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd told reporters the decision had been made with no dissent. </P>
<P> Other EU sanctions against Syria, such as bans on low-level diplomatic meetings, had gradually been lifted by the EU between 1987 and 1990, when Syria sided with the West in the Gulf War. </P>
<P> EU-Syrian relations have improved recently as a reflection of peace accords between Israel, the PLO and Jordan. </P>
