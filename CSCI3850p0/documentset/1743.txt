<P>  First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton visited Florida Saturday to campaign for her younger brother, Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Hugh Rodham, but devoted most of her time at the podium praising her husband. </P>
<P> Rodham, a 44-year-old former public defender, faces a run- off primary election Tuesday against fellow Democrat Mike Wiley, an unemployed radio talk show host from Orlando. The winner will challenge Republican incumbent Senator Connie Mack, whom pollsters say will be tough to beat. </P>
<P> Mrs Clinton, speaking to her brother's supporters during a rally in the Fort Lauderdale suburb of Hollywood, urged voters to send him to Washington. </P>
<P> She also praised President Clinton, saying her husband deserved credit for helping ban assault weapons and put another 100,000 policemen on the street by pushing for passage of the crime bill and for reducing federal spending by $255 billion with his economic plan. </P>
<P> ``He made some specific promises and the vast majoirty of them have already been fulfilled,'' she said. </P>
<P> Although the Clinton health plan failed to make it through Congress this year, Mrs Clinton vowed continued support for the proposal. </P>
<P> ``We have moved health care farther than it's ever been moved before in the history of our country,'' she said. ``We are going to keep going. We will not give up and we will achieve universal health care coverage at affordable cost for America.'' </P>
<P> Hugh Rodham's campaign has focused on protecting Social Security and Medicare benefits, banning assault weapons, and expanding pre-trial intervention programs aimed at rehabilitating first-time drug offenders. </P>
<P> His opponent has called for an end to social entitlement programs, U.S. withdrawal from the United Nations, and an end to legal abortion. </P>
