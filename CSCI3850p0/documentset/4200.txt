<P>  Mario Cuomo, three-term governor of New York until his election defeat last November, is joining the law firm of Willkie Farr & Gallagher as a partner, the firm announced Tuesday. </P>
<P> It said in a statement that Cuomo, a leading liberal Democrat who lost the governorship to a relatively unknown New York Republican, state Sen. George Pataki, will start work Feb. </P>
<P> Founded in 1888, Willkie Farr & Gallagher is one of the nation's leading full-service commercial law firms with its headquarters in New York City. It also has offices in Washington, Paris and London. </P>
<P> Cuomo, who was first elected New York governor in 1982 and declined President Clinton's offer of a U.S. Supreme Court nomination, said he looked forward to joining the firm and ''practicing law in an environment that will present many exceptional professional challenges and that will allow me to use all I have learned about life and the law in my public and private careers.'' </P>
