<DATELINE>DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Prospects for U.N.-mediated peace talks between government and rebels in Tajikistan, scheduled for Monday, faded Friday as the death toll rose in fighting on the Tajik-Afghan border. </P>
<P> Dozens of people were reported killed in the latest flare-up of fighting in the remote eastern region of Gorno-Badakhshan, where opposition forces and Afghan-based Islamic rebels have been staging attacks. </P>
<P> Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Albert Chernyshev, quoted by Interfax news agency, said the government and rebels agreed to meet in Moscow after consultations with the United Nations envoy to Tajikistan, Ramiro Piriz-Ballon. </P>
<P> But a spokesman from Tajik embassy in Moscow said talks were not likely to take place. ``Maybe some other day, later on,'' he told Reuters. ``But definitely not next Monday.'' </P>
<P> A Tajik opposition leader said Thursday his party would agree to talks in Moscow only if border guards withdrew from the frontier and Russia recognized a cease-fire signed last year. </P>
<P> Tajik Deputy Security Minister Anatoly Kuptsov told a news conference that 30 Islamic opposition fighters and six Commonwealth of Independent States border guards were killed in three hours of battles Thursday. </P>
<P> Itar-Tass news agency said two Tajik soldiers were shot dead on the outskirts of the capital Dushanbe early Friday. </P>
<P> With the prospects for talks hanging in balance, Russia, which already has a huge force in Tajikistan, showed signs of becoming even more involved in the conflict. </P>
<P> Tass said President Boris Yeltsin, on vacation in the southern resort of Sochi, reiterated his backing for extra military aid to Tajik government. </P>
<P> Yeltsin was quoted by his press office as saying that joint efforts of other former Soviet republics were necessary. </P>
<P> Interfax said Commonwealth of Independent States foreign ministers, with defense ministers and border guard commanders, were due to meet April 21 to work out joint measures. </P>
<P> Leaders from Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan met in the Kazakh city of Chimkent and called for urgent action to quell fighting in Tajikistan. They proposed separate peace talks in the Kazakh capital, Alma-Ata. </P>
<P> In Afghanistan, government sources and witnesses said Russian planes bombed the northern town of Taloqana and a border district Thursday, killing 125 civilians and wounding 250 in a fourth day of raids on two provinces on the Tajik border. </P>
<P> Russia has denied all such accusations. Interfax quoted the Russian armed forces' press office as saying: ``Russian aircraft did not bomb Afghan territory.'' </P>
<P> The border fighting breaches a cease-fire agreed last year between Dushanbe and opposition leaders who fled to Afghanistan after losing a civil war in 1992. </P>
