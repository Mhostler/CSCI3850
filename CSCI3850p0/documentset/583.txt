<P>  Gunmen shot and wounded an Israeli soldier traveling in an army jeep near Hebron in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday, military sources said. </P>
<P> They said troops were searching for the attackers. </P>
<P> Jewish settler sources said the gunmen fired on the army jeep from a moving vehicle and fled in the direction of Hebron. The attack was similar to one Tuesday near the same place. A soldier was also wounded in that incident. </P>
<P> Settlers said after Tuesday's attack an army decision to thin out forces in the Hebron area was mistaken. </P>
<P> Hebron, home to some 100,000 Palestinians with about 400 Jews living in heavily fortified enclaves, is a flashpoint of Jewish-Arab violence. It is the site of the Tomb of the Patriarchs, which is sacred to both Muslims and Jews. </P>
