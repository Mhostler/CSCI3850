<P>  British and Omani divers have rescued a 20-ton whale off Oman after it was trapped in fishing nets for 29 days, a statement by an environmental group said Sunday. </P>
<P> Rescuers found the 26-foot-long humpback whale sunburned and bleeding in rough waters off one of Oman's most inaccessible coastal areas, said a statement by Oman's Whale and Dolphin Research agency. </P>
<P> The rescue mission this weekend was made more dangerous because the whale was distressed and resisted the divers, it said. </P>
<P> ``The whale was clearly nervous, blowing whilst still under water, bucking its head and thrashing its tail,'' the statement said. </P>
<P> The tail -- ``six feet across and frighteningly powerful'' -- struck one diver in the chest, knocking his air-supplying regulators from his mouth. </P>
<P> ``The net had cut deeply into the whale's head and stretched back along the body, engulfing both flippers. A bundle of ropes, nets and fishing floats were wrapped right around the body and hooked over the dorsal fin. Only the tail remained free,'' the statement said. </P>
<P> ``Blood spurted from the whale's nose as the net was cut and pulled from inch-deep wounds inflicted over the past month as the whale had struggled to free itself,'' the statement said. </P>
<P> It said the whale was set free more than 90 minutes after the start of the rescue. </P>
<P> The humpback whale, one of about 20 species of whales and dolphins in Oman waters, is in danger of extinction throughout the world. It is one of Oman's largest species of marine mammals. </P>
