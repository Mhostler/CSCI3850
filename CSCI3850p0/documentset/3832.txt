<P>  Chicago White Sox vice chairman Eddie Einhorn predicts fans will welcome back baseball this spring even if teams are stocked with replacement players. </P>
<P> ``Baseball is part of the fabric of American society and they want to see it played,'' Einhorn told Reuters after addressing a gathering of sports executives at the Sport Summit conference Wednesday. </P>
<P> Last month club owners declared their intention to field teams with makeshift rosters of career minor leaguers and former major leaguers after negotiations with the players union to end the five-month-long strike reached an impasse. </P>
<P> Einhorn acknowledges that the caliber of play will be inferior with replacement players, but the White Sox executive points to the nearly 30 million people that flocked to minor league games across the country last year as evidence of Americans' appetite for all levels of the game. </P>
<P> ``Too much has been made about the aesthetics of replacement players,'' he said when asked if major league fans would scorn the substitute product. ``It's pretty obvious the aesthetics of it. That's not the issue. </P>
<P> ``People want to see baseball. That's it.'' </P>
<P> Einhorn was confident that teams would be able to find players to put on the field. </P>
<P> ``I'm sure there are enough people playing the game,'' said Einhorn, whose team reportedly became the first to lure a former major leaguer earlier this week by signing 35-year-old hurler Oil Can Boyd, who last pitched in the majors in 1991. </P>
<P> Einhorn said fans would be sympathetic to the plight of the owners. </P>
<P> ``I think everybody feels that this is a temporary thing until it is settled,'' he said. ``Really what the other choice is, is a dark park, no baseball and I think that is not what people want to see.'' </P>
<P> ``You're not going to get 60,000 people and the same TV ratings. That's not the issue. You have to scale everything down. The worst thing is to close the parks and have nothing. </P>
<P> ``Then you are asking for disaster.'' </P>
