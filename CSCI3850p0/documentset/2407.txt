<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Representatives of baseball's striking players and team owners will return to the bargaining table for face-to-face negotiations next week, a spokesman for special mediator William Usery confirmed Friday. </P>
<P> The site of the talks has not yet been decided but negotiations are expected to resume as early as next Wednesday, possibly in Washington. </P>
<P> ``We think Wednesday or Thursday, we're not sure where yet,'' Dick Conn told Reuters. ``We're still negotiating for the negotiations.'' </P>
<P> The talks could go beyond Friday, Conn said. </P>
<P> Negotiators for the owners and players met with Usery Thursday in Washington and both sides agreed to resume talks next week. </P>
<P> There has only been one joint meeting between the owners and players since September 9, an introductory meeting with Usery on October 19 in Washington. </P>
<P> Usery, a former labor secretary under President Ford and one of the top labor mediators in the nation, was appointed as special mediator for baseball's labor dispute by President Clinton on October 14. </P>
<P> Usery has been holding separate talks with both sides in an attempt to familiarize himself with the issues prior to the resumption of formal negotiations. </P>
<P> The baseball strike began August 12 and the owners cancelled the remainder of the season and the playoffs and World Series September 14, marking the first time in 90 years that the World Series did not take place. </P>
<P> Usery helped negotiate an end to a 1974 National Football League strike and mediated a coal miners strike last year. </P>
