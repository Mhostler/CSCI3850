<P> U.S. District Judge Deborah Robinson ordered Francisco Martin Duran, a 26-year-old hotel worker from Colorado, held without bail for psychiatric evaluation as authorities took the first step toward prosecuting him for the Saturday afternoon attack that injured no one but stunned the nation as an assault on America's most hallowed historical shrine. Robinson also ordered Duran -- who did not enter a plea to the charges -- to return for a second court hearing on Wednesday. </P>
<P> In asking for the mental test, prosecutor John Finnegan said a letter found in Duran's pickup truck, parked near the White House, ``brings into question whether the defendant is truly competent to proceed.'' Public defender Leigh Kenny argued that the motion was premature, but was overruled. </P>
<P> Duran, wearing a black shirt and open-necked black shirt, said nothing during the initial court hearing at which he was charged with illegal possession of a firearm, unlawful use of a firearm in the commission of a felony, destruction of government property and assaulting a U.S. Secret Service Officer. In combination the four charges carry a maximum possible penalty of 35 years in prison. </P>
<P> Authorities accused Duran, whose motives were not immediately known, of pulling a Chinese-made semi-automatic rifle from under a raincoat on Pennsylvania Avenue and firing 20 to 30 shots through the iron White House fence. Several shots struck the mansion before two passersby wrestled Duran to the ground and held him for White House security guards. </P>
<P> Duran reportedly served over three years in federal prison for assault when he was in the U.S. Army. Convicted felons are prohibited from owning firearms in the United States. </P>
