<P> Kees Wijnobel, leader of a project to rebuild medical facilities in Somalia, was in a stable condition in a Nairobi hospital where he was being treated for serious gunshot wounds, officials said Sunday. </P>
<P> Four other members of his medical team were also evacuated and their organization, Memisa, was reconsidering its activities in Somalia, a spokeswoman said. </P>
