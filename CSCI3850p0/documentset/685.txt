<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Tom Snyder, current host of CNBC's late night interview program, will move to CBS in early December to host the ``Late Late Show'' following the Late Show with David Letterman, CBS said Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``Once David suggested Tom Snyder, we immediately ditched the idea of anyone else ... we all concluded that David was, as usual, absolutely right, Tom's the man,'' said Howard Stringer, president of CBS Broadcast Group, at a news conference announcing the widely rumored move for the veteran broadcaster. </P>
<P> Stringer said Letterman, the current king of late night television, had lobbied for Snyder, who from 1973-82 held down the late-night slot on NBC's ``Tomorrow'' show after Johnny Carson before being replaced by Letterman. </P>
<P> He said Snyder, 57, who has worked more than 30 years as a newsman, raconteur and talk show host on television and radio, has ``the insouciance that connects him directly to Dave.'' </P>
<P> Letterman described Snyder as ``first and foremost, entertaining ... a gifted broadcaster and communicator.'' </P>
<P> Snyder commented that, with young comedians like Conor O'Brien and Greg Kinnear -- the late, late TV hosts on NBC -- ''the trend has been young ... and funny.'' But he said for CBS to put a young comedian into the post-Letterman slot would be ''stupid.'' </P>
<P> Letterman poked fun at Snyder's unceremonious exit from his last assignment in New York -- as anchor on the WABC ''Eyewitness News'' show -- by holding aloft his middle finger and saying good night to his audience as Snyder once did. </P>
<P> Both Letterman and Snyder said his appointment was an indication that ``experience counts'' and that television does not belong only to the MTV generation. </P>
<P> Snyder said the Late Late Show will be simulcast on CBS radio and will originate live from Los Angeles, beginning in late December. It will be produced by Letterman's production company, Worldwide Pants Inc. </P>
<P> Letterman, who signed with CBS a year ago, had stipulated as part of his agreement with the network that he would produce the show that followed his. </P>
<P> Snyder said his show on CBS will change little from what he is currently doing on CNBC. ``If I have a strength it is in being able to conduct conversations that are informing and entertaining with people on a one-on-one basis.'' </P>
<P> The biggest hurdle facing the new show may be clearances. </P>
<P> Observers such as NBC West Coast president Don Ohlmeyer have questioned whether CBS will be able to secure timeslots for Snyder, citing the newly acquired leverage stations have based on the recent flurry of network affiliation switches. </P>
