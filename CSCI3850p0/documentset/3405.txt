<P>  Nepal's new communist government, fresh from winning an overwhelming vote of confidence, unveiled the outlines of an economic program Friday that shunned radical change. </P>
<P> King Birendra read the policy statement of Prime Minister Man Mohan Adhikary's communist government to parliament, the day after Adhikary won a test of confidence without losing a single vote. </P>
<P> Adhikary, a lifelong anti-monarchist, and King Birendra were arch-foes during pro-democracy demonstrations that ended the monarch's absolute powers in 1990. </P>
<P> Adhikary's Communist Unified Marxist-Leninist (UML) party won a narrow plurality in last month's elections but survived the vote of confidence with the support of the opposition. </P>
<P> The government's policy statement confirmed expectations that Adhikary was not inclined to diverge far from the former ruling Congress Party's free-market policies, analysts said. </P>
<P> Congress warned Adhikary before Thursday's vote of confidence that his government, 15 votes short of an overall majority in the 205-seat parliament, could only survive with the backing of the opposition. </P>
<P> ``My government will follow the policy of encouraging the national and foreign investors for the development of power projects,'' King Birenda said. </P>
<P> The government said it would encourage private sector industries based on indigenous raw materials, and said foreign aid, Nepal's economic lifeblood, would be fully utilized. </P>
<P> This program is ``a repetition of what has been said during the last three or four years. There is no new approach and strategy to solving the country's problems except promises,'' said Prakash Chandra Lohani, a deputy with the pro-palace Rastriya Prajatantra Party. </P>
<P> Adhikary said he wanted to maintain close relations with both of Nepal's neighbors, China and India, and would visit India in the near future. </P>
