<P>  There were probably few people happier to see 1994 end than convenience store clerk Onkar Singh. </P>
<P> Singh, who works the midnight shift at a Circle K convenience store in the Seattle suburb of Renton, was robbed six times on the job last year, police spokeswoman Penny Bryant said Monday. </P>
<P> Bryant said that while ``it's not totally unheard of to see stores hit more than once,'' the robbery spree at the Circle K, which was hit seven times last year, was extremely unusual, especially since Singh was on duty six of the times. </P>
<P> According to police, Singh was roughed up in two of the incidents and threatened several times with handguns, but has not been seriously hurt in any of the robberies, all of which took place between midnight and 5 a.m. </P>
<P> Bryant said one suspect has been caught and pleaded guilty to one of the robberies, while the other crimes are unsolved. </P>
<P> Singh told the Seattle Times that he had no plans to leave his job, which he began in late 1993. </P>
