<DATELINE>BEIJING (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  China confiscated 30,000 fake computer discs in raids in Beijing's most notorious pirating district, as U.S. and Chinese officials Friday extended talks to avert a trade war over intellectual property piracy. </P>
<P> Four days of efforts by U.S. and Chinese negotiators to prevent a looming trade war over intellectual property rights violations in China made some progress, but significant differences remained and talks would stretch through the weekend, U.S. and Chinese officials said. </P>
<P> In Beijing's Zhongguancun district -- China's ``Silicon Valley,'' famed for its software pirates -- raids Thursday morning netted more than 30,000 fake Maxell discs after the Beijing Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce acted on complaints from Japan's Maxell Asia Ltd. </P>
<P> The administration sent six teams into Zhongguancun in northwest Beijing where they seized 10,000 fake Maxell discs in one warehouse alone, the Xinhua news agency said. </P>
<P> Wei Qixue, head of the Patent and Trademark Office under the China Council for Promotion of International Trade, said the move was intended to crack down on trademark infringement and create an ideal environment for foreign investors, Xinhua said. </P>
<P> Piracy of computer discs is a major U.S. complaint being raised in the ongoing talks in Beijing. </P>
<P> ``U.S. negotiators have had frank and detailed discussions with their Chinese counterparts on protection for audiovisual products, computer software, border enforcement and trademarks,'' a U.S. embassy spokesman quoted an official statement as saying after Friday's talks. </P>
<P> ``Some progress has been made but significant differences have yet to be resolved,'' he said. Negotiations would continue over the weekend. </P>
<P> Both sides have been tightlipped about talks which began late Tuesday, just hours after the arrival of U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Lee Sands. </P>
<P> Beijing told Washington orders for Boeing airliners worth $2 billion could be lost unless an accord was reached by a Feb. 26 deadline. </P>
<P> The China Daily newspaper said the orders might have to be canceled by China Southern Airlines, based in the boomtown of Guangzhou. </P>
<P> ``We sincerely hope the two sides will reach a successful agreement in the end as the trade war will benefit neither side,'' the newspaper quoted Ding Yuhua, general manager of the airline's Import and Export Trading Corp, as saying. </P>
<P> A trade war would not affect a contract for more than $1 billion signed in 1993 for six Boeing-777 airliners, with two of the planes due to arrive in Guangzhou at the end of this year. </P>
<P> However, China Southern had planned to place orders worth more than $2 billion to buy another eight Boeing-777 planes and 25 Boeing-737 planes in the next few years, Ding said. </P>
<P> ``We might have to turn to other European models instead,'' he said, adding Airbus had offered airliners to China Southern. </P>
<P> China and the United States have announced mutual sanctions on goods worth around $1 billion, after the eighth round of anti-piracy talks since last June ended without agreement on Jan. 28. </P>
<P> No date has been set for an end to the Sino-U.S. talks, which could stretch right up to Feb. 26 when the tit-for-tat sanctions are to take effect. </P>
<P> Beijing says a trade war could be averted if the United States drops what it calls excessive and unreasonable demands. </P>
<P> In the United States, Trade Representative Mickey Kantor has said China should carry out raids on 29 compact disc plants in southern China that produced 75 million pirated compact discs last year and begin reforms that would protect copyrights on software, music and films. </P>
<P> China insists it has already taken numerous actions to curb piracy and will persist with further tough measures as far as it is able. </P>
