<P>  Investigators probing a tanker intercepted in the Gulf last week believe it was carrying gas oil from Iraq to Iran, shipping sources said on Wednesday. </P>
<P> They said the 29,687-ton Katerina P was carrying between 15,000 and 19,000 tons of gas oil when it was intercepted and boarded last week by the U.S. navy enforcing U.N. sanctions. </P>
<P> It was now anchored off the shores of Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, they added. </P>
<P> They said the Liberian-flagged Katerina P had apparently been involved in boycott busting for ``for quiet some time,'' adding it had been shuttling between Iraq and Iran carrying gas oil from Iraq to Iran and sailing back with Iranian fuel oil. </P>
<P> They said the captain of the tanker had denied any involvement in sanctions busting but crew members had apparently said that it had been to Iraq. </P>
<P> The charges could not be confirmed officially and Iran has repeatedly denied reports in the oil market that it was trading oil products with Iraq in contravention of the embargo imposed on dealings with Baghdad after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. </P>
<P> A U.S. military spokesman said last week the tanker was intercepted off the Iranian coast in international waters carrying 19,000 tons of oil believed to have been shipped from Khor al-Zubayr in Iraq. </P>
<P> It was the first known interception of an oil cargo Iraq is suspected of exporting illegally in defiance of U.N. sanctions. </P>
<P> The U.S. Navy said the boarding was in line with an operation that inspects ships to enforce U.N. sanctions. </P>
