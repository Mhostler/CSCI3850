<P>  An opposition bid to cut the powers or unseat Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze foundered Friday when the Caucasus republic's parliament failed to achieve a quorum. </P>
<P> Fewer than half the 220 deputies were present for the emergency session, the last before the legislature adjourned for its summer recess until September. </P>
<P> One opposition group had been drafting a motion to cut back the head of state's powers significantly. </P>
<P> Another, more radical, motion would have abolished the post of head of state altogether, leaving the parliamentary speaker as the formal leader of this nation of 5.4 million people. </P>
<P> Shevardnadze, 66, returned from Moscow in 1992 to take the helm after a ruinous power struggle had wrecked central Tbilisi. He has survived the near-secession of the Black Sea province of Abkhazia, economic collapse and an epidemic of banditry. </P>
