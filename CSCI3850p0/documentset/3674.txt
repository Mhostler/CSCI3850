<P>  China's first nuclear power plant, in the eastern province of Zhejiang, will complete its first inspection and refuelling and rejoin the power grid on January 29, the China Daily newspaper said Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``This was the first refuelling carried out at the Qinshan plant since it went into operation three years ago on Dec. 15, 1991,'' it quoted Yao Qiming, general manager of the Qinshan Nuclear Power Company, as saying. </P>
<P> The 300,000-kilowatt Chinese-designed Qinshan plant was China's first nuclear station to go into operation. </P>
<P> Inspection of the plant found that used nuclear fuel had been completely consumed and the turbine rotor was in good condition, Yao said. </P>
<P> The plant had generated 4.043 billion kilowatt hours of electricity before stopping production on Oct. 21 to replace a third of its nuclear fuel, he said. </P>
<P> Construction of the second phase of the power station, which is scheduled to add two new 600,000-kilowatt generating units by the year 2001, is in full swing, the newspaper quoted Yao as saying. </P>
<P> More than 10 other Chinese cities are conducting feasibility studies on constructing nuclear power stations, and a construction site for a new nuclear plant has already been selected in Liaoning province in the northeast, China Daily quoted a spokesman for the China National Nuclear Corporation as saying. </P>
<P> Other than Qinshan, China's only other operating nuclear power station is the French-designed Daya Bay plant in Guangdong province near Hong Kong. </P>
