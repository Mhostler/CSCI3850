<P>  Zimbabwe's government says it will sell or cull 5,000 elephants from its main national park to relieve pressure on the environment there. </P>
<P> National Parks' chief ecologist Peter Mundy said Wednesday night Zimbabwe's largest Hwange park in the northwest had 31,000 elephants instead of the 20,000 that it could adequately cater to. </P>
<P> ``We are going to advertise soon for people to come and buy the elephants and translocate them. They may get a quota of the animals and we may have to cull the remainder,'' Mundy told Zimbabwe's state-run news agency ZIANA. </P>
<P> Animal conservationists said the move was certain to spark controversy, noting that few countries were willing to buy the elephants because of the high costs of transporting them. </P>
<P> ``This leaves the government with the option to kill most of these animals and we are opposed to this,'' said one local conservationist who declined to be named. </P>
<P> Zimbabwe, with around 80,000 elephants, says they are too many. Together with neighboring states such as Botswana, it wants a resumption in the sale of ivory banned by the international community five years ago. </P>
