<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A federal grand jury has widened an already sweeping indictment of Philadelphia's top Cosa Nostra crime family leadership, adding three new persons and arresting two of them. </P>
<P> The new, 13-count indictment unsealed Thursday raises to 27 the number charged with crimes including murder, racketeering and extortion, the U.S. Attorney's office in Philadelphia announced. </P>
<P> Two of those newly named -- Gaetano ``Tommy'' or ''Horsehead'' Scafidi of Philadelphia and Giuseppe ``Napoleon'' Palazzolo of Haddon Heights, N.J. -- were arrested without incident Thursday by the FBI and police. </P>
<P> A third, Santo Bravata, remains at large. </P>
<P> The three were indicted on racketeering violations including murder conspiracy. </P>
<P> Included in both indictments is the reputed head of the Philadelphia mob, John Stanfa, who was arrested when the orignal indictment was handed down in March. </P>
<P> Four of those indicted already have pleaded guilty. </P>
<P> Many of the charges stem from a bloody mob war that reputedly broke out between Stanfa and a rival faction led by Joseph Merlino, who was released this week from a one-year prison sentence for parole violation. </P>
<P> Merlino narrowly escaped assassination in 1993 when he was shot in the leg and buttocks and an associate, Michael Ciancaglini, was killed as the two left Merlino's Philadelphia clubhouse. </P>
<P> Stanfa is charged with ordering attempts to kill Merlino and seven others. </P>
