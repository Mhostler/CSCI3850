<P>  Canadian peacekeepers will stay in Bosnia at least until their current U.N. mandate expires in March despite growing dangers to their mission, Prime Minister Jean Chretien said Thursday. </P>
<P> Chretien rejected opposition politicians' calls to pull out of Bosnia hours after Serbs freed 55 Canadian peacekeepers they were holding for two weeks as ``human shields'' against further NATO air strikes. </P>
<P> Defense officials said 20 Canadian soldiers detained at Ilijas since Nov. 23 had returned to their base camp at Visoko, while 30 others were being relieved at U.N. observation posts in central Bosnia. </P>
<P> ``The situation is very bad there, but the president of Bosnia (Alija Izetbegovic) pleaded with me to try to keep our troops there,'' Chretien told parliament. </P>
<P> ``Canada has no political interests in the area,'' he said. ''Our only interest is peace and to help the civilian population.'' </P>
<P> Chretien said his government will review the situation in January to decide whether to stay in Bosnia beyond Canada's current mandate that expires at the end of March. </P>
<P> Right-wing politicians have called for Canada to pull out because the U.N. Protection Force mission has become too dangerous and there is no peace to keep in Bosnia. </P>
<P> The Canadians freed were among some 300 U.N. peacekeepers of various nationalities seized by Bosnian Serb forces as an insurance against air strikes. </P>
<P> They were detained after NATO air raids last month to try to block a Serb assault in northern Bosnia on the Muslim town of Bihac, which is under U.N. protection. </P>
<P> French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said Wednesday that a U.N. withdrawal seemed unavoidable and NATO's supreme allied commander, U.S. Gen. George Joulwan, said that contingency plans were being drawn up for a possible U.N. pullout. </P>
<P> But Canadian officials said a U.N. withdrawal from the war-torn country could lead to a ``bloodbath.'' </P>
<P> Chretien said Canada would only withdraw from Bosnia if the situation became disastrous or if the international arms embargo was lifted, as Republican members of Congress have advocated in Washington. </P>
