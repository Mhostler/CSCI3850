<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Senate leaders said Sunday they agreed with House Speaker Newt Gingrich's suggestion that reform of the Medicare program should be uncoupled from ongoing efforts to balance the budget by the year 2002. </P>
<P> Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole and Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan favor removing Medicare reform from the current budget process and dealing with it separately later. </P>
<P> The government health care system for the elderly has been an increasing drain on the budget because of rising costs and an aging population. The program is headed for bankruptcy in the next decade. </P>
<P> Dole, speaking on ABC's ``This Week with David Brinkley,'' said Republicans want to preserve and protect Medicare. </P>
<P> ``We're not talking about budget cuts,'' the Kansas Republican said, adding that Republicans would be making statements on the subject Monday or Tuesday. </P>
<P> But Dole, who is running for president, conceded it would be ``difficult'' to balance the budget by 2002 if Medicare is exempted from the budget process. </P>
<P> Moynihan, the senior Democrat on the finance committee, said on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' that Medicare reform should not be approached as a means of balancing the budget. </P>
<P> ``It is not long for this world at the present rate of the trust funds, and we have to attend to it, and we can. It's normal government, and we will,'' the New York Democrat added. </P>
<P> Gingrich said Friday that Republicans would propose a major overhaul of Medicare, maintaining the current system but giving elderly Americans multiple health care choices. </P>
<P> Gingrich also said Medicare would be separated from efforts to balance the budget. </P>
<P> Gingrich also released a letter to President Clinton asking for recommendations to Congress no later than May 15 to address the Medicare crisis and calling on him to begin building a national consensus on how to make Medicare solvent. </P>
<P> He said several House committees would be holding hearings on Medicare. </P>
<P> The Clinton administration has said the problems of Medicare and the Medicaid program that helps the poor must be addressed in the context of overall health reform. </P>
<P> Its complex health reform plan collapsed in the last Congress and the administration has not come up with any alternative this year, saying it is waiting to negotiate with Congress on the matter. </P>
