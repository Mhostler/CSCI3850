<P>  Priceless treasures stolen last December from Budapest's Jewish museum will be shipped back to Hungary from Romania, where they were found last month, a police spokesman said Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``The treasures will be back tonight at Tokol military airport (just south of Budapest),'' National Police spokesman Laszlo Garamvolgyi said in a telephone interview. </P>
<P> ``A part of the treasures will be put on display after the plane landed,'' he added. </P>
<P> In a break-in last year, thieves climbed scaffolding to enter Budapest's Jewish museum and stole most of the items from one of Europe's richest collections of Jewish devotional objects and art. Many of them were irreplaceable parts of the collection started in 1896. </P>
<P> Gusztav Zoltai, director of the Federation of Jewish Religious Communities of Hungary, said the value of the treasures was put by police experts at tens of millions of dollars. </P>
<P> Garamvolgyi said all the treasures that the Romanian police had found in Dascalu village, said at the time to represent 90 percent of the whole booty, will be returned. The remaining part of the collection was yet to be found. </P>
<P> Two alleged perpetrators, Stefan Emilian and Nicolae Chirita, both Romanian born but with dual Romanian-German citizenship, have been arrested, Romanian police said in July. </P>
