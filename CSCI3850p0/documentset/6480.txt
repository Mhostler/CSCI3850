<P>  Kremlin forces launched a heavy bombardment of rebel positions in southern Chechnya Thursday night, effectively wrecking any chance that a cease-fire might be extended. </P>
<P> Russian troops, using artillery and rockets, started bombarding the village of Serzhen-Yurt and rebel bases in nearby mountains at around 9 p.m. -- three hours before the truce was to expire. </P>
<P> Fires could be seen raging in Serzhen-Yurt, 12 miles from the capital, Grozny. </P>
<P> Shells and rockets exploded every 20 seconds as the Russian troops concentrated on their targets. Air force planes dropped flares over the entire area, lighting up the skies for miles around. </P>
<P> At least 15 Russian armored personnel carriers thundered down the road leading southeast from Grozny just hours before the truce was scheduled to end at midnight -- 4 p.m. EDT. </P>
<P> The Interfax news agency quoted Russian Lt. Gen. Mikhail Yegorov, Moscow's military commander for Chechnya, as saying the two-week cease-fire had ``brought no positive results from a military point of view.'' </P>
<P> ``Once it expires at midnight, federal troops ... will continue to disarm and destroy illegal armed units,'' he said. </P>
<P> A Russian officer at a roadblock outside the southeastern town of Shali said his men had been ordered to close the road to Vedeno -- 25 miles to the south of Grozny -- where rebel headquarters are now situated. </P>
<P> ``We are all on alert. Come back tomorrow and you may see a war,'' said one soldier at the roadblock. </P>
<P> Russian President Boris Yeltsin ordered the latest cease-fire in deference to President Clinton and dozens of other world leaders who had gathered in Moscow to mark the 50th anniversary of victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. </P>
<P> Clinton urged Yeltsin, who sent troops into Chechnya five months ago to crush an independence bid, to extend the truce. </P>
<P> Yeltsin said at a joint post-summit news conference Wednesday that Russian armed forces were no longer fighting in Chechnya because they had handed the operation over to Interior Ministry troops. </P>
<P> But minutes after he spoke helicopter gunships blasted Serzhen-Yurt. </P>
<P> National Security Adviser Anthony Lake told reporters in Kiev before news of Thursday's bombardment broke: ``The fighting has in recent days been increasing and I think that you would see the same pattern continuing.'' </P>
<P> Lake is accompanying Clinton at his summit in Ukraine with Preisdent Leonid Kuchma. </P>
<P> ``In our view, and as the president said very firmly in his televised address to the Russian people (in Moscow Wednesday), we consider this a tragedy,'' Lake said. </P>
<P> ``We hope there can be an indefinite extension of the cease-fire -- that begins to work better -- as well as political conclusion to what is a tragedy, not only for the people of Chechnya but also a factor that is damaging reform within Russia and damaging Russia's relations with other nations.'' </P>
