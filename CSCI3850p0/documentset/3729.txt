<P>  Anti-nuclear activists marched off from Brussels Thursday to the sound of beaten oil drums at the start of a 3,400-mile walk to Moscow. </P>
<P> The activists, accompanied by fire eaters at the start of their walk in front of the headquarters of the European Commission, are campaigning for the phasing out of nuclear energy, a halt to nuclear weapons testing and the dismantling of nuclear weapons. </P>
<P> They want to promote more environment-friendly alternatives to nuclear and fossil energy such as wind power. </P>
<P> France, with 56, has the most nuclear reactors in operation in Europe, followed by Britain with 37. Russia has 28. </P>
<P> The march will take in Paris and London en route to Moscow via Germany, the Czech Republic and Austria. </P>
<P> About 150 walkers plan to end the journey in Moscow on Oct. 12, the organizers said. </P>
<P> American Blackfoot Indians have joined the walk because they need Europeans' help against nuclear dumping on their land, a representative said. </P>
