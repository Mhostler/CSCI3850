<P>  A. Kenneth Pye, who resigned as president of Southern Methodist University last month due to declining health, died Monday of cancer. He was 62. </P>
<P> Pye, who resigned June 22 from the private university in Dallas, was on vacation in Colorado at the time of his death, the university said. </P>
<P> Pye became the ninth president of SMU in the fall of 1987, just after the university's football program was banned from National Collegiate Athletic Association play because of booster payments to players. </P>
<P> ``Pye quickly restored the integrity and credibility of SMU athletics by instituting tough reforms, including closer supervision of athletics and a system of checks and balances to guard against future problems,'' the Dallas-based university said. </P>
<P> The football program resumed NCAA play in 1989. </P>
<P> Prior to working at SMU, Pye was with Duke University for 21 years, including twice as university chancellor and twice as dean of the law school. </P>
<P> Pye, who was born in New York City, is survived by his wife, Judith, and their son, Henry. </P>
