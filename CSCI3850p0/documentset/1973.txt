<P> Release at 6:00 p.m.  Medicare patients living near major medical centers are sent to the hospital far more than the elderly in areas lacking extensive hospital services, a new study found. </P>
<P> The study, published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine, found Medicare recipients in the Boston area have a readmission rate that is 64 percent higher than older people living in the New Haven, Conn. region. </P>
<P> The findings add to a 1987 study which suggested that older patients in the Boston area are sent to the hospital more than they need to be. </P>
<P> That study found although the two communities had similar demographics and illness patterns, the hospitalization rate was 55 percent higher in Boston. </P>
<P> Skeptics have suggested that, instead of showing that Boston-area residents are sent to the hospital more than they need to be, the severity of the illnesses in Boston may be greater. </P>
<P> In an effort to resolve the controversy, Dr. Elliott Fisher of the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in White River Junction, Vt., and his colleagues looked at Medicare claims for residents of the two areas. </P>
<P> ``We found that Medicare beneficiaries who were hospitalized in Boston for myocardial infarction (heart attack), stroke, hip fracture, gastrointestinal bleeding, or potentially curative surgery for cancer had a 64 percent higher average readmission rate'' than those hospitalized in New Haven, they said. </P>
<P> ``Severity of illness among the patient populations of the two cities are unlikely to explain these findings,'' they concluded. </P>
<P> One explanation, they said, may be that there are more services available in the Boston area, so doctors may be more willing to take advantage of them. </P>
