<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark., (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The legal battle over a Little Rock Christmas light show escalated Thursday when opponents asked the Arkansas Supreme Court to immediately block the spectacle. </P>
<P> Angry homeowners whose properties adjoin the display fear ''irreparable harm'' as ``hostages of a nuisance,'' their attorney said. </P>
<P> Jennings Osborne, an eccentric, multi-millionaire biomedical executive, annually wraps his sprawling, suburban Little Rock estate in more than three million red holiday lights, attracting tens of thousands of spectators to the affluent neighborhood, to the outrage of his neighbors. </P>
<P> The Arkansas Supreme Court last week declared the light show a public nuisance and ordered Osborne to drastically scale back his display or eliminate it altogether. </P>
<P> The Osbornes responded Tuesday by asking the Court to stay its ruling while it appealed to the Supreme Court. </P>
<P> The Osbornes contend their Christmas extravaganza is a Constitutionally-protected exercise of religion. </P>
<P> The petition to the state Supreme Court seeks immediate action to block the Osborne's outdoor celebration because, according to the legal filing, the Osborne's ``have continued with the construction of massive light displays on their property.'' </P>
<P> ``It is clear that Mr. Osborne intends to defy the rule of law and to turn on his lights in defiance of the Supreme Court's ruling,'' said Gary Corum, attorney for disgruntled neighbors. </P>
<P> ``No man can or should defy the law, no matter how much wealth he has, no matter what his position, or his influence,'' Corum told reporters. </P>
<P> Sam Perroni, attorney for the Osbornes, said late Thursday that Corum ``is over-reacting, just as his clients have been over-reacting.'' </P>
<P> Perroni said the Arkansas Supreme Court's ruling was not final under its rules of procedure. Asked if that meant the Osbornes would indeed turn on their lights, Perroni said: ``I've been telling people that we'll have lights this Christmas. The Osbornes will turn on the lights when they're ready to be turned on.'' </P>
