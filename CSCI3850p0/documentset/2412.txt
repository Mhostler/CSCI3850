<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The criminal investigation of outgoing Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy is in gear, and more than 30 people have been questioned about Espy's activities, Independent Counsel Donald Smaltz said Friday. </P>
<P> ``We're rolling,'' said Smaltz in a brief session with reporters to introduce the team of lawyers he has assembled. </P>
<P> The group will investigate a wide array of charges against Espy that include accepting illegal gifts from companies his agency regulates. </P>
<P> Smaltz, appointed in September as the Justice Department's special prosecutor in the Espy probe, said he was limited in what he could say about the investigation because a grand jury is now involved in the case, but that ``there are no startling developments to report.'' </P>
<P> Smaltz said his team has talked to at least 32 people, and ''maybe higher as of today,'' in the first phase of the investigation into Espy's activities. </P>
<P> Espy first came under under investigation in the spring. He was accused of violating federal laws by accepting gifts from people and organizations regulated by his department, including the country's largest poultry processor, the Arkansas-based Tyson Foods Inc. </P>
<P> Over the summer, the scope of the probes widened to look at allegations that Espy had improperly charged the government for vehicles used for personal affairs and had taken personal trips financed by taxpayers' money. </P>
<P> The investigation, which at one point was also being conducted by the White House legal office, eventually led to the charge that Espy's girlfriend had improperly received a $1,200 educational scholarship from a Tyson foundation. </P>
<P> It was this charge, said administration officials, that pushed Espy on Oct. 3 to announce his resignation by year's end so he could devote his energies full-time to defending his reputation. </P>
<P> Smaltz said he just completed assembling his team of five lawyers earlier this week. </P>
<P> The group has a range of experience from investigating and prosecuting white-collar crime and public corruption cases to public defense and handling multi-million-dollar corporate theft cases. </P>
<P> Smaltz said the workload of the investigation has been divided up among the lawyers depending on their various expertise, but would not elaborate. </P>
<P> Smaltz also has at his disposal six full-time investigators, five from the FBI and one from the Agriculture Department's inspector general's office. </P>
<P> Smaltz told reporters the investigation is ``going very well,'' and said, ``we're busy.'' </P>
<P> The probe is likely to continue for several months, and Smaltz predicted earlier that it would last at least six months and maybe up to a year. </P>
<P> Espy, a former congressman from Mississippi and the first black to become Agriculture Secretary, has repeatedly denied breaking any laws, but in announcing his resignation, said he had been careless and apologized to President Clinton and Agriculture Department employees. </P>
