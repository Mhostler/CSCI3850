<DATELINE>BEAVERTON, Ore (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Police said Friday they were investigating claims by the owner of an adult-care facility that he killed four terminally ill elderly people. </P>
<P> Jon Self, operator of the Beach House adult foster-care home in this Portland suburb, confessed to police that he killed three men and a woman who had terminal illnesses, according to an affidavit filed by police to obtain a search warrant. </P>
<P> Beaverton police spokesman Mark Hyde said Self had not been charged with any crime pending further investigation. Hyde said three of the bodies had been cremated but said police plan to exhume the fourth. </P>
<P> ``The district attorney's office informs us that a confession by itself is not enough'' to file charges, Hyde said. ``There needs to be corroborating evidence. </P>
<P> ``Our next step is to meet with the medical examiner on Monday and arrange to exhume the remaining body.'' </P>
<P> Self said he injected the three men with morphine overdoses and gave the woman a liquid that he knew would cause her death, police officer Michael Harrell said in the affidavit. </P>
<P> Hyde said Self apparently ``felt sorry for the fact that these people were in a great deal of discomfort.'' </P>
<P> The four patients, who ranged in age from 85 to 93, died between January 1992 and December 1993. </P>
<P> Death certificates indicated all four died of natural causes. But Harrell said that Self's wife, Rachael, came to police July 28 and told detectives her husband had confessed to killing the four. </P>
<P> According to Harrell, officers confronted Self, who at first denied the accusation but then ``decided to 'tell the truth.''' </P>
<P> Self shut down the foster home in April, Hyde said. The operation was small and never had more than five patients at a time. </P>
