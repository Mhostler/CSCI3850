<P>  A foster mother once honoured by former first lady Nancy Reagan for her work with seriously ill children was released on bail on Friday after being charged with child abuse. </P>
<P> Yvonne Eldridge, 42, was indicted by a Contra Costa County grand jury last week on two felony counts of child endangerment. The charges, which carry a maximum penalty of six years in prison, involve two girls, both aged two, whose health deteriorated under her care. </P>
<P> At a court hearing on Friday, Contra Costa County Superior Court Judge Richard Flier set bail at $100,000 and ordered Eldridge to be arraigned on January 5. </P>
<P> Eldridge ran a foster care home in Walnut Creek, 30 miles east of San Francisco, in the 1980s, but now lives in Oregon. She cared for more than 40 children and received the Great American Family award from Nancy Reagan in 1988 for her work. </P>
<P> But the state revoked her foster mother's license in April 1993 after officials said a rare disorder drove her to cause the deaths of two children in her care. Administrative Law Judge Robert Coffman ruled that Eldridge suffers from Munchausen's syndrome by proxy, an illness which leads people to make others sick to get attention from doctors. </P>
<P> Coffman found that Eldridge administered too much medication to two children, causing their deaths. Prosecutors did not press charges in those cases due to lack of evidence. </P>
<P> Officials said there was sufficient evidence to bring charges regarding two other victims, who are still alive. </P>
<P> Eldridge has denied all charges against her. </P>
