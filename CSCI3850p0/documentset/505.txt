<P>  Silvio Berlusconi's most important political partner Sunday scorned a proposed plan to distance the Italian premier from his business empire, saying it did not go far enough. </P>
<P> Umberto Bossi, leader of the federalist Northern League, the largest member in the prime minister's coalition, poured cold water on Berlusconi's plan to have a special committee oversee his huge Fininvest business empire. </P>
<P> ``The idea just doesn't stand up,'' said Bossi in several television interviews Sunday in remarks bound to rekindle tensions within the embattled governing coalition. </P>
<P> Berlusconi announced a plan Friday to distance himself from his business empire after a week of sharp criticism over the handling of a corruption probe that has implicated Fininvest and led to the arrest of his brother Paolo. </P>
<P> Bossi, whose party controls the largest number of seats in Berlusconi's ``Freedom Alliance'' coalition that also includes neo-fasists, said he would challenge the Prime Minister's plan in parliament Tuesday and propose separate anti-trust legislation. </P>
<P> In an interview with Il Giornale newspaper published Sunday, Bossi denied that he was trying to torpedo the government and said he was merely keen on a more coherent plan. </P>
<P> Bossi said the League would formally propose Tuesday that all Berlusconi's assets be run by a special foundation for five years and suggested political parties could play a role in choosing its board members. </P>
<P> Berlusconi's plan called for President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and the heads of the two houses of parliament to name a special committee to oversee the $7.0 billion a year broadcasting-to-supermarkets empire. </P>
<P> The plan had already run into trouble after Scalfaro said constitutional obligations meant he could probably not be one of those naming members of the committee. </P>
<P> The plan's failure would be a further blow to Berlusconi, whose image has been dented by a dispute over a failed bid to curtail magistrates' rights to order pre-trial detention. </P>
<P> In Milan, Paolo Berlusconi spent the weekend under house arrest after giving himself up to magistrates Friday. He is accused of bankrolling Fininvest bribes to the city's finance police. </P>
