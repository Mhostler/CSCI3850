<P>  The United States will exchange liaison offices with North Korea as long as Pyongyang keeps a promise to halt its nuclear programme, U.S. nuclear ambassador Robert Gallucci was quoted as saying on Thursday. </P>
<P> In an interview with South Korean Chosun Ilbo newspaper, Gallucci said the exchange would take place despite differences over nuclear reactors set to replace Pyongyang's current system, which Washington had suspected of being used to make bombs. </P>
<P> Gallucci said as long as North Korea maintained the freeze on its old nuclear programme, other parts in a landmark U.S.-North Korean nuclear deal would proceed independently. </P>
<P> ``The provision of light-water reactors is the part of the agreement that will benefit North Korea,'' Chosun Ilbo, in a report from Washington, quoted Gallucci as saying. </P>
<P> The chief U.S. negotiator with North Korea said the Stalinist state should not be penalised for not accepting benefits quickly. </P>
<P> He said North Korea could set up a liaison office in Washington once technical questions were resolved. He did not elaborate. </P>
<P> U.S. and South Korean officials had said the nuclear reactor issue was important as it held the key to the success of the overall nuclear accord signed by the United States and North Korea last October. </P>
<P> Washington promised Pyongyang steps for better ties and $4.5 billion in new light-water reactors and alternative energy supplies if the Stalinist regime agreed to freeze and eventually dismantle its nuclear programme. </P>
<P> Last month, technical-level talks between the United States and North Korea broke down in Berlin over how the reactors be provided to Pyongyang. </P>
<P> From the beginning, the United States has insisted South Korea should provide the reactors because it has agreed to underwrite the huge cost and also because U.S. policy is to encourage dialogue between North and South. </P>
<P> Pyongyang opposes such an offer and wants alternative reactors. </P>
<P> The United States and North Korea are due to hold a fresh round of talks this weekend in Kuala Lumpur and various compromises have been floated in the press, including the possibility of using a South Korean reactor but not identifying it as South Korean. </P>
