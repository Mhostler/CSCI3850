<P>  Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, in a rare statement addressed to the United States, said Thursday that U.S. pressures could not bring Iran to its knees. </P>
<P> He called on Washington to reconsider its policies on Iran. </P>
<P> Rafsanjani, in the message read on Tehran radio, said: ``U.S. officials must think over their misconceptions and historical errors.'' </P>
<P> U.S. charges that Iran backed terrorism and was trying to build nuclear and chemical arms ``were so baseless that they could not even convince the people who were saying them,'' he said. </P>
<P> U.S. pressures were partly due to Tehran's rejection of Arab-Israeli peace accords which it saw as unjust, Rafsanjani said. </P>
<P> Rafsanjani said U.S. leaders were ``sinking in a self-made swamp (of propaganda), and sinking even further by repeating their errors in an attempt to rescue themselves.'' </P>
<P> U.S. moves to isolate Iran were illegal and only led to regional instability. </P>
<P> Azerbaijan this week cancelled Iran's stake in a multi- national Caspian Sea oil project after U.S. firms opposed Tehran's participation. </P>
<P> Last month the United States stopped a $1 billion oil development deal between the American Conoco Inc and Iran and Tokyo delayed a $500 million loan to Tehran that was opposed by Washington. </P>
<P> The United States, citing concerns about an alleged Iranian program to develop nuclear arms and charges that Iran supports terrorism, is drafting plans to impose further sanctions on Tehran which include banning U.S. firms from buying its oil. </P>
