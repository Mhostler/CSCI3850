<DATELINE>SEOUL, Sout1h Korea (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Seven Seoul city officials were arrested Saturday in connection with the collapse of a bridge in the capital which killed 32 people, an official at the Seoul District Prosecutor's Office said. </P>
<P> The disaster, the latest in a series of embarrassments to hit the government of President Kim Young-sam, raised a flurry of criticism from legislators and the media questioning his policies. </P>
<P> A presidential spokesman said Prime Minister Lee Yung-dug had offered to resign over the collapse, but Kim indicated he would turn down the offer.  Yo Yong-won, head of the city government's construction office responsible for maintaining the bridge, and six other men in his office were charged with negligence and causing death, the official in the prosecutor's office said. The accident also injured 17 people. </P>
<P> Investigators had earlier accused them of failing to check the safety of the Songsu bridge, whose central span collapsed into the Han River Friday morning during rush hour, taking with it cars, vans and at least one fully-loaded bus. </P>
<P> Prosecutors said the seven arrested had reported to the city government there were no safety problems regarding the bridge without carrying out statutory daily checks. </P>
<P> The construction office also failed to carry out repairs after finding earlier this year that steel girders supporting the bridge were badly corroded, they said. </P>
<P> Investigators told reporters after a visit to the site Saturday they believed a 157-foot span of the 0.7-mile bridge collapsed after rusted extension hinges broke under heavy loads. </P>
<P> City officials had warned of potential disaster on the teeming bridges over the Han, which runs through central Seoul, and carries millions of commuters daily to the northern business area from residential districts in the south. </P>
<P> Only last week, an opposition member of parliament, Choi Jae-sung, warned that urgent repair work was necessary on Songsu and 11 other Seoul bridges to avert disasters. </P>
<P> City officials said repairs to the Songsu bridge had been scheduled for Thursday but were postponed due to bad weather. </P>
<P> The collapse of the four-lane bridge is the latest in a string of embarrassments to Kim's cabinet since he came to office in February last year. </P>
<P> The government's security capabilities were questioned after a series of grisly murders and after two army officers deserted in protest at lack of discipline in the military. </P>
<P> The administration's diplomacy was criticized after Seoul supported Washington's deal this week with North Korea to delay outside inspection of the North's key nuclear facilities for five years despite earlier demands for immediate checks. </P>
<P> A corruption scandal involving tax officers has marred reforms in which priority was given to ending corruption. </P>
