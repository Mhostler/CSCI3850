<DATELINE>PARIS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Three police officers and a taxi driver were killed and six other people -- including two more police officers -- were wounded in a shootout in Paris overnight, police said Wednesday. </P>
<P> A man and a woman were in custody Wednesday morning but were refusing to divulge their identities, police said. </P>
<P> The male suspect, wounded during one of two gunfights with police that took place during the night, was hospitalized, a police spokesman said. </P>
<P> The shootings brought to five the number of police officers killed in France so far this year, angering police unions who complained they were ``easy targets'' for troublemakers and demanded bullet-proof vests, better communications systems and more sophisticated vehicles. </P>
<P> The killings also triggered an early-morning protest by taxi drivers worried about their safety. </P>
<P> The drivers circulated through the center of the French capital, honking their horns to show their emotion. </P>
<P> The names of the dead were not immediately available. </P>
<P> The incident began Tuesday night when two people wearing hoods and armed with tear gas greandes broke into a Paris police station and stole firearms, the spokesman said. </P>
<P> The couple then took a taxi driver hostage and forced him to begin driving them to an undetermined site. </P>
<P> While still in the city center, the driver, apparently seeking to alert police to his plight, drove his taxi into a police car. But when the police officers got out of their car to assess the damage, they were shot down, as was the driver. </P>
<P> The couple then resumed driving, heading for the Bois de Vincennes, a park just outside of eastern Paris. </P>
<P> In a second encounter with police, a third officer was killed and two other officers and the alleged gunman were wounded. </P>
<P> The remaining wounded were passersby, police said. </P>
