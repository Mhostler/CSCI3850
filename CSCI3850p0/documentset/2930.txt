<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  House Democrats re-elected their top leaders Wednesday, giving them a vote of confidence despite a stunning election defeat that dropped the party to minority party status for the first time in 40 years. </P>
<P> The leaders promised a more inclusive leadership and a message that Democrats are the party to help Americans when jobs are being lost and families are under strain. </P>
<P> Meeting in closed session, the Democrats re-elected Richard Gephardt of Missouri as House Democratic leader and David Bonior as whip and Vic Fazio of California as party caucus chairman, the second and third ranking posts. </P>
<P> Referring to the lack of new faces at the top, Fazio told reporters, ``I don't think this is simply the same old tune.'' </P>
<P> Gephardt, preparing to enter a hospital for removal of his gallbladder, said House Democrats would take the lead in developing a party agenda that ``gives promise to American workers.'' </P>
<P> ``Our mission is to represent the workers, middle income, poor families in this country who are struggling very hard right now'' in a changing economy,'' Gephardt told reporters. </P>
<P> Bonior said, ``Our responsibility will be to the working families. That will be our top priority.'' </P>
<P> Following the Nov. 8 elections, candidates demanding change -- two from the South -- launched challenges to the leaders. </P>
<P> Charlie Rose of North Carolina sought to oust Gephardt, conservative Texan Charles Stenholm sought Bonior's whip job and Kweisi Mfume of Maryland, outgoing chairman of the 40-member Congressional Black Caucus, challenged Fazio. </P>
<P> But Democrats voted 150-58 to re-elect Gephardt, 145-60 for Bonior and 149-57 for Fazio. </P>
<P> Caucus vice chairman Barbara Kennelly of Connecticut defeated challenger Louise Slaughter of New York 93-90. </P>
<P> The challengers had been rated underdogs in their campaigns to give a new face to the party as it seeks its way out of the political wilderness. </P>
<P> Rose, who won a tough race in his district, cited Gephardt's close ties with the Clinton White House in announcing his challenge for the minority leadership and said it was time House Democrats showed more independence. </P>
<P> He told reporters after the caucus vote, ``I think he (Gephardt) has a new insight into some of the dissention in our party.'' </P>
<P> The congressional elections threw Democrats out of power in the House for the first time since 1954. Republicans also won the Senate, which they had last held from 1981 to 1987. </P>
<P> In the Senate Thomas Daschle of South Dakota and Christopher Dodd of Connecticut are vying for the post of Democratic leader held by retiring George Mitchell of Maine. </P>
<P> Senate Republicans will be led by the current minority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, but Trent Lott of Mississippi is seeking to wrest the deputy leader's post from Alan Simpson of Wyoming, who is backed by Dole. </P>
<P> House Republicans are expected to be led by Dick Armey of Texas. The current Republican whip, Newt Gingrich of Georgia, is in line to be speaker of the new House, which convenes on Jan. </P>
