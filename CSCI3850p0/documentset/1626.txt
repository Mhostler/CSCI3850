<P>  The United States wants the United Nations to pull all of its 18,000 troops out of Somalia by the end of this year rather than by next March, as originally envisaged, a U.S. official said Tuesday. </P>
<P> The Security Council is due to review the mandate for the mission by the end of this week. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has recommended a one-month extension for the life of the mission while U.N. officials assess the situation on the ground. </P>
<P> Some envoys said the secretary-general wanted to keep one contingent there as well as ask the United States for help in the withdrawal because of fear of attacks on departing peacekeepers. They also believe millions of dollars' worth of U.N. weapons and equipment could be looted. </P>
<P> The United Nations had envisioned a withdrawal of most forces, known as the U.N. Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM), by March but Washington wants it done sooner. </P>
<P> ``The United States believes that the right course for the Security Council at this time is to terminate all UNOSOM activities by December 31, 1994,'' said the U.S. official in a briefing to reporters. </P>
<P> He said that progress toward reconciliation among feuding factions was too slow to keep such a large number of troops in a country when the world organization's resources were being stretched. </P>
<P> ``It is the United States' view that a one-month extension would be a mistake,'' he said, adding that the ability of the troops to change the dynamics of Somalian society is limited. </P>
<P> Efforts by American and U.N. officials to convince General Mohamed Farah Aideed, one of the strongest factional leaders, to make peace with the other 12 clans or factions have failed, particularly in Mogadishu. </P>
<P> More than 100 peacekeepkers, including 36 Americans, have been killed in Somalia since April 1992. The deaths of 12 Americans nearly a year ago prompted a pullout of U.S. troops, with fighting escalating again after their departure. </P>
