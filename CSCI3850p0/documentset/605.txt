<P>  President Fidel Castro, announcing one of the poorest sugar cane harvests in decades, has urged Cubans to break out of the current economic crisis by ``winning the battle'' of sugar harvests and food production. </P>
<P> Castro told parliament Wednesday evening that the country's sugar harvest for 1993-94 will be four million metric tons, down from a disastrously low 4.2 million metric tons last year. </P>
<P> If Cuba didn't start improving on its sugar and food production, he said, it risked destroying the revolution. </P>
<P> ``We are going to create conditions that make it impossible to save it (the revolution),'' Castro told the first day of an ordinary session of the National Assembly. </P>
<P> While not a surprise, the figure of four million metric tons reflects continuing deep problems with the communist-ruled Caribbean island's principal export earner. The current sugar harvest is still continuing, well beyond schedule. </P>
<P> Production has plumeted from seven million metric tons in 1991-92 as Cuba battles with economic crisis triggered by the collapse of the Soviet Union, its former trade and aid partner. </P>
<P> The sugar sector has been ravaged by lack of inputs ranging from fuel and spare parts to fertilizers and pesticides. But Castro said that whatever the hardships, more work could be done. Lack of fertilizer did not mean sugar cane could not be weeded, he said. </P>
<P> Given Cuba's import needs, especially in fuel and food, four million metric tons of sugar was not enough to solve the country's problems, Castro said. </P>
<P> ``If we don't win the battle of the sugar harvest, ... how are we going to win the battle of the special period?'' he said, using the term Cuba gives the current economic squeeze. ``Our attitude has to be different.'' </P>
<P> The country's 11 million inhabitants are facing severe shortages of many products ranging from fuel and power to many food items and basic consumer goods. </P>
