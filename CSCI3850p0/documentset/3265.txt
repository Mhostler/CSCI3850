<P>  Vice President Al Gore and Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin signed a series of cooperation agreements Friday, putting behind them a cool period in U.S.-Russian relations. </P>
<P> ``The prime minister and I have just concluded three very full and fruitful days,'' Gore told a news conference after the fourth session of the Joint Commission on Economic and Technological Cooperation. </P>
<P> ``Nothing speaks more clearly about the health of the U.S.-Russian relationship than the work of this commission,'' he said. Gore also said he had an excellent meeting with President Boris Yeltsin. </P>
<P> Relations between the two countries have been soured in recent weeks by differences over policy in the former Yugoslavia and over NATO's planned expansion into eastern Europe. </P>
<P> Fifteen agreements were signed during the Gore-Chernomyrdin session, covering such areas as prevention of pollution in the Arctic, customs cooperation, space, energy, health and defense conversion. </P>
<P> The two sides agreed to carry out joint space research to gather data on the earth's atmosphere and to cooperate on an international space station. </P>
<P> They also committed themselves to ensuring safe and secure nuclear warhead dismantlement and to funding studies on viable energy alternatives to replace plutonium production reactors. </P>
<P> The U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) has offered up to $500 million in financing and insurance for U.S. business participation in defense conversion, Gore said. </P>
<P> ``OPIC has given fresh impetus to work on defense conversion,'' he said. ``We've also made impressive strides in our joint work on an international space station.'' </P>
<P> A U.S. astronaut is due to join a Russian mission to the Mir space station next March and the first docking between an American space shuttle and Mir is due in June. </P>
<P> As far as NATO and other thorny issues were concerned, Gore said: ``We have established a process to put all of these questions in a proper perspective, which is that of a strong and healthy relationship.'' </P>
<P> ``I will leave Moscow with the sense of a U.S.-Russian relationship that is strong, dynamic and firmly on track,'' he said. </P>
<P> The next meeting of the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission is due to take place in Moscow again in six months. </P>
<P> ``We have every reason to be happy with the work we have done,'' Chernomyrdin said. </P>
<P> As Gore met the Russian leaders Friday morning, Itar-Tass news agency reported that his wife Tipper had to cancel a visit to a Moscow school because of a bomb threat. </P>
<P> ``There is information that the call came from a young man, possibly a teen-ager,'' Tass said, adding that it may have been a schoolboy prank. </P>
<P> Moscow police have been on alert this week for possible terrorist attacks following last weekend's entry of Russian troops into Chechnya, a volatile Transcaucasian republic that declared independence in 1991. </P>
