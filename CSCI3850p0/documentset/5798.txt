<P>  Thousands of right-wing Israelis marched across the country's narrowest stretch Monday to protest against any further handover of territory to Palestinian rule. </P>
<P> The 10-mile walk from the outskirts of Tulkarm in the occupied West Bank to the Israeli Mediterranean resort of Netanya was advertised as a way to say ``no with our feet'' to a return to the pre-1967 Middle East war border. </P>
<P> ``It is very symbolic. This is Israel's narrow waist -- a 10-minute drive from Tulkarm to Netanya,'' said Rehavam Zeevi, a legislator from the ultranationalist Moledet party. </P>
<P> ``You know what happens when you go on a super-diet? You die,'' one marcher said. ``Sixteen kilometers (10 miles) is nothing. How can you defend it?'' </P>
<P> The march was organized by Israel's main right-wing parties, Jewish settlers' organisations, ultranationalist rabbis, a group of Israelis injured in Arab guerrilla attacks, academics and retired army officers. </P>
<P> All the groups oppose the 1993 Israel-PLO peace deal that established Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho. </P>
<P> Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin has made a widening of autonomy to the rest of the West Bank contingent on PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat preventing attacks by Muslim militants against Israelis. </P>
<P> ``Throw the Bum Out,'' read one sign carried by a protester, referring to Rabin. </P>
