<P>  Former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari was named as the top suspect in the assassination last year of Luis Donaldo Colosio in a newspaper poll published Wednesday. </P>
<P> The poll in Mexico City daily El Universal found that 46.2 percent of 926 people surveyed said Salinas masterminded the shooting death of Colosio, who was the presidential candidate of Salinas' ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). </P>
<P> Colosio was gunned down March 23, 1994 at a campaign rally in the northern border city of Tijuana. Mario Aburto, who has confessed to shooting Colosio, was sentenced to 42 years in prison for the murder and another man, Othon Cortez, has been jailed on charges he also fired at the candidate. </P>
<P> A government investigation has resulted in several other men being accused of taking part in a conspiracy to kill Colosio but there has been little recent movement in the case. </P>
<P> The PRI was named as the mastermind of the murder by 23.5 percent of those surveyed, followed by the government, with 15.7 percent. Another 5.6 percent chose Raul Salinas, brother of the former president, who is awaiting trial on charges he ordered the killing last September of PRI secretary general Francisco Ruiz Massieu. </P>
<P> Although the government has in the past hinted that drug traffickers killed Colosio, only 3.3 percent of those surveyed agreed. </P>
<P> Salinas, who chose Colosio to be the PRI presidential candidate for the August 1995 election, moved to the United States this year after the arrest of his brother and a public spat with President Ernesto Zedillo, his successor. But the government has said there is no evidence linking Salinas to Colosio's death. </P>
<P> The poll, which had a margin of error of plus-or-minus 5 percent, did not address possible motives for the murder, although many Mexicans believe Colosio was killed by political factions opposed to democratic reform. </P>
