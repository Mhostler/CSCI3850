<P>  Congressional negotiators reached agreement Friday on a bill streamlining the way government agencies buy goods and services. </P>
<P> The bill authorizes acquisition reforms in Vice President Al Gore's ``reinventing government'' plan and in a report by an advisory panel on reforming acquisition laws. </P>
<P> The bill, a compromise of measures passed by the House and Senate, would reduce paperwork, simplify procedures for small purchases and facilitate purchase of commercial products. </P>
<P> ``The current process of procuring equipment and services for our military and civilian services takes too long, costs too much and suffers under a crushing burden of wasteful overhead,'' Senator Sam Nunn, a Georgia Democrat and chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said. </P>
<P> He said the bill would provide the secretary of defense and other cabinet officials with the tools to reinvent the federal acquisition system. </P>
