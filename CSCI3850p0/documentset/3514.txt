<DATELINE>NEW YORK, (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Thousands of New Year's Eve revelers were expected to brave forecasted freezing rain to witness the traditional rib-crunching mayhem in Times Square Saturday night as the 200-pound ball is lowered to greet 1995. </P>
<P> Over a quarter of a million spectators will be on hand for the customary countdown that begins one minute before midnight as the illuminated globe slides 70-feet down a stainless steel flagpole to welcome the New Year. </P>
<P> At that moment, 3,000 pounds of confetti and 10,000 balloons will float from area buildings as ball-watchers see a dazzling light show and seven-minute fireworks display that will illuminate the skyline. </P>
<P> Police plan to close the Times Square area to traffic by 7 p.m. EST as the anticipated crowd begins to assemble. </P>
<P> Shopkeepers spent most of the last day of 1994 boarding up glass windows to prevent breakage from the expected crush of people. </P>
<P> Police urged people coming to the city to take extra precautions. ``We'll have a large police presence in Times Square as we do every year to handle crowds,'' Det. Andrew McInnis, a police spokesman, said. </P>
<P> He said celebrants should be ``extra alert'' because a combination of alcohol, crowds and late hours often leads to the loss of valuables and wallets. </P>
<P> For those wanting to drink champagne, have dinner and dance at some of the city's tonier places, merry-makers can rub elbows at Tavern on the Green in Central Park for $245 a person or pay $375 a person for a spot in one of three rooms at the ``Rainbow Room'' in Rockefeller Plaza. </P>
<P> However, both places are sold out. </P>
<P> Another festivity to ring in the New Year is becoming a New York tradition -- the low-budget, alcohol-free, family-oriented party celebration called ``First Night New York '95,'' that began four years ago. </P>
<P> The 14-hour schedule features 30 events around town such as face-painting, clowns and music to waltzing in Grand Central Terminal. </P>
<P> Among other ways New Yorkers plan to belt out ``Auld Lang Syne'' on the cheap, is to join the 16th annual, 5-mile ''Runner's World/Nike Midnight Run'' in Central Park that includes a marriage ceremony at 11 p.m. and a costume parade. </P>
