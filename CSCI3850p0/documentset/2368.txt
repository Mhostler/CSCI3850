<P>  A Florida jury Wednesday began deliberating over the fate of an anti-abortion activist accused of murdering an elderly doctor and his unarmed escort outside a Pensacola women's clinic last July. </P>
<P> Escambia County Circuit Judge Frank Bell charged the panel of six men and six women to determine whether Paul Hill is guilty of the first-degree murder of Dr John Britton, 69, and 74-year-old retired Air Force Lt. Col. James Barrett, who were gunned down July 29. </P>
<P> The jury also must deliver a verdict on charges that Hill tried to murder Barrett's 68-year-old widow, June, at the same time. </P>
<P> Hill, 40, who is acting as his own attorney, declined to make a closing argument to jurors as well as the chance to rebut the closing argument of state attorney James Murray. </P>
<P> Murray told jurors that Hill killed Britton and Barrett according to a pre-meditated plan that had been in the works for at least 2 3/8 days. </P>
<P> ``He demonstrated in the most graphic, violent kind of way that he does not believe he's bound by any laws with which he does not agree,'' Murray told the jurors. </P>
<P> ``He carried out what he had been preaching for the past year -- execute! -- execute a person with whom he did not agree on a matter of constitutional law.'' </P>
<P> Murray addressed the jury while standing beside a large color photograph of an anti-abortion sign confiscated from Hill's home after the murders. The sign reads, ``Execute murderers, abortionists, accessories?'' </P>
<P> The jury earlier Wednesday heard Barrett's widow identify Hill in a 15-minute testimony punctuated with tears as the gunman who shot and killed her husband and Britton. </P>
<P> Barrett, who was wounded in the attack, was sitting in the Nissan truck's jump seat while her husband was in the driver's seat. Britton was in the passenger seat of the truck. </P>
<P> If the jury convicts Hill on the first degree murder charges, the panel will be asked whether they also recommend a sentence of death. </P>
