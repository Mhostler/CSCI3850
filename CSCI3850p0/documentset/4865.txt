<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Riot police stormed the official residence of South Korea's parliamentary speaker Sunday, freeing him and ending a six-day protest by opposition lawmakers, witnesses said. </P>
<P> They said about 300 policemen forced their way into the occupied residence of National Assembly speaker Hwang Nak-joo who had been prevented from leaving his home by the protesters. </P>
<P> The demonstrators left voluntarily after confronting the police. </P>
<P> Police also raided the home of vice-speaker Lee Han-dong and ejected another group of Democratic Party (DP) lawmakers, witnesses said. The opposition members who had also occupied Lee's residence since Monday scuffled briefly with police before being expelled from the dwelling. </P>
<P> A DP spokesman later said party members would begin sit-ins at the National Assembly later Sunday in protest against the police raid. </P>
<P> The protests would continue until the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) abandoned plans to ram an electoral bill through parliament, he said. </P>
<P> ``The current regime must take full responsibility for a possible political catastrophe caused by the exercise of public power,'' the spokesman said. ``We will not sit idly watching the DLP railroading the election bill.'' </P>
<P> A DLP spokesman said the DP had prompted the police intervention and called the DP's protests ``shameful.'' He urged opposition members to return to parliament. </P>
<P> The row over the electoral bill is centered on revisions which would ban political parties from participating in elections for county, ward and small city positions in June 27 local elections. </P>
<P> The ruling party says the ban is needed to preserve local autonomy, but the DP charges the revisions are a plot to prevent an opposition victory in the local polls. </P>
<P> More than 5,000 posts are at stake in the elections to choose nine provincial governors, mayors of the six largest cities and other smaller cities, heads of counties and wards as well as 4,000 council members. </P>
<P> An aide to Hwang said 10 DP legislators left Hwang's residence after confronting the police for about 80 minutes. He said police warned the protesters they would be forcibly removed if they did not leave on their own. </P>
<P> ``But Speaker Hwang himself did not call in the police,'' the aide said. He said the raid was initiated by the police themselves. </P>
<P> However, Yonhap, South Korea's domestic news agency, quoted a police chief as saying Hwang had requested the police action. </P>
<P> DP lawmakers had brought parliamentary proceedings to a standstill through their occupation of the speakers' residences, which are both located in southern Seoul. </P>
