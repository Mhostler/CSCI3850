<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Republicans elected tough talking Texan Dick Armey to the No. 2 post of House majority leader Monday, elevating a champion of small government, free enterprise and self reliance. </P>
<P> ``How good it feels,'' an elated Armey told fellow Republicans after the staunch conservative won election by acclamation. </P>
<P> Armey exhorted his party, which takes control of the House in January for the first time in 40 years, to maintain their faith and vision ``so this Congress of the United States will once again deserve to be known as the people's body.'' </P>
<P> A political novice until he decided to run for Congress in 1984, the former economics professor jumped over more senior -- and more moderate -- colleagues to become a leader of activist House conservatives. </P>
<P> The 54-year-old gained attention soon after arriving in Washington for his decision to save money by sleeping in the House gym and, after he was kicked out, his House office. </P>
<P> He was elected leader of the Republican conference in 1992, beating moderate Jerry Lewis of California. </P>
<P> Armey was the force behind a successful 1988 commission that recommended a series of military base closings and has teamed up with liberal Democrats to oppose federal farm subsidies, which he cites as wasteful spending. </P>
<P> ``We hope he becomes more enlightened as he gains power,'' said Keith Heard, executive vice president of the National Corn Growers Association.  Armey's career bears similarities to that of his Republican ally Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the future House speaker, who has a policy of in-your-face confrontation. </P>
<P> Like Gingrich, Armey is a former academic, an economics professor at North Texas State University. And, like Gingrich, Armey is outspoken. </P>
<P> ``I see confrontation as a tool,'' Armey told reporters in 1992 after his election to the No. 3 Republican House post. </P>
<P> He angered adminstration officials during a 1993 White House meeting by warning Clinton would be a one-term president if he pushed a budget with new taxes that hurt the economy -- the same advice he gave former President Bush. </P>
<P> Armey's description of Clinton's health care plan as a Dr. Kevorkian prescription, a reference to Michigan physician Jack Kevorkian who advocates assisted suicide -- earned a rebuke from First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton at a House hearing. </P>
<P> ``I have been told about your charm and wit,'' Armey replied to Mrs. Clinton. ``Let me say that reports on your charm are overstated and the reports on your wit are understated.'' </P>
<P> ``There's no question Armey is a smart guy in terms of brain power,'' said a lobbyist who has worked closely with him. ``On the other hand ... he's kind of brutally honest sometimes to a fault.'' </P>
<P> But Armey's warning that the White House faced political turmoil has been correct. Clinton's controversial budget plan barely squeaked through Congress without a single Republican vote and his health reform plan died without a vote. </P>
<P> Since Republicans gained the majority in the Nov.8 elections, Armey has taken a more moderate tack. </P>
<P> ``Armey's axiom is that you cannot get ahead while you're getting even. It's a waste of time, it's a waste of other people's resources, it's not an honorable thing to do,'' he said when asked if he wanted vengeance on Democrats. </P>
<P> In 1989, Armey founded the Institute for Policy Innovation, a nonprofit group to provide independent economic analysis and information. Armey said the group was needed to serve as a counter to the Congresional Budget Office and other organizations controlled by Democrats. </P>
<P> Aides said Armey was considering whether to continue the Institute, funded by other foundations and private donors with an annual budget of about $350,000 -- now that he is assuming a leadership role. The Institute's donor list is not public. </P>
<P> ``I think he's taking a close look at that right now, what he can and should do as majority leader in that regard,'' said spokesman Ed Gillespie. </P>
