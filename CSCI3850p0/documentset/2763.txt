<P>  A cease-fire was declared in Angola Tuesday but serious doubts remained over whether the peace would hold after 19 years of ruinous civil war in which hundreds of thousands have died. </P>
<P> ``The cease-fire has started throughout the country at this hour according to the Lusaka Protocol,'' Angolan state radio reported at 1 p.m. (7 a.m. EST), referring to peace accords signed in the Zambian capital Sunday. </P>
<P> Earlier Lopo Ferreira, secretary-general of the ruling MPLA, said government forces, which expected UNITA rebels to carry on fighting, would remain vigilant. </P>
<P> ``We can expect...violations will happen,'' he told the radio. </P>
<P> Despite weeks of negotiations and premature reports of ceasefires and truces, the United Nations appeared unprepared for the official end to the war, saying it would be unable to monitor it until hundreds of observers were sent. </P>
<P> ``We have five U.N. stations in Angola in non-active zones...but we have no way of verifying if there is a violation,'' a U.N. official told Reuters. </P>
<P> ``We have plans to bring about 600 military observers and police to Angola but this cannot be done overnight... I have no idea when this will happen.'' </P>
<P> Ferreira said the Angolan government hoped the cease-fire would be properly implemented and enforced. </P>
<P> The government said UNITA rebels attacked the town of Cacolo Sunday and the northern city of Uige Monday, the night before the cease-fire. </P>
<P> Government forces captured Uige from UNITA last week in what the rebels said was a violation of a truce aimed at facilitating Sunday's signing of the peace pact ending the 19-year war. </P>
<P> There have been no reports of fighting since Monday night when the United Nations reminded government and rebels of the need to honour their commitments to peace and the cease-fire. </P>
<P> ``The council reminds the parties of the responsibilities they bear to respect fully the cease-fire agreement which is to go into effect on November 22, 1994,'' said a statement read at a U.N. Security Council meeting in New York. </P>
<P> The peace accord was signed in Lusaka, but not, as originally planned, by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and rebel leader Jonas Savimbi, who said government attacks on UNITA made it unsafe for him to travel. Lower-ranked officials signed on behalf of both parties. </P>
<P> In Lusaka, military delegations from both sides met again Tuesday to hammer out technical details of the cease-fire. </P>
<P> Sources close to the talks said the question of Savimbi's security, the disarming of rebels, the locations of confinement and assembly areas for the rival forces and a proposed ban on the acquisition of new arms were still being discussed. </P>
