<P>  The United States again struggled to impose its authority in the Pan-American Games swimming pool Monday and needed success in less glamorous sports to reach the top of the medals table. </P>
<P> The United States won five gold medals in the kayak and canoe events and another three in roller-skating to top the gold medals count with 23, ahead of Cuba's total of 19. </P>
<P> The Cubans themselves depended heavily on the multitude of weightlifting categories, where they won six golds, for their total of medals. </P>
<P> Cuba finished ahead of the United States in the gold medals table in the previous Pan-Am Games which it hosted in 1991 but seems resigned to the fact that they will not repeat the feat this time. </P>
<P> The country's sports minister Reinaldo Gonzalez Lopez said he did not expect Cuba to win as many golds but said he still expected to accumulate more than 100. </P>
<P> The United States won three of the five golds up for grabs in the swimming on Monday, a good performance but short of the total domination it had hoped for after bringing one of the strongest-ever Pan-Am Games squads. </P>
<P> Curtis Myden of Canada won the men's 400 meters medley and set a Pan-American record in the process while Canadian Lisa Anne Flood won the women's 200 meters breast stroke and countrywoman Cuylaine Cloutier took the silver. </P>
<P> Even worse was to come for the United States in the diving when Annie Pelletier won the women's three-meter springboard event to become Canada's first diving champion at the games for 20 years. </P>
<P> The United States had dreamed of a clean sweep in diving but, after Fernando Plata won the men's three-meter springboard for Mexico on Sunday, had yet to win a single gold in the sport. </P>
<P> Cristina Teuscher of the United States won the women's 200 meters freestyle in 2:01.49, snatching the lead in the last length after Canada's Marianne Limpert had been in front for three-quarters of the race. </P>
<P> Mark Henderson had a comfortable win in the men's 100 meters butterfly. </P>
<P> The United States was also triumphant in the men's 4x200 meters freestyle relay, which it won in 7:21.61 seconds to set a games record. </P>
