<P>  Scientists from across Europe will put together a task force to check on the threat of global warming by drilling in Antarctica, the European Science Foundation said Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``The task force will undertake the drilling of cores from the 4,000 metre (13,000 foot) thick ice sheet,'' the scientific cooperation body said in a statement released in London. </P>
<P> ``These will reveal the pattern of temperature and air composition changes over several hundreds of thousands of years covering at least two Ice Ages. The improved understanding of climate will aid prediction of global changes.'' </P>
<P> Scientists were worried by the breaking off from Antarctica of an enormous iceberg 48 miles by 23 miles in size in February. Some said it was the first serious sign of global warming that could melt the icecaps, submerging coastal cities and even entire islands. </P>
<P> ``The break-up of ice shelves around the Antarctic and formation of new icebergs the size of Luxembourg have renewed concerns about possible global climate warming,'' it said. </P>
<P> ``Already there are upwards trends in temperatures. The U.K. Faraday station in the Antarctic Peninsula has experienced a 2.5 degree C (4 degree F) warming in the last 50 years.'' </P>
<P> Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Britain, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland will take part in the program, which they hope will be funded in part by the European Union. </P>
