<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  House Speaker Newt Gingrich on Monday evening fired his newly appointed House historian after learning that in 1986 she helped block federal funds for a school curriculum on the Holocaust because it did not present the views of the Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan. </P>
<P> Gingrich appointed the 47-year old Jeffrey, an assistant professor of political science at Kenneshaw State University in Georgia where Gingrich once taught, in mid-December, but her appointment was not officially announced and became public only a few days ago. </P>
<P> Reports of her involvement in the 1986 incident -- which caused a furor in Washington and prompted at least one congressional hearing -- surfaced late Monday, prompting immediate outcry from major Jewish groups and two New York lawmakers. </P>
<P> Gingrich's spokesman Tony Blankley said the speaker had left a message for Christina Jeffrey asking for her resignation, but had not yet spoken with her directly. </P>
<P> Blankley said Jeffrey served on a Department of Education panel that was set up to review a curriculum entitled ``Facing History and Ourselves,'' but the panel rejected a $70,000 grant for the program because it was not balanced or objective. </P>
<P> At the time Jeffrey, whose name was then Christina Price, wrote, ``The program gives no evidence of balance or objectivity. The Nazi point of view, however unpopular, is still a point of view and is not represented, nor are the views of the Ku Klux Klan,'' according to Cable News Network. </P>
<P> Blankley said neither Gingrich nor his staff was aware of the incident because Jeffrey had married and changed her name in the interim. </P>
<P> ``No one was aware of it,'' he told Reuters. ``Newt just learned of the incident (which happened) six years ago, and upon corroborating those facts, has asked for her resignation this evening.'' </P>
<P> A White House spokeswoman said Gingrich's move to fire Jeffrey was ``an appropriate step and a prudent decision.'' </P>
<P> A spokesman for the World Jewish Congress praised Gingrich for moving swiftly on the matter. </P>
<P> One Jewish leader, informed of Jeffrey's dismissal, said Gingrich was ``smart to cut her loose right away and not let it fester.'' He said he had been told by Gingrich's staff that the Georgia lawmaker still considered Jeffrey a friend. </P>
<P> Earlier, WJC vice president Kalman Sultanek said he was ''aghast by this development,'' and would call an emergency meeting of the group's executive committee. </P>
<P> In its Tuesday editions, the New York Times quoted Jeffrey as saying Monday that she had no intention of stepping down. </P>
<P> ``It wasn't the kind of thing I would have said if I had known it was going to be in The New York Times. It has never been my position that you ought to be going out and finding the KKK and bringing them into the middle-school classrooms.'' </P>
<P> The curriculum was a training program for high school teachers and their students and is about morality and society and the citizen's role in preventing tyranny. It examined the genocide of Jews and Armenians during this century. </P>
<P> Gingrich's first days as speaker have been dogged by controversy, beginning with remarks by his mother last week to CBS television in which she said her son thought first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was ``a bitch.'' </P>
<P> Kathleen Gingrich repeated her comment in a second interview on the ``American Journal'' syndicated program Sunday. </P>
<P> Monday's developments on Jeffrey were reminiscent of problems President Clinton had with several key appointments early in his administration after background checks failed to turn up information on their past conduct or views. </P>
<P> Gingrich was also criticized earlier Monday for hiring Jeffrey's husband Robert, also a professor from Georgia, as his personal ``chronicler.'' </P>
<P> Gingrich's decision to let Jeffrey go came just hours after strong criticism of her by two New York Democrats. </P>
<P> Rep. Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, said ``What Christina Jeffrey has said is an affront to tens of thousands of Holocaust survivors and millions of American World War II veterans.'' </P>
<P> Rep. Nita Lowey, also from New York, said, ``An apologist for the Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan does not belong in the people's house. Anti-Semitism, racism, revisionism has no place in the United States of America,'' CNN reported her as saying. </P>
<P> Jeffrey, who is living in a Washington suburb, could not be reached for comment Monday. </P>
<P> An answering machine at her Kennesaw, Ga. home, said: ``This is the House historian. I won't be able to return your call for a few days. but please leave a message if you still want to.'' </P>
