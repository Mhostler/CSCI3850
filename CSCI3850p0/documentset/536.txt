<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Two of three Central American nations Monday openly backed the U.N. Security Council decision allowing a U.S. invasion of Haiti, but said sanctions should be given more time to work. </P>
<P> ``We support the United Nations' decision, although I think we must continue exhausting the search for a peaceful solution to Haiti's crisis,'' Costa Rican President Jose Maria Figueres told reporters. </P>
<P> He said that if those efforts fail to force Haiti's military rulers into resigning and allowing ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to return to power, an invasion would be necessary. </P>
<P> ``If there is no other path, or no way out, we will support the U.N. resolution,'' Figueres said. </P>
<P> In Honduras, Foreign Minister Ernesto Paz said the government was considering whether or not to offer troops to either an invasion force or a multinational peacekeeping force that would de deployed once Haiti's army chiefs leave. </P>
<P> ``It was necessary to take a radical and definitive decision,'' he said of the U.N. vote, which passed 12-0 with two abstentions. </P>
<P> Leading Latin American nations have either sharply criticized the U.N. resolution or expressed deep reservations, hitting U.S. hopes of drumming up the involvement of Western Hemisphere states in any invasion force. </P>
<P> Brazil abstained in Sunday's Security Council vote, Mexico said it ``deplores'' the resolution and Cuba accused the United States of stepping up its military presence in the Caribbean for its own strategic interests. </P>
<P> Uruguay and Venezuela also criticized the resolution, albeit less strenuously. </P>
<P> Central America's six nations are striving to draw up a common policy on Haiti but clearly hope that the crisis can be resolved through the U.N.-ordered trade embargo against Haiti. </P>
<P> Guatemala's President Ramiro de Leon, talking to reporters Monday, did not say whether his country backed or opposed the U.N. resolution. </P>
<P> ``We would like ... to achieve our objective with the mechanisms of the blockade,'' de Leon said. </P>
<P> ``Guatemala's position is based on the principle of non-intervention and the resolution of conflicts through peaceful means,'' he said, adding that his government would not send troops to Haiti because Guatemala is still struggling to end its 33-year-old civil war. </P>
