<P>  Calling Jordan's King Hussein ``a strong partner in the peace process,'' a House committee chairman said Wednesday he believed Congress will approve relief for Jordan's debt to the United States. </P>
<P> ``I think there will be support for debt relief,'' Rep. Benjamin Gilman, chairman of the House International Relations Committee, said after an hour-long meeting with Hussein. </P>
<P> Although he said the issue had not yet been debated, the New York Republican said he could speculate that there would be support for debt relief. </P>
<P> Gilman hosted a meeting between Hussein and a number of House members on issues including Hussein's effort to collect on President Clinton's vow to relieve Jordan's U.S. debt in exchange for Hussein's peace agreement with Israel last year. </P>
<P> The House meeting with Hussein ``reaffirmed that we have a strong partner in the peace process,'' Gilman said. </P>
<P> The Senate has approved President Clinton's full $275 million request to finance relief of Jordan's entire remaining $480 million of U.S. debt but the House, without debate, has approved only $50 million of Clinton's request. </P>
<P> The House and Senate must now compromise on a final figure. Senate-House negotiations began Wednesday on the defense bill to which the Senate attached Jordan's $275 million, but there was a dispute on how to handle debt relief. </P>
<P> Rep. Bill Young, R-Fla., a chief House negotiator, said the debt relief is not defense, and so should be handled by House-Senate negotiators working on a $17 billion House budget cutting bill that includes the $50 million for Jordan debt relief. Those negotiations will take weeks. </P>
<P> Rep. David Obey, D-Mich., said the Jordan debt relief money should be kept in the defense bill because the budget cutting bill would force legislators to choose between approving money for Jordan or for American programs. </P>
