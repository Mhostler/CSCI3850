<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Former New York City Mayor John Lindsay, who led the city through one of its most tumultuous periods, collapsed from heat exhaustion Thursday and was listed in stable condition at a local hospital. </P>
<P> Lindsay, 72, was waiting to board a train when he was apparently overcome by the heat, hospital officials said. </P>
<P> ``Mayor Lindsay was brought to the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center emergency room at 10:30 this morning after feeling faint on a hot platform at Grand Central Station,'' a hospital spokeswoman said. </P>
<P> He was admitted to the hospital for observation and will remain there for the next few days, she said. </P>
<P> Lindsay was elected mayor in 1965, serving two terms before leaving office in 1973. </P>
<P> While credited with saving New York from the racial violence that swept over many major cities in the early 1970s, his economic legacy was more mixed. </P>
<P> Critics say the mayor, known for his sophistication and dapper style, gave up too much to the city's powerful municipal unions, creating financial problems for the city that exist to this day. </P>
<P> Lindsay was on his way to the country with his wife, Mary when he felt dizzy and fainted. </P>
<P> Lindsay has had a string of health problems, including heart surgery in 1988. He has also had previous fainting episodes. </P>
