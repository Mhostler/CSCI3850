<P>  Argentina said Tuesday it will decorate 87-year-old Emilie Schindler, who helped her husband Oskar save more than 1,000 Polish Jews from the Nazi Holocaust. </P>
<P> Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella will bestow upon Schindler the Order of May decoration Wednesday, on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Jews from Auschwitz, the largest World War II death camp, a ministry spokesman said. </P>
<P> ``It will be an honor for me,'' Schindler told Reuters by telephone from her house in the Buenos Aires outskirts. ``But I don't want all that. I am a very simple person.'' </P>
<P> She also said she is writing her memoirs and hopes to have them ready for publication next year. ``From my infancy to the present -- I haven't forgotten anything.'' </P>
<P> The Schindlers settled in Argentina after World War II ended. He eventually returned to Germany and died in 1974. </P>
<P> She stayed in Argentina and led a quiet life supported by Jewish groups until last year, when Steven Spielberg's Oscar-winning film ``Schindler's List'' brought her to the limelight. </P>
<P> ``It took a genius like Spielberg to make Emilie known and honored in our country and the world,'' the B'nai Brith Argentine chapter said. </P>
<P> ``Oskar and Emilie Schindler were the heroic rescuers of 1,200 Jews imprisoned at the Plaszow concentration camp in Cracow,'' it said in a press release. </P>
<P> Argentina is home to a 350,000-stong Jewish community. It has also recently been the target of some of the worst anti-Jewish attacks since World War II. </P>
<P> The Order of May is bestowed on foreigners who stand out ''because of their services and personal deeds and deserve the nation's gratitude,'' said the Foreign Ministry. </P>
<P> Schindler said, ``I have so many medals now, I don't know what to do with them. Medals from America, from Europe, from Germany, from all over.'' </P>
<P> After she dies, she will give them to Yad Vashem, the memorial to Holocaust victims in Jerusalem. </P>
<P> ``That is where the light will always shine for those who were killed,'' Schindler said. </P>
<P> She will receive the Order of May at a ceremony at the Foreign Ministry that will be attended by foreign dignitaries and human rights groups representatives. </P>
