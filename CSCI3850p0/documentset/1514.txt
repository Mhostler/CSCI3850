<P>  Planned peace talks between the Sri Lankan government and Tamil separatist guerrillas will go ahead despite Monday's rebel suicide attack which destroyed a navy patrol boat, a minister says. </P>
<P> ``The negotiations will continue,'' Deputy Defense Minister Anuruddha Ratwatte told Wednesday's state-run Daily News. </P>
<P> ``I do not think this will affect peace talks,'' a senior military officer said. ``Although it was a big loss, it should not be allowed to affect the peace talks, for the overall good of the country.'' </P>
<P> Navy divers Wednesday resumed searching for any bodies trapped inside the 330-ton Sagarawardene, which sank off the northwestern Puttalam district after being rammed by two rebel boats packed with explosives. </P>
<P> Sixteen members of the crew of 43 were rescued and the bodies of two sailors were found Tuesday. Two officers and 23 sailors are either dead or were captured by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. </P>
<P> State-owned Lankapuwath news agency said the rebels had claimed, in radio transmissions, to have captured the captain of the vessel. </P>
<P> The raid was carried out by the rebel's Sea Tigers unit, which lost five members. The unit is believed to have seized some of the vessel's weapons. </P>
<P> It was the second time the navy lost one of its boats to a rebel suicide attack. Sea Tigers rammed and sank a fast attack craft off their northern Jaffna peninsula stronghold about a year ago. </P>
<P> The Tigers have been fighting since 1983 for a separate state for their 2.5 million minority Tamil community in the island's north and east. </P>
<P> Despite fears the attack could harden the military's attitude, Ratwatte's remarks indicated the new government wanted to push ahead with efforts to end the war which has killed more than 30,000 people. </P>
<P> Analysts said the raid could be the Tamil Tigers' way of emphasizing that a cease-fire was necessary for talks to go ahead. Tigers chief Velupillai Prabhakaran pressed for a cease-fire in his reply last week to Prime Minister Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, accepting her offer of peace talks. </P>
<P> K. Manikavasagar, the government's top civil administrator in the rebel stronghold of Jaffna, appealed last week to both sides to declare a truce. </P>
<P> Prabhakaran said recently it would be difficult to resume negotiations while fighting was going on and that continuing navy attacks on fishermen in northern waters were an impediment to talks. </P>
<P> Kumaratunga has also eased a four-year-old economic embargo on the north as a goodwill gesture. The rebels responded by freeing 10 policemen held hostage since June 1990, when they broke off peace talks with the former United National Party government. </P>
<P> The Tigers have named a four-member negotiating team for peace talks. Government negotiators have not yet been named. </P>
