<P>  Nepali Prime Minister Man Mohan Adhikary, the Himalayan kingdom's first communist leader, won a unanimous vote of confidence Thursday in what opposition parties called a one-time show of undivided support. </P>
<P> An overwhelming total of 198 deputies voted in favor of Adhikary's three-and-a-half-week-old government, reflecting the opposition's unwillingness to go right back to the polls. </P>
<P> ``I hereby declare that the proposal put up by Prime Minister Man Mohan Adhikary seeking the confidence of the House has been passed by the House of Representatives,'' speaker Ram Chandra Poudel said after the vote. </P>
<P> In a symbol of consensus, Adhikary and former Congress prime minister Girija Prasad Koirala shook hands after the vote. </P>
<P> But the opposition warned the minority government to shun radical policies or risk being thrown out of power. </P>
<P> Poudel, who was elected speaker last Saturday, did not vote and three other votes in the 205-seat chamber were not cast because they belonged to deputies who had been elected from two constituencies in general polls last month. Three deputies were absent. </P>
<P> Adhikary's Communist United Marxist-Leninist (UML) party controls 88 seats in the chamber and won the support of the opposition which feared it could lose even more ground to the communists if another set of elections were held. </P>
<P> ``It will be only one-time support,'' the spokesman for the pro-palace Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP), Kamal Thapa, told Reuters before the vote. </P>
<P> Adhikary, 74, was appointed prime minister on November 29 after his party won a plurality that fell 15 votes short of an overall majority in the House of Representatives. </P>
<P> The three-year-old constitution requires a prime minister to seek a vote of confidence in the House within 30 days of being appointed. </P>
