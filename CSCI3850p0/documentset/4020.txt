<P>  The independent counsel investigating President Clinton's personal and political finances is examining whether his 1990 campaign for Arkansas governor improperly funneled tens of thousands of dollars into black communities to turn out the vote, U.S. News and World Report reported Saturday. </P>
<P> It said investigators are reviewing the conduct of several close Clinton associates, including a senior White House aide and longtime Clinton confidant Bruce Lindsey, who was his campaign treasurer in 1990. </P>
<P> The weekly news magazine said the FBI has questioned a top Clinton political aide, a man named Carol Willis, who has long served as one of president's chief liaisons to the black community in Arkansas. </P>
<P> U.S. News said lawyers and others familiar with the 1990 campaign finances say Lindsey authorized the withdrawal of large amounts of cash from the campaign's bank account for get-out-the-vote efforts. </P>
<P> It said Willis was the principal campaign aide who disbursed the cash and that his efforts are being scrutinized by a federal grand jury in Little Rock, Ark., which is examining the so-called Whitewater affair. </P>
<P> Arkansas law bars cash expenditures of more than $50. U.S. News said Willis routinely passed out cash to Clinton campaign supporters in amounts ranging from a few hundred dollars to nearly $1,000. </P>
<P> Lindsey said in a statement released Saturday that Clinton's 1990 campaign ``made traditional, legal and publicly reported 'get-out-the-vote' efforts in both the primary and general election campaigns. </P>
<P> ``The campaign reported spending slightly over $33,000 in the primary $50,000 in the general election campaign for, among other things, traditional get-out-the-vote activities as literature distribution, door knockers, rides to the polls, campaign visibility at the polls, etc.,'' he said. </P>
<P> He said that as is customary because of the large number of campaign workers involved and the small dollar amount of each individual expenditure, ``cash withdrawals and expenditures were made with respect to these activities.'' </P>
<P> ``The Clinton for governor campaign was mindful of its obligations under the law and attempted to fully comply with those duties,'' he said. </P>
