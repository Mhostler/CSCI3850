<DATELINE>ASSIUT, Egypt (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Police have arrested 62 people in a southern Egyptian village after a shootout this week between two feuding families killed 24 and left 18 wounded, security sources said Saturday. </P>
<P> In the worst incident of its kind in Egypt for years, armed men opened fire at random in a violent rampage Friday through the center of Maasarat al-Haggag village. </P>
<P> The dead included nine women and three children and only half of the victims were members of the feuding families. </P>
<P> Those in detention include Eid Abderrahim, suspected of leading the armed gang on its rampage. He gave himself up to police Friday evening and handed in an automatic rifle and ammunition, the sources said. </P>
<P> Altogether police have seized four automatic rifles and three revolvers in the village, in Minya province 110 miles south of Cairo. </P>
<P> The war between the Marei and Abderrahim families was the bloody outcome of a longstanding feud and had nothing to do with the Muslim militant violence common in the area, residents said. </P>
