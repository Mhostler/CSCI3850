<P>  Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole said Tuesday he had strong reservations about President Clinton's plan to go to Moscow for World War II victory ceremonies, urging him to also go to London. </P>
<P> The White House announced Monday that Clinton would travel to Moscow for May 9 ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary of the allied victory in Europe, but would be unable to attend similar ceremonies in Britain, France and Germany. </P>
<P> ``While this is clearly President Clinton's call, I have some serious reservations about his decision to go to Moscow on May 9, particularly in the light of the ongoing Russian assault on Chechnya,'' Dole said in a statement. </P>
<P> He said Clinton should use his visit to raise objections to the violence against the breakaway region and to Russian plans to provide nuclear reactors to Iran. </P>
<P> Clinton should also address the U.S. refusal to subject the enlargement of NATO with former Warsaw Pact countries to a Russian veto, and U.S. displeasure with ``Russian support for the rogue regimes in Iraq, Iran, Serbia and Cuba,'' Dole said. </P>
<P> He said he hoped Clinton would consider attending Victory in Europe ceremonies in London, Paris and Berlin. He particularly urged him to go to London on May 8 to celebrate V-E Day with the British ``whose soldiers and leaders played a critical role during the Second World War.'' </P>
