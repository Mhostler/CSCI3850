<P>  Officials from 12 European countries inaugurated Friday the world's brightest source of X-rays -- a giant microscope to study complex atomic and molecular structures including the AIDS virus. </P>
<P> The European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, called an ESRF or a Synchrotron, sends electrons speeding along a 2,790-foot circular path built in concrete to create light beams. </P>
<P> Its six billion electron-volts of power generate X-ray pictures enlarged 10 million times. </P>
<P> ESRF General Manager Yves Petroff said he expected some 2,000 medical, biology and chemistry researchers to come to this French Alpine city each year to use Synchrotron. </P>
<P> He said the facility would be available free of charge to scientists from the 12 European countries that contributed to its construction -- Belgium, Britain, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland. </P>
<P> European industrialists will be charged 3,000 francs ($550) an hour. </P>
<P> Top contributors to the 2.6 billion franc ($480 million) project were France and Germany, which paid 27.5 percent and 25.5 percent of construction costs respectively. Britain contributed 14 percent. </P>
