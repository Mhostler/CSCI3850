<DATELINE>ATLANTA (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Lawyers fighting to stop the execution of British-born Nicholas Ingram made a desperate appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court Thursday, only hours before he was scheduled to die in Georgia's electric chair. </P>
<P> A court spokesman in Washington said Ingram's lawyers had requested a stay of execution after a lower appeal court had refused to consider their argument that electrocution is cruel and inhuman punishment barred by the U.S. Constitution. </P>
<P> The application to the Supreme Court was one of several last minute appeals on behalf of Ingram, a 31-year-old convicted murder who was scheduled to be executed at 7 p.m. EDT at a state prison near Jackson, Georgia, about 40 miles southeast of Atlanta. </P>
<P> A separate hearing was set to take place Thursday afternoon in a U.S. District Court in Atlanta, after the Georgia Supreme Court refused to block the execution on the grounds that Ingram had allegedly been drugged during his 1983 trial. </P>
<P> ``We have some hope of staying the execution in the federal district court. That's where our real hope is, I suspect,'' said British attorney David Marshall, who has been working with Ingram's defense team. </P>
<P> Ingram, who has dual British and U.S. nationality, was convicted of shooting dead 55-year-old J.C. Sawyer and wounding his wife, Mary Eunice, after forcing his way into their log cabin in suburban Atlanta on June 3, 1983. </P>
<P> He robbed the couple of $60 and drove off in their pickup truck after tying them to a tree outside their home and shooting them both in the head. </P>
<P> A lawyer for Ingram said he had been ``in a state of terror'' when he saw him Monday. </P>
<P> The Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles refused to commute the death sentence early on Thursday after taking the unprecedented step of sending its chairman to meet Ingram the day before. </P>
<P> Board chairman J. Wayne Garner said all four members of the panel had now agreed that Ingram's punishment was appropriate for his crime. </P>
<P> ``Days like yesterday and today are very long and very tough,'' Garner said. ``But I will tell you it was a long and tough day for the Sawyers.'' </P>
<P> The Ingram case has drawn international attention, with the condemned man's mother making a plea for intervention from British Prime Minister John Major and the European Parliament appealing to President Clinton to stop the execution. </P>
<P> Ingram, a native of Cambridge, England, was allowed to have visitors in his cell until 4 p.m. EDT Thursday. </P>
<P> U.S. District Judge Horace Ward Wednesday denied a request to allow a ``spiritual adviser'' to remain in the prison with Ingram until he is executed. </P>
