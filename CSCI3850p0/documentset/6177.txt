<P>  Russia's defense ministry said its forces came under fire from separatist fighters in Chechnya Monday in defiance of Moscow's three-day-old unilateral cease-fire, Itar-Tass news agency reported. </P>
<P> Tass quoted the ministry's press service as saying the rebels had attacked Russian troop positions with mortar bombs and light weapons but gave few details of the fighting. </P>
<P> A senior Russian official said groups of fighters loyal to separatist leader Dzhokhar Dudayev had regrouped and some had penetrated into the shattered regional capital, Grozny. </P>
<P> Tass quoted him as saying that tension had grown ``significantly'' in and around Grozny, which Russian forces seized in February after weeks of fighting in which thousands of civilians, Russian soldiers and rebel fighters were killed. </P>
<P> More than four months after Russia sent troops to end Chechnya's three-year independence drive, the rebels still control the southern part of the region and the Russian army is not yet fully in control of the lowlands. </P>
