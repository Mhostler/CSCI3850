<P>  A German court cleared the names Thursday of three alleged Irish nationalists who had been accused of bombing and killing for the guerrilla Irish Republican Army. </P>
<P> The Federal Court rejected an appeal by prosecutors against the acquittal last June of Donna Maguire, Sean Hick and Paul Hughes who had been charged with the 1990 slaying of a British army officer at his Dortmund home. </P>
<P> Maj. Michael Dillon-Lee died in a hail of bullets from a Kalashnikov AK-47 assault rifle and a Browning automatic as he and his wife returned from a party. </P>
<P> The Federal Court also upheld the trio's acquittal in the same trial of attempted murder charges in a failed 1990 bombing of a British army barracks. </P>
<P> Hick and Hughes were freed last year but Maguire is still on trial separately in the northern town of Celle, charged with three other suspected IRA guerrillas of bombing British barracks in 1989 and of spying on army installations. </P>
<P> The Federal Court had described the three as members of an IRA cell which was active on mainland Europe in 1990, although it was not certain if the three admitted membership. </P>
<P> The Duesseldorf trial last year was the third attempt in a four-year legal battle to convict Maguire of attacks for the IRA, which last September called a cease-fire in its 25-year fight to end British rule in Northern Ireland. </P>
<P> Maguire, from Northern Ireland, has been acquitted of explosives charges in Dublin and, together with her co-defendants, was acquitted by a Dutch court in 1991 of the murder of two Australian tourists mistaken for off-duty British soldiers in Roermond. </P>
