<P>  Philippine President Fidel Ramos Thursday ordered arrangements made with Singapore for a neutral, third-party autopsy of the remains of a murdered Filipina maid so it could be determined once and for all if a woman could have killed her. </P>
<P> In March, Singapore hanged Filipina Flor Contemplacion for double murder despite an appeal from Philippines President Fidel Ramos, setting off a bitter row threatening to derail relations between the two countries. </P>
<P> American experts, acting at Singapore's request, and Filipino experts failed to agree after jointly examining the exhumed remains of murder victim Delia Maga Wednesday in an effort to resolve the dispute. </P>
<P> The American scientists who took part in Wednesday's study agreed with the original findings of a Singaporean pathologist that Maga was strangled and her injuries were consistent with an attack by a woman. </P>
<P> ``She died of strangulation and our firm opinion is there's no question that Flor Contemplacion could have done it,'' Michael Baden, director of the New York State Police Forensic Sciences Unit, told reporters. </P>
<P> Ramos said he hoped a final autopsy on Maga's remains, the fourth since she was killed in 1991, would ``lead to the truth.'' </P>
<P> Contemplacion had confessed to killing Maga and a three-year-old Singaporean boy in Maga's care. </P>
<P> To critics who accuse Singapore of heartless and draconian laws, the government's response is that the tough laws help keep the crime rate low and it won't change them or bend them. </P>
<P> Many Filipinos believe Contemplacion was framed and a Manila inquiry suggested Maga was killed by a man. </P>
<P> ``I have instructed the Department of Foreign Affairs to make the necessary arrangements with its Singaporean counterpart toward the convening of a third party forensic panel, whose composition shall be mutually agreed upon, to conduct the final re-examination of the remains of Delia Maga,'' Ramos said in a statement. </P>
<P> ``I am confident that, with the willingness and firm resolve of both the Philippine and Singapore governments to keep the lines of communications open, we will be able to complete the review and re-examination process that would lead to the truth,'' he said. </P>
<P> Some Philippine officials have proposed it be done by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation. </P>
<P> The American experts, who have been involved in other high-profile cases, such as the deaths of Martin Luther King, John F. Kennedy and Elvis Presley, rejected the Filipinos' findings that Maga might have been killed by a man. </P>
<P> ``There is no basis whatsoever for concluding that Delia Maga was killed by a man or a woman skilled in martial arts,'' they said in a statement. </P>
<P> The Filipinos arrived at the theory of a possible male assailant after noting what they said were fractures in Maga's ribs not reflected in the 1991 autopsy in Singapore. </P>
<P> The fractures suggested she was severely beaten before she was strangled, they said. </P>
<P> But the Americans said the ``defects'' in Maga's ribs were the result of the skeleton's rapid deterioration since death. </P>
<P> The other Americans were William Maples, a University of Florida anthropology professor, and Cyril Wecht, pathology department director at St. Francis Central Hospital, Pittsburgh, Pa. </P>
