<P>  Former Detroit Mayor Coleman Young showed signs of improving from an acute respiratory ailment Tuesday as doctors discounted the possibility he suffered a stroke. </P>
<P> Young, 76, remained in serious condition and on a respirator at Detroit Receiving Hospital, where he was rushed unconscious on Monday. </P>
<P> Young's cousin and personal physician, Claud Young, said the mayor was suffering from the onset of pneumonia and was responding to a broad-spectrum antibiotic. </P>
<P> Diagnostic tests did not show signs of a stroke, although Dr. Young added the possibility has not been ruled out completely. </P>
<P> A computed tomography or ``CAT'' scan will provide more definitive evidence Thursday, Dr. Young said. </P>
<P> The former mayor is alert and responsive and is able to move all of his limbs, but the respirator is preventing him from speaking. </P>
<P> Dr. Young said his condition was serious but, ``If all is well, he could be off (the respirator) tomorrow.'' </P>
<P> The former mayor has a history of emphysema, a condition which makes it difficult for the lungs to keep oxygen flowing through the blood stream. It was the second time this year Coleman Young has been treated at the hospital. </P>
<P> Young led Detroit for 20 years before deciding not to run for re-election in 1993 for health reasons. As Detroit's top executive, Young, who is black, enjoyed widespread support among the city's mostly black population. </P>
