<P>  A homemade boat carrying 18 Cubans, including five children, landed on Miami Beach Thursday, marking the first successful refugee crossing since a change in U.S. policy stemmed the flow in August. </P>
<P> The Cubans left Puerto Padre on Dec. 29 in a 24-foot wooden boat powered by a diesel engine and arrived in the United States after stopovers at Ragged and Andros Islands in the Bahamas. They were all in good health, Mike Sheehy, assistant chief of the U.S. Border Patrol said. </P>
<P> Sheehy said the group, which included two doctors, were in the custody of the U.S. Border Patrol and a decision would be made shortly on whether they would be released or go to a holding center operated by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. </P>
<P> The children are between six and 13 years old. </P>
<P> President Clinton announced in August a reversal in a 28-year policy of allowing Cubans automatic asylum as a flood of refugees poured into the United States. </P>
<P> Many boats have since been intercepted by the United States and most of the refugees taken to the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. About 21,000 Cubans are being held at Guantanamo and 7,800 more in camps in Panama. </P>
<P> A federal appeals court in Atlanta ruled Wednesday that refugees who had failed to make it into U.S. territory and were taken to Guantanamo could be deported by the American government. </P>
<P> The Clinton administration, which repatriated 3,000 Haitian refugees against their will earlier this month, however, stated Wednesday it has no intention of taking similar action against the Cubans. </P>
<P> In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Christine Shelly said Thursday that despite the arrival of the boatload of Cubans, the Havana government appeared to be honoring its pledge last September to halt the flow of refugees. </P>
<P> ``We have always known that there could be incidents, successful travel of this kind,'' she told a news briefing. </P>
<P> ``But I think overall insofar as it touches on the commitments which the Cuban authorities have made to police their borders and try to stop the flow, I think that they have been certainly rigorous in their efforts to implement their commitments in this,'' she said. </P>
