<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P> By Michael Posner  With soothing voice and grandfatherly demeanor, President Clinton's special White House counsel Lloyd Cutler played the role of fireman Tuesday, trying to douse the potentially incendiary Whitewater affair. </P>
<P> That was the role the white-haired Washington insider was enlisted to play in March after White House counsel Bernard Nussbaum quit after questions were raised about possible White House meddling in a probe of the Whitewater matter. </P>
<P> And on this opening day of congressional hearings on the Arkansas land deal, the 76-year-old Cutler, a cornerstone of the Washington legal establishment, played the fireman's role to the hilt. </P>
<P> The elder statesman was up at dawn and telling the world on TV talk shows that White House and Treasury officials had done nothing improper in their many discussions about the Whitewater matter. </P>
<P> And before going to Capitol Hill as the lead-off witness in House Banking Committee hearings into Whitewater, Cutler briefed reporters as part of his damage control blitz that started Sunday on yet another TV interview program. </P>
<P> The message was similar on the air and in the hearing room: nothing illegal or improper was done nor were officials trying to influence the Resolution Trust Corporation, an independent agency looking into the failed Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan. </P>
<P> That savings institution is central to the Whitewater matter, a resort land deal in which Bill and Hillary Clinton were partners with Madison's owner, James McDougal. Investigators are trying to find out if any savings money was improperly diverted to Whitewater or to then Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton's campaign coffers. </P>
<P> This was not a new fireman's role for Cutler, who started practicing law six years before Clinton was born. </P>
<P> Cutler was the pick of then-President Jimmy Carter, the last Democratic president, who brought him into the White House in the third year of his administration, in 1979, to bring calm to the then-troubled Carter administration. </P>
<P> But in 1980, Cutler found himself on the hot seat. </P>
<P> Cutler was accused of monitoring a federal probe of Carter's brother Billy's dealings with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and improperly keeping the president advised. </P>
<P> But Cutler's explanation to Congress satisfied the inquisitors and he obviously hopes they buy his story now. </P>
