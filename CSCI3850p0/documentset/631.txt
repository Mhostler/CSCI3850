<DATELINE>SRINAGAR, India (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Indian forces packed up their bunkers around Kashmir's holiest Muslim shrine Saturday, triggering rare celebrations and claims of a major victory by separatist leaders fighting New Delhi's rule. </P>
<P> Indian troops and the paramilitary Border Security Force (BSF) had surrounded the lakeside Hazratbal shrine in Srinagar, summer capital of the northern Jammu and Kashmir state, since a month-long standoff last October with Muslim militants inside the shrine. </P>
<P> Kashmiri leaders had demanded the removal of the bunkers, which had been erected last year to enable troops to flush out the militants. </P>
<P> The removal of the posts had also been sought by pro-Pakistan Haraktul Ansar militants as a condition for allowing safe passage to Hindu pilgrims on their annual pilgrimage later this month to the mountain temple of Amarnath. </P>
<P> ``This is a victory for the whole Kashmiri population,'' Professor Abdul Ghani, a leader of the all-party Hurriyat (Freedom) Conference, said at a formal departure ceremony attended by Indian officials. </P>
<P> ``We call upon Kashmiris to celebrate this triumph by lighting lamps for two consecutive nights,'' he said. </P>
<P> Kashmir's top bureaucrat, Mahmoodur Rahman, and Police Chief Manohar Nath Sabharwal looked on as Hurriyat leaders entered the shrine and brought out a sacred relic, believed to be a hair from Prophet Mohammed's beard, for public display. </P>
<P> A spokesman for the Muslim Auquaf Trust, managing body of the Hazratbal shrine, said Friday the government had agreed to dismantle all of the posts. </P>
<P> Kashmiri militant groups had threatened war on worshippers heading for the Hindu religious center of Amarnath if paramilitary forces were not removed from Hazratbal shrine. </P>
<P> Amarnath is a remote cave near Pahalgam, southeast of Srinagar. It is only open to pilgrims for a brief period each summer when winter snows have retreated and weather conditions permit. It is a 30-mile trek from Pahalgam. </P>
<P> The Ansar militant group said last month it would ban the annual Amarnath pilgrimage to protest the permanent stationing of the BSF posts around the Muslim shrine. </P>
<P> Gahni said the Hurriyat would try to persuade the militants to call off their threat. </P>
<P> ``We believe in religious tolerance, we are not against any religion,'' he told the meeting at Hazratbal. </P>
<P> Last year's siege, which ended peacefully with the militants' surrender in return for their eventual release, was an emotional high point in the Kashmiri rebellion against Indian rule that erupted in January 1990. </P>
<P> Police and hospital sources have reported more than 17,000 deaths in the revolt, which is widely supported in largely Hindu India's only Muslim-majority state. </P>
<P> Pakistan and India have fought two of their three wars since independence from Britain in 1947 over Kashmir. </P>
