<DATELINE>TUNIS, Tunisia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Gunmen killed seven foreigners in Algeria Monday, shooting five dead in a bus ambush and killing two dining in a restaurant near the capital, embassy and official sources said. </P>
<P> Four Algerians including two officials with important posts were also killed, bringing the death toll for the day to 11. At least 49 foreigners have died in Algeria's 30 months of political violence. </P>
<P> No one claimed immediate responsibility for the attacks, but last September the fundamentalist Armed Islamic Group gave foreigners one month to leave the country or face death for alleged support to the army-backed government. </P>
<P> Four Russians and a Romanian were killed when men disguised as police manning a ``road check'' stopped their bus. </P>
<P> The five, who worked with the state oil and gas giant Sonatrach, were with about 10 Algerians going to work and passing through the Algiers suburb of Oued Ouchayeh, a hotbed of militant Muslim fundamentalism. </P>
<P> The gunmen separated the foreigners from their Algerian colleagues, ordered them out of the bus, and ``machine-gunned'' them, an embassy spokesman said. </P>
<P> ``They (the foreigners) could be distinguished by reading their names on the badges they wore,'' he said. The killers fled. </P>
<P> Two citizens of former Yugoslavia and two Algerians were killed in the attack on the zoological park's restaurant six miles from central Algiers. The restaurant is popular with diplomats, foreign businessmen and wealthy locals. </P>
<P> Two people whose nationalities were not immediately known were wounded. </P>
<P> Security forces quoted by the official news agency APS blamed the lunchtime restaurant attack on ``terrorists'' who opened fire on customers sitting at the tables. </P>
<P> Algerian officials use the term ``terrorist'' for armed Muslim militants who they blame for violence that has shaken the north African country since the army-backed govermnment cancelled elections which Islamists were poised to win. </P>
<P> The latest killings came four days after seven Italian seamen had their throats slit by suspected guerrillas on their cargo ship in Jenjen port, 150 miles east of Algiers. </P>
<P> The biggest single number of foreigners to die were 12 Croat Christian technicians who had their throats cut last December. </P>
<P> Last September the fundamentalist Armed Islamic Group gave foreigners one month to leave the country or face death for alleged support of the army-backed government. </P>
<P> Armed militants have been fighting in this country of 26 million people since January 1992. At least 3,700 people have been killed in the fighting. </P>
