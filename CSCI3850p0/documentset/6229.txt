<P>  Pope John Paul on Wednesday said the escalation of the conflict in ex-Yugslavia had brought back thundering weapons to Europe 50 years after World War Two. </P>
<P> ``While celebrations are underway for the 50th anniversary of the end of World War Two, the gloomy thunder of weapons has returned to echo over Europe,'' the Pope said at his weekly general audience. </P>
<P> He spoke a day after Croatian forces seized control of all key points in the Western Slavonian enclave, held by Serbs since 1991. Croatian Serbs retaliated by rocketing the centre of Zagreb in an attack that killed five and injured 134 others. </P>
<P> The Pope, who has made hundreds of appeals for peace in the Balkans and had to cancel a trip to the Bosnian capital Sarajevo last year for security reason, said he had been saddened and worried by attacks against innocent civilians. </P>
<P> ``I want to recall once more that peace is not built with weapons, combat does not promote understanding, fanning the flames of hate does not favour negotiations,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``We all expect the leaders of those nations to show signs of far-sightedness and to assume their responsibilities coherently so that those dear populations exhausted by war can resume their path to the future with confidence,'' he added. </P>
