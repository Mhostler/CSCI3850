<DATELINE>PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  American soldiers seized control of Haiti's state-run television and radio early Friday, as U.S. troops laid out the biggest show of force seen in the capital since arriving to help restore democracy. </P>
<P> Soldiers in tanks cleared the two main communications buildings before stringing up barbed wire and preventing employees from entering. </P>
<P> ``Our assessment of that is that national television and radio was in illegal hands, namely the hands of the illegal government.'' U.S. ambassador to Haiti William Swing said on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' program. </P>
<P> ``They continue to broadcast vitriolic statements about (exiled) President (Jean-Bertrand) Aristide, attacking everything that we're trying to do here in restoring democracy, and it was high time that that be changed.'' </P>
<P> As soldiers manned tank positions along a main road into Port-au-Prince to prevent unrest on the anniversary of the 1991 military coup overthrowing Aristide, some Haitians began a looting spree in the poor port area near where an explosion Thursday killed five people and wounded over 40. </P>
<P> A group of men pried over the metal doors of a food store believed owned by feared police captain Joseph Michel Francois and scrambled on top of each other to grab bags of rice and other supplies. </P>
<P> At the state-run radio station near the U.S. embassy, soldiers turned away employees reporting for work. </P>
<P> ``Our mission was to come in and secure the radio station,'' Lieutenant Gail Yoshitani told Reuters. ``There were no shots fired.'' </P>
<P> Under a September 18 deal negotiated with former President Jimmy Carter, Haiti's military leaders are scheduled to stop down by October 15, paving the way for Aristide's return. </P>
