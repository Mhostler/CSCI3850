<P>  Strong winds from Typhoon Teresa forced a ship aground off Manila and prompted power cuts in much of the main Philippine island of Luzon, officials said Friday. </P>
<P> The typhoon battered the northern Philippines with winds at its center of up to 90 mph. </P>
<P> ``The waves were so strong one ship ran aground at the breakwater of Manila Bay,'' a navy spokesman said. Details of the incident were not available. </P>
<P> Scores of houses on Polillo island, just east of Luzon in the Pacific, were demolished. ``Some 80 percent of the houses on Polillo island were destroyed. One man was hit by falling lumber,'' said Tess Padua of the social welfare department. </P>
<P> Several women were injured when a billboard in Manila fell on them after being blown down by the wind. Toppled street lights and trees blocked roads in the capital and some vehicles were damaged. </P>
<P> Flood and mudflow warnings were raised in villages which were earlier swamped by steaming rivers of mud swept down the flanks of the Pinatubo volcano. </P>
<P> Power in large parts of Manila and Luzon was shut off because of the danger of winds bringing down overhead power cables. </P>
<P> Flights from Japan and the U.S. territory of Guam in the Pacific were cancelled. Other international flights were diverted. Domestic flights to northern Luzon were also called off. </P>
<P> Branches from falling trees broke windows in the control tower at Manila's international airport, forcing air traffic officials to rig temporary covers. </P>
<P> ``There are some problems about visibility and the strong winds. Some passengers have been stranded but operations are beginning to normalize,'' Manila airport general manager Guillermo Cunanan said in a radio interview. </P>
<P> Schools were closed and government and private firms sent workers home early. </P>
<P> The weather bureau said Teresa was expected to cross into the South China Sea by late Friday afternoon and head towards Vietnam or southern China. </P>
