<P>  President Clinton Friday acknowledged that U.S. policy toward Cuba has been heavily criticized by other nations but said it has been proper and will not be changed. </P>
<P> Responding to a question about Cuba following a speech to the American Society of Newspaper Editors, Clinton acknowledged that other countries have called for ending the U.S. trade embargo against the last communist regime in the Western Hemisphere. </P>
<P> ``Even though I recognize most countries disagree with it, I think being firm has been the proper policy and I do not believe we should change it, except within the confines of the Cuba Democracy Act,'' he said. </P>
<P> The act stiffened sanctions against Cuba and set up conditions that must be met before any changes could take place. </P>
