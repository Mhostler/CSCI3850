<P>  A gunman opened fire on guards at Israel's industrial complex on the Dead Sea Friday and guards returned fire, hit the attacker and captured him, Israel Radio said. </P>
<P> Israeli security sources confirmed the radio report. </P>
<P> The radio said guards at the site ``captured an armed terrorist'' after he shot at them and they fired back and wounded him. It made no mention of any other casualties. </P>
<P> Authorities were investigating how the man got close enough to the complex to shoot at the guards. Jordan is just across the Dead Sea from the factories but it was not immediately clear where the gunman came from. </P>
<P> Jordan and Israel signed a peace treaty last October but there are a large number of Palestinian refugees from the various Middle East wars living in the Hashemite kingdom, some of whom oppose peace with Israel. </P>
<P> Israel, struggling to shield revelers on the Jewish Passover from the specter of Islamic suicide bombings, has sealed off its borders to all Palestinians from Gaza and the West Bank. </P>
<P> Troops and police are on high alert throughout the territories and Israel. </P>
<P> Earlier Friday, Israeli security forces shot and wounded two Israeli Arabs who fled a roadblock in central Israel near the border with the occupied West Bank, Israeli police said. The two turned out to be car thieves. </P>
<P> Israeli soldiers traveling in a jeep in the occupied West Bank Thursday shot and wounded a Palestinian driver who tried to overtake their vehicle. </P>
<P> Friday morning, the army slapped a curfew until further notice on the West Bank town of Hebron, a flashpoint of Jewish-Arab violence, where about 400 Israelis live among some 100,000 Palestinians. The curfew applied to the town's Arabs only. </P>
<P> The army said the curfew was imposed for ``security reasons.'' </P>
