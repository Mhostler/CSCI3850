<DATELINE>CHICAGO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Two fugitives sought in a plot to free a Puerto Rican nationalist from prison with a helicopter and powerful explosives have surrendered after more than nine years on the run, the government said Tuesday. </P>
<P> Claude Marks, 45, and Donna Willmott, 44, both on the FBI's ``Ten Most Wanted'' list and pursued since 1985, surrendered in Chicago after months of negotiations through their lawyer, the FBI and the Justice Department said. </P>
<P> ``Political causes are not good enough reasons in this country under our laws to justify this kind of conduct under any circumstances,'' U.S. Attorney James Burns told a news conference. ``We view their conduct as having been very dangerous.'' </P>
<P> Marks and Willmott were indicted along with five others in 1986 for an alleged plot to free Oscar Lopez and Kojo Sababu from the Leavenworth federal penitentiary. Lopez is an alleged leader of the FALN -- Fuerzas Armadas de Liberacion Nacional Puertorriquena -- which espouses Puerto Rican independence. </P>
<P> The government said it was not alleging that Marks and Willmott -- who were together during their nine years as fugitives -- were members of the FALN, but said they were working ``in concert'' with Lopez. </P>
<P> The 1986 indictment said the seven -- of whom Marks and Willmott were the only ones not in prison or finished serving prison terms -- conspired to transport explosives ``with the intent to kill people and damage buildings.'' </P>
<P> They allegedly bought what they were told was 40 pounds of ''C-4'' plastic explosive in Louisiana in 1985. The material was inert, and the man they thought was a weapons merchant was really an undercover agent, the announcement said. </P>
<P> They later drove to Los Angeles but discovered their car had been bugged and fled in June 1985, leaving behind a helicopter flight training manual among other things. </P>
<P> Burns said Marks had taken helicopter lessons and the plot called for freeing Lopez and Sababu with an airborne assault on the Kansas prison using the plastic explosives. </P>
<P> ``The toll of dead and injured human beings and the millions of dollars in damaged and destroyed property by acts of terrorism is not diminished by the passage of time,'' Burns said. </P>
<P> ``The use of powerful explosives, with the obvious and likely risk of loss of life, is a crime that is neither justified nor mitigated by resort to political idealism or claims to some asserted moral 'high ground,''' he added. </P>
