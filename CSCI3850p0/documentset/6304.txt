<DATELINE>SARAJEVO, May 5 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Fierce fighting broke out around a northern Croat-held pocket of Bosnia on Friday morning in what the United Nations said could be a Bosnian Serb response to this week's Croatian Serb territorial losses. </P>
<P> U.N. observers said there was heavy shelling around the Orasje pocket and to the west of the Serb-held town of Brcko, which straddles a vital Serb supply corridor linking western and eastern parts of the land they control. </P>
<P> The fighting began at dawn and more than 2,000 artillery and mortar shells rained down on a small stretch of the front line in less than three hours, U.N. officials said. </P>
<P> The fighting was the worst in Bosnia since a four-month truce expired on Monday. </P>
<P> ``We believe from early unconfirmed reports this may be a BSA (Bosnian Serb army) attack,'' U.N. spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Gary Coward said in Sarajevo. </P>
<P> The Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA said units of the Bosnian government army and Croat forces had attacked BSA soldiers. The Brcko region has seen heavy fighting throughout the three years of war in Bosnia. </P>
<P> It said three people were killed in Brcko, a port on the river Sava border between Bosnia and Croatia, in shelling from Croatian-held territory. </P>
<P> Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic promised his forces they would retaliate for the capture of Serb-held Western Slavonia in Croatia by the Croatian army earlier this week. </P>
<P> Asked if the fighting around the sliver of Croat-controlled Bosnian territory just south of Croatia proper could be the expected response, Coward said: ``A reasonable man might assume so.'' </P>
<P> In the first hours of Croatia's attack on Western Slavonia Karadzic promised to lend assistance but no help arrived for the now defeated and captured Croatian Serb soldiers. </P>
<P> The BSA is thought to be preoccupied with countering the rising strength of the Moslem-led Bosnian government army and hampered by shortages of fuel and manpower. </P>
<P> Serb forces blasted an exposed mountain road with heavy machine gun fire on Thursday night, continuing their attempts to cut the only government-held route linking Sarajevo and the outside world and tighten their siege of the city. </P>
<P> Nearly 200 rounds from large calibre weapons supposedly banned from use around Sarajevo by U.N. resolution hit the Mount Igman road, said U.N. spokesman Major Guy Vinet. </P>
<P> The road is the only access to the city for Bosnian citizens and supply traffic and is littered with the wreckage of vehicles blown apart by Serb fire while making the dangerous descent. </P>
<P> The Bosnian government on Thursday threatened to fire on all Serb supply routes around the city unless the Igman path was left in peace. </P>
<P> If the threat from Hasan Muratovic, minister responsible for relations with the U.N., was carried out it would continue the downward spiral in the security of the city, already plagued by an increase in shelling and sniping in the last month. </P>
