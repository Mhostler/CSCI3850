<DATELINE>AZADI, Iraq (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Seven Iraqi Kurdish shepherds, last seen being led away by Turkish troops hunting separatist rebels, were found dead in the mountains, and their relatives Tuesday accused the soldiers of murdering them. </P>
<P> The villagers in Azadi, 20 miles south of the Turkish border, said the shepherds -- beaten by soldiers Sunday and forced to leave their flocks -- were found dead in the mountains Monday and Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``It's certain that the Turkish soldiers did this. Turkey comes here and we see that they are murderers. They want to destroy us,'' said Fatima Derwish, whose husband and 18-year-old son were killed. </P>
<P> Turkey's foreign ministry said an investigation had begun into the incident. But it denied Turkish troops had harmed any civilians and accused the PKK of killing the shepherds as part of a ``smear campaign.'' </P>
<P> The charges raised to nine the number of civilians that Turkish troops are accused of killing since the start of the cross-border drive 16 days ago against the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). </P>
<P> Western countries including Britain, France, Germany and the United States have raised fears for the fate of civilians in the way of the thrust, the biggest by Turkey in modern times. </P>
<P> A Reuter correspondent saw seven bodies at Dohuk hospital, one missing half its head and some with huge bruises and bloody puncture wounds. Others looked as if flesh had been scooped from the bodies. </P>
<P> Four women who lost a husband, brother or son said Tuesday the troops flooded the Metina and Qara mountain areas around the village of 1,000 people early Sunday. The women said they became afraid thinking the soldiers would mistake the shepherds tending their flocks for guerrillas. </P>
<P> The Turkish troops were on a search for hiding PKK rebels and their military supplies. </P>
<P> From a small hill the women pointed to green pastures where the shepherds had been grazing their flocks when soldiers began beating them. The women said they tried to approach, waving their hands excitedly, until soldiers fired on them. </P>
<P> ``When they started shooting, we lay on the ground behind rocks screaming that we weren't PKK but women and we came for our men,'' said Derwish, nervously twisting her head scarf between her fingers. </P>
<P> The women said a Kurdish-speaking soldier told them to stay at home and assured them nothing would happen to the men. </P>
<P> ``A soldier said they would just ask the men some questions and then release them and then the soldiers forced us back to the village,'' said Esmer Zekri, whose brother was killed. </P>
<P> ``We wanted to tell them these weren't terrorists. They're shepherds, they're our men,'' she said. </P>
<P> Villagers waited a day. One of them, Mehmet Selim Ahmet, said that Monday he went to a soldiers' base in nearby Sarsang palace, once a summer retreat for Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, and asked what had happened to the men. </P>
<P> ``They told me they didn't arrest anybody and that's when we got worried and started to search for them,'' Ahmet said. </P>
<P> The villagers said they found five corpses scattered throughout the area Monday and two Tuesday. Relatives identified the seven bodies at Dohuk hospital. </P>
<P> In response, the foreign ministry said the PKK had in the past tried to blame a ``massacre'' on Turkish troops, adding: ``This time the said incident was definitely perpetrated by the PKK as part of the same smear campaign. </P>
<P> ``It is not serious at all to take into account claims that Turkish soldiers have tried to kill people by ripping them apart and cut their ears off while at the same time giving humanitarian help to the civilians in the region,'' it said. </P>
<P> ``In spite of this, an investigation has been started into the incident claimed in the news report.'' </P>
