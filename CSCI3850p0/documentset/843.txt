<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The House of Representatives approved a bill Wednesday supported by President Clinton that urges him to try to end the United Nations' Bosnia arms embargo if Serbs do not accept a peace plan. </P>
<P> The House approved a $264 billion defense authorization bill including the Bosnia provision 280-137 and sent it to the Senate for Congress's final approval. </P>
<P> In a letter last week, Clinton told Congress that he intends to comply with its request and introduce a U.N. resolution by the end of October to lift the arms embargo so Bosnian Muslims can arm and defend themselves if Serbs do not accept the latest peace proposal by October 15.  If the United Nations does not lift the embargo and Serbs fail to accept the peace proposal, the compromise would cut off all funds as of November 15 for U.S. enforcement of the embargo. </P>
<P> It would also urge Clinton to then introduce another U.N. resolution, this one to selectively lift the embargo in Sarajevo and other ``safe havens'' and arm Bosnian Muslims if Bosnian Serbs continue to attack them. </P>
<P> The Senate approved that policy in a different defense bill last week by a vote of 56-44. But it also approved 58-42 a contradictory proposal by Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole to simply order Clinton to lift U.S. participation in the embargo by November 15. </P>
<P> The proposal Clinton supports is headed for final approval by Congress in the next few days and would only stop U.S. enforcement of the embargo. </P>
<P> The full Congress could not approve Dole's contradictory proposal to require Clinton to lift the embargo and clear the way for U.S. arms shipments to Bosnian Muslims before September. If it did, that action would take precedence because it would be the latest congressional action. </P>
<P> The $264 billion defense bill also includes an artful compromise that leaves open the slightest possibility of building more than the 20 B-2 stealth bombers now planned. </P>
<P> It does not have the $150 million the Senate had approved specifically for that purpose but includes $100 million in bomber contingency money. </P>
<P> Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, a Georgia Democrat, said that money could be used for more B-2 bombers if Defense Secretary William Perry asked. </P>
<P> Perry adamantly opposed the $150 million, saying the military does not need more B-2 bombers and cannot afford them. But Nunn said he hoped Perry would change his mind. </P>
<P> The bomber is built by Northrop Corp. </P>
<P> The bill also would fund all six C-17 military transport planes Clinton requested, and his request for a new nuclear aircraft carrier. </P>
<P> The C-17 is built by McDonnell Douglas Corp. The aircraft carrier is to be built by the Newport News (Virginia) Shipbuilding Co. </P>
