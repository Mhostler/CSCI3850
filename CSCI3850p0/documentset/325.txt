<P>  Everyone wants to offer Mexico's President Carlos Salinas de Gortari a job, it seems, but the president wants it known he is not going anywhere just yet. </P>
<P> A statement released by his press office Wednesday said Salinas had been asked to teach and lecture after he leaves office December 1. The offers have come from prestigious institutions around the world, ranging from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland to the Association of Industrialists and Businessmen of Turkey, the statement said. </P>
<P> It said Salinas has also received an invitation to become honorary ambassador of the Tokyo-based University of the United Nations. But Salinas is believed to be most interested in the post of head of the World Trade Organization, a successor body to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) which will be set up in January 1995. </P>
<P> Mexico's foreign ministry has formally announced Salinas' candidacy for that post and he has garnered some support among fellow Latin American countries -- although not Brazil, which favors its own economy minister Rubens Ricupero. </P>
<P> Salinas nevertheless reassured his countrymen Wednesday that he ``will continue concentrating exclusively, until the last day of his mandate, on his tasks at the head of the executive branch,'' according to the statement. </P>
