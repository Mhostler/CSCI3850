<P>  Canada announced Friday an end to a confrontation with two trawlers owned by Spanish and Portuguese interests that had soured an agreement to protect fish off its Atlantic coast. </P>
<P> Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin and Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet said the ships, flying Belizean flags, have been stricken from the Belize shipping register as a result of their not following agreed conservation measures. </P>
<P> ``The deregistration by Belize is the result of our initiatives to ensure that fragile fish stocks are not endangered,'' Tobin said in a statement. </P>
<P> He had threatened action against the two vessels on April 17 as he was celebrating an agreement reached after bitter feuding with the European Union, which forced conservation of turbot, also known as Greenland halibut. </P>
<P> The Canadian government, arguing that the ships were using flags of convenience to get around agreed rules, asked Belize to stop these vessels from fishing in a turbot-rich area in international Northwest Atlantic waters. </P>
<P> In fact, the two boats -- the Gadus and the Albri II -- have not been seen fishing in the area since April 12, the statement said. But, using language that recalled the seizure of the Spanish trawler Estai in March, it threatened action should they return. </P>
<P> ``Should they be seen fishing contrary to Canadian regulations, they will be subject to appropriate enforcement action by Canada,'' the joint statement said. </P>
