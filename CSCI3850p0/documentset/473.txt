<P>  Quebec's separatist Parti Quebecois is still leading the ruling Liberal party in the French-speaking province by about nine percentage points, a poll published Friday showed. </P>
<P> According to the Leger & Leger poll of 1,022 Quebeckers, the first survey made since the election campaign began Sunday, 51.6 percent of decided voters would vote for the separatists while 42.7 percent would choose the Liberals. </P>
<P> This is about in line with previous polls made before the election campaign officially began, showing the separatist ahead by seven to 10 percentage points. </P>
<P> Quebeckers go to the polls September 12, and the Parti Quebecois has already said it will work immediately toward independence for Quebec. The Parti Quebecois plans to hold a referendum on separation within eight to 10 months of its victory. </P>
<P> According to the poll, which has a 3.07 percent margin of error, support for a separate Quebec is diminishing. About 44.2 percent favor separation, compared to 46.5 percent in the last poll two weeks ago. </P>
<P> The poll also shows that the Parti Quebecois would likely garner about 90 of the 125 seats in the provincial legislature with 51.6 percent of the vote. </P>
<P> ``It is not an exaggeration to think that the (Parti Quebecois) could get about 90 seats out of the 125 in the National Assembly,'' Jean-Marc Leger, president of Leger & Leger, told the Journal de Montreal, which published the poll. </P>
<P> This is mainly due to the fact that the Parti Quebecois has strong support among French-speakers, who make up about 80 percent of the Quebec population. </P>
