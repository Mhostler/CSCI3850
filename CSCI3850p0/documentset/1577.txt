<P>  Buckingham Palace refused to comment Saturday on a book speculating that the Duchess of York, known as ``Fergie,'' and the Queen's middle son Prince Andrew could repair their broken marriage. </P>
<P> The Daily Mail newspaper quoted the Duchess of York's father, Major Ronald Ferguson, as saying in an autobiography that the couple could still find happiness together. </P>
<P> Ferguson, a former polo manager for Prince Charles, heir to the British throne, made the comment in his autobiography entitled ``The Galloping Major,'' in which he defends his daughter and criticizes other members of the Royal Family. </P>
<P> A spokesman at Buckingham Palace said: ``We are not going to be drawn into commenting on Major Ferguson's book and his speculation about the Duke and Duchess of York's marriage.'' </P>
<P> Andrew, whose mother made him the Duke of York, married Sarah Ferguson in a royal wedding in 1986. They separated six years later. </P>
<P> But the couple, who have two young daughters, have remained friendly and royal watchers have been predicting a reconciliation for months. </P>
<P> ``Sarah would love to go back to Andrew and to Sunninghill (their marital home). I desperately want it to happen,'' Ferguson said. </P>
