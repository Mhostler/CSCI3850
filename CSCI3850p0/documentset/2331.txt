<P>  A parliamentary committee looking at ways to cut defense spending said Monday that Canada should scrap one-fourth of its CF-18 fighter planes and buy the navy no more submarines. </P>
<P> But the committee recommended that Canada increase the size of its army and give soldiers new armored personnel carriers to carry out international peacekeeping missions. </P>
<P> ``Our armed forces must be equipped for the new post-Cold War era where Canada's role in international peace missions reflects our commitment to world peace and stability,'' said committee co-chairman William Rompkey. </P>
<P> The committee said Canada's armed forces had been geared to protect Europe from attack by the defunct Warsaw Pact. </P>
<P> It warned that, with the Soviet threat gone, the world had actually become more insecure and Canada needed to have a credible military force to help maintain world peace. </P>
<P> Budgetary constraints forced Canada to withdraw its troops from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and Canadian bases in Germany were closed down earlier this year. </P>
<P> Canadian air force fighters have only seen action once since the Korean War, during the 1991 Gulf war against Iraq, and then only in a limited role. </P>
<P> Meanwhile, Canadian troops have got more and more involved in United Nations peacekeeping. Despite their declining numbers, there were more Canadian soldiers overseas in 1993 that at any time since the Korean War in the early 1950s. </P>
<P> The committee said Canada had the lowest defense spending in NATO and could not make many more cuts. But it found the armed forces were top heavy and proposed chopping the brass at headquarters by half, or a total of 4,000 staff posts. </P>
