<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Iraq's parliament voted Thursday to recognize Kuwait within its new U.N.-defined borders. </P>
<P> President Saddam Hussein's Revolutionary Command Council was expected to announce its final approval shortly, members of parliament said. </P>
<P> Settlement of the issue will lay to rest Iraq's longstanding claim to Kuwait as its 19th province and meet one of the cease-fire terms Baghdad accepted after its forces were driven from the emirate by a U.S.-led alliance in February 1991. </P>
<P> It is also a vital step for Iraq to win U.N. Security Council permission to resume exports from its vast oil reserves and release its economy from crippling, four-year-old trade sanctions. </P>
<P> ``The National Assembly declared its support of the recognition by the republic of Iraq of the sovereignty of the state of Kuwait and its territorial integrity and political independence, and its support for compliance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 833,'' a statement by the parliament said. </P>
<P> Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, who helped broker a settlement, met Saddam Thursday morning and then addressed a special, open session of the national assembly urging acceptance. </P>
<P> The assembly gave him a standing ovation. </P>
<P> ``Today we expect the National Assembly and the Revolutionary Command Council to ratify, in full compliance with U.N. Security Council resolutions, the sovereignty of Kuwait within internationally recognised borders,'' Kozyrev told reporters. </P>
<P> ``We have had a very substantive and businesslike meeting with President Saddam Hussein, who reaffirmed the political decision and readiness by the leadership of Iraq ... to fulfil (U.N.) Security Council resolutions,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``This will constitute a major step in the right direction which in my mind should be registered by the Security Council.'' </P>
<P> Kozyrev has pledged Moscow's help in persuading the United Nations to ease trade sanctions if Baghdad recognized Kuwait's borders set by a U.N. commission after the 1991 Gulf War. </P>
<P> The United Nations has insisted Iraq must formally recognize the border with Kuwait to comply with Gulf War cease-fire resolutions which also demand the scrapping of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and U.N. monitoring of its defense facilities. </P>
<P> The United States and Kuwait also want Iraq to respect the rights of its Kurdish and Shiite minorities and account for prisoners of war missing since 1990. </P>
<P> Baghdad declared readiness to recognize Kuwait when Kozyrev visited in October to mediate in the crisis caused by Iraq's massing of forces near Kuwait. The United Nations said recognition should go through legal and constitutional channels. </P>
<P> The U.N. Security Council is due to hold a regular review of sanctions Monday and there is no sign that Britain and the United States have shifted their positions. </P>
<P> British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said Wednesday that while Britain would view recognition of Kuwait as a step forward, it would want to study any declaration carefully. </P>
<P> Previous Iraqi governments have shunned any attempt to formalize a border they see as a legacy of British colonialism. </P>
