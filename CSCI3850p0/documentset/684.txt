<P>  First Lady Susana Higuchi, no stranger to controversy, has again churned Peru's political waters with a protest over an electoral law that bans her from running for office and a frank critique of her husband's rule. </P>
<P> In prime-time interviews over the weekend, Higuchi aired her ``differences of ideas'' with President Alberto Fujimori and even left open the possibility that she could be his opponent in next April's general elections. </P>
<P> ``We live in a democratic country and democracy begins with the presidential family,'' a serene Higuchi said from the home of a former aide where she took refuge last week to avoid what she called ``personal pressures'' in Government Palace. </P>
<P> After the interviews, which even included her criticism of a key presidential adviser, Fujimori rushed home from Bogota where he had been attending the inauguration of Colombian president Ernesto Samper over the weekend. </P>
<P> Higuchi arrived at the presidential palace Tuesday afternoon saying she planned to talk with her husband and visit her children but the first lady said she had not decided if she planned to stay. </P>
<P> She also distributed a new letter to Peru's Congress in which she reiterated that Constitution states no prohibitions can be imposed on seeking office aside from the ones barring the police and military from running as candidates. </P>
<P> The political storm began last Wednesday when Higuchi made public a letter to Peru's congressmen and the Attorney General protesting that an article of the electoral law banning her or Fujimori's family from seeking office was unconstitutional. </P>
<P> Higuchi said Sunday night her intention was to test Peru's new constitution and its civil rights. </P>
<P> Last week, Peru's Attorney General Blanca Nelida Colan rejected Higuchi's plea saying a Constitutional Tribunal aimed at resolving constitutional disputes had yet to be installed. </P>
<P> Asked if she was thinking of running for president, Higuchi said: ``I haven't decided yet, but in the face of the challenge I will think about it.'' </P>
<P> Fujimori, who four years into his term was enjoying a 65 percent approval rating, on Sunday called elections April 9 of next year as required by law. He has yet to declare whether he will run for a second term but few in Peru doubt that he will. </P>
<P> ``This could complicate the political panorama,'' said Manuel Torrado, head of the Datum polling agency. ``If either the president or the First Lady say something wrong, it could cause problems for Fujimori.'' </P>
<P> Torrado said Higuchi's argument that she was defending not only her rights but those of 22 million of her compatriots could go over well with Peruvians, who tend to identify with the downtrodden. </P>
<P> She also seemed to strike a nerve of the national sensibility when she spoke frankly about Fujimori's neglect of the social needs of the Peruvian populace during a tough four-year-old economic austerity program. </P>
<P> ``I have observed with impotence how tuberculosis has advanced in the country, which indicates there is hunger, because this illness does not increase for no reason at all.'' Higuchi also said her husband should pay less attention to works of infrastructure and more to an integrated approach to meeting the basic needs of the Peruvian people. </P>
<P> Higuchi, whose marriage with Fujimori has for some time been reported in difficult straits, said she planned to return to home soon and that her dispute with husband over ``ideas and work'' should not be confused with ``marital discord.'' </P>
