<P> Perry's visit is part of a continuing dialogue between the United States and moderate states in the Gulf, where a U.S.-led military coalition drove Iraqi forces from Kuwait in the 1991 Gulf war. Washington has signed defence cooperation agreements with states in the area. </P>
<P> Kuwait and Qatar last year agreed to provide bases for stationing additional U.S. armour and attack jets in case of renewed trouble in the region, but Saudi Arabia has declined Washington's requests to store American armour. </P>
<P> The United States has voiced concern about the fundamentalist Moslem government in Iran, including recent statements that Tehran has installed anti-aircraft missiles and artillery on islands in the Strait of Hormuz near the mouth of the Gulf. </P>
<P> Although President Bill Clinton and the Defence Department have since said that the Iranian equipment is mainly defensive, Clinton stressed that the Pentagon was closely watching Iranian activities in the Gulf. </P>
