<DATELINE>ZAGREB, Croatia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Dozens of Yugoslav trucks carrying goods banned for export under a U.N. embargo have scrapped trips to a rebel Serb enclave of Croatia after being blocked by sanctions monitors, officials said Wednesday. </P>
<P> An official in the Brussels-based international mission enforcing the sanctions said the number of trucks lining up at the monitors checkpoint near the Yugoslav-Croatian border had dwindled from around 100 to 60 in a 24-hour period. </P>
<P> ``The queue may not entirely go away. We know that some vehicles turned back in the past have come back later with different number plates for another attempt to pass,'' a senior mission official told Reuters. </P>
<P> A huge traffic jam mushroomed on the Croatian side of the Lipovac highway border crossing after the inspectors began around-the-clock shifts 10 days ago. </P>
<P> The checkpoint is in Croatian Serb-held territory, just west of the formal Yugoslavia-Croatia border. </P>
<P> Some 100 trucks including at least 50 fuel tankers and rigs carrying cigarettes, liquor, washing powder and fruit backed up at the checkpoint, bolstered by Russian U.N. soldiers helping guard a Croatian-Serb cease-fire in the region. </P>
<P> About 200 foreign customs officers are stationed at borders in six Balkan states to deter trade in and out of Serbian-led Yugoslavia banned under a 1992 U.N. embargo imposed for Belgrade's role in ethnic war in Bosnia. </P>
<P> The sanctions committee set up a mission in Croatia only last December when the reopening of a motorway from Yugoslavia created a major new corridor for would-be sanctions-busters. </P>
<P> It crosses alternating patches of government- and Serb-held land in Croatia. Vehicles can take exits from the rebel region to enter Serb-held Bosnia. </P>
<P> Mission officials said it adopted a 24-hour vigil on Croatia's eastern frontier with Yugoslavia after a sudden flood of suspicious trucks on April 8-9. </P>
<P> ``Many of these trucks had papers showing they were going to (Serb-held territories) further west where they could cross the Sava river to (Serb-held north) Bosnia which is not permitted,'' said Ole Frederiksen, deputy mission head in Croatia. </P>
<P> ``Previously the monitors did not maintain a permanent presence so when they went home for the night these vehicles would go through,'' a U.N. spokesman said Tuesday. </P>
<P> Authorities in Belgrade refused to comment immediately. </P>
<P> U.N. officials said there had been no attempts by truckers to barge through the monitors' checkpoint, possibly because Belgrade, lobbying to have the U.N. embargo rescinded, did not want to dash its chances with brazen violations. </P>
