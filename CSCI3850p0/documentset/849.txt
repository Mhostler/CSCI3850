<P>  An airline pilot aborted landing his Boeing 737 to avoid crashing into another passenger jet at Kuala Lumpur's international airport earlier this week, aviation officials said Thursday. </P>
<P> The near-miss Tuesday was due to a damaged multimillion dollar radar system, the officials said. </P>
<P> Flights have been delayed since Sunday after fire damaged the $6.5 million system at the airport Saturday night. </P>
<P> Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik said Malaysia will buy a mobile radar to replace the damaged Thomson-CSF radar system bought in June 1993. </P>
<P> The fire, reportedly caused by a short circuit in the air conditioning system, was the third at the airport in the last two years and damaged vital components in the terminal approach radar. </P>
