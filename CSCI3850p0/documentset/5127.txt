<P>  Palestinian and Samaritan leaders Thursday offered $13,000 for the recovery of two centuries-old manuscripts stolen this week from the ancient Samaritan religious sect in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. </P>
<P> The scrolls, each valued at $3 million, are written in ancient Hebrew on deer and lambskin and were stolen from the prayer hall of the Samaritan sect. </P>
<P> Samaritan officials said the 500-strong sect Thursday asked PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat for help in recovering the manuscripts -- a 700-year-old religious scroll and a 500-year-old Torah scroll. </P>
<P> Arafat promised to do his best to help, they said. The West Bank is home to about a million Palestinians. The Torah is the Five Books of Moses of the Old Testament. </P>
<P> The Samaritans, living on Mount Gerizim which they regard as holy, above the Palestinian city of Nablus, trace their history back more than 3,600 years. They observe some Jewish rituals but do not regard themselves as Jews. </P>
<P> Palestinian Moslem and Christian leaders gathered at the Nablus municipality to join the Samaritans in offering the $13,000 reward. </P>
<P> ``These (manuscripts) are very valuable and are a basic part of the religious and spiritual heritage which the community had kept,'' community spokesman Samir al-Sameri told reporters. </P>
