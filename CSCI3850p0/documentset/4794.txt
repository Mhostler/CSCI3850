<P>  Four states that have filed lawsuits against tobacco companies seeking reimbursement for cigarette-related Medicaid costs plan a unified legal battle against the industry, state officials said Wednesday. </P>
<P> Florida, Mississippi, Minnesota and West Virginia have formed the National Coalition of States for Tobacco Liability, officials announced in the Florida capitol. </P>
<P> The states will share depositions and legal resources in their efforts to force tobacco companies to reimburse taxpayer funds used to pay smoking-related medical costs for welfare recipients, officials said. </P>
<P> Mississippi Attorney General Mike Moore said the sharing of resources by the states will give them a better chance of winning legal battles against the well-funded tobacco industry. </P>
<P> ``When we argued our first motion, we had three lawyers that showed up and they (tobacco industry) had 58 lawyers that showed up,'' said Moore. </P>
<P> On Feb. 21, Florida became the fourth state to sue in an effort to recover Medicaid costs, filing a $1.4 billion lawsuit in state court in West Palm Beach. </P>
<P> The Florida law under which the suit was filed allows the state to seek triple damages, which could boost the final outcome to nearly $4.5 billion if the suit is successful. </P>
<P> Philip Morris Cos. Inc. and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. asked the Florida Supreme Court to prohibit the suit, claiming the law under which it was filed is unconstitutional. </P>
