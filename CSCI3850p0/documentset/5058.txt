<P>  Talks between Washington and Hanoi over the repatriation of 272 Vietnamese boat people from the Philippines have hit a snag, the U.S. embassy said on Tuesday. </P>
<P> The U.S. has offered to shoulder the costs so the boat people can be repatriated to Vietnam. </P>
<P> ``We're ready to go. The problem is we're currently in a very difficult process of negotiations with the Vietnamese government,'' U.S. embassy spokesman Jim Nealon told reporters. </P>
<P> The 272 Vietnamese have threatened to commit mass suicide if they are forcibly sent home. </P>
<P> The U.S. has refused to take them in after finding most of their documents fraudulent. </P>
<P> Manila said it is growing impatient at the inability of both sides to work out arrangements for the repatriation of the refugees. </P>
<P> ``There was a specific commitment by the U.S. government to repatriate them. They've failed to do that from our perspective,'' Philippines Foreign Secretary Roberto Romulo said. </P>
