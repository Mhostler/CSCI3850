<P>  Former President Jimmy Carter said Monday Bosnian Serb leaders have agreed to an immediate four-month cease-fire in their war with Muslims and were willing to discuss an international peace plan. </P>
<P> Carter, mediating privately to end the 32-month conflict, said after talks with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic that he would put the cease-fire proposal to the Muslim-led Bosnian government. </P>
<P> Karadzic's agreement to negotiate the international peace plan he rejected earlier this year will come as a relief to its authors, a five-nation ``contact group'' -- the United States, Russia, Britain, France and Germany -- who feared the Serbs would use the Carter initiative to bypass it. </P>
<P> ``President Carter came here to bring us back to the table and he did; we have accepted something that we never thought we would accept,'' Karadzic said after several hours of talks with the 70-year-old ex-president at his headquarters at Pale near Sarajevo. </P>
<P> Although fighting continued in northwest Bosnia Monday, Carter said the Serbs were ready, if the Muslims agreed, to stop the war and allow U.N. peacekeeping troops to be deployed between the two sides. </P>
<P> They also agreed to allow free movement of U.N. convoys, which have been hindered and harassed by the Serbs for months, and open Sarajevo airport for both U.N. military and aid flights. </P>
<P> Karadzic's agreement to a four-month, renewable cease-fire was seen as a concession after he earlier insisted any truce should be permanent, confirming the Serbs' battlefield gains which have left them controlling 70 percent of the country. </P>
<P> The Bosnian government has so far been prepared to sign only a three-month cease-fire, reserving the right to resume fighting to try to regain territory if talks fail. </P>
<P> Carter was expected to return to Sarajevo to resume contact with the Bosnian government either Monday evening or Tuesday morning. He may then travel to Belgrade to brief Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, a former Karadzic ally who disavowed him when he rejected the peace plan. </P>
<P> Carter, now an international mediator who helped settle disputes with North Korea and Haiti, caused controversy at the start of his meeting when he praised the Serbs for their commitment to peace and said they were misunderstood by the American people. </P>
<P> Bosnian Serbs, blamed as the aggressors in the war, have rarely heard such endorsement from international negotiators. </P>
<P> Carter was immediately disavowed by the White House where spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said Serbs were resposnsible for the war and that Americans were fully informed of both sides of the issue. </P>
<P> Bosnian vice president Ejup Ganic reacted angrily, saying Carter was ill-informed and adding his remarks appeared to contradict the former president's traditionally strong stance on human rights. </P>
<P> Bosnian Serbs made up a third of the prewar population in Bosnia while Muslims were 44 percent and Croats, 17 percent. </P>
<P> Most of the 200,000 dead in the fighting have been Muslim victims of the Bosnian Serb Army's huge military superiority and ruthless artillery sieges of towns including Sarajevo. </P>
<P> As Carter was meeting Karadzic, Bosnian Serb tanks were reported by U.N. officials to have shelled a U.N.-declared ``safe area'' in northwest Bosnia. </P>
<P> The Serbs launched at least four tank rounds and one 120 mm mortar bomb into Bihac town, in a Muslim enclave. Two of the tank rounds crashed into houses, but there were no immediate reports of casualties. </P>
<P> Earlier Monday the Bosnian government admitted for the first time that the second largest town in the Bihac pocket, Velika Kladusa, had been captured by rebel Serb and renegade Muslim forces. </P>
<P> Its loss was expected to make the defense of Bihac town by the Muslim-led government army's 5th Corps more difficult. </P>
<P> In the Hague, NATO military chiefs discussed ways of strengthening the U.N.'s battered mission in Bosnia and avoid a humiliating withdrawal of peacekeeping troops, but declined to give any details. </P>
<P> French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said countries with peacekeepers in Bosnia should take a tougher line against Serb interference with a U.N. airlift to Sarajevo. </P>
