<DATELINE>NEW YORK, (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  New York Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, under fire last week for imitating Judge Lance Ito in a Japanese accent on a radio show, was admitted to a hospital Tuesday ``for tests and observation relating to chest pains,'' his office said. </P>
<P> The announcment said the 57-year-old head of the Senate Banking Committee was in St. Francis Hospital, Roslyn, N.Y., and ``is not expected to undergo surgery at this time.'' </P>
<P> The senator was described as awake, alert and in good spirits. </P>
<P> A St. Francis spokeswoman said the hospital could not confirm whether the senator was a patient in the hospital. She said the hospital would release a statement later in the evening. </P>
<P> D'Amato and his girlfriend, former gossip columnist Claudia Cohen, appeared Monday night at a Republican fundraiser in New York for presidential hopeful Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.). </P>
<P> Last Wednesday, D'Amato feigned a heavy Japanese-English accent in an interview on the nationally syndicated radio show ''Imus in the Morning'' when discussing the O.J. Simpson murder trial in Los Angeles, over which Ito is presiding. </P>
<P> An abashed D'Amato later apologized in a speech from the Senate floor, saying he was sorry if he offended anyone. </P>
<P> And last Friday, D'Amato announced he and his wife Penelope had divorced following a 13-year separation. </P>
<P> He recently held a news conference to talk about his romance with Cohen, who is divorced from cosmetics mogul Ron Perelman from whom she received a reported $80 million settlement. </P>
<P> D'Amato, who was elected to the Senate in 1980, became chairman of the Banking Committee in January. </P>
