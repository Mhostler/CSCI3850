<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A strong tremor measuring 6.7 on the Richter scale struck the Philippine island of Mindoro early Tuesday, spawning a tidal wave that hit a coastal town, doctors and officials said. </P>
<P> At least one man died in Calapan town on the coast of Mindoro which was hit by the small tidal wave that swept about 50 yards inland, damaging traditional wood and palm thatch houses. </P>
<P> ``Many houses along the shore have been damaged,'' said Medel Vertusio at the town's Maria Estrella Clinic. </P>
<P> One man was killed in the town after being pinned under falling building blocks, and many had to be treated for lacerations. </P>
<P> Seismologist Linda Amin said the quake, originally reported as registering 4.0 on the Richter scale, struck at about 3:15 a.m. (2:15 p.m. EST) as people slept. </P>
<P> It was centered just north of Baco in Mindoro, about 80 miles south of Manila, and and only a few miles from Calapan. </P>
