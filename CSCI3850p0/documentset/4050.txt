<P>  A north Florida minister and his wife had their prayers for a family more than answered with the birth of quintuplets Monday. </P>
<P> ``We were hoping just to have one child,'' the Rev. Marc Baker said. ``We were told we couldn't have any children, so any child we did have was a blessing.'' </P>
<P> The tiny babies -- four boys and one girl -- were born by Cesarean section Monday morning at Sacred Heart Hospital, and were listed in critical condition. </P>
<P> A team of 30 doctors and nurses assisted in the births. </P>
<P> ``It was organized chaos,'' said Dr. James Maher, a perinatologist who specializes in the management of high-risk pregnancies. </P>
<P> The infants ranged in weight from 3 pounds and 2 ounces to 1 pound and 12 ounces, and are expected to be hospitalized for at least one or two months. The new mother, Mona Baker, 29, was in good condition. </P>
<P> Mrs. Baker had taken fertility drugs to get pregnant, and was hospitalized nearly two months ago. </P>
<P> The couple has known for some time that she would have five children, Rev. Baker said. </P>
