<P>  The British Parliament Tuesday rejected a tongue-in-cheek bill banning the use of French words. </P>
<P> Conservative member of parliament Anthony Steen introduced the bill in retaliation for a ban on the use of English words imposed by France's Parliament and Culture Minister Jacques Toubon. Steen insisted he was a big fan of France but the ban was discriminatory and offensive and ``a stone's throw away from a policy of ethnic cleansing.'' </P>
<P> It was also in bad taste for France to outlaw the language of allies who helped free them from the Nazis 50 years ago, added Steen. </P>
<P> He said before the vote that he would ensure enforcement of his measure by getting Britain's army of traffic wardens to impose on-the-spot fines of about $15.00 for every French word uttered. </P>
<P> ``Forget words like baguette or croissant at breakfast. They're out. You won't be able to visit a cafe or a brasserie. No aperitifs, no hors d'oeuvres. In fact, no restaurant,'' he said. </P>
<P> Opposing the motion, fellow Conservative Gyles Brandreth said France needed all the help it could get to preserve its language from the onslaught of English. </P>
<P> ``While it's still going to be easier for a Frenchman to ask for 'un sandwich' -- even if the Assemblee Nationale would prefer him to ask for deux morceaux de pain avec quelque chose au milieu -- I reckon that when it comes to the linguistic exchange rate mechanism ... you cannot buck the market,'' he said. </P>
<P> Steen's bill was rejected by more than 100 votes. </P>
