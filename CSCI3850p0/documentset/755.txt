<P>  A senior North Korean official said Saturday he expects no foreign policy changes under the North's new leader, son of the late president. </P>
<P> In a rare Western press interview, Deputy Foreign Minister Kang Sok-ju said the North remained committed to unifying the Korean penninsula and easing tension with the West over its nuclear program. </P>
<P> Kang, who earlier Saturday concluded an agreement with the United States on Pyongyang's disputed nuclear program, said Kim Jong-il oversaw all aspects of government policy for 20 years before the death last month of his father, President Kim Il-sung. </P>
<P> His remarks that Kim Jong-il was firmly in charge appeared designed to counter Western speculation of a power struggle or significant policy change in the secretive communist state. </P>
<P> ``Our policy has remained consistent,'' said Kang, who was wearing a discreet Kim Il-sung pin-badge in the lapel of his charcoal-grey suit. </P>
<P> Kang said the agreement showed North Korea's ``sincerity in resolving the nuclear issue.'' He said North Korea had not broken new ground but had followed the ideas and policies laid out by Kim Il-sung in the weeks before his death. </P>
<P> The negotiations in Geneva were seen in the West as a possible pointer on North Korea's future foreign policy under Kim Jong-il. </P>
<P> The two sides agreed that North Korea would freeze its graphite nuclear power program if it is given in return a light-water reactor system less capable of producing weapons-grade plutonium. </P>
<P> They also agreed to establish diplomatic representations in each other's capitals and to cut down trade barriers, although they fell short of agreeing on full diplomatic relations. </P>
<P> Asked about North Korea's chain of command and how he consulted with Pyongyang, Kang said all policy was discussed democratically by officials concerned before being sent to a ``higher destination'' for approval. </P>
<P> ``Our Dear Leader comrade Kim Jong-il has been overseeing the overall affairs of our country -- political, military, economic and foreign affairs -- for as long as 20 years, so I think from that perspective you can make your own judgment as to how we got the final approval,'' Kang told Reuters and the Washington Post. </P>
