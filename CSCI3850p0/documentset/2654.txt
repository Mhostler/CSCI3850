<P>  Rebel Muslim forces have advanced against the Bosnian government around the town of Velika Kladusa, in the north of Bosnia's Bihac pocket, and cut it off in a pincer movement, a U.N. military spokesman said Thursday. </P>
<P> ``Velika Kladusa is surrounded and there is very heavy fighting with all weapons systems being used, including tanks and multiple barrel rocket launchers,'' said Col. Tim Spicer. ``The 5th Corps (of the Bosnian army) is having to fight on three fronts, which is very bad news for them.'' </P>
