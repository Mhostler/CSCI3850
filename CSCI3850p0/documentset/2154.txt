<P>  Reuters, the international news and information organization, launched a charity campaign Friday to raise $1 million for children in Bosnia who have been traumatized by war. </P>
<P> Reuters is contributing $250,000 to finance four youth centers being set up in the towns of Tuzla and Mostar by the Swiss charity Terre des Hommes, company officials told a Geneva news conference. </P>
<P> The rest of the funds are being sought from banks and financial institutions participating in golf tournaments organized by Reuters next year in 11 countries. </P>
<P> ``In the past few years, our journalists, cameramen and photographers have witnessed the human cost of the conflict in ex-Yugoslavia, in particular the plight of innocent children caught in the crossfire,'' Jean-Claude Marchand, Managing Director of Reuters Continental Europe, told the news conference. </P>
<P> ``We do not want to be just passive onlookers. So we have decided to make a substantial contribution ourselves and invite our banking customers to join us in alleviating this suffering which is right on our doorstep.'' </P>
<P> The youth centers in Tuzla and in both east and west Mostar will offer psychological help and support to children traumatized by the loss of relatives and the scenes of violence they have witnessed. </P>
<P> Children will also be able to learn languages and computer skills as well as engage in artistic activities and sports. Terre des Hommes, which will run the centers, has been carrying out relief work in Bosnia since October 1992. </P>
