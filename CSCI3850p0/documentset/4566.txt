<DATELINE>LONDON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  American Gerald McClellan was in ``extremely critical'' condition Sunday after he was knocked out in the 10th round of a savage fight against Britain's Nigel Benn for the WBC super-middleweight title. </P>
<P> Amid new calls for a ban on boxing after the 10-round World Boxing Council bout, surgeons operated through the night to remove a blood clot from McClellan's brain. </P>
<P> A hospital official at the Royal London Hospital said he was heavily sedated and on a life-support machine in the hospital's trauma unit and was ``likely to remain in this condition for some time.'' </P>
<P> The hospital said it was too soon to say how much damage McClellan may have sustained. It said his family had been made aware of the seriousness of his condition and were expected to fly into London from the United States later Sunday. </P>
<P> A British safety official called for the sport to be banned, saying it was bad for boxers and a bad influence on children. </P>
<P> McClellan collapsed in the ring in the 10th round shortly after being counted out. He was given oxygen, his neck was put in a brace and he was removed by stretcher from the ring and taken to the hospital. </P>
<P> Benn was also taken to the hospital to have his jaw checked after three board doctors feared it may have been broken, but he was later released. </P>
<P> It had been a surprising performance by Benn, who was widely expected to succumb to McClellan's monster punches. </P>
<P> Defending his title for the seventh time, Benn looked down and out when he was knocked through the ropes in a brutal opening round. But he rode the punches and made a remarkable recovery in the second. </P>
<P> In the ninth round, McClellan sank to his feet, claiming a head butt, which seemed to be all the incentive the desperately tired Benn needed. </P>
<P> McClellan, who had never previously been beyond eight rounds, went down for a count of seven in the 10th and after another right immediately went down for a full count. </P>
<P> He then lay prone as Benn celebrated and was taken from the ring on a stretcher. </P>
<P> James Tye, Director General of the British Safety Council, told Britain's GMTV that the fight had been an especially vicious one. </P>
<P> ``I'm a little bit horrified because right from the beginning of the fight there wasn't much boxing about it. Really it was one bloke trying to injure the other bloke's brain,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``People don't understand this but what's really happening with boxing, the brain is like a blancmange,'' he said, comparing it to a rubbery pudding. </P>
<P> ``Every time this evening, and hundreds of times it occurred, the blow is struck, the brain cracks aganst the inside of the hard skull, and it has the effect of numbing the brain or causing permanent brain damage.'' </P>
<P> John Sutcliffe, the neurosurgeon who operated on McClellan, said bluntly after examining the boxer: ``His brain was quite swollen, how we would expect a brain to look after it's been punched for (10) rounds. Hopefully it will not prove too serious but it will end his fighting career and it will kill him if it's (the clot) not taken out.'' </P>
<P> Tye said he would ask the government to ban ``this so-called sport.'' </P>
<P> ``All kinds of changes have been made but really the answer is to ban it,'' he said. </P>
