<P>  A major in the U.S. Army whose lesbian lover turned her in can be discharged by the military, a federal appeals court here ruled Tuesday. </P>
<P> In a 3-0 ruling, the 10th circuit court of appeals refused a request by Joyce Walmer for an injunction to block her honorable discharge from the army. </P>
<P> Walmer has been stationed at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas and has been in the military 15 years. </P>
<P> The court said that in 1992 Walmer's lover informed the army about their relationship and later that year the army said it would proceed with an honorable discharge. </P>
<P> The court said in its ruling that it was upholding a 1984 ruling from the same court which allowed the military to proceed with discharging a homosexual. </P>
<P> Walmer's attorney Jeffery Baxter said he would ask all nine judges who sit on the federal appeals court here to reconsider the decision. </P>
<P> The National Defense Authorization Act of 1993 says a service member may be discharged for saying he or she is gay or engaging in homosexual acts. </P>
<P> A federal judge ruled Thursday against the policy, known as ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell,'' saying it was discriminatory and unconstitutional. </P>
<P> House Speaker Newt Gingrich said this week that Congress might try to reinstate the previous policy, which flatly barred all gay men and lesbians from the military, if last week's ruling was upheld on appeal. </P>
