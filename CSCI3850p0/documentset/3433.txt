<P>  A Christmas tree fire claimed the life of a 44-year-old mother and two of her children, Meza police said Monday. </P>
<P> The tragedy began shortly after 7 p.m. (9 p.m. EST) Sunday, when the woman called 911 and ``all she did was scream,'' a police spokeswoman said. </P>
<P> When police officers Jamie Castaneda, Paul Manson and Mario Mercado arrived at the apartment building, they saw flames coming from the windows. </P>
<P> ``They were able to pull the woman from the apartment, but she was on fire and they had to extinguish the flames. They couldn't go in. There was too much smoke, heat and flames,'' said the Meza Police Department spokeswoman. </P>
<P> ``The woman was dead,'' she added. </P>
<P> When fire fighters arrived, they quickly put out the blaze and found the two children, ages six years old and four years old. The two were taken to a local hospital, where both died. </P>
<P> ``It apparently started in the electrical outlet and the Christmas tree, which was partly blocking the apartment's door, also caught fire,'' the spokeswoman said. </P>
<P> The woman's husband and her third child, an infant, were not in the apartment at the time. Police are withholding the names of the dead pending notification of relatives. </P>
