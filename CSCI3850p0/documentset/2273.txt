<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Houston Astros first baseman Jeff Bagwell was named Thursday as the unanimous winner in balloting for the National League Most Valuable Player award. </P>
<P> Bagwell received all 28 first-place votes cast by a panel of the Baseball Writers Association of America and became the first Astro ever to win the MVP award. </P>
<P> ``I'm very grateful to receive the award,'' Bagwell said. ''I feel very honored, even if the season was cut short. I'm ecstatic and feel very fortunate. I played almost as well as I could have.'' </P>
<P> The 26-year-old Bagwell became just the third unanimous selection in the National League MVP voting, joining Orlando Cepeda in 1967 and Mike Schmidt in 1980. </P>
<P> Bagwell compiled 392 points and easily surpassed San Francisco Giants first baseman Matt Williams, who had 11 second-place votes and finished with 281 points. </P>
<P> Montreal outfielder Moises Alou was third with nine second-place votes and 183 points and Giants outfielder Barry Bonds, who won the last two MVP awards, was fourth with 144. </P>
<P> Bagwell made a run at the triple crown this season, finishing with a .368 batting average, 39 home runs and a major league-leading 116 runs batted in 110 games, along with 32 doubles, two triples and a league-leading 104 runs scored. </P>
<P> Bagwell finished second in batting behind San Diego's Tony Gwynn (.394), second in home runs behind Williams (43) and first in RBI, easily outdistancing Williams (96). </P>
<P> Bagwell also led the N.L. in slugging percentage (.750). </P>
<P> Bagwell, ironically, may have benefitted by the premature end to the season on Aug. 12 caused by a players-owners contract dispute. Bagwell suffered a broken hand just before the players went on strike and was scheduled to miss several weeks. </P>
<P> Bagwell and Williams were the only players named on all 28 ballots. </P>
<P> Williams, who hit .267, was putting in a serious bid to shatter Roger Maris's record of 61 home runs in a season before the season came to a premature close due to the strike. </P>
<P> Bonds (.312, 37 homers, 81 RBI, 29 stolen bases) won the award in 1990 and 1992 with the Pittsburgh Pirates and last year with the Giants. </P>
<P> Chicago pitcher Greg Maddux, who won his third consecutive Cy Young Award earlier this week, was fifth in the balloting, which awards 14 points for first-place votes, nine points for second-place votes and down to one point for a 10th-place vote. </P>
<P> The voters include two writers from each league city. </P>
<P> Chicago's Frank Thomas won the award in the American League on Wednesday. </P>
