<DATELINE>NEW DELHI (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Indian villagers in part of the northern desert state of Rajasthan are seeing what the past generations hadn't -- plenty of rain. </P>
<P> Monsoon clouds covering most of India swept across the Thar desert bringing rains that cooled searing temperatures. The old danced in the villages and the children looked up at the sky in absolute wonder. </P>
<P> It poured in Barmer, the district bordering Pakistan at the furthest end of the Indian section of the Thar desert, and there were floods in neighboring Jodhpur district, both long drought-stricken. </P>
<P> The local Rajasthan Patrika reported floods in places where earlier rains never more than soaked the parched earth. At many places the army had to be called to evacuate marooned people even as most of the populace watched the cloudburst in absolute wonder. </P>
<P> The whole of Rajasthan state, which is largely drought-prone and where women often have to walk over 12 miles for drinking water, is having the best monsoon in years. </P>
<P> River beds are no longer dry and natural small reservoirs for drinking water are overflowing in most places. Farmers waiting to sow their crops are talking of a good harvest. </P>
<P> The great irony of Rajasthan is that the tourist city of Udaipur, which is built around several lakes in the fertile section of the state, has had little or no rain this year. </P>
<P> In the past month since the monsoon broke -- ending ferociously hot, dry weather in which several hundred people died from heatstroke across northern states -- floods have claimed more than 600 victims across the country. </P>
<P> Swirling rivers have flooded cities and on the weekend heavy rains lashed the Indian capital New Delhi, killing six and bringing down houses in the old part of the city. </P>
<P> Flooded roads disrupted traffic and the city ground to a halt as the meterological department recorded 4.4 inches of rains in 24 hours. </P>
