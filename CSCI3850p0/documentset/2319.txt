<P> Republicans last held a House majority in 1954. </P>
<P> The highest profile House race is in Washington state where Democratic Speaker Thomas Foley is fighting for his political life against lawyer George Nethercutt. The last time a House speaker was ousted in an election was in 1860. </P>
<P> THE SENATE: Thirty-five of the 100 seats in Senate are at stake. The Democrats now hold a 56-to-44 margin over Republicans, who have controlled the Senate for only six of the last 40 years, from 1981 through 1987. </P>

<P> GOVERNORS: Thirty-six of the 50 governorships are at stake. Democrats now hold 29 of them, the Republicans 20. One is held by an independent, Connecticut's Lowell Weicker. </P>
