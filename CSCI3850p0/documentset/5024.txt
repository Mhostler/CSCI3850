<P>  China's Communist Party is to intensify its struggle against rising rural crime by sending inspection teams to six provinces to see how local officials are coping, the People's Daily said on Monday. </P>
<P> Warlords, bandits and feuding clans are running rampant in the countryside, now riddled with widespread murder, rape, explosions, prostitution and kidnapping of women and children, according to local media. </P>
<P> The Communist Party's Central Committee for Comprehensive Management of Social Security has formed six inspection teams to look into efforts by officials in the selected provinces to fight soaring crime, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> The inspection teams are to visit the central provinces of Anhui and Hubei; Shaanxi and Hebei in the north; Jilin in the northeast, and Yunnan in the southwest in late March, it said. </P>
<P> Whether local officials are rewarded or punished hinges on their success or failure to curb crime, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> Local strongmen take advantage of the erosion of authority of local officials to become regional warlords, monopolising resources to such an extent that they become mafia-like underworld gangs, the media have reported. </P>
<P> Crime, virtually eliminated in the years after the communists swept to power in 1949, has flourished under 16 years of economic reform, which has unleashed a frenzy of greed. </P>
<P> China's leaders, President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng, have repeatedly called for efforts to intensify the war against crime. </P>
<P> Chinese courts jailed 547,435 people for all crimes in 1994, with 208,267 receiving sentences ranging from five years to the death sentence, according to official statistics. </P>
<P> They were involved in 480,914 criminal cases, up nearly 20 percent from 1993. </P>
