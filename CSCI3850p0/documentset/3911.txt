<P>  Germany's Catholic bishops, marking the 50th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp, said Tuesday they still carried the burden of their church's failure to help the Jews or protest against the Nazis. </P>
<P> The German Bishops' Conference said in a statement for this Friday's anniversary that the church looked away as the Nazis unleashed a pogrom in 1938 and sent Jews to gas chambers. </P>
<P> Although inmates of many nationalities died in Auschwitz, most of the victims were Jews and the camp was therefore a symbol for the Holocaust against them. </P>
<P> ``It saddens us deeply today that there were only individual bids to help oppressed Jews,'' the bishops said. ``There was no clear public protest, even at the pogrom of November 1938.'' </P>
<P> Nazis burned down synagogues, ransacked Jewish shops and publicly humiliated Jews during the ``Crystal Night'' on Nov. 9, 1938, the start of their drive to exterminate the Jews. </P>
<P> Apart from a few fearless preachers, German Catholics mostly supported or did not oppose the Nazis. There were more dissidents among the Protestants, but there too most did not stand up against the Third Reich. </P>
