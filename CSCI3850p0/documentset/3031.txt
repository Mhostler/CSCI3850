<P>  A federal judge Tuesday ordered the state of Illinois to provide Medicaid funding for abortions in cases of rape and incest. </P>
<P> The ruling, a permanent injunction from Judge Charles Kocoras of the U.S. District Court, came in a suit filed by Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood was challenging a decision by a state administative panel that put a halt to such funding. </P>
<P> The decision ``vindicates our very simple position: If the state of Illinois takes federal funding for the Medicaid system, it has to comply with federal law and provide abortion funding for rape and incest victims,'' said Colleen Connell, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union. </P>
<P> Illinois had been paying for such abortions since July but stopped after a committee on administrative rules voted Nov. 15 to halt the funding. </P>
<P> Planned Parenthood sued to require the state to obey the Hyde Amendment which says states must provide Medicaid funding for abortions in cases of rape and incest. </P>
