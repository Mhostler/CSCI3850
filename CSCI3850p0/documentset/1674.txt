<P>  Indonesia banned the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie ``True Lies'' Thursday as Muslim scholars said the film has caused unrest in the mainly Muslim country. </P>
<P> Alex Leo Zulkarnain, director general for Radio, Television and Film, told a news conference the ban would start Saturday, October 1. </P>
<P> He said the decision was made by the Indonesian Censorship Board after ``due consideration to the people's aspirations.'' </P>
<P> Indonesia's influential council of Muslim Ulemas, or scholars, had urged the government to ban ``True Lies,'' which depicts Schwarzenegger battling an Arab extremist group named Crimson Jihad. A jihad is a Muslim holy war. </P>
<P> The growing controversy over ``True Lies'' has given the film huge publicity, resulting in long ticket lines at movie theaters. </P>
<P> Earlier Thursday, a Muslim leader said he wanted to sue the chief of the censorship board, Soekanto, for showing board members a version of the film that cut out scenes of what he described as ``erotic'' dancing. </P>
<P> Ahmad Sumargono, vice chairman of the Indonesian Committee for the Solidarity of World Islam, told Reuters the board was shown a different version of the film than the one currently playing to packed audiences. </P>
