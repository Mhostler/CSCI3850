<P> The tanker occupation was the latest in a spate of incidents involving Cubans trying to leave the communist-ruled Caribbean island by sea. </P>
<P> The group began trickling off the vessel during Monday. By late afternoon, they were leaving in large numbers, according to eyewitnesses. </P>
<P> State television said that the incident had been resolved thanks to a series of factors. </P>
<P> These included the firm conviction that the boat would not be allowed to leave, the ``firm and calm attitude of the authorities'', the efficient work of tugboat workers who held the vessel against the dock and the cooperation of neighbors and relatives of those who boarded the boat. </P>
<P> President Fidel Castro visited Mariel late Sunday to get first-hand details of the incident. </P>
