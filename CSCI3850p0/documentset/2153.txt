<DATELINE>LONDON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Two IRA guerrillas were each jailed for 25 years Friday for plotting a bombing campaign in London last year. </P>
<P> Gerard Mackin, 33, and Derek Doherty, 23, were found guilty on Thursday after the jury deliberated for two days. But it was unable to reach a verdict on a third defendant, Thomas McAuley, 37, and Judge John Alliott ordered a retrial. </P>
<P> Friday's sentencing was the first since the Irish Republican Army announced a cease-fire on Sept. 1 in its 25-year-old campaign to end British rule in Northern Ireland. </P>
<P> The IRA's Protestant foes followed suit earlier this month with a similar truce. </P>
<P> Prime Minister John Major, who flew to Belfast Friday, was expected to give the go-ahead for British government talks with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing. </P>
<P> Prosecutor Nigel Sweeney told the court that 12 bombs were planted in north London last fall, causing widespread damage but no serious injuries. </P>
<P> In sentencing the IRA pair to 25 years in jail each, the judge said: ``It was no thanks to you that members of the public were not killed or maimed.'' </P>
<P> Police said that after the trio were arrested they found 10 detonators, 11 pounds of the explosive Semtex and 16 incendiary devices behind a bath panel in McAuley's flat. </P>
<P> McAuley told the court he did not know the bomb-making equipment was in the apartment. </P>
