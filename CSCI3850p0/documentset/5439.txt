<P>  Local Communist Party powerbrokers are abusing their authority to influence China's tentative flirtation with democracy by imposing their choices within what are effectively their fiefdoms, the People's Daily said Tuesday. </P>
<P> The commentary on what the newspaper called illegal and unconstitutional action by party secretaries appeared to mark further erosion of the authority of central government in Beijing in controlling ever more powerful and wealthy regional officials. </P>
<P> ``Even the candidates for the National People's Congress, or parliament...are selected or appointed by the party secretary,'' the official party mouthpiece said. </P>
<P> ``All such actions should be stopped because this seriously violates the principle of democratic centralism...and also violates the constitution and the Communist Party charter,'' it said. </P>
<P> China is nominally a socialist democracy but in reality authority, especially in rural areas, rests with local Communist Party bosses, many of whom rule their hamlets as lucrative petty fiefdoms. </P>
<P> China has gradually introduced electoral processes in some areas of its administration, including a collegiate system for selecting members of the National People's Congress and an experiment with direct elections for village leaders. </P>
<P> The People's Daily reminded wayward party secretaries that the proper democratic process began with the choice of candidates after hearing the opinions of the local populace and that the proposals were then screened by personnel departments and discussed by the party committee. </P>
<P> The party secretary should only be involved when a final recommendation reached his desk, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> However, party secretaries -- the most powerful local officials in China -- were abusing their authority to circumvent the selection process by deciding on candidates in advance with the aim of establishing their own powerbases. </P>
<P> ``It has become the objective of party secretaries to form their own cabinet,'' the newspaper said, referring to a system reminiscent of the regional warlordism that has plagued China for centuries. </P>
<P> ``This is totally wrong and against the law,'' it said. </P>
<P> Many party secretaries have been reluctant to implement Beijing's experiments with democracy in recent years, fearing an inevitable erosion of their almost absolute power. </P>
<P> Beijing's slow and careful introduction of limited elections is intended to complement its far-reaching, market-oriented economic reforms that have swept away decades of Stalinist-style central planning. </P>
