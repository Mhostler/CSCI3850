<DATELINE>FRANKFURT (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Former President Jimmy Carter left Frankfurt Sunday to begin an ambitious private peace mission for Bosnia at the invitation of the Bosnian Serbs. </P>
<P> Reporters saw Carter take off just after 10 a.m. (4 a.m. EST) on board a Air Force plane bound for Zagreb, where officials said it was expected to land about two hours later. </P>
<P> In Croatia, Carter is scheduled to meet with Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman. </P>
<P> He is expected to then go to Sarajevo and Belgrade for talks with Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic and Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. He is also likely to meet Yasushi Akashi, the United Nations' special representative for the former Yugoslavia. </P>
<P> Carter had arrived earlier in Frankfurt on a commercial plane from Atlanta and was whisked to the neighboring U.S. Rhein-Main air base for his connecting military flight. </P>
<P> Asked by reporters whether there could be peace by Christmas in Bosnia, Carter said. ``I hope so. I don't know.'' </P>
<P> He did not comment further before boarding a T-43A plane, the military version of a Boeing 737, and taking off. </P>
<P> At the airbase, Carter met former the U.S. special envoy to ex-Yugoslavia and now ambassador to Germany, Charles Redman, and his successor as special envoy, Charles Thomas. </P>
<P> Thomas accompanied Carter on the flight to Zagreb with the former president's wife, Rosalynn, and two aides from the Atlanta-based Carter Center, the base for his private peacemaking initiatives. </P>
<P> Redman declined to comment on the hour of talks with Carter and Thomas. ``This is the (former) president's trip. It would be inappropriate to comment,'' a U.S. official quoted Redman as saying. </P>
<P> Carter, who earlier this year brokered agreements in Haiti and North Korea, was invited into the Bosnian conflict by Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic. </P>
<P> The U.S. government has wished him well but emphasized his mission is purely a private endeavour and he will not be speaking on behalf of Washington. </P>
<P> Western diplomats are concerned Carter's trip could provide fodder for a Bosnian Serb publicity offensive. </P>
