<P>  Canada said Monday it was disappointed by the failure of the European Union to approve an agreement to end their bitter dispute over North Atlantic fishing stocks. </P>
<P> ``We're deeply disappointed that the agreement has not been approved,'' Fisheries Ministry spokeswoman Bonnie Mewdell told Reuters. ``From Canada's point of view the negotiations had concluded.'' </P>
<P> An EU foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg called Monday for greater efforts to end the conflict, which has primarily pitted Canada against Spain in a tussle over overfishing of turbot, or Greenland halibut, in international waters off Newfoundland. </P>
<P> Mewdell sought to keep the ball in the EU's court, noting it was Spain that was the main obstacle to an agreement in the Luxembourg meeting. ``It's up to the EU to get Spain on-side,'' she said. </P>
<P> The ministers urged European Commission officials to hold more talks to try to clinch a deal as quickly as possible, but it was not clear if Canada would agree to give more ground. </P>
<P> Canada's negotiators had returned home over the weekend. Ottawa's ambassador to the EU, Jacques Roy, was meeting with European officials Monday, but Mewdell stressed this was only to find out what happened and not to negotiate. </P>
<P> Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin, a Newfoundlander who has gained national popularity over his stand against what he says is Spanish overfishing, was due to make a statement in Ottawa after being briefed on the phone by Roy. </P>
<P> Canada, concerned turbot would go the way of northern cod and other now-depleted fish stocks, placed a moratorium on the harvesting of turbot even outside the normal 200-mile international limit. </P>
<P> In particular it has ruled out fishing in an area known as the Nose and Tail of the Grand Banks off Newfoundland, arguing that Spanish trawlers fishing in the area could deplete fish stocks on both sides of the 200-mile line. </P>
<P> Canada, which seized a Spanish trawler in the area last month but later released it, had not taken any action against Spanish vessels in the area in recent days while negotiations were underway. But it warned that its patience was limited. </P>
<P> Mewdell said 12 to 16 Spanish trawlers were in the area. </P>
