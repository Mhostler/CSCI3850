<P>  Russia hailed Tuesday a deal under which U.S. troops moved in to occupy Haiti unopposed after the Caribbean country's military rulers agreed to step down. </P>
<P> ``Russia welcomes the move, which lays the ground for a political solution of the Haitian crisis -- something which Moscow has always advocated,'' foreign ministry spokesman Grigory Karasin said. </P>
<P> The Kremlin might send observers at a later stage in the U.N.-sanctioned operation, he said. </P>
<P> Former President Jimmy Carter succeeded in a last-ditch attempt to persuade Haiti's military rulers to promise to leave without resistance when a huge U.S. military force was ready to step into action. </P>
<P> Under the deal, Haiti's military rulers are to step down by October 15 and the country's parliament is to approve a law granting amnesty for crimes committed during and after the 1991 coup against Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the country's elected president. </P>
<P> Nevertheless the United States was sending its troops to Haiti to police it and create conditions for restoring democracy. </P>
<P> Karasin said Russia was expecting Washington would present a detailed report in the United Nations after its troops had moved to Haiti. </P>
<P> ``Russia is not taking part in the first stage of the operation, that is taking under control the situation on the island,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``But depending on the U.S. report in the United Nations, it might consider sending several observers to take part in the further stages.'' </P>
