<DATELINE>LONDON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Princess Diana is considering legal action over newspaper allegations concerning a series of nuisance telephone calls to a married friend, The Times reported Tuesday. </P>
<P> Diana, estranged wife of heir to the throne Prince Charles, has denied making any nuisance calls to her millionaire friend, Oliver Hoare, and says dark forces are conspiring to destroy her. </P>
<P> ``The princess will consult Lord Mishcon, her lawyer, in the next few days over the reports in the News of the World and other Sunday papers,'' said The Times, which gave no source for its information. </P>
<P> Polarized views of 33-year-old Diana as victim or as desperate plotter intensified after reports that police traced anonymous calls made to Hoare back to her own telephones. </P>
<P> In an unprecedented move to defend herself, Diana summoned a friendly royal reporter to reject the allegations she blamed on unnamed enemies trying to make it look as if she was having an affair. </P>
<P> ``What have I done to deserve this? I feel I'm being destroyed,'' the Daily Mail's Richard Kay quoted her as saying in a report published Monday. </P>
<P> Diana, said to be distraught and close to tears, added: ``There is absolutely no truth in it. Somewhere, someone is going to make out I am mad.'' </P>
<P> British media quickly interpreted that she meant Charles and his courtiers, whom her friends have long accused of campaigning to sideline the princess in order to leave the public stage to Charles as he prepares his way to the throne. </P>
<P> The rival royal camps accuse each other of media manipulation to steal the limelight and win the public's hearts. Charles boosted his popularity with a frank television interview in June in which he admitted he had been unfaithful to Diana. </P>
<P> Newspaper reports say Hoare, a close friend of both Diana and Charles, complained to police last October about a stream of anonymous calls. Each time he answered, there was silence. </P>
<P> Hoare, an expert on Islamic art, was worried he might be the target of Middle East extremists, but investigators were said to have traced calls to Diana's private apartments at Kensington Palace in London, her mobile phone and a line at her sister's house. Some calls were from public phone boxes. </P>
<P> Diana is reported to have released details of her private diary to prove she was not at home when the calls were made. </P>
<P> Breaking with royal tradition, Diana is already suing the proprietor of a London gym for secretly taking shots of her exercising, and the Mirror Group newspapers that published them. </P>
<P> ``The princess is reportedly torn over whether or not to resort to the courts for a second time,'' said The Times. </P>
<P> It quoted Lord Mishcon as saying he had ``no instructions at the moment'' and declining further comment. </P>
<P> The Times said police chiefs had resisted demands from members of parliament, from both the ruling Conservative and opposition Labor parties, for an internal inquiry into how details of the police probe were obtained by newspapers. </P>
<P> Diana, embarrassed by phone calls once before when transcripts were published of her alleged conversation with a male admirer, retired from public life at the end of last year, saying she could not take the media pressure. </P>
<P> But interest in her has barely diminished. Photographers still hound her and speculation about her future -- especially whether she will sue for divorce -- rages on. </P>
