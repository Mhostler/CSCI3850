<P> He was commenting, in unusually strong terms, on a letter from Croatian U.N. envoy Mario Nobilo saying that U.N. Under-Secretary-General Chinmaya Gharekhan, a former Indian ambassador, had given the council ``unfounded and unsubstantiated reports'' about alleged human rights violations by Croatian forces who earlier this week captured the enclave of Western Slavonia from Croatian Serb rebels. </P>
<P> Nobilo had also demanded an apology from Gharekhan, whose briefing for council members was followed late Thursday by a council statement expressing concern at ``reports that the human rights of the Serb population of Western Slavonia are being violated.'' </P>
<P> ``The content of the letter of ambassador Nobilo concerning ambassador Gharekhan has been found inadmissible and unacceptable by the members of the council,'' Merimee said. </P>
<P> Council members also found it ``highly inappropriate that a country alludes in a letter to what has been discussed in informal consultations of the council.'' </P>
<P> ``The members continue to have full confidence in ambassador Gharekhan and the information he provides the council with,'' Merimee said. </P>
