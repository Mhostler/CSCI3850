<P>  The United States would consider contributing troops to an international force to monitor an Israeli-Syrian peace settlement, a senior State Department official said Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``We would be willing to consider a request by the two parties for U.S. participation in such a force,'' Assistant Secretary of State Robert Pelletreau for Near East Affairs told a House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee hearing. </P>
<P> He said such a peacekeeping force would be similar to the one in the Sinai to monitor the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty. </P>
<P> Pelletreau said Israel and Syria had not requested U.S. troops to act as monitors, but added, ``We have an expectation such a request might be part of an overall (peace) package.'' </P>
<P> Pelletreau said there was a good opportunity for a peace agreement between Israel and Syria. </P>
<P> ``The two leaders are fully engaged, through Secretary (of State Warren) Christopher's facilitation, in negotiating the issues of peace, withdrawal, security and the timing and interfacing of the various elements of these issues. </P>
<P> ``And while their positions are still quite far apart, they are not as far apart as when the secretary began his shuttle diplomacy last spring,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``It is fair to say we have an opportunity that should not be wasted right now,'' he added. </P>
<P> ``Each party is preparing its own public for peace with the other,'' Pelletreau said, citing a recent speech by Syrian President Hafez al-Assad calling for ``peace with honor''. </P>
<P> The foreign ministers of Israel and Syria are visiting Washington this week and Christopher will go to both countries in a trip beginning this weekend. </P>
<P> ``The president and Secretary Christopher are determined to do everything we can to help the peoples of this vital region to reach a just and lasting peace,'' Pelletreau said. </P>
<P> He said it was likely Israel and Syria would hold direct negotiations at some point. </P>
