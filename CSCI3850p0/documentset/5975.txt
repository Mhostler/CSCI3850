<P>  A report commissioned by a private relief agency based says countries involved in the Vietnam War have an obligation to help clear landmines and other unexploded devices across Vietnam. </P>
<P> Oxfam Hong Kong, in a report obtained by Reuters on Monday, said assistance from nations such as the United States and Australia could take the form of training Vietnamese to clear mines and other ordinances. </P>
<P> Vietnam no longer engages in systematic mine clearance, the report said. </P>
<P> ``There is a strong moral responsibility for the nations who conducted the war in Vietnam... to make aid available to help clear these deadly weapons,'' said the report, called ``Landmines and Underdevelopment.'' </P>
<P> Landmines and unexploded bombs and artillery shells left over from the war have killed and maimed thousands of Vietnamese since it ended in 1975. </P>
<P> The report said Vietnam's Peace and Solidarity Committee, which is aligned with the Foreign Ministry, wanted to hold an international conference in Vietnam to draw attention to the problem. </P>
<P> Author Jim Monan conducted research for the report in Quang Tri, a province near the 17th Parallel, a boundary line drawn by an international conference in 1954 that divided Vietnam into North and South. </P>
<P> The report, which gave no figure for the number of unexploded landmines and other ordnance scattered across the largely agricultural nation, said it would cost $17.5 million to clear landmines in the Quang Tri province alone. </P>
<P> It said 474 people have been killed by landmines and other unexploded devices in the province since 1985. </P>
<P> Many deaths occur because villagers across Vietnam, one of the world's poorest nations, see the weapons as sources of gunpowder and scrap metal. </P>
