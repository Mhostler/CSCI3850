<P>  Infant bed deaths have declined dramatically in Britain after a campaign advocating that babies sleep on their backs, according to figures out Thursday. </P>
<P> Bed deaths dropped from 1,469 in 1988 to 442 in 1993. </P>
<P> The worldwide Sudden Infant Death Syndrome remains a mystery but the fall in deaths in Britain follows a government campaign urging parents to babies on their backs to sleep. </P>
<P> The Back to Sleep Campaign, launched in October 1991 by the government's chief medical officer, gained the support of British television personality Anne Diamond whose third son was a bed death victim. </P>
<P> The campaign was launched after research showed babies sleeping on their stomachs were more likely to be victims of the syndrome. </P>
<P> Recent research by a British television program has linked chemicals in flame proof mattresses to bed deaths. A government committee has been set up to investigate this. </P>
