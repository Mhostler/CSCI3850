<P>  About 100 Iranian intellectuals in exile demanded Thursday a U.N. probe into the death of a dissident Iranian writer while in detention in Tehran. </P>
<P> In a statement received in Paris, the signatories -- writers, journalists, scientists and teachers -- said the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and an independent team of world writers should investigate the death and report to the U.N. Commission for Human Rights within three months. </P>
<P> Writer Ali Akbar Saidi Sirjani reportedly died Sunday of a heart attack in a Tehran hospital. Iran's official news agency IRNA has said Saidi Sirjani was buried Tuesday in Behesht-e Zahra cemetery south of Tehran in the presence of relatives and friends. </P>
<P> Some opposition groups have accused the government of torturing Saidi Sirjani and questioned the authenticity of statements Tehran newspapers printed in which he was reported to have confessed to hostility toward the Islamic government and voiced repentance. </P>
<P> The Iranian intellectuals said that if Tehran did not allow the probe, intellectuals should pressure their governments to close down Iran's cultural offices and IRNA bureaus. </P>
<P> Several international human rights groups have already called for an indepednent investigation. </P>
