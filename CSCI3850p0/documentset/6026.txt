<P>  The world disposes of thousands of tons of nuclear waste every year but tough regulations should ensure that accidents or radioactive leaks are nightmares that will never happen, nuclear officials said Tuesday. </P>
<P> The arrival in Japan of a controversial British freighter carrying 14 tons of radioactive waste and Germany's attempt to store spent nuclear fuel near Hamburg have provoked mass protests in those countries and abroad. </P>
<P> ``Ten years ago it was Cruise missiles but now people find nuclear waste is a good subject to protest about,'' a diplomatic source in Vienna said. </P>
<P> The Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, said 53 countries have signed the 1987 Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Materials which is one document outlining the safest ways to handle nuclear materials. </P>
<P> Around 430 nuclear reactors are operating worldwide mostly in North America, Europe and the Far East. A section of those reactor cores, containing highly radioactive uranium fuel rods, has to be changed on average every three years. </P>
<P> What can be done with lethal materials such as iodine that can remain radioactive for generations or caesium and uranium which can be ``live'' for hundreds of thousands of years? </P>
<P> IAEA spokesman Hans Meyer said countries had a choice -- to reprocess their spent nuclear fuel or bury the fuel rods intact, preferably deep underground. </P>
<P> Geological experts have to check whether storage sites such as old salt mines have walls that are adequately thick or that pits are not near earthquake faults or volcanoes. </P>
<P> ``All these requirements have to adhere to strict international standards,'' Meyer said. </P>
<P> Britain, France and Japan are the only western countries that recycle nuclear fuel. The others opt for storing waste, which is potentially more dangerous, on purely economic grounds. </P>
<P> ``Reprocessing has become uneconomic. The market price for 2.2 pounds of uranium is around $20. It's cheaper to carry on buying the uranium,'' Meyer said. </P>
<P> But energy experts have said power demand will increase dramatically over the next 20-30 years and the price for uranium, the biggest producers of which are the United States, Australia, South Africa and Canada, is bound to rise. </P>
<P> Russia also conducts some reprocessing of nuclear waste but the IAEA has been unable to check the methods used or safety standards. </P>
<P> Other states of the ex-Soviet Union which have nuclear plants such as Ukraine and Lithuania have received help from the IAEA on radiation safety and monitoring but nuclear industry experts believe storage of spent fuel may not measure up to rigorous international standards. </P>
<P> The word 'Chernobyl' still haunts Europe nine years after a reactor there spewed a radioactive cloud over part of the continent. And it is the transport of nuclear waste by road, rail or sea and a potential accident which provokes real fear that a radioactive leak could wipe out whole communities. </P>
<P> ``There have been accidents but I know of none where there has been a radioactive leak,'' Meyer said. </P>
<P> Ships are specially adapted for nuclear waste transport as well as trains and trucks that are tested to ensure they can withstand the most powerful crash. </P>
