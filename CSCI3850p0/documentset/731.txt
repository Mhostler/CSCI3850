<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  South Korea does not oppose the normalization of relations between North Korea and the United States once Pyongyang drops its nuclears arms ambition, a senior foreign ministry official said Friday. </P>
<P> He was speaking after a North Korean diplomat said in Geneva Friday that a draft statement worked out by United States and North Korean experts dealt with the setting up of normal relations in return for North Korea freezing its nuclear program. </P>
<P> Assistant Foreign Minister Choi Dong-jin said Seoul was also committed to ``playing a key role'' in providing a light-water nuclear reactor to the North if it freezes its nuclear project. </P>
<P> ``We have no objection to the normalization of relations between Washington and Pyongyang. Our position is that such a step should follow full transparency in the North's nuclear program,'' Choi told Reuters. </P>
<P> The United States, in intensive talks in the past week in Geneva, tried to persuade North Korea to give up its suspected development of nuclear weapons. </P>
<P> Washington, which has accused North Korea of diverting nuclear weapons material from its power program to a weapons program, negotiated a deal under which the Stalinst North would switch from graphite reactors to light-water technology. </P>
<P> Light-water reactors are less susceptible to diversion of weapons-grade fissionable material, but they cost billions of dollars per unit. </P>
<P> Choi said North Korea had dropped its earlier insistence that a Russian light-water reactor be provided. The North did not express opposition to Washington's suggestion that the North take a South Korean-model light-water reactor. </P>
<P> ``North Korea left the issue (choice of reactor) to the United States,'' he said. </P>
<P> Choi said acceptance by North Korea of a South Korean-model reactor could lead to an exchange of visits by experts and other cooperation between North and South Korea. </P>
<P> ``We hope such an arrangement will ease tension on the Korean peninsula,'' he added. </P>
<P> The North Korean diplomat in Geneva told Reuters a joint U.S.-North Korean statement had been finalized and was only subject to approval by their respective capitals. </P>
<P> ``The expert-level meetings concluded the issue of making provision of a light-water reactor, establishing normal relations between the DPRK and U.S., and other issues, in return for freezing nuclear activities of the DPRK,'' he said. </P>
<P> But Choi said he understood the normalization could only be mentioned as an eventual objective. </P>
<P> ``The issue is related to the resolution of North Korea's nuclear question but there are many steps to be taken before full-fledged diplomatic ties could be actually set up,'' he said. </P>
<P> The U.S. intelligence service, the CIA, suspects that North Korea has extracted enough plutonium from its reactor in Yongbyon, about 60 miles from Pyongyang, to build at least one or two nuclear devices. Pyongyang says its nuclear program is peaceful. </P>
