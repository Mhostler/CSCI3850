<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A devout follower of the Sikh religion is suing the New York City Transit Authority for $1 million because he refused to replace his turban with a hardhat, New York Newsday reported Sunday. </P>
<P> The newspaper said Charan Kalsi, a 47-year-old father of three, filed a $1 million lawsuit in federal court against the Transit Authority (TA), which he said violated his U.S. Constitutional right to religious freedom. He also is demanding his job back. </P>
<P> Kalsi, a veteran of the Indian air force with an engineering degree, passed a civil service exam to become a $19-an-hour subway car inspector, New York Newsday reported. </P>
<P> As a probationary employee, Kalsi began his on-the-job training, but was sacked when he refused to wear the protective helmet required by the authority. </P>
<P> ``This is a hazardous job,'' TA Safety Director Carmen Bianco told the newspaper. ``The use of hardhats (protective helmets) is mandatory.'' </P>
<P> A TA spokesman told New York Newsday, ``The inspectors crawl under the cars. They work with all kinds of heavy components. If something came loose and hit him in the head, we'd all be in serious trouble.'' </P>
<P> Kalsi's lawyer, Richard Nager, told the newspaper, ``We're not saying there are no safety considerations here. We say the religious rights outweigh the safety considerations.'' </P>
<P> Sikhism blends elements of Hinduism and Islam that embraces the doctrines of human equality and the dignity of labor, according to the newspaper. </P>
<P> Freedom of religion is guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution, but exceptions have been granted, mainly to the military. For instance, the Army has argued successfully before the U.S. Supreme Court that for good order and operations to be maintained, soldiers should be forbidden to wear religious symbols or artifacts. </P>
