<P>  German anti-nuclear activists Monday delayed tens of thousands of railway commuters by pulling down overhead power lines to disrupt services on the eve of a nuclear waste shipment due to take place Monday night. </P>
<P> Police and campaigners also prepared for confrontations when a railway container of highly radioactive spent fuel rods set off Monday night from the Philippsburg reactor in southern Germany bound for a new storage depot at Gorleben near Hamburg. </P>
<P> Railway officials said up to 60,000 passengers were delayed by the sabotage of power lines, carried out near junctions to cause maximum disruption to the heavy Monday morning commuter flow between Frankfurt and industrial towns on the Rhine. </P>
<P> The activists used a favorite tactic in their long campaign against the depot, pulling power lines down with grappling hooks to cut six main lines and disrupt train services between Hanover and Bremen, Frankfurt and Mannheim and Frankfurt and Heidelberg. </P>
<P> They also damaged tracks near the town of Dannenberg, where the nuclear shipment will be unloaded, and police said they had detained six people, bringing the total held after weekend protests to 131. All were released after a short time. </P>
<P> The activists threatened to cause similar disruption on Monday night and Tuesday to prevent the fuel container getting to Gorleben, some 60 miles southeast of Hamburg. </P>
<P> Authorities said the train would leave Philippsburg at 8.10 p.m. (2:10 p.m. EDT) Monday and reach Dannenberg at 10 a.m. (4 a.m. EDT) Tuesday. From there the container would be taken by truck to reach Gorleben at 2 p.m. (8 a.m. EDT). </P>
<P> ``We are going to publish the timetable and time our actions to coincide with it,'' one campaign leader camping near Gorleben told German radio. </P>
<P> Environment Minister Angela Merkel appealed to the opponents of the shipment ``not to misuse it for violent protests and not to endanger people who are not involved.'' </P>
<P> Police are mounting one of their biggest postwar operations, costing tens of millions of marks (dollars), to ensure the shipment goes ahead safely. </P>
