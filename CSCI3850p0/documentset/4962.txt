<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The United States is keen to resume military training aid to Indonesia and sell weapons to Jakarta despite the situation in East Timor, a senior U.S. military official said Thursday. </P>
<P> Admiral William Owens, vice-chairman of the U.S. joint chiefs of staff, said he was satisfied that Jakarta was dealing properly with issues over Indonesia's military involvement in East Timor. </P>
<P> ``From our standpoint in the (U.S.) military it seems when an issue is raised affecting the military's involvement in East Timor that appropriate action has been taken to address those concerns,'' he told a news conference. </P>
<P> Owens said that in this context it was normal for the U.S. military to seek to re-establish the International Military Education and Training (IMET) fund with Indonesia and seek arms sales. </P>
<P> The U.S. Congress cut off IMET to Indonesia in 1992 to protest the November 1991 massacre of up to 180 civilians during a funeral march in the East Timor capital Dili. The IMET issue is to be discussed by Congress at a date not yet disclosed. </P>
<P> ``It seems completely appropriate that we attempt to establish a normal relationship with the Indonesian military and the Indonesian government,'' said Owens, who is on a five-day visit. </P>
<P> Owens, who earlier held talks with Vice President Try Sutrisno, gave no details of what military equipment could be sold to Indonesia. </P>
<P> Washington's relations with Indonesia have been hurt at times over allegations of human rights abuses in the former Portuguese colony of East Timor. </P>
<P> The Senate voted last July to restrict small arms sales to Indonesia, which invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed the tiny territory one year later. </P>
<P> The United Nations has never recognized the annexation. </P>
