<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Rep. Newt Gingrich said Saturday that the House Ethics Committee had asked him to respond to a ''bizarre'' complaint brought by a political opponent. </P>
<P> The Georgia congressman, a Republican in line to be House speaker next year, suggested he was being investigated because of his role in forcing the resignation of former House Speaker Jim Wright on charges of financial impropriety. </P>
<P> The complaint by Ben Jones, who lost to Gingrich in last Tuesday's election, questioned Gingrich's use of a Republican political group to develop and finance a course he taught last year at Kennesaw State College in Marietta, Ga. </P>
<P> The Washington Post said the ethics committee, in an eight-page letter to Gingrich, suggested the involvement of GOPAC, Gingrich's political organization, might have compromised the non-partisan nature of the endeavor. </P>
<P> ``A number of documents... raise questions as to whether the course was in fact exclusively educational in nature, or instead constituted partisan political activity intended to benefit Republican candidates,'' the newspaper quoted the letter as saying. </P>
<P> ``This is the most bizarre thing,'' Gingrich said on Cable News Network's Evans and Novak program. </P>
<P> He said GOPAC had done nothing beyond providing initial ideas on who might be interested in helping to finance the course and ``how we might go about it.'' </P>
<P> Gingrich said there was ``nothing at all illegal or inappropriate'' about any political organization helping non-profit foundations. </P>
<P> Calling the complaint ``a nonsense issue,'' Gingrich said: ''Ever since I filed charges against Jim Wright and had him resign as speaker there's been a sincere desire to make sure that I'm investigated as thoroughly as possible.'' </P>
<P> Wright was forced to resign in 1989. </P>
<P> According to the Post, donors who contributed funds for the course could take tax deductions because the contributions went to an educational foundation, which is forbidden from engaging in partisan, political activity. </P>
<P> The newspaper said the Ethics Committee listed documents that were said to have raised questions about whether the true goal of Gingrich's course was ``to promote Republican party activism and a Republican agenda.'' </P>
