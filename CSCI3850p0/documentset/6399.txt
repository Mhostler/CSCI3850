<P>  Pretoria's armed forces chief, Gen. Georg Meiring, said Tuesday he expected South Africa would have to take a more active role in U.N. peacekeeping operations in the future. </P>
<P> He said the United Nations had been keen to have South Africa in the peacekeeping team going to Angola, but the Angolan government had rejected personnel from ``surrounding'' countries that had been involved there in the past. </P>
<P> South Africa played a key role in supporting the rebel UNITA movement in fighting in Angola in the 1970s and 1980s. </P>
<P> ``At the moment we are playing a wait-and-see game. But I foresee in the future that we will have to be employed more in this role than we have been up to now,'' he told Reuters. </P>
<P> Meiring said that under South Africa's interim constitution, the armed forces into which former anti-apartheid black guerrillas were being integrated was mandated to back the government's diplomatic initiatives where needed. </P>
<P> President Nelson Mandela's government has so far resisted international pressure for direct peacekeeping involvement, saying South Africa had enough problems at home without taking part in foreign operations. </P>
<P> Meiring said the integration of former guerrillas, members of the former nominally-independent black homelands and the old armed forces into the year-old South African National Defense Force (SANDF) was going smoothly after initial problems. </P>
<P> ``I think it started out with a little bit of a hiccup here and there, but eventually it ended up very well, and it's going very well at the moment,'' he said. </P>
<P> More than 11,000 former guerrillas and about 3,000 former homeland soldiers had been integrated during the past year, and around 1,600 people were being processed monthly. </P>
<P> The integration process would raise the armed forces' military and civilian numbers to between 120,000 and 130,000 but rationalization and demobilization would cut this back to the old figure of 91,000, Meiring said. </P>
<P> Asked about military involvement in police activities, Meiring said no defense force liked being involved in civilian policing, but the SANDF would do so under government direction. </P>
<P> The government last weekend ordered military and police reinforcements into the volatile KwaZulu-Natal region and the Gauteng province around Johannesburg to combat violence and crime. </P>
<P> ``In this regard, we are planning together with the South African Police Service to see where we can contribute most toward the maintenance of law and order. </P>
<P> ``We are not policemen, we are not the 'bobby' on the beat. We are soldiers used in trying to help...in the maintenance of law and order,'' he said. </P>
<P> The SANDF preferred a role in such areas as border patrols and using its assets such as ships and planes to combat gun and drug smuggling, Meiring said. </P>
