<DATELINE>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The New Jersey Devils spotted the New York Islanders three goals, then stormed back for a 6-3 victory to win for the seventh time in nine games Friday. </P>
<P> Chris Terreri stopped all 13 shots he saw in relief of an ineffective Martin Brodeur and Stephane Richer and Bill Guerin scored two goals apiece to rally the Devils, who remained just three points back of first-place Philadelphia in the Atlantic Division. </P>
<P> Terreri replaced Brodeur with six minutes left in the first period after the starter allowed three goals on five shots, including a pair by Steve Thomas. </P>
<P> But Shawn Chambers and Neal Broten scored a minute apart midway through the third period to give the Devils a 4-3 lead. </P>
<P> ``We've got to feel good about ourselves and the important thing is that we carry this into the playoffs,'' Guerin said after his team scored six unanswered goals. </P>
<P> At Washington, rookie sensation Jim Carey recorded his fourth shutout and Peter Bondra and Mark Tinordi each had a powerplay goal and an assist to lead the Capitals to a 3-0 victory over the Florida Panthers. </P>
<P> Carey, who faced his most difficult work early in the game, turned aside all 16 shots he faced. </P>
<P> Carey stopped Jody Hull on a breakaway and withstood a two-man advantage for 70 seconds in the opening minutes of the game as the Caps ended a three-game losing streak. </P>
<P> Carey raised his record to 14-5-1 in his 20th straight start for the Capitals, who are tied for fifth place in the Eastern Confernce. </P>
<P> In Chicago, Steve Yzerman scored a pair of goals and Ray Sheppard had a goal and an assist as the Detroit Red Wings extended their unbeaten streak to 11 games with a 3-1 victory over the Blackhawks in a battle of teams heading in opposite directions. </P>
<P> Yzerman scored on the power play with 8:12 left in the first period on a one-time slap shot and made it 2-0 with 5:11 left in the second period. </P>
<P> Chris Osgood made 30 saves for the Red Wings, who are 16-1-2 since March 6 and lead the NHL with 61 points. His shutout bid was broken up when Tony Amonte scored shorthanded with 8:57 left in the game for the Blackhawks, who have lost six games in a row. </P>
<P> In Hartford, Darren Turcotte scored with 2:56 left in overtime as the Whalers rallied for a 4-3 victory over the Montreal Canadiens. </P>
<P> Frantisek Kucera took a slap shot from the left circle and Turcotte, who was storming the net from the right wing, backhanded the puck past Patrick Roy for the game-winner. </P>
<P> Steven Rice's second goal of the game tied it with 22 seconds left in regulation to force overtime. </P>
<P> The Whalers moved ahead of the Buffalo Sabres for seventh place in the Eastern Conference playoff race, while Montreal fell three points behind Buffalo. </P>
<P> ``That was probably the biggest victory we had this year,'' Turcotte said. ``It just moves us one step closer to the playoffs.''  In Philadelphia, John LeClair scored at 11:49 of the third period to lift the Flyers to their fifth straight victory, a 3-2 triumph over the Tampa Bay Lightning. </P>
<P> LeClair, who was in front on the net, took a pass from Eric Lindros and shoveled the puck between the pads of Tampa Bay goalie J.C. Bergeron. </P>
<P> The Lightning had tied the game at 2-2 less than a minute earlier when Bob Halkidis fed Brian Bradley in the crease and he beat Dominic Roussel for his 10th goal of the season. </P>
<P> Rod Brind'Amour scored Philadelphia's first goal on a powerplay to notch his 400th career NHL point. </P>
<P> In New York, Brian Leetch and Pat Verbeek scored two goals apiece and Mark Messier had four assists as the Rangers built a 4-1 lead then held on for a 5-3 win over the Boston Bruins. </P>
<P> The Rangers closed within one point of Buffalo in the race for the final Eastern Conference playoff slot. </P>
<P> The Rangers scored three times in the first 12:52 on goals by Petr Nedved, Brian Leetch and Pat Verbeek to knock Boston rookie goaltender Blaine Lacher out of the game. </P>
<P> Bryan Smolinski and Ted Donato scored in the first three minutes of the third period to make it 4-3, but Leetch sealed the victory for the Rangers with his second goal of the game. </P>
<P> In Quebec, Valeri Kamensky scored a pair of goals and Stephane Fiset stopped 27 shots to lead the Nordiques to a 5-2 victory over the Buffalo Sabres. </P>
<P> Joe Sakic had a pair of assists in his 500th game for Quebec, which moved six points ahead of the Pittsburgh Penguins for the top spot in the Eastern Conference. </P>
<P> Pat LaFontaine and Donald Audette scored for Buffalo, which fell into eighth place in the conference and is 0-4-1 in its last five games. </P>
<P> Quebec stretched its home unbeaten streak to 11 games with 10 wins and a tie. </P>
<P> In Toronto, Randy Wood snapped a 1-1 tie with 11:23 remaining and Damian Rhodes stopped 22 shots as the Maple Leafs beat the Dallas Stars 2-1. </P>
<P> Mike Craig also scored for the Maple Leafs, who are 3-0-1 against the Stars this season. </P>
<P> Rhodes shut down the Stars after Peter Zezel's goal midway through the first period. He needed to make only six saves in the third period. </P>
