<DATELINE>BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev scored a victory Sunday in his efforts to lead the mountainous former Soviet republic to market democracy. </P>
<P> The central electoral commission said provisional results of a weekend referendum showed more than 70 percent of participants -- the figure Akayev had hoped for -- had approved two key amendments to the constitution. </P>
<P> The vote clears the way for an election to a new-style parliament which Akayev hopes will be more accommodating to his liberal reforms than the outgoing legislature. </P>
<P> ``I hope that today's vote will open the way to installing a pro-reform parliament in December,'' he said Saturday. </P>
<P> Full results, initially expected early Sunday, were postponed after sudden snowstorms. </P>
<P> Electoral commission officials said riders who had been due to deliver results on horseback from remote regions had been unable to get through to district centers. </P>
<P> Kyrgyzstan, shaped like an arrowhead between China and Kazakhstan, has moved further toward a market economy than its ex-Soviet neighbors despite a largely hostile parliament elected in 1990 before the collapse of the Soviet Union. </P>
<P> But Akayev had sought an extra vote of confidence in reform. </P>
<P> The referendum means that, unlike in Russia where outright confrontation between President Boris Yeltsin and parliament led to bloodshed last October, Akayev has succeeded in setting the stage to oust the Soviet-era parliament without violence. </P>
<P> Opposition members had said Saturday that they expected some irregularities in the voting, noting that procedures were lax and many voters were allowed to cast ballots for family members. </P>
<P> But large-scale manipulation seemed unlikely because of Akayev's popularity, which seemed to decide the poll's outcome. </P>
<P> No Kyrgyz officials were immediately available for comment on the outcome or on the allegations. </P>
<P> The electoral commission said 86 percent of Kyrgyzstan's 2.2 million voters had participated in the poll, well above the 50 percent needed to make the referendum valid. </P>
<P> Akayev, who got over 90 percent backing in a confidence referendum in January, had urged his people in a media campaign to back his proposals to change the constitution. </P>
<P> One constitutional amendment in the referendum will replace the one-chamber parliament with a two-house legislature. </P>
<P> Under the plan, 35 deputies will form a permanent lower chamber to draft laws. The upper house of 75 deputies will meet twice a year to approve them. </P>
<P> Another amendment will allow changes to the constitution through referendums as well as through parliamentary decision. </P>
<P> Akayev has said the new parliament would be elected Dec. 24. </P>
<P> Akayev's reform efforts can claim some success, especially in a country which has few natural resources. </P>
<P> Despite a sharp decline in industrial production, the som currency is stable and inflation low. His three-year economic recovery program was blessed by the International Monetary Fund, which in July promised a $104 million credit to back it. </P>
<P> Akayev has also managed to avoid serious ethnic frictions between scores of races and nationalities living in Kyrgyzstan, a painful problem for many other former Soviet republics. </P>
