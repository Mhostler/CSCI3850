<P>  Eight people, six of them children, were killed and 17 were injured when a bus carrying a school group slammed into a truck and burst into flames in southern Brazil Monday, police said. </P>
<P> ``It must have been a driving mistake because the collision was head-on, said Joao Macheki, the head of highway police in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul state. </P>
<P> The dead also included a school teacher and the driver of the bus. The group was on an excursion to a nearby beach. </P>
<P> In the northeastern state of Bahia, five people were killed early Monday when a truck collided with a car. And in Parana state, southern Brazil, 16 people were killed in two accidents during the weekend. </P>
<P> ``It's been very rainy and there's always a lot of traffic at this time of year,'' said a highway police spokesman in Brasilia. But since July, when Brazil launched a dollar-linked currency to reduce inflation, the number of accidents has risen, the spokesman said. ``With the (economic) stability there's a lot more people travelling out there,'' he said. </P>
