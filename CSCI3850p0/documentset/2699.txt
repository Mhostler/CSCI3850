<DATELINE>RAFAH, Gaza Strip (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Hundreds of Arab youths led by masked Muslim militants rampaged through this southern Gazan town Friday bent on revenge for the killing by Palestinian police of at least 11 people in Gaza City. </P>
<P> Police got off the streets as soon as the news of what the Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas termed a massacre reached Rafah, 25 miles to the south. </P>
<P> For six hours, Hamas controlled the center of the town of about 100,000 inhabitants. </P>
<P> Witnesses said up to a thousand youths, led by six masked members of Hamas' Qassam military wing armed with iron bars, smashed up two cafes, a video shop and the town cinema. </P>
<P> Muslim militants regard music, card-playing and Western videos as un-Islamic. </P>
<P> They beat up the owner of a video shop and scrawled slogans on the walls, evoking memories of the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation. Except this time, Hamas and Islamic Jihad promised PLO leader Yasser Arafat a bullet in revenge. </P>
<P> ``Arafat, you have finished building your coffin and now just wait for your just deserts,'' said one slogan signed by Islamic Jihad. </P>
<P> Police stayed away until after dark, but then came back firing shots in the air to scatter knots of young men gathered on the streets. </P>
<P> Apart from the video store owner there were no immediate reports of injuries. </P>
