<P>  Pittsburgh Penguins superstar center Mario Lemieux has talked about sitting out the next National Hockey League season, and team chairman Howard Baldwin said Monday he will soon meet with Lemieux to finalize plans for the 1994-95 season. </P>
<P> ``Some discussions have taken place with Mario concerning the possiblity of his taking a year off, but at this point, Mario has not informed us of anything definite,'' said Baldwin. </P>
<P> Cable television sports network ESPN reported Sunday that Lemieux, who has been diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease and has had recurring back problems, will take a year off and then plan a return to the Penguins for the 1995-96 season. </P>
<P> ``Executive vice president and general manager Craig Patrick and myself will be meeting with Mario very shortly,'' Baldwin said. </P>
<P> The 28-year-old Lemieux, a four-time NHL scoring champion who led the Penguins to Stanley Cup championships in 1991 and 1992, played in only 22 regular-season games and six playoff games last season because of back pain. </P>
<P> He has experienced chronic back pain due to a disk injury, and he began radiation treatments in February 1993 to treat Hodgkin's disease, a form of cancer. </P>
<P> Lemieux missed 20 games while receiving treatment but won his second Hart Trophy as the NHL's Most Valuable Player in the 1992-93 season, amassing 69 goals and 91 assists in just 60 games. </P>
<P> Lemieux has spent the summer months mulling retirement and playing on a celebrity golf tour. </P>
