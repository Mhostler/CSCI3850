<P>  The Republican Party said it would begin airing television advertisements in seven states Monday aimed at forcing Democratic Senators to back a balanced budget amendment to the constitution. </P>
<P> Republican National Committee chairman Haley Barbour said the commercials were designed to complement broad grassroots support for the amendment which has passed the House of Representatives but is in trouble in the Senate. </P>
<P> The commercial is targetted at the following Democratic Senators: Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota, Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad of North Dakota, Jim Exon and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, Richard Bryan and Harry Reid of Nevada, Iowa's Tom Harkin, New Mexico's Jeff Bingaman and Wendell Ford of Kentucky. </P>
<P> Barbour said these Senators would help themselves politically if they backed the balanced budget amendment. </P>
<P> ``If they vote against it, their constituents will know about it,'' he said. </P>
<P> Barbour said the White House and the Democratic Party were straining every muscle to ensure that the proposition was defeated. It needs a two thirds majority to be sent to the states for ratification, where it will require the approval of three fifths of state legislatures. </P>
<P> Barbour said the Republican Party would spend several hundred thousand dollars on its campaign. The exact cost would depend on how long the ads needed to be aired but he said the party was in the battle for the long haul. </P>
