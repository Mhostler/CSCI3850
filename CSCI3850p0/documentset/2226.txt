<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The dollar fell to a new post-World War Two low against the Japanese yen and a fresh two-year low against the German mark before shimmying up late Tuesday. </P>
<P> The pressure on the dollar kept the heat on bonds -- where the yield on the benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury bond ended well above 8 percent -- and left the stock market lower. </P>
<P> The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 4.71 points at 3,850.59 -- bringing to about 85 points the amount the index has lost since it began falling last Thursday. </P>
<P> Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was a heavy 326.1 million shares, compared with 282.8 million shares Monday. Declines beat advances 1,409 to 790 on the Big Board. </P>
<P> The dollar fell to 96.35 yen early in New York trading, breaking through the prior post-war low of 96.55 yen set on Oct. 21. The dollar also hit a new two-year low of 1.4860 marks. </P>
<P> However, the dollar recovered somewhat to stand mixed by the end of the day. In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.4940 German marks, up from 1.4915 marks late Monday. Against the yen, the dollar was quoted at 96.70 yen, down from 97.15 late Monday. </P>
<P> The dollar had come under pressure in overnight trading, despite repeated intervention by the Bank of Japan aimed at supporting it. Selling continued as New York traders entered the market in the morning. </P>
<P> As the dollar edged down, the Bank of Japan's efforts alone were not been enough to combat the negative sentiment. </P>
<P> The benchmark 30-year bond eased 1/32 of a point, keeping the yield at 8.05 percent -- the same as Monday. </P>
<P> In commodities markets, copper prices surged to four-week highs, fueled by strong industrial demand for base metals and a strike at an Australian copper mine and smelter. </P>
<P> December copper jumped 1.35 cents to 119.25 cents a pound, its highest since September. </P>
<P> In overseas markets, the 225-share Nikkei average in Tokyo ended down 120.22 points or 0.61 percent at 19,732.15. In Germany, the 30-share DAX index closed down 50.75 points or 2.51 percent at 1,974.63, hurt by slumping bonds and the weak dollar. In London, the FTSE 100 closed down 28.2 points at 3,000.9. </P>
