<DATELINE>TOKYO, April 26 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Former world boxing heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali and a group of wrestlers left Japan for North Korea on Wednesday to attend the secretive communist state's first series of professional wrestling matches. </P>
<P> A 120-member delegation of wrestlers and singers from Japan and overseas, led by Japanese pro wrestler-turned parliamentarian Kanji Inoki, left on a chartered flight for an international sports and culture festival in Pyongyang. </P>
<P> In contrast to similar sports events in the past, North Korea is welcoming foreign visitors and journalists to the April 28-30 festival, which is seen as a cautious step by Pyongyang towards opening more to the outside world. </P>
<P> A spokeswoman for the New Japan Professional Wrestling Corporation said Ali was invited to attend the festival as a special guest. </P>
<P> Asked whether Inoki or Ali would meet North Korea's top leaders during their stay in Pyongyang, she said their schedule would be formally fixed by North Korea when they arrived. </P>
<P> North Korea's communist government and the Japanese professional wrestling group jointly organised the event in line with Pyongyang's efforts to boost tourism following the death of its late president Kim Il-sung. </P>
<P> North Korean citizens are showing interest in the unprecedented event and about 3,000 tourists from Japan are expected to visit North Korea for two weeks before and after the festival, Japan's Kyodo news agency said. </P>
