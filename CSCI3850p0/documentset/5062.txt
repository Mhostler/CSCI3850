<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Yossi Beilin met Omani Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Youssef Bin Alawi Bin Abdullah Tuesday and said obstacles to opening diplomatic ties were disappearing. </P>
<P> ``The meeting was positive. The obstacles which existed in the past are gradually being removed,'' Beilin told reporters after the unexpected meeting in Cairo. </P>
<P> ``Each of these meetings is an important step in the direction of improving relations although we have not taken yet a decision to establish diplomatic ties,'' Hebrew-speaking reporters quoted him as saying. </P>
<P> Beilin said he felt there was ``a tendency'' to remove the direct economic Arab boycott on Israel ``although there has not been an official statement.'' </P>
<P> ``After the official decision by the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries to lift the boycott of the second and tertiary boycott, this indicates that the direct boycott is on its way to disappearing,'' Beilin was quoted as saying. </P>
<P> He said Oman and Israel decided in principle that the Israeli airline El Al could fly over Omani airspace for the first time but a detailed agreement had yet to be worked out. </P>
<P> Beilin said they also agreed that Israeli businessmen would visit Oman in the coming few weeks and that Israel and Oman would cooperate in water desalination projects. </P>
<P> Israel would also hold an exhibition in Oman, Beilin said without giving details. </P>
<P> Beilin told reporters he would see the Omani minister again later in his stay in Egypt. Alawi, in Cairo to attend the 50th anniversary of the Arab League, was not available for comment. </P>
<P> Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin visited Oman in December, the first such visit by an Israeli head of government to the Gulf Arab state. The two nations agreed to continue talks on establishing ties. </P>
