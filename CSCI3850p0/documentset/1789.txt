<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A high Chinese official told Secretary of State Warren Christopher on Monday that Beijing was seriously concerned at the recent upgrade of U.S. unofficial ties with Taiwan. </P>
<P> Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen told Christopher that if Washington ``could not deal with this question in a responsible and prudent manner, there may be serious consequences,'' Qian's spokesman Shen Guofong told reporters. </P>
<P> Qian had a two-and-a-half-hour meeting with Christopher in advance of a call on President Clinton at the White House. </P>
<P> Clinton and Qian met for an hour in the Oval Office, discussing a wide range of issues between the two countries, the White House said in a statement following the meeting. </P>
<P> The two officials ``agreed that the overall relationship had been considerably strengthened over the past year, and that significant progress had been achieved in some areas,'' the White House said. </P>
<P> Clinton raised concerns about China's human rights record and expressed disappointment that more progress had not been made, the White House said following the meeting. </P>
<P> The two leaders also discussed North Korea's nuclear program and agreed that it was important that the United States and China work toward a denuclearized Korean peninsula, the White House said. </P>
<P> Shen told reporthers following the meeting with Christopher that the issue of Taiwan was high on the Chinese agenda. </P>
<P> The Clinton administration recently upgraded its unofficial relations with Taiwan to permit high-level Taiwanese officials to meet U.S. officials in Washington and U.S. trade and other officials to visit Taiwan. </P>
<P> Shen said the question of Taiwan was central to Sino-U.S. relations and a violation of Sino-U.S. communiques on the Taiwan issue would damage all relationships between the United States and China. </P>
<P> He said Beijing opposed any U.S. sale of F-16 warplanes to Taiwan as a serious violation of a Sino-U.S. accord and added that talks on this issue were continuing. </P>
<P> Christopher reiterated to Qian that Washington would continue to adhere to the joint communiques regarding Taiwan, maintaining non-governmental ties, Shen said. </P>
<P> Beijing considers Taiwan a province of China and has long been sensitive to U.S. ties with the island. </P>
<P> The spokesman repeated Beijing's official position that it has not sold M-11 offensive missiles to Pakistan although reports that it has sold components for such missiles led to U.S. trade sanctions last year. </P>
<P> At a picture-taking session with Christopher earlier, Qian told reporters through a translator, ``China's policy on arms sales is a very responsible one; China does not engage in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction which may produce instability and conflict in regions concerned.'' </P>
<P> However, when pressed further on whether China condones the transfer of technology that might be used to construct a nuclear weapon, Qian responded, ``China abides by MTCR (Missile Technology Control Regime) guidelines and ground rules with regard to missile transfer.'' </P>
<P> Shen said Qian and Christopher exchanged views on the guidelines in the international accord and talks would continue. But he said the United States could not require a limit on missile transfers while violating a U.S.-China communique on selling weapons to Taiwan. </P>
<P> Shen said the two also exchanged views on the Korea question and expressed hopes that the momentum of talks with North Korea on its nuclear program would be maintained. </P>
