<DATELINE>BOSANSKI PETROVAC, Bosnia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Thousands of Bosnian Serb civilians have taken refuge here in private homes and public buildings, fleeing a Bosnian Muslim offensive that has driven Serb forces back in retreat. </P>
<P> Refugees and Bosnian Serb authorities said the Muslim-led Bosnian government army had siezed some 10 villages outside of Bihac in the northwest over the past week, catching Serb soldiers and civilians by surprise. </P>
<P> International aid agencies reported up to 8,000 civilians have fled the area east and south of Bihac due to the Muslim offensive. </P>
<P> But local authorities in Bosnanski Petrovac said the number probably exceeded 10,000 people. </P>
<P> The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) delivered ``urgently needed surgical supplies'' to a hospital in Serb-held Bosnanski Petrovac, some 30 miles southwest of the Muslim stronghold of Bihac. </P>
<P> The ICRC issued a statement in Zagreb saying it planned to distrubute medical supplies to ``assist treatment of war wounded'' in two hospitals in Sanski Most and Jasenica in Bosnian Serb territory. </P>
<P> Refugees from the village of Pritoka, 2.5 miles south of Bihac, said they had been forced to leave behind large stores of wheat, meat and brandy they had collected for the approaching winter due to the Muslim onslaught. </P>
<P> Pritoka is now in the hands of the Muslim-led army and Bosnian state radio in Sarajevo said the army had captured more ground in fighting Saturday, threatening the town of Bosanska Krupa. </P>
<P> Ilija Delic, a Serb from Pritoka, escaped the fighting with his two sons and seven grandchildren. But he said he was desperate to return to his home, even if it had been destroyed in the attack. </P>
<P> ``I will be happiest if I can return with my family to my home,'' Delic said. ``I would prefer to return to the burnt down ruins of my house rather than go anywhere else.'' </P>
<P> The sound of sporadic artillery fire could be heard on Saturday near the front line, some 12 miles west of Petrovac, Reuters journalists said. </P>
<P> Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic declared a state of emergency in nine municipalities around Bosanski Petrovac in response to the major Muslim advance, the Bosnian Serb SRNA news agency reported. </P>
<P> Karadzic ordered all conscripts to report to their barracks by midnight local on Sunday and said civilians could leave the northwest area with the permission of local mayors. </P>
<P> All soldiers were banned from leaving Bosnian Serb territory without permission from Serb defense authorities, SRNA reported. </P>
<P> New Serb defense lines had been set up at Matin Brod, about 12 miles west of Petrovac. </P>
<P> Bosnian Serb General Milan Gvero criticized the United Nations Protection Force for allowing Muslim-led forces to mount attacks from U.N.-designated ``safe areas'' such as Bihac town. </P>
<P> ``There cannot be under international war and civil law a protected zone that people in it are armed,'' Gvero told Reuters. </P>
<P> ``Whenever they attacked us from protected zone members of U.N. forces did not react and whenever we responded they threatened us with retaliation and air strikes.'' </P>
<P> Bosnian Serb generals and leaders said Friday they would shell Sarajevo and Bihac, both U.N. safe areas, if the Bosnian army did not halt its offensive. U.N. commanders warned the Bosnian Serbs would run the risk of NATO air strikes if they carried out their threats to shell civilians in Sarajevo or Bihac. </P>
