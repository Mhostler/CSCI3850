<P>  Five Israeli soldiers, one allied militiaman and one Muslim guerrilla were wounded in fierce duels in south Lebanon Saturday, security and pro-Israeli militia sources said. </P>
<P> The fighting on the Middle East's last active front line between the pro-Iranian Hizbollah guerrillas and Israeli and allied South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia came a day after President Clinton left the Middle East for home. </P>
<P> Security sources said there had been no reports of raids against the Israelis in south Lebanon during Clinton's visit to Syria Thursday. </P>
<P> ``The resistance has been in a very low-key mode since the beginning of September with attacks only against the SLA. Today's exchanges were fierce and covered a wide area,'' an independent security source in south Lebanon told Reuters. </P>
<P> ``The restraint, either self-imposed, or suggested, or a combination of both, was so the Clinton visit would not deviate from its main course of discussing the Israeli-Syrian peace track to addressing security issues,'' he said. </P>
<P> The five Israeli soldiers were wounded when their hilltop post on the edge of the Israeli-held zone in south Lebanon came under a hail of machine-gun and anti-tank rocket fire from guerrillas outside the buffer strip, the SLA sources said. </P>
<P> Other posts manned by the Israelis or SLA militia at Dabsheh, Suweida and Touhra came under similar assaults, they added. </P>
<P> In retaliation Israeli and SLA gunners unleashed 150 artillery shells on Iqlim al-Toufah ridge, a Hizbollah stronghold north of the zone, and areas near the town of Nabatiyeh and around three villages from where militants launch attacks against the zone. </P>
<P> Four civilians were also reported wounded in the exchanges. </P>
<P> Security sources said guerrillas fired a missile at two Israeli planes on reconnaissance flights over the Nabatiyeh area. </P>
<P> Hizbollah, in a statement from Beirut, said its fighters launched a broad assault against four Israeli posts and it claimed the fighters captured the position at Dabsheh after killing the unit manning it. </P>
<P> There was no immediate confirmation of the claim. </P>
<P> Hizbollah and other groups opposed to Arab-Israeli peace talks have vowed to continue attacks on Israeli forces in the zone until it is liberated. </P>
