<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Unidentified gunmen shot and killed three policemen in Egypt's southern tourist province of Luxor, the Interior Ministry said Tuesday. </P>
<P> A ministry official said the gunmen attacked a police station on the outskirts of the village of Naziat al-Aish just after sunset Monday, killing Sgt. Hassan Mohammad al- Sayyid and two guards, Saad Muawwad and Ahmad Abdulbasit. </P>
<P> The gunmen escaped after the shooting, the official said. </P>
<P> He did not say who was believed responsible for the attack, but the militant Gama'a al-Islamiya (Islamic Group), which aims to overthrow the government and install a purist Islamist state, has been targeting policemen regularly in the south. </P>
<P> More than 500 people, mainly militants and policemen, have been killed in Egypt since the Gama'a launched its campaign of violence in March 1992. </P>
<P> The attacks have hit Egypt's vital tourist industry hard, scaring visitors away from pharaonic Nile valley sites and depriving the country of much-needed revenue. </P>
<P> Last month, amid heavy security, the government hosted a spectacular production of the Italian opera Aida near Luxor's Valley of the Kings to try to encourage tourists back to the area. </P>
