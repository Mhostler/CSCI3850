<P>  Greenpeace demonstrators occupying a disused oil storage platform in the North Atlantic in protest against plans to dump it stocked up with supplies Wednesday and promised to stay there for a long time. </P>
<P> Activists from the international environmental group scaled the 93-ft. Brent Spar platform 120 miles northeast of Britain's Shetland Islands Sunday, claiming the proposal to sink it would violate international law. </P>
<P> ``We've been busy today loading food and equipment on board. We are here for a long stay,'' Greenpeace campaigner Tim Birch said via a satellite telephone link. </P>
<P> Seven journalists from Germany, the Netherlands and Britain joined the protesters who pledged to stay until the government reversed plans to dispose of the platform. </P>
<P> ``We'll be there till the autumn when bad weather will prevent any attempt to dump it,'' spokeswoman Sue Cooper said. </P>
<P> Greenpeace fears the dumping would set a precedent for the 400 other platforms earmarked for disposal as the North Sea oil boom fades. Police said they were investigating the occupation of the platform. </P>
<P> Brent Spar's owners, Shell U.K. Exploration and Production, obtained British government persmission to tow the platform to a disposal site later this year. </P>
<P> Greenpeace said the platform contained over 130 tons of highly toxic and radioactive substances which would cause irreparable damage to the marine environment and its wildlife ifdisposed in the ocean. </P>
<P> But Shell said extensive research showed the platform's contents would not have any significant environmental impact. ``The total radioactivity in the Spar is roughly equivalent to a medium-sized street of granite buildings,'' it said. </P>
