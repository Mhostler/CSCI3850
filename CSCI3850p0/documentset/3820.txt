<P>  Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, warned of consequences if Moscow did not resume its march toward democracy, told Secretary of State Warren Christopher Tuesday that President Boris Yeltsin would try to rebuild his ties with reformists, a U.S. official said. </P>
<P> ``In terms of the partnership between the United States and Russia, Kozyrev assured the secretary of the Russian government's determination not to waiver from the path of democracy and market reform,'' the official said. </P>
<P> ``He also assured the secretary that President Yeltsin would undertake efforts to rebuild his political base of reformers,'' the official added. He gave no details. </P>
<P> The official briefed reporters on condition of anonymity after Christopher and Kozyrev held a three-hour private dinner. The two ministers consulted during that time on what their spokesmen would later tell journalists about their talks, the U.S. official said. </P>
<P> Hours before the dinner, Christopher told reporters he would warn Kozyrev there would be unfavorable consequences for Russia if it did not soon end the bloodshed in Chechyna and seek political reconciliation with rebel forces there. </P>
<P> Christopher also said that in the next few weeks, Russia had an important choice to make between returning to the reform path or siding with more authoritarian, anti-reform elements that would jeopardize ties with the West. </P>
<P> Moscow's six-week military campaign to end an independence bid by the Chechnya region has been the source of great angst for the United States, which has strongly backed Yeltsin as a reformer but has been horrified to see the attacks on Chechnya which killed thousands of civilians. </P>
