<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A new drug to treat acute phases of manic-depression moved toward federal approval Monday when an outside panel recommended it go on the market to treat the disease suffered by some two million Americans. </P>
<P> Abbott Laboratories Inc., the drug's maker, said that if approved by the Food and Drug Administration, the divalproex sodium tablet would be the first new drug to treat manic episodes since the introduction of lithium 25 years ago. </P>
<P> The FDA's Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee, after a hearing, found that the drug was a safe and effective method of treatment for acute episodes of the bipolar illness. </P>
<P> It recommended the FDA approve the drug for use in acute manic cases. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of its expert panels, but usually accepts them. </P>
<P> Abbott said that 21-day studies in patients with mania showed the drug well-tolerated, with vomiting the only side effect reported by significantly more patients receiving divalproex sodium compared to a placebo. </P>
<P> About two million Americans suffer from manic-depressive illness, a chronic condition that involves wide mood swings between mania and depression. </P>
<P> The company said that while the causes of the disease are not fully understood, it was thought that genetic, biochemical and environmental factors could each play a role. </P>
<P> It said manic phase symptoms can include elevated moods, hyperactivity, explosive temper, impaired judgement, insomnia, grandiosity, hypersexuality and delusions. </P>
