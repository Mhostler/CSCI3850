<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Law enforcement agents had to stop a key informant in the ``urban terrorism'' trial of a militant Muslim cleric and his followers from playing the role of leader, a detective testified Monday. </P>
<P> Louis Napoli, a New York City police detective who was part of a joint local and federal terrorist task force, admitted during cross examination that he had to tell informant Emad Salem to ``back off.'' </P>
<P> Defense lawyers in the case against Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman and 10 others are trying to show that law enforcement officials had little control over Salem -- a former Egyptian army officer with a shadowy past. The Muslim cleric and his followers are accused of plotting to bomb U.S. landmarks and assassinate political and religious leaders. </P>
<P> Salem's credibility may play a pivotal role in the trial's outcome as he infilitrated Abdel-Rahman's inner circle and learned of what prosecutors allege was a massive plot to ``wage a war of urban terrorism'' in the United States. </P>
<P> The lawyers allege that Salem was working as a double agent for Egypt and the United States. They argue he hatched the plan to entrap Abdel-Rahman, who advocates the overthrow of the Egyptian government. </P>
<P> Then he lured the defendants into the scheme to earn more than a million dollars in fees from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the lawyers alleged. </P>
<P> The informant, who may testify as early as Tuesday, made tapes of more than 1,000 conversations with the defendants and others including his FBI handlers and Egyptian intelligence officers. </P>
<P> Some of the tapes had been supervised by the terrorist task force, but others were made secretly. </P>
<P> Napoli, who had collected the tapes made by Salem, said that Salem wanted to be in charge and tried to ignore FBI procedures. </P>
<P> ``You had to tell him to back off ... isn't it a fact your office had to tell Salem to stop playing the role of leader,'' asked defense lawyer Anthony Ricco. </P>
<P> ``Correct,'' said Napoli. </P>
<P> ``You told him procedures had to be followed. He was constantly pulling against you. He wanted to do things his own way,'' Ricco said. </P>
<P> Napoli testified last week that the task force-supervised tapes were made between May 7 and June 23, 1993. The taping stopped when a group of the defendants were arrested in a raid at a house where they were caught mixing explosives. </P>
<P> Another defense lawyer John Jacobs said that the task force had been lax in its accounting of the tapes it gave and then collected from the informant and questioned Napoli about the secret recordings. </P>
<P> ``Before the arrests, did you become aware he had taped conversations with defendants that he was not turning over,'' Jacobs asked. </P>
<P> ``No, I was not aware of it,'' Napoli said. </P>
<P> Abdel-Rahman and the other defendants are accused of plotting the fatal Feb. 26, 1993, World Trade Center blast, which killed 6 people and injuring more than a thousand, and of planning to blow up the United Nations building and other U.S. landmarks. </P>
<P> In addition to the bomb plot allegations, the defendants are accused of plotting the 1990 murder of radical Rabbi Meir Kahane and of planning to assassinate Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak during a visit to the United States. </P>
