<P>  President Alberto Fujimori vowed Friday that Peru would adhere to a peace treaty signed with Ecuador last week and said fighting was dying down in the month-old border conflict. </P>
<P> ``We heard a mortar round about a half-hour ago, but the belligerant actions appear to be diminishing,'' Fujimori told Radioprogramas del Peru by satellite telephone from Cueva de los Tayos outpost in the disputed border zone. </P>
<P> ``We will not be the ones to restart the conflict. The peace agreement of Itamaraty should be respected save for purposes of self-defense. </P>
<P> ``We hope this cease-fire solidifies now that observers are arriving,'' he added. </P>
<P> Earlier Friday, an advance team of foreign observers flew from the north coast city of Piura to the Peruvian side of the conflict along an undemarcated 48-mile stretch of border. </P>
<P> Fighting broke out between the two Andean countries along the Cordillera del Condor on January 26. A ceasefire and peace treaty were agreed to last week, but fighting has continued in the remote patch of Amazon jungle. </P>
<P> A delegation of military officers and diplomats from four countries monitoring the conflict -- Argentina, Brazil, Chile and the United States -- travelled to the town of Bagua and later were to be transported by helicopter to PV-1 post about 8.5 kms from the Ecuador-Peru border. </P>
<P> Meanwhile, Fujimori, who spent the night in a cave, completed early in the morning a two-day trek to Cueva de los Tayos, one of three positions in the disputed area which both sides claim to control. </P>
<P> ``Last night, or rather early this morning, we experienced some dramatic moments. We heard heavy artillery, bombing,'' he said. </P>
<P> He raised the Peruvian flag and led troops, reporters and others in singing the national anthem and, after spending an hour and a half at the outpost, began the hike back to PV-1, the Peruvian command outpost in the area. </P>
<P> The president said he expected to arrive at PV-1, some 969 miles north of Lima, on Saturday after being in the area since Wednesday. ``I hope the observers can make it here,'' he told the radio. ``I did.'' </P>
