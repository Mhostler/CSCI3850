<P>  Amnesty International urged the United Nations Wednesday to set up an international civilian monitoring team to help stop human rights abuses in Sudan. </P>
<P> In a statement released in London, the human rights group said Sudan was facing a humanitarian emergency in which thousands of people have been unlawfully detained and tens of thousands killed. </P>
<P> ``Having international monitors on the ground would make it more difficult for government and opposition forces to get away with the killings, torture and arbitrary detentions that have fractured Sudanese society and deepened political hatreds over the past five years,'' Amnesty Secretary-General Pierre Sane said. </P>
<P> He added that with the peace process in the African nation's civil war showing little progress the need for a monitoring committee had never been greater. </P>
<P> ``Sudan's future depends on greater respect for human rights being established throughout the country,'' Sane said. </P>
<P> ``The carnage in the war-torn south is only half the picture, because even in areas less affected by civil war, the brutal violation of human rights has also divided the population.'' </P>
<P> The group said the monitors could help to improve human rights policies, report abuses, follow up individual cases and provide an impartial body where Sudanese could report violations. </P>
<P> In a 132-page report on Sudan, Amnesty said that since the 1989 coup in which the civilian government of Sadeq al-Mahdi was toppled, both the military government of President Omar Hassan Ahmad al-Bashir and the two main armed opposition factions had been guilty of abuses. </P>
<P> ``Amnesty International has documented the torture of hundreds of people since 1989, both in the capital, Khartoum, and other towns, as well as in the southern war zone,'' it said. </P>
<P> Rebels of the SPLA (Sudan Peoples' Liberation Army) and the breakaway SSIA (South Sudan Independence Army) are fighting against what is perceived as domination of the mainly black Christian and animist south by the Muslim and Arabized Khartoum government. </P>
<P> The southerners want a right to self-determination which the Khartoum government rejects. </P>
