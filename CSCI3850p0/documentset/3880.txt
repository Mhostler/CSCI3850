<DATELINE>SARAJEVO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  U.N. peacekeepers reported fighting subsided in Bosnia Saturday but neighboring Croatia issued fresh warnings it was prepared to recover by force the third of its territory held by Krajina Serbs if necessary. </P>
<P> Fighting in the Bihac enclave in northwest Bosnia had slowed and other battlefronts were generally quiet except for minor violations of a three-week cease-fire, said U.N. spokesman Lt. Col. Gary Coward. </P>
<P> Croatia's President Franjo Tudjman said in an interview with the German news weekly Der Spiegel that his government was ready to recover by force land held by the country's minority rebel Serbs. </P>
<P> ``If necessary, we won't shy away from that,'' he told the magazine, according to an advance release issued Saturday. </P>
<P> ``The Krajina Serbs and the Belgrade (Serbian) leadership know we are capable of liberating our land by force of arms. The whole world is behind us in this question.'' </P>
<P> Tudjman last week decided not to renew the mandate of U.N. peacekeepers stationed between the Croats and the Krajina Serbs on the grounds that their presence was cementing the secession of the Krajina region. </P>
<P> Tudjman said there was no prospect of him heeding Western appeals to change his mind on forcing the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) to leave. </P>
<P> ``It's final. We have an independent policy, we aren't the servants of the international community. The U.N. is a nuisance to us,'' he said. </P>
<P> Minority Serbs rebelled against Croatia's secession from former Yugoslavia in 1991 and the ensuing six-month war claimed thousands of lives. A U.N.-brokered cease-fire in January 1992 provided for the U.N. deployment, mainly along lines separating the third of territory seized by Serbs from the rest of Croatia. </P>
<P> The leader of the rebel Serbs warned that Tudjman's decision to eject peacekeepers from Croatia could lead to renewed war between the two sides. </P>
<P> Milan Martic, president of the self-styled republic of Serb Krajina, told the Belgrade daily Borba in an interview published Saturday that Croatia had no right to end the U.N. mission by March 31. </P>
<P> He said Krajina Serb authorities and rump Yugoslavia also gave their approval for the deployment in Croatia of 15,000 troops and personnel in early 1992. </P>
<P> ``A decision to deny hospitality to UNPROFOR cannot be solely Croatia's,'' Martic said. </P>
<P> ``Should the international community...support Tudjman's decision, it would be the only party to be blamed for a new war,'' he added. </P>
<P> Martic said the 1992 truce obliged Yugoslavia to protect Krajina Serbs in the event of an attack by the Croatian army. </P>
<P> But Tudjman said he did not expect to spark a renewal of the 1991-1992 war between Croatia and Serbia. </P>
<P> ``I'm sure (Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic) won't intervene. As far as Bosnian Serb leader (Radovan) Karadzic is concerned, that's a different matter,'' he said. </P>
<P> Tudjman had harsh words for Bosnian Muslim allies who he blamed for causing a growing rift in a new Croat-Muslim federation pitted against the Serbs. </P>
<P> The tensions have hampered efforts by European Union administrator Hans Koschnick to reconcile Croats and Muslims in the divided southern city of Mostar. Koschnick said he believed the dispute had been defused in meetings with three Croatian ministers Saturday. </P>
<P> Koschnick had largely blamed the Bosnian Croats for blocking efforts to reunite the city and return refugees to their homes, and called on their backers in Zagreb to act. </P>
<P> But Tudjman alleged the Muslims ``want to control all of Mostar, then push on to the sea and found an Islamic state.'' </P>
<P> ``Just because the Muslims have a demographic majority in Bosnia, they thought they could put a citizens' republic under Islamic law. That's how the conflict arose,'' he said. </P>
<P> In Sarajevo, U.SS envoy Charles Thomas held talks with Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic and Bosnian Serb leaders expected him to meet them Sunday. </P>
<P> U.N. officials have urged the warring factions in Bosnia to fulfil the promises in the four-month cease-fire accord which was meant to open the way for a resumption of peace talks. </P>
