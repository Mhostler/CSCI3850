<P>  Israel's deputy foreign minister said Friday the United States could pay a ``terrible price'' if it did not spend money now to aid countries involved in the Middle East peace process. </P>
<P> Yossi Beilin's comments in a television interview followed a complaint Thursday by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin to President Clinton over a congressional subcommittee vote to cut U.S. debt forgiveness of Jordan from $275 million this budget year to $50 million. </P>
<P> Beilin said, ``There is a sort of lack of understanding regarding the terrible price, also in money but not only in money, that the United States ... could pay if, God forbid, there is another war in the region or in other regions, compared to the small sums being talked about for creating a better atmosphere.'' </P>
<P> The Clinton administration's decision to forgive Jordan's debt helped lead King Hussein to agree to a peace treaty with Israel last year. </P>
<P> A White House spokesman, commenting on the telephone conversation between Rabin and Clinton, said the U.S. president told the Israeli leader he would work with Senate moderates to block the cut if it passed the House of Representatives. </P>
<P> Beilin, asked by Israel Television if he saw a danger in what the interviewer called ``isolationism'' in the Republican-dominated U.S. Congress, replied: ``Without doubt. There is a danger here not only for us in the Middle East.'' </P>
