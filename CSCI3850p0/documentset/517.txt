<DATELINE>LONDON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Caitlin Thomas, whose stormy marriage to the late poet Dylan Thomas was notorious in literary circles, has died in Italy at age 81. </P>
<P> Her body will be returned to Wales to be buried in his tomb, her family said Monday. </P>
<P> A stunning beauty who once dreamed of becoming a great dancer, Caitlin married the poet in 1936 after meeting him in a pub. Their union was marred by drinking bouts, passionate affairs and fights. </P>
<P> They had three children, Llewelyn, Aeronwy and Colm, and lived in a boat house in Laugharne in southwest Wales which Thomas called a ``legendary lazy little black magical bedlam by the sea.'' It also where the poet chose to be buried. </P>
<P> Dylan Thomas died from drinking in 1953 while on a United States lecture tour. Afterwards, his widow found new happiness with a Sicilian, Giuseppe Fazio, who persuaded her to stop drinking. They had a son, Francesco, when she was 49. </P>
<P> ``I was surprised when I heard she wanted to be buried with my father,'' Aeronwy told reporters Monday. ``I felt that she had been in Italy so long that she would want to stay there.'' </P>
<P> But Aeronwy said her mother had told Francesco of her wish before her death and he was respecting it. </P>
<P> Thomas spent much of his adult life living in Laugharne. The couple surprised locals by walking to shops in their dressing gowns. They ran up huge bills on credit but were forgiven because of their generosity in the town's many pubs. </P>
<P> Forced to move back to London because of their debts early in World War Two, the couple returned in May 1949 after a wealthy woman infatuated with Dylan bought him a small house overlooking the wide Taf estuary. </P>
