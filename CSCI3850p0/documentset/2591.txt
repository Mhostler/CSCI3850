<DATELINE>PALMA DE MAJORCA, Spain (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Three Algerian hijackers armed with a knife and claiming to hold a bomb that later turned out to be a coffee grinder forced a plane to Majorca Sunday, then freed all 42 passengers and crew and gave themselves up. </P>
<P> The three men were waiting Monday to know if they will be repatriated or allowed to stay in Spain. </P>
<P> Their fate was being debated by the Spanish judicial authorities, but it appeared their best hope to avoid repatriation would be to stand trial in Spain. </P>
<P> Airport sources said the hijackers had asked not to be repatriated to Algeria because they were certain to be killed. </P>
<P> The hijackers had threatened to blow up the plane if their demands, which included liberating Algeria's political prisoners, resuming elections interrupted there in 1991 and refueling the plane to fly to Marseilles, were not met. </P>
<P> But the three men, in their twenties, were armed only with a knife and had no explosives. A shoe box in which they claimed to have a bomb contained only a coffee grinder. </P>
<P> The Air Algerie plane, with 38 passengers and four crew on board, was flying a new route between Algiers and Ouargla in the Sahara, 340 miles to the south. </P>
<P> It was the second Algerian plane to have been hijacked to Spain this year, and at one point looked as if it might turn into tragedy as the hijackers threatened to blow it up. In the end, the three men gave themselves up and Spanish authorities said they refused to bow to any of their demands. </P>
<P> ``At no time have we acceded to any of their demands,'' Gerard Garcia, central government representative in the Balearics, told a news conference. </P>
<P> According to airport sources in Palma de Majorca, cited by state news agency Efe, the three hijackers were identified as Merzak Benachour, Madjid Arab and Mohammed Nedjar. </P>
<P> None of the passengers and crew was hurt, and they were expected to fly back to Algeria later Monday. They were released at 1:15 p.m. EST, just over eight hours after the plane landed at Palma's Son Sant Joan airport. </P>
<P> According to Garcia, a decision on whether to repatriate them or try them in Spain would depend on the investigating judge. Spain signed the Montreal accord of 1971 and is precluded from granting hijackers political asylum. </P>
<P> Three Algerians who hijacked a Boeing jet to Alicante in February with 127 passengers on board were jailed pending trial in Spain, though one committed suicide in May. </P>
<P> Algerian ambassador Abdelaziz Rahabi told reporters his government would not seek the extradition of the three hijackers because no such agreement existed between the two countries. </P>
<P> He had flown to Palma late Sunday afternoon to follow the negotiations but did not intervene. He said neither he nor any Algeria government representative had talked to the hijackers. </P>
<P> According to Pedro Meaurio, director of Majorca airport, the hijackers had not intended to harm anyone and were concerned that their action should be carried by the news media and that their demands be known internationally. </P>
<P> The hijackers described themselves as members of the ``Union of Peaceful Citizens of Algeria,'' but Meaurio said they did not give the impression of belonging to any political group. </P>
<P> Algeria opened internment camps in the Sahara desert early in 1992 after violence followed the annulment of the 1991 elections. An estimated 10,000 people were held at one time, but hundreds have since been freed. </P>
<P> Nevertheless, leaders of the outlawed Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) say several thousand people are being held by various security forces, including detainees in desert camps. </P>
