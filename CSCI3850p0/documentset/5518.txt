<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Senate Commerce Committee Thursday passed a bill to limit damages in product liability lawsuits. </P>
<P> The bill, approved by a 13-6 bipartisan vote, would cap punitive damages in product liability cases to three times the actual damages or $250,000, whichever was greater. </P>
<P> Supporters said the bill was needed because of excessive damage awards in many lawsuits and to discourage frivolous suits. ``If something is unfair to business, isn't it just as right to make the law fair as it is when something is unfair to consumers?'' Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-WVa., said. </P>
<P> But opponents argued that it was unfair to victims of defective products. </P>
<P> ``They (damage caps) hurt the little fellow and help the rich,'' said Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky. </P>
<P> Liability awards are now regulated by state laws. Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., said the bill went against the Republican goal of returning more power to the states and individual Americans. </P>
<P> ``We now find them (citizens) untrustworthy (as jurors),'' Hollings said. </P>
<P> ``There is no litigation explosion,'' Hollings added. </P>
<P> The bill is strongly supported by business organizations and opposed by legal and consumer groups. </P>
<P> ``The trial lawyers are the only ones winning anything under the current system,'' said Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash, the co-author of the bill with Rockefeller. </P>
<P> The legislation was quickly approved by the committee but faces a tougher fight in the full Senate where many amendments are possible. </P>
<P> The Senate Labor Committee considered a separate bill putting the same limits on medical malpractice suits but put off final action until after a three-week Senate recess. </P>
<P> The House last month passed a single bill containing both product liability and malpractice limits. It was one of the Republican ``Contract with America'' campaign pledge items. </P>
