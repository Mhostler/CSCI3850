<DATELINE>ONESTI, Romania (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Nadia Comaneci, the first gymnast to score a perfect 10 in the Olympics, returned to her Romanian home town Wednesday, five years after fleeing communism for the West. </P>
<P> ``Five is my lucky number and I said to myself: ``Now I can go home','' the 32-year-old triple Olympic gold medallist told crowds in the small town of Onesti, in the province of Moldova. </P>
<P> Comaneci returned to Romania Monday night with the Romanian women's gymnastics team after it won its third world championship at a tournament in Dortmund, Germany. </P>
<P> In a country with little to shout about since its 1989 anti-communist revolution toppled dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, Comaneci remains a national hero. </P>
<P> Onesti celebrated her visit by renaming her old school the Nadia Comaneci High School, giving her a large symbolic wooden key to the town as well as the title of citizen of honor. </P>
<P> Deputy Mayor Ionel Munteanu was overcome with emotion when he presented Comaneci with the key to Onesti. </P>
<P> ``Nadia belongs to gymnastics; she belongs to the world, but first and foremost she belongs to this place,'' he said. </P>
<P> Comaneci said: ``I am very, very happy to be here. This is one of the greatest days of my life.'' </P>
<P> Much has changed since the 14-year-old Comaneci enchanted the world at the 1976 Montreal Olympics, winning three gold medals with seven 10s -- an unprecedented achievement. </P>
<P> In those days Onesti was called Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej -- the name of the first communist post-war dictator. </P>
<P> Outside her old school some 300 people chanted ``Nadia, Nadia, Nadia'' and stretched for a glimpse of their idol. </P>
<P> ``I dream of becoming a star like Nadia,'' said a little girl named Anca. </P>
<P> Before the ceremony, Comaneci visited her father's humble apartment in a working class district of the town. Gheorghe Comanici, 61, was moved to tears when his daughter received the award. </P>
<P> Comaneci fled into self-imposed exile five years ago this week, less than a month before Ceausescu -- who regarded her as a national hero -- was overthrown and executed in the bloodiest of the Eastern European revolutions of 1989. </P>
<P> President Ion Iliescu welcomed Comaneci home, declaring Tuesday night when he met her and the victorious gymnastics team: ``Across time, from Nadia's generation to today, we have another gold generation.'' </P>
<P> Comaneci said Tuesday she would donate $100,000 to help the development of Romanian gymnastics. </P>
<P> ``The national team's success at Dortmund was the perfect opportunity to make this visit and for me to donate $100,000 to the Romanian Federation as my participation, and as a sign of thanks for what I have received,'' she said. </P>
