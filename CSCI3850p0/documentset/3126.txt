<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Israel opened its embassy in Jordan Sunday, sparking protests by hundreds of Muslim militants and leftists who described the occasion as a ``black day.'' </P>
<P> A Jordanian mission was due to open in Tel Aviv later Sunday as agreed in the Oct. 26 peace treaty which ended nearly five decades of a formal state of war. </P>
<P> Ambassadors will be exchanged in about six weeks. </P>
<P> Israeli Foreign Ministry official Yaov Biran unveiled a plaque reading ``Embassy of Israel'' in English, Arabic and Hebrew before raising the blue and white flag on a pole outside the Forte Grand Hotel in Amman's financial district. </P>
<P> ``It is a great privilege for me to declare the embassy of the state of Israel in Jordan open,'' said Biran. Invitees applauded and drank champagne and orange juice. </P>
<P> Pictures of Israeli President Eizer Weizman, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres decorated the six-room suite serving as a temporary site. </P>
<P> A Jewish rabbi blessed the embassy and fixed a mezuzah -- a parchment scroll featuring verses from the Bible -- next to the door in line with a Jewish custom at the opening of new homes and public buildings. </P>
<P> But over 400 protesters, members of an eight-party coalition opposed to Jordan's peace pact with Israel, staged a sit-in outside the prime minister's offices and burned an Israeli flag. </P>
<P> They urged Jordanians to boycott the Israeli embassy and oppose all forms of normalization. </P>
<P> ``The opening of the enemy's embassy is a black day because it forms a departure from the nation's principles and goes against the will of the majority of the Jordanians,'' the coalition said in a statement. </P>
<P> Biran said he hoped the move would inspire Syria and Lebanon to reach similar treaties with Israel to complete the ``circle of peace'' in the Middle East. Egypt is the only other Arab country to have signed a peace treaty with Israel. </P>
<P> ``I am sure that these two embassies in Amman and Tel Aviv will constitute a cornerstone on which we shall build a bridge of friendship, good neighborliness and cooperation,'' he added. </P>
<P> ``We are making another important and great step forward.'' </P>
<P> Jordanian foreign ministry officials and representatives from the United States and Russia, co-sponsors of the Middle East peace process launched in Madrid in 1991, as well as the European Union, Egypt and Spain, attended the low-key ceremony. </P>
<P> Scores of Jordanian police, some in anti-riot gear, surrounded the hotel and banned traffic on the street leading to the nine-story building. Others stood on nearby rooftops. </P>
<P> The government, which banned the coalition from organizing a march through main streets in line with policies in force since October, allowed them to stage the sit-in as a compromise. </P>
<P> Biran said the embassy will be manned for now by charge d'affaires Yaacov Rosen and first secretary Ronnie Porat. The figure could go up to 25 - four to five diplomats and the rest administrative and security staff. </P>
<P> ``The embassy will start operating from tomorrow (Monday) and will start by implementing the agreement of peace and its various clauses,'' Biran said. </P>
