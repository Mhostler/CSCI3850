<P>  Israel has been acquiring raw materials from Syria for more than a year by shipping them through third countries, Israel's Haaretz daily said Friday. </P>
<P> Israeli officials were not immediately available to comment. </P>
<P> Haaretz, quoting unnamed Israeli sources, said the deals were initiated by a company controlled by Israel and done via straw companies in third countries but with ``full knowledge and approval of the most senior levels in the Syrian government.'' </P>
<P> It said the materials were brought directly from Syria to Israel but that Syria, which is Israel's staunchest foe in the Middle East, was not an important source for them. </P>
<P> The newspaper did not specify what raw materials were involved. </P>
<P> More than three years of Israel-Syria peace talks have stalled over the Golan Heights Israel captured in the 1967 war. </P>
<P> Syria demands full withdrawal and Israel wants a Syrian commitment to full trade and diplomatic ties and open borders before discussing the scope of a withdrawal. </P>
<P> The coordinator for U.S. Middle East peace efforts, Dennis Ross, came to Israel Thursday on the first leg of a shuttle aimed at inching talks forward between Israel and Damascus. Ross met Israeli Prime Minister Rabin Thursday. </P>
<P> He is to meet, separately, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and PLO head Yasser Arafat Friday before setting off for Damascus. </P>
