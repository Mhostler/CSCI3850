<P>  Whatever Europe may say about Canada's unilateral policing of international fishing grounds, the dramatic seizure of a Spanish ship on the high seas may have succeeded in forging ground-breaking conservation measures which may not otherwise have been written, experts said. </P>
<P> Firing shots across the bow of a fishing vessel and cutting the expensive nets of another -- as Canada did to Spanish trawlers in international waters off Newfoundland last month -- is hardly to be expected of an ally. </P>
<P> But Canada reckoned drastic action was needed to save one of the last stocks of fish in the Northwest Atlantic -- the lowly turbot, or Greenland halibut. </P>
<P> ``It's not only for Canada; we're not doing that only for our fishermen,'' Prime Minister Jean Chretien said last week. </P>
<P> ``We wanted to make sure that there are conservation rules that are applied there and that all the nations of the world follow the rules.'' </P>
<P> Canadian Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin announced Saturday that an agreement had been reached with the 15-nation European Union under which tough new enforcement measures would be put in place to save the turbot. </P>
<P> ``Finally we have an excellent precedent to move towards better management of fisheries by the European Union,'' Helene Bours, Greenpeace's EU fisheries campaigner, said of the agreement with Canada. </P>
<P> Canada, for sure, is not innocent of excessively exploiting fish stocks off its Atlantic coast. So much fishing was allowed there that a complete moratorium on taking the once bountiful northern cod was applied in 1992. </P>
<P> Canada pumps billions of dollars into the Maritime Provinces, impoverished largely because of the decimation of fish stocks. Angered by the moratorium, Atlantic provinces fishermen put enormous pressure on the Canadian government to stop foreign boats from fishing the once-rich Grand Banks. </P>
<P> Hardest hit is Newfoundland, with more than 20 percent unemployment. That province also happens to be where Fisheries Minister Tobin -- some dubbed him ``Captain Turbot'' -- is from, though the dispute gained him popularity worldwide for his audaciousness. </P>
<P> Spain, backed sometimes grudgingly by its EU partners, was outraged by what it termed illegal Canadian seizure of a Spanish ship outside the 200-nautical-mile limit. </P>
<P> Canada argued that Spanish and Portuguese ships were taking too much fish, especially young ones, damaging the stock's ability to reproduce and replenish. </P>
<P> Whatever the legal arguments, the fact is that tough conservation rules have now been agreed for the first time for the Northwest Atlantic, with observers to be on board all ships to ensure compliance with strict quotas and rules. </P>
<P> Tobin said Saturday that he hoped the new Canada-Europe regime would be used as a model for a United Nations convention on fishing rights around the world. </P>
<P> And indeed the dispute concentrated the minds of negotiators at a U.N. conference on fishing in New York. This conference has now come up with tentative rules which also would help prevent overfishing. </P>
<P> Greenpeace says 70 percent of the world's fish stocks are overfished or depleted. </P>
<P> Tobin said his hope is that the agreement reached with the EU could eventually lead to the recovery not only of turbot but of six other species, including the northern cod, that are so depleted a moratorium has been placed on fishing them. </P>
<P> He held out the possibility that the glory days of hundreds of thousands of tons of caught fish worth hundreds of millions of dollars could return if stocks recover. </P>
<P> But Newfoundland and Spanish fishermen may be waiting a long time for those riches to return because the damage wrought, especially on the northern cod, was so severe. </P>
<P> Canadian government scientists believe recovery of cod to sustainable levels could be 15 years off, though the less depleted turbot would recover sooner. </P>
<P> But environmentalists reckon one or two decades are well worth the wait if the tradition of centuries of rich fishing on the Grand Banks off Newfoundland can be restored. </P>
