<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Clinton has invited Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams to a White House meeting next week with his national security adviser, Anthony Lake, the Irish Times reported Wednesday. </P>
<P> But the newspaper said Clinton had personally decided to ban Adams from fund-raising for Sinn Fein while in the country after a request from Britain, which has yet to officially recognize the Irish Republican Army's political wing. </P>
<P> Its front-page report, quoting a high-level administration source, said Clinton had also decided to grant Adams' request for a multi-entry visa for three months. </P>
<P> The moves were seen in Dublin as an attempt to balance the demands of the powerful Irish-American political lobby and the desire of the British government to keep Adams at arms length. </P>
<P> Britain says it will open exploratory talks with Sinn Fein before the year's end after the IRA announced a cease-fire Aug. 31 in its 25-year war against British rule of Northern Ireland. </P>
<P> Northern Ireland has enjoyed a fragile peace since the IRA cease-fire, which was followed six weeks later by a truce from their Protestant Loyalist foes fighting to preserve the province's British links. </P>
<P> Britain's ban on ministerial contacts with Adams and other Sinn Fein politicians is threatening to backfire on an initiative by Prime Minister John Major to provide an economic boost to the current peace process, the paper reported. </P>
<P> It said that the British government's decision to exclude Sinn Fein from an international investment conference planned for Belfast next month had upset Irish American political figures, who might now boycott the conference. </P>
<P> But U.S. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown still plans to attend the economic forum next month despite Britain's exclusion of Sinn Fein, a spokesman for Brown said Tuesday. </P>
<P> Clinton's fund-raising ban will be a setback for Adams' hopes of raising much-needed funds for his party's united Ireland campaign during functions in several cities. </P>
<P> The Irish Times said Clinton was honoring a private commitment he gave to Britain on fund-raising. Opposition to any relaxation also came from the State and Justice Departments and the FBI. </P>
<P> When Adams lasted visited the United States, shortly after the IRA cease-fire, the White House was closed to him and he had to be content with a telephone call from Vice President Al Gore. </P>
<P> Britain says there is no change in its policy barring ministers from face-to-face contacts with Sinn Fein. </P>
<P> An international investment forum, planned for Dec. 13 and 14 in Belfast, is Major's attempt to portray Northern Ireland as a profitable peacetime location to several hundred international business executives. </P>
<P> The Irish Times said: ``The decision (to ban Sinn Fein) could decimate a group of potential American investors which the Clinton administration planned to send as part of a U.S. delegation accompanying Commerce Secretary Ron Brown.'' </P>
<P> Democratic Rep. Tom Manton of New York said he was shocked by the development. ``It looks as if the British have pulled the rug out from under the peace process,'' Manton said. </P>
