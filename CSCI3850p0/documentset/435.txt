<DATELINE>SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Serb forces fired on a British U.N. convoy near Sarajevo Wednesday, killing one British peacekeeper and wounding another, U.N. officials said. A Bosnian civilian was also wounded. </P>
<P> A truck carrying 4,500 gallons of fuel went up in flames, sending a huge cloud of black smoke into the sky, and two other trucks in the 10-vehicle U.N. Protection Force convoy caught fire. </P>
<P> The incident occurred after rebel Serbs made good a threat issued Tuesday to block the route on which the convoy was traveling -- the main supply lifeline for Sarajevo -- to civilian traffic. </P>
<P> U.N. sources said the Serbs had threatened to use force against vehicles breaking the blockade. </P>
<P> The U.N. commander in Bosnia said the Serbs had opened fire because they mistook the white trucks and jeeps, bearing U.N. markings, for civilian vehicles. </P>
<P> ``I'm afraid we're in a period when there's a lot of tension and opportunity for misunderstanding,'' British Lieutenant General Michael Rose told reporters. ``As soon as we radioed them they (the Serbs) stopped firing.'' </P>
<P> But British Lieutenant John Mitchell of the Duke of Wellington's Regiment, one of those ambushed, voiced a different view. </P>
<P> ``All the vehicles were obviously marked U.N., that's for sure,'' he said. ``It was a direct targeting on the U.N.'' </P>
<P> The United Nations called in NATO warplanes, but they did not open fire because they were unable to identify a target, U.N. sources said. </P>
<P> They said confusion apparently arose because a civilian truck had preceded the convoy and Serb gunners may have erred in thinking all the vehicles were defying their self-decreed travel ban. </P>
