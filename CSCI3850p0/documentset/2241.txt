<P>  The ubiquitous fluid bag hanging above the stretcher of a shooting or stabbing victim who is being rushed to the hospital may become a thing of the past. </P>
<P> A Houston study on nearly 600 people with serious wounds has discovered that the practice of giving fluids to bleeding trauma victims, even if their blood pressure has dropped dangerously low, may hurt as much as it helps. </P>
<P> The study, to be published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine, found that patients who did not receive fluids until surgeons were ready to close their wounds had a slightly better survival rate than those who received the standard fluids, designed to keep blood pressure up. </P>
<P> ``Our results challenge traditional practices that espouse aggressive and universal preoperative intravenous infusion of fluids'' for trauma patients whose pressure has dropped because of the bleeding, concluded the team, led by Dr. William Bickell of Saint Francis Hospital in Tulsa, Oklahoma. </P>
<P> But Dr. Lenworth Jacobs of Hartford Hospital in Connecticut cautioned in an editorial in the journal that the Bickell study may not be the final word on the issue. </P>
<P> ``Before we adopt the practice of withholding fluid resuscitation from patients with extensive bleeding at the scene of an event and in the emergency department,'' Jacobs wrote, ''further controlled studies are needed'' to see of the victim's blood pressure reading, or the severity and location of the bleeding, are factors that should affect the decision. </P>
<P> Emergency personnel have given fluids for years in the belief that they increased the likelihood of survival by preventing damage to organs deprived of sufficient blood. </P>
<P> However, adding fluids has a drawback. Diluting the blood also makes it harder for the body to form clots which naturally stem blood loss. </P>
<P> To test the possibility that this could make the trauma victim bleed even faster, Houston rescue workers gave differing treatments to assault victims whose blood pressure had dropped dramatically. Some patients were given fluids immediately while others received them only when they were under general anesthesia ready for surgery. </P>
<P> While the overall survival rate among patients who got the standard treatment was 62 percent, the rate was 70 percent for victims who did not receive any fluids immediately. </P>
<P> Patients denied the fluids also tended to be discharged faster and seemed less likely to suffer complications, such as infection, breathing problems and kidney failure, immediately after surgery, the study found. </P>
<P> ``It is not the value of fluid resuscitation that is currently being debated,'' the researchers said, ``but rather the volume, timing, and extent of that resuscitation for certain patients.'' </P>
