<DATELINE>KINGSTON, Jamaica (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Jamaica's opposition leader, former Prime Minister Edward Seaga, said Monday he will abide by a national poll on his leadership following demands for his resignation. </P>
<P> Seaga, who has served as leader of the Jamaica Labor Party (JLP) for over two decades, faces the most serious challenge ever to his leadership by disgruntled party officials from western Jamaica who feel he is a liability to the JLP. </P>
<P> As Jamaica's prime minister from 1980 to 1989, Seaga was a staunch regional ally of President Ronald Reagan and played a key role in persuading Reagan to invade Grenada in 1983. </P>
<P> The challenge to Seaga's leadership became public Feb. 23 when two newspapers published reports that a group of constituency caretakers -- or members of parliament -- from western Jamaica had written Seaga demanding he either resign or they would. </P>
<P> The 11 officials claimed they have at least 20 of the JLP's 60 constituency caretakers behind them, but said the others were reluctant to go public. </P>
<P> For the most part, Seaga has been silent on the issue since it emerged over a week ago but did tell those asking him to step down that it was either ``my way or the highway.'' </P>
<P> The squabble already has claimed party Chairman Bruce Golding, who resigned late last week. Golding is widely seen as Seaga's heir apparent but also enjoys the support of those seeking to oust him. </P>
<P> Golding said his resignation was triggered by dissatisfaction over the pace of reform within the JLP. But observers believe Golding wishes to wait for the dust to settle before siding with either Seaga or his challengers. </P>
<P> No date has been set for the opinion poll, which will determine whether Seaga has the public support to remain as opposition leader. </P>
<P> The western JLP leaders claim Seaga's continued presence has made it impossible to mobilize grass-roots support and campaign contributions in that part of the country. </P>
