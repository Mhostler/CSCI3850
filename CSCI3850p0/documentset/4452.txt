<P>  Romanian police have found the last 30 missing items from a treasure stolen in 1993 from the Jewish Museum in the Hungarian capital of Budapest, a senior police official said Monday. </P>
<P> ``There are 30 precious gold and silver Jewish art and devotional items, worth some $5 million,'' Col. Bogdan Bucur, of the Romanian General Police Inspectorate, told Reuters. </P>
<P> ``We are cooperating with Hungarian police to make an inventory of the treasure,'' Bucur said, adding that it might take one month to return the stolen goods to the museum in Budapest. </P>
<P> Last year, Romanian police discovered and returned to Hungary the bulk of the haul, consisting of hundreds of items including centuries-old silver artifacts, Jewish manuscripts and old religious books, with an estimated value of $250 million. </P>
<P> The treasure, Europe's richest collection of Jewish artifacts, had been housed in Budapest's main synagogue in the former Jewish ghetto. </P>
<P> It vanished in December 1993, when cat burglars climbed scaffolding outside the synagogue and entered through an iron grid. </P>
<P> Romanian police declined Monday to provide further details either of the theft or of how the booty was recovered. They said investigations were still under way. </P>
