<DATELINE>TOKYO, May 9 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Japan on Tuesday again rejected U.S. demands for its carmakers to draft plans to buy more American car parts. </P>
<P> Cabinet ministers reiterated Japan's intention to take a spiralling dispute over auto trade to a world trade body if Washington imposes trade sanctions. </P>
<P> Minister of International Trade and Industry Ryutaro Hashimoto told a news conference he would keep opposing numerical trade targets because setting them for one sector would lead to requests for similar targets in other areas. </P>
<P> ``Once we accept numerical targets in one sector, such as cars, we may have to accept similar requests in other areas,'' Hashimoto said. ``As far as I am concerned, we will continue to oppose adamantly (numerical trade targets).'' </P>
<P> President Bill Clinton has been advised by top aides to hit Japan with tariffs and other tough trade measures following the breakdown of long-running talks on the topic over the weekend. A decision is expected by mid-week. </P>
<P> Economic Planning Minister Masahiko Komura told a separate news conference that it was only natural for Japan to appeal to the new Geneva-based World Trade Organisation (WTO) if the United States imposed sanctions over the dispute. </P>
<P> ``I consider it natural (to go to the WTO). If the United States imposes trade sanctions, I believe that it is natural to follow rules,'' Komura said. </P>
<P> But Komura also quoted Foreign Minister Yohei Kono as telling a cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning that the government should not react emotionally to the trade dispute. </P>
<P> Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura, also speaking after a regular cabinet meeting, said he supported Hashimoto's tough stance on the bilateral dispute. </P>
<P> Takemura added, however that Japan would work out steps to expand imports of car parts and boost the domestic economy as part of its efforts to cope with the yen's surge and said such efforts would be promoted by both the government and the private sector. </P>
<P> Meetings held in Canada last week and capped by talks between Hashimoto and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor failed to resolve the nearly two-year-old auto dispute. </P>
<P> The biggest sticking point was Hashimoto's rejection of a U.S. demand that Japanese carmakers renew voluntary purchase agreements which spell out how they plan to boost purchases of U.S.-made car parts. </P>
<P> Hashimoto said on Tuesday, however, that it had become more important than ever for Japan to proceed with deregulation to ease trade friction, adding that he had asked other ministers for their cooperation. </P>
<P> Some trade experts have said that Japan is unlikely to cave in to U.S. demands for car parts purchase plans but might be able to avert a trade battle by drafting a convincing plan to ease regulations which impede imports and strangle business. </P>
<P> Deregulation plans to date have been criticised as too slow and too vague. </P>
