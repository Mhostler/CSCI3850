<P>  Just two days before he died last July, North Korea's late president Kim Il-sung approved a cautious opening of his nation's economy, a Japanese news agency reported Sunday. </P>
<P> Han Tok-su, chairman of the pro-Pyongyang General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryun), relayed Kim's position to fellow Chongryun members upon returning home last month from a six-month stay in Pyongyang, Kyodo news service said. </P>
<P> Han, who is also a member of North Korea's Supreme People's Assembly, said Kim's position is being regarded as his last wish and respected by the entire leadership around his son and heir-apparent Kim Jong-il, Kyodo said. </P>
<P> At a July 6 meeting of about 100 Communist Party politburo members, Kim Il-sung was said to have stressed the need to rebuild the country's economy, although he showed concern over possible defections and a large influx of South Korean investment. </P>
<P> Kim died of a heart attack two days after the meeting. </P>
<P> A Chongryun spokesman told Reuters Han met Kim Il-sung during his stay in Pyongyang, but that nothing had been heard from Han about the late president's economic position. </P>
<P> Han was not available for comment. </P>
<P> Earlier this month, North Korea rejected South Korea's proposal of bilateral economic cooperation, saying Seoul must first apologize for freezing ties over the issue of the North's nuclear program. </P>
<P> South Korea announced it would lift a freeze on North-South contacts following a landmark nuclear deal between North Korea and the United States in October. </P>
