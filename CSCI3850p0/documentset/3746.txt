<P>  Keith Fergus finished up with two birdies and an eagle Thursday to earn a share of the first round lead with Jim Furyk at the $1.2 million Hawaiian Open golf tournament. </P>
<P> Fergus and Furyk each shot five-under-par 67 on the 6,975-yard Waialae Country Club course to stand one stroke ahead of a group of six, including Tom Lehman, Mark Brooks and Duffy Waldorf. </P>
<P> Strong trade winds from the north -- a switch from the southerly Kona winds that blew during the practice rounds -- caused unusually high scoring on a layout not considered one of the more challenging on the tour. </P>
<P> The 40-year-old Fergus, who quit the PGA Tour in 1987 to raise his family, had been working as the golf coach at the University of Houston until last spring. </P>
<P> A three-time winner on the tour during the 1980s, Fergus made five birdies, two bogeys and an eagle for his place atop the leaderboard. The two bogeys were both from three-putt greens. </P>
<P> ``Although I was still playing and practicing in Houston, I wasn't playing competitively, and you lose those little, bitty shots around the green when you're out of competition. My short game was very rusty coming back,'' he said. </P>
<P> The final three holes provided a huge boost to Fergus's confidence. He birdied the 16th from five feet, sank a 25-footer for birdie on 17, and eagled 18 by holing a chip from 40 feet. </P>
<P> ``It feels really good to be back,'' Fergus said. ``A lot of my friends are still out here, and so it felt almost like I never left.'' </P>
<P> The 24-year-old Furyk, in just his second year on tour, was relieved to get in out of the wind with a good score. </P>
<P> ``At the start of the year you don't know what to expect, so I'm really happy with the round,'' said Furyk, who had five birdies and no bogeys. </P>
<P> ``I hadn't played in the wind in a while, and I've almost never played in wind this strong, so shooting such a solid round is great.'' </P>
