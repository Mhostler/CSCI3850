<DATELINE>LAGOS, Nigeria (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  American Ambassador Walter Carrington Thursday denied news reports alleging widespread visa selling at the U.S. Embassy in Lagos. </P>
<P> The Daily Times newspaper Thursday reproduced an article in the current issue of the U.S. magazine Newsweek which said that a visa-selling racket was uncovered at the embassy last summer and all its visa section staff were recalled home. </P>
<P> The brief article in the periscope section of Newsweek's overseas editions quoted a prominent Nigerian attorney as saying the visas were being sold for about $3,000 each. </P>
<P> ``The story is false in its entirety,'' Carrington told a news conference. ``There is no scintilla of evidence to support it. No person's tour has been cut short.'' </P>
<P> The United States is a favorite destination for thousands of young Nigerians trying to flee economic hardships at home. Long lines of visa-seekers are usually seen at the U.S. Embassy in Lagos. </P>
<P> A U.S. consular official said the embassy received an average of 30,000 non-immigrant visa applications a year. </P>
<P> ``Since I have been here for over a year, there has never been a single allegation of the selling of visas brought to the embassy,'' Carrington said. </P>
<P> According to Newsweek, Nigerians have the highest rate of visa delinquency worldwide. Many remain in the United States illegally after their visas have expired. </P>
