<DATELINE>TOKYO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Japan is stepping up defense ties with Russia, China, South Korea and other Asia-Pacific countries in a long-term bid to create a forum for regional security dialog, foreign and defense ministry officials said. </P>
<P> ``Our goal is not to replace the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty,'' one government source said Tuesday. ``Nor do we envisage a collective security arrangement like NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization).'' </P>
<P> Instead, Japan aims to accumulate layers of defense ties on the bilateral and regional levels, to reassure its neighbors of no surprises and ensure that Tokyo has a bigger say than simply economics in how the area develops, they said. </P>
<P> Japan is allergic to collective security arrangements like NATO because of a long-standing constitutional restraint on multilateral military alliances and the ghost of the tripartite Axis alliance with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. </P>
<P> Defense and Foreign Ministry officials said dialogue and other forms of confidence-building measures were more realistic than forming a regional security body. Measures include exchanging naval training fleets and observers to war games. </P>
<P> Tokyo's latest moves include what had long been unthinkable -- an overture to Moscow for mutual visits by defense chiefs. </P>
<P> No defense minister from either country has visited the other in more than a century of tortuous bilateral ties. Their militaries have fought four times this century and Moscow-Tokyo ties are still strained over disputed islands in the southern Kuriles. </P>
<P> The islands were seized by the advancing Soviet army during the last days of World War II. Japan has refused to sign a peace treaty without their return. </P>
<P> Russia's Itar-Tass news agency reported last Saturday that Japanese Defense Minister Tokuichiro Tamazawa could travel to Moscow as early as January. </P>
<P> Japan's proposal for Tamazawa's visit apparently came from Naoaki Murata, head of the Defense Ministry's Defense Policy Bureau, who was in Moscow over the weekend. </P>
<P> Murata has been in Moscow since Nov. 19 to attend the Trilateral North Pacific Security Forum with counterparts from the U.S. and Russia. He is the highest Japanese defense official ever to visit Russia, ministry officials said. </P>
<P> Japan has also invited Chinese Defense Minister Chi Haotian to visit Tokyo, Foreign Ministry officials said. </P>
<P> It would be the first contact between Chinese and Japanese defense ministers since 1987. Defense visits were suspended after the 1989 Chinese crackdown on the pro-democracy movement. </P>
<P> The immediate impetus for Japan's drive appears to be changes in policy by Tokyo's key ally the United States which is also now heavily involved in regular defense contacts with once old foes like Russia and China. </P>
<P> ``The recent visit by U.S. Defense Secretary (William) Perry greatly eased our situation,'' a defense official said of Tokyo's desire not to be out of step with Washington. </P>
<P> Japan's defense ties with South Korea, a bitter critic of Japan's war past, has also been speeding up. </P>
<P> When South Korean Defense Minister Rhee Byoung-tae visited Tokyo last April, the two sides agreed to hold talks on the senior bureaucrat level for furthering defense contacts. </P>
<P> The South Korean Navy's training flotilla is expected to call at Tokyo next month, the first such visit. </P>
<P> On the regional level, Japan has already taken part in the first ASEAN Regional Forum, an Asia-Pacific regional security conference hosted by the six-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations, held in Bangkok in September. </P>
<P> As part of regional efforts, Japan will host the December 1-17 Asia-Pacific Security Seminar of senior military officers in charge of defense policy. </P>
<P> Majors and colonels from 14 countries, incuding Russia, China, South Korea, Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand and the ASEAN six -- Indonesia, Brunei, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines -- were to attend the Tokyo gathering, defense ministry officials said. </P>
