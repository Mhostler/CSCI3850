<P>  A woman who had previously threatened to use fire as a weapon has been charged with murder and arson in the fiery rowhouse deaths of six children, including four of her own, police said Monday. </P>
<P> Tracey Shaw, 27, was arrested Sunday morning at her sister's home and ordered held without bail, detectives said. </P>
<P> The fire that began the morning of Dec. 23 trapped the six children, ages 2 to 15, including two neighboring girls who were sleeping over. Shaw claimed to have escaped the fire with her six-month-old son, but authorities became suspicious when a medical exam showed no after-effects of exposure to smoke or flames. </P>
<P> Det. James Tucker said Sunday that Shaw was a suspect from the outset. ``We have ruled out every other conceivable suspect, and we kept coming back to her,'' he said. </P>
<P> Tucker said interviews with relatives and neighbors show that Shaw had exhibited irrational behavior in the days before the fatal fire. </P>
<P> Another report was that Shaw had recently made two threats to burn the house down if a former boyfriend did not come back to her. In one episode described by a police source, Shaw allegedly sprayed charcoal lighter fluid throughout her rowhouse in an attempt to make good on the threat. </P>
<P> She was also about to be evicted for nonpayment of her rent, officials said. </P>
