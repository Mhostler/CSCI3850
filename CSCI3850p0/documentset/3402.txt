<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Protestant politicians pressed Britain Friday to grant an amnesty to hundreds of Loyalist prisoners to match an Irish amnesty which freed nine IRA convicts and gave 30 parole for Christmas. </P>
<P> ``It's not prisoners' parole that's at the top of our agenda, it's the release of prisoners,'' Billy Hutchinson of the Progressive Unionist Party (PUP) told reporters before starting talks with British officials in Belfast. </P>
<P> He was speaking as nine Irish Republican Army (IRA) prisoners, including two convicted murderers, walked free from the Irish Republic's Port Laoise maximum security jail under a controversial amnesty granted by the Dublin government. </P>
<P> They were to have been freed in November but their release orders were scrapped after IRA gunmen killed a postal worker in a robbery in the border town of Newry which shattered an IRA cease-fire that started in September. </P>
<P> Britain refuses to grant amnesty to hundreds of IRA and Loyalist prisoners despite appeals to make a gesture of clemency to reward both groups for declaring cease-fires since September that has brought peace to the province. </P>
<P> Two small Protestant political parties with links to Loyalist guerrillas who fought to keep Northern Ireland British said they would be raising the prisoner issue at their second round of talks with British officials since the ceasefires. </P>
<P> Britain has allowed 350 Republican and Loyalist prisoners home for Christmas leave this year, about 100 fewer than in 1993, and has rejected appeals for a more sweeping amnesty. </P>
<P> Britain says those in jail for Northern Ireland-related security offenses are not political prisoners and will receive no special treatment beyond normal reviews of sentences dependent upon criteria such as time served and good behavior. </P>
<P> Ian Paisley, a hardline Unionist politician determined to keep Northern Ireland British, called Dublin's amnesty an ``outrageous'' caving-in to unrepentant murderers and bombers. </P>
<P> ``If you can only have a peace process by concessions, where will the concessions end?'' Paisley, leader of the second biggest pro-British party in Northern Ireland, told BBC radio. </P>
<P> Britain's talks with the Loyalist representatives mirror similar ground-breaking discussions the London government has opened with Sinn Fein, political wing of the IRA. </P>
<P> Both groups were invited to preliminary discussions in the wake of the guerrilla ceasefires under an Anglo-Irish push to end 25 years of violence and launch new all-party talks to find a politial settlement to the Northern Ireland conflict. </P>
<P> But Britain wants the guerrillas to surrender or put out of service hundreds of tonnes of guns, weapons and explosives the gunmen have stockpiled over the past quarter of a century before taking part in new negotiations. </P>
