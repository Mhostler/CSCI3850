<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The nation's capital got more bad news Wednesday when credit rating firm Moody's Investors Service Inc. downgraded the city's general obligation debt to junk bond status. </P>
<P> Moody's said it downgraded District of Columbia debt to Ba from Baa, moving the rating into the junk category. The move affects roughly about $1 billion of bonds. </P>
<P> Congress, Wall Street and city officials led by Mayor Marion Barry -- newly re-elected after time in jail for drug abuse -- have been seeking solutions to the city's financial crisis. </P>
<P> Proposed rescue plans range from massive budget cuts, a federal takeover of some services and creation of a tax-free zone to attract people and business. </P>
<P> The city of 600,000 people faces a forecast $722 million budget deficit in fiscal 1995 -- a number equal to 22 percent of the overall budget. </P>
<P> Wednesday's downgrades come a day after Standard & Poor's Corp. lowered its rating on the district to BBB-minus -- a borderline investment grade -- from A-minus. S&P said it kept the rating investment grade because of the district's ability to borrow from the Treasury. </P>
<P> Barry said he was shocked by the rating downgrade of District bonds but stressed that city services will not come to a halt. </P>
<P> ``I'm dismayed, I'm upset,'' Barry said at a briefing following the announcement by Moody's. </P>
<P> ``But it doesn't mean any operations or services are going to be affected,'' he said. ``We are going to have more police officers on our streets than ever before.'' </P>
<P> Barry said if S&P joins Moody's in dropping the district's bond rating to junk grade, the city cannot move forward with the $200 million bond offering it plans this spring for improvements to roads, schools and transportion facilities. </P>
<P> ``We'll have to go elsewhere to borrow it or borrow it at a higher rate,'' he said.  Barry would not comment on reports that the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether district officials properly disclosed the city's financial woes to bond investors. </P>
