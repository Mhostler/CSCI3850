<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Peru's electoral board Wednesday squashed the presidential hopes of deposed first lady Susana Higuchi, the latest chapter in her high-profile feud with her husband, President Alberto Fujimori. </P>
<P> The National Electoral Board ruled that her party had failed to gather the 100,000 valid signatures required. </P>
<P> Higuchi last week signed up to challenge her estranged husband in his bid for re-election in April's elections, sparking an unprecedented huband-and-wife rivalry for Peru's highest offfice. </P>
<P> The electoral board said in a statement that Higuchi's Harmony 21st Century Party had only presented 11,851 valid signatures to register itself. Harmony 21st Century had submitted some 147,000 signatures. </P>
<P> Higuchi, in a statement read over television late on Wednesday, said she had yet to received official notification of the board's resolution. </P>
<P> ``In the case we are notified our movement is not accepted, we will ask the time provided by law to rectify the problem,'' she said referring to the lack of valid signatures. </P>
<P> Higuchi had charged earlier in the week that members of the National Intelligence Service were using high-tech fraud in a bid to eliminate her from the race. </P>
<P> Higuchi said some 150,000 signatures had been erased from her movement's computers Oct. 8 and 9 during a blackout which only affected the block where her offices were located. </P>
<P> She also charged that a computer virus had appeared on diskettes containing reconstructed signatures and that some diskettes apparently had been switched for others that contained invalid signatures. </P>
<P> Higuchi, whose parents like Fujimori's are Japanese immigrants, was stripped of her duties of first lady by her husband in August after she protested an electoral law that banned her from running for office and began criticizing Fujimori's rule. </P>
<P> The electoral board said Higuchi's party was one of seven eliminated from the race due to lack of valid signatures. Of the 27 parties or political movements which presented candidacies, 14 remained Wednesday, it said. </P>
<P> Earlier, one of Higuchi's vice presidential running mates announced he was quitting. </P>
<P> Eduardo Menguillo, candidate for second vice president on Higuchi's ticket, told Radio Programas del Peru that ``family and business pressures'' had forced him to submit his resignation. </P>
<P> Menguillo and Luis Renteros, Higuchi's candidate for first vice president, are virtual unknowns in Peruvian political circles. </P>
