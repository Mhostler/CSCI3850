<P>  The Cuban government, in the process of cutting subsidies to loss-making state industry and agriculture, is considering expanding the types of work that self-employed people may undertake, officials said on Tuesday. </P>
<P> Labor Minister Francisco Linares said that there were currently 160,000 people licensed to offer goods and services through ``work on their own account.'' </P>
<P> This could grow to some 300,000 people if the proposed new categories were approved, the Cuban news agency Prensa Latina said, quoting Linares. </P>
<P> He did not say how many categories were being considered or give details of the new types of work, which would add to some 130 categories approved last year in a law to authorize self-employment. </P>
<P> Existing categories include jobs such as manicurists, barbers, carpenters and bicycle mechanics. </P>
<P> The self-employed have to register and be approved for a license by local authorities. Doctors, teachers and other university graduates are not allowed to obtain such licenses. </P>
<P> Communist-ruled Cuba does not release statistics on unemployment among its work force of around five million people, although it stresses that workers laid off from state firms are protected by unemployment payment or relocation to other work. </P>
<P> But the need to create jobs is bound to rise as the state continues to cut spending on loss-making firms in its efforts to emerge from deep economic crisis. </P>
