<DATELINE>BOSTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  It wasn't Magic and Bird, but Nick Van Exel made the Los Angeles Lakers' final visit to the Celtics' Boston Garden a night to remember Friday. </P>
<P> Van Exel took an inbounds pass with his back to the basket, turned and hit a 28-foot desperation 3-pointer at the buzzer to give the Lakers a 120-118 victory. </P>
<P> Asked what kind of look he got at the basket, Van Exel said: ``It was a horrible one. I wanted to get it up. I thought I traveled and then I thought I was out of bounds. And after I didn't hear a whistle blow, I just shot it up and it went in.'' </P>
<P> Lakers coach Del Harris said: ``He caught the ball, he made an incredible, impossible shot. For the rest of our lives, we'll be able to say the last time we played in Boston Garden, we won the game.'' </P>
<P> The Celtics will move into the Shawmut Center next season, leaving the Boston Garden in which they fought so many epic battles with the Lakers. From 1980-89, Magic Johnson's Lakers and Larry Bird's Celtics won a combined eight NBA titles and at least one of the teams was in every Final. </P>
<P> The Lakers (23-12) could not return to the Garden unless both they and the Celtics (15-23) reach the Finals. </P>
<P> ``It's right up there with Magic's hook shot across the key in 1985,'' Lakers assistant coach Michael Cooper said of Van Exel's shot. ``It fits there with Gerald Henderson's steal in '84, when they beat us that year.'' </P>
<P> Cooper added: ``It put the whole series in perspective for me. Every time we play these guys, it had to be something difficult to win the game.'' </P>
<P> The game-winning hoop came after Dino Radja put back his own miss with 2.4 seconds left to give Boston a 118-117 lead. Radja led the Celtics with 21 points and 12 rebounds. </P>
<P> Cedric Ceballos scored 31 points and Elden Campbell had 30 for Los Angeles. Van Exel finished with 29 points. </P>
<P> In Charlotte, ex-Celtic Robert Parish hit a 15-foot baseline jumper with 1.5 seconds left, then stole an inbounds pass to seal the Hornets' 13th straight home victory, a 99-97 triumph over the New Jersey Nets. </P>
<P> Alonzo Mourning had 26 points and 15 rebounds and Muggsy Bogues had 17 points and 13 assists for Charlotte. </P>
<P> In Denver, Anfernee Hardaway scored six of his 27 points in overtime to lift the Orlando Magic to their sixth straight victory, a 112-108 triumph over the Nuggets. </P>
<P> Shaquille O'Neal added 20 points for Orlando. </P>
<P> At Utah, Karl Malone had 28 points and 12 rebounds as the Jazz held on for their eighth straight victory, 94-84 over the Cleveland Cavaliers. </P>
<P> Malone became just the 19th player in NBA history to score more than 20,000 points. He entered the game 15 points shy. </P>
<P> The Jazz nearly blew a 20-point lead but improved their record against Eastern Conference teams to 18-1. </P>
<P> In Dallas, Patrick Ewing scored a season-high 36 points as the New York Knicks beat the slumping Mavericks 106-93. </P>
<P> Ewing scored 10 points in the final period as the Knicks got their 11th win in their last 12 games. </P>
<P> The Mavericks have lost 11 of their last 15. </P>
<P> At Detroit, Hakeem Olajuwon scored 24 of his 34 points in the second half and added 12 rebounds and four blocks to power the Houston Rockets past the Pistons, 106-96, snapping a three-game losing streak. </P>
<P> The Pistons have dropped 12 of their last 14 games. </P>
<P> At Indiana, Reggie Miller made all four of his 3-point attempts and scored 15 points and Byron Scott added four during a 10-0 spurt early in the fourth quarter to lift the Pacers to a 99-89 victory over the Atlanta Hawks. </P>
<P> In Chicago, B.J. Armstrong had 22 points and Scottie Pippen 16 as the Bulls beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 93-86. </P>
<P> The Bulls improved to 12-0 lifetime against the Wolves while snapping a season-high four-game losing streak. </P>
<P> The Timberwolves have dropped 10 of their last 12 games. In Miami, David Robinson scored 26 points, including a pair of free throws with 5.5 seconds left in overtime, giving the San Antonio Spurs a 115-114 triumph over the Heat. </P>
<P> San Antonio played without temperamental forward Dennis Rodman, who was benched for one game after he failed to attend the morning shootaround. </P>
<P> In Los Angeles, Clyde Drexler scored 28 points to lead the Portland Trail Blazers to an easy 108-97 victory over the Clippers, snapping a three-game losing streak. </P>
<P> Portland played without Harvey Grant, Jerome Kersey and James Edwards, who were serving one-game suspensions for their roles in a brawl against Sacramento earlier this week. </P>
<P> In Baltimore, Scott Skiles had a game-high 28 points and Calbert Cheaney added 25 to lead the Washington Bullets past the the visiting Philadelphia 76ers, 102-98. </P>
<P> Washington won for only the second time in 13 games. </P>
<P> The Sixers have dropped 10 of their last 11. </P>
