<DATELINE>BONN, May 5 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) look set to maintain their overall majority in next week's election in Germany's most populous regional state, North Rhine- Westphalia, a survey released on Friday showed. </P>
<P> But the ailing liberal Free Democrats (FDP), junior partners in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Bonn coalition, looked in danger of suffering the latest in a series of embarrassing defeats. </P>
<P> The SPD, in opposition in Bonn, scored 50.5 percent in the poll by the Sample institute published by Focus magazine -- half a point up from their 1990 result. </P>
<P> The FDP registered 4.0 percent, below the minimum five percent needed to return to the parliament. </P>
<P> The liberals had dropped out of nine straight state parliaments before being returned in Hesse earlier this year. They scraped back into the national parliament to save Kohl's coalition in October's general election. </P>
<P> New failures in North Rhine-Westphalia, and in the city-state of Bremen which also has a state election on May 14, could threaten the position of party leader Klaus Kinkel, who is also foreign minister. </P>
<P> FDP officials admitted earlier this week that they were not sure of getting back into the Bremen assembly. </P>
<P> The Sample poll gave Kohl's Christian Democrats 33.5 percent in North Rhine-Westphalia, a heavily industrialised region which is the SPD's heartland, compared with 36.7 percent in 1990. </P>
<P> The big winners looked likely to be the ecologist Greens, increasingly donning the FDP's traditional mantle as the mainstream third party. The survey put them at 10.0 percent, double their 1990 result. </P>
