<P>  Businesses hit by a one-boy crime wave that sent insurance costs soaring in an English town have appealed to the government to act against the delinquent destroying their livelihoods. </P>
<P> The 14-year-old has been convicted 138 times for vandalism and theft in the northern town of Elland over the past four years, and is blamed for doubling the town's crime rate and driving out traders. </P>
<P> After his latest court appearance this week, when he was ordered to make regular appearances at a police-run attendance center, shopkeepers demanded the government lock him up. </P>
<P> ``The town is under siege,'' said one shopkeeper. </P>
<P> Magistrates were unable to pass a custodial sentence on the boy, who was convicted of three burglaries and two cases of criminal damage, because he is under age. </P>
<P> But new legislation allowing custodial sentences for persistent young offenders comes into force in January, and Elland traders asked Home Secretary (Interior Minister) Michael Howard to treat the boy as a special case and put him in secure accommodation as soon as the act becomes law. </P>
<P> The Home Office declined to comment Wednesday. </P>
<P> The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is blamed for sending businesses' insurance premiums soaring. </P>
<P> ``We couldn't afford to stay in Elland when we were finally refused insurance cover for office equipment,'' one shopowner said. </P>
<P> Even his father wants the boy jailed. ``If it was up to me, I would have had him put away somewhere long ago,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``We've tried to lock him in at home, but it doesn't work. In these flats you can't lock the firedoors, so he can get out.'' </P>
<P> The boy says he turned to crime out of boredom. </P>
<P> ``It was something to do, because Elland is ... and I don't have enough pocket money,'' he told the court. </P>
<P> Police say the boy is always cooperative in custody and sometimes cries with apparent remorse. </P>
