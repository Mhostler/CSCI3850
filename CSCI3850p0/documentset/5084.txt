<P>  Cuba's dream of a boxing clean sweep collapsed at the Pan-American Games Tuesday and U.S. veteran Roger Kingdom, a two-time Olympic champion, won the 110-meter hurdles after an agonizing two-hour wait for a judges' decision. </P>
<P> Kingdom was first disqualified and then reinstated but in the two-hour wait before he could claim victory, Kingdom had to hear repeated scratchy recordings of the Cuban national anthem, signaling yet another victory for the Cubans, who collected three more gold medals in athletics. </P>
<P> Local organizers were asked to make the host nation's passionate sports fans quiet down for the remainder of the games. But with Argentina expected to make the finals in both the men's and women's hockey, the soccer and the basketball, they could have a tough job on their hands. </P>
<P> The United States is way ahead in the overall gold medals standings with 137, compared to Cuba's 63. The two nations are tied 4-4 in athletics. </P>
<P> Cuba's hopes of winning all 12 boxing golds, after taking 11 in the 1991 Havana games, were shattered when welterweight Juan Hernandez, the defending Pan-Am champion, was disqualified for punching opponent Hercules Kyvelos of Canada in the gentials. </P>
<P> Hernandez, the top ranked amateur boxer in the world in his category and firm favorite for a gold medal, was expected to easily beat Kyvelos until he took a huge swipe that connected fully with his genitals. </P>
<P> The Canadian keeled over in agony and still had tears in his eyes when the referee raised his arm to declare him the winner. </P>
<P> Kingdom, 32, had to wait two hours after winning the 110 metres hurdles and then was disqualified after a judge said he had deliberately knocked down the ninth hurdle. </P>
<P> The U.S. team appealed and finally ruled in Kingdom's favor. </P>
<P> ``I did not knock over a hurdle on purpose,'' he said. </P>
<P> Kingdom won the event in the 1984 and 1988 Olympics but since 1991 has been struggling to recover from knee surgery. He said he intends to quit with a gold at the Olympics in Atlanta next year. </P>
<P> Connie Price-Smith grabbed a second gold medal for the United States in athletics on Tuesday, winning the women's shot put with a throw of 19.17 metres. </P>
<P> But elsewhere the Cubans were in charge. </P>
<P> Aliuska Lopez won the women's 100-meter hurdles in 12.68 seconds. </P>
<P> Emeterio Gonzales was first in the men's javelin with a throw of 79.28 meters, a new games record, and Niurka Montalvo won the women's long jump with a leap of 6.89 meters. </P>
<P> Graciela Mendoza of Mexico took the other gold, winning the women's 10-kms walk in 46 minutes 1.93 seconds. </P>
<P> Argentina's fans had little to cheer about, which at least relieved one problem for local organizers. </P>
<P> The Pan-American Sports Organization (PASO) said they had asked if the crowds could be called on to be quiet, following the partisan atmosphere at some recent events. </P>
