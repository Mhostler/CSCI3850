<P>  Republican Congressional leaders Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole expressed reservations Tuesday about President Clinton's planned trip to Moscow for ceremonies marking the allied victory in Europe in World War II. </P>
<P> Dole, the Senate Republican leader, said Clinton should also go to victory celebrations in London, which the president plans to pass up for the Moscow trip. </P>
<P> House Speaker Gingrich told a news conference that Clinton should take care of domestic business first and send Congress his plans for balancing the budget by 2002 before he goes to Moscow to discuss aid and other issues. </P>
<P> The White House announced Monday that Clinton would travel to Moscow for May 9 ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary of the allied victory in Europe, but would be unable to attend similar ceremonies in Britain, France and Germany. </P>
<P> ``While this is clearly President Clinton's call, I have some serious reservations about his decision to go to Moscow on May 9, particularly in the light of the ongoing Russian assault on Chechnya,'' Dole said in a statement. </P>
<P> He said Clinton should use his visit to raise objections to the violence against the breakaway region and to Russian plans to provide nuclear reactors to Iran. </P>
<P> Clinton should also address the U.S. refusal to subject the enlargement of NATO with former Warsaw Pact countries to a Russian veto, and U.S. displeasure with ``Russian support for the rogue regimes in Iraq, Iran, Serbia and Cuba,'' Dole said. </P>
<P> He said he hoped Clinton would consider attending Victory in Europe ceremonies in London, Paris and Berlin. He urged him to go to London on May 8 to celebrate V-E Day with the British ''whose soldiers and leaders played a critical role during the Second World War.'' </P>
<P> ``If the president thinks it is useful in helping democracy in Russia to go to Moscow, that's a reasonable decision to make,'' Gingrich said. </P>
<P> ``I think for him to go to Russia, particularly if he intends to talk about any more aid, without having shown us how he is going to balance the budget, is not appropriate,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``And I just think it's very, very important that he meet his obligations here in the United States before he can consider leaving for Moscow.'' </P>
