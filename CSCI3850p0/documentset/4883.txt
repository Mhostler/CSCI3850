<P> The daily La Jornada said Salinas and his family left for the United States on a private flight Saturday afternoon and would not be returning. </P>
<P> La Jornada said Salinas, his wife and their three children flew to New York and would likely move on to Boston to begin a new life. </P>
<P> And the weekly magazine Proceso said Sunday that Salinas' political exile was agreed at a meeting with President Ernesto Zedillo, his handpicked successor, at the presidential palace Los Pinos last Thursday night. Proceso said the accord binds Salinas to stay out of public life but did not say what he received in return. </P>
<P> A government spokesman and a man who answered the telephone at Salinas' office in Mexico City both said they could not confirm or deny the report. </P>
<P> ``We know nothing, there is nobody here,'' the man at Salinas' office told Reuters. </P>
<P> In Washington, the State Department said it did not know if Salinas had in fact traveled to the United States, but suggested there was no reason he would be unwelcome. </P>
<P> ``We don't know if in fact Carlos Salinas is in the United States,'' a department spokeman said. ``He is a private citizen. We are uanware of any impediments to Mr. Salinas's traveling to the United States.''  State Department officials said Salinas presumably had an indefinite tourist visa dating from years ago, but they could not immediately confirm this because, they said, issuance records are normally kept for only one year. </P>
<P> Gwen Williams, a New York Port Authority spokeswoman, said they had no record of Salinas and his family having arrived in New York City Saturday or Sunday. The Port Authority operates the three major international airports in the area. </P>
<P> The Mexican Consulate in New York did not return telephone calls regarding the whereabouts of Salinas and his family. </P>
<P> Salinas since January has been on the 17-member board of the New York-based financial information company Dow Jones, a company spokesman said. </P>
<P> Salinas' reputation has come crashing down around his ears over the last two weeks and he has held a messy public dispute with Zedillo over who is to blame for the economic crisis. </P>
<P> The scandal erupted Feb. 28 when his elder brother, Raul Salinas, was arrested on charges of masterminding the murder last September of Francisco Ruiz Massieu, secretary-general of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). </P>
<P> Carlos Salinas responded by going on a brief hunger strike to clear his name of allegations that he mishandled the economy and played a role in covering up a conspiracy in the assassination last March of PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio and in the death of Ruiz Massieu. </P>
<P> Raul Salinas' arrest and Carlos Salinas' efforts to shift blame for the country's economic woes on Zedillo broke a golden rule of Mexican politics that the sins of former leaders and their families are swept under the carpet in exchange for their absolute silence on national issues. </P>
<P> The ugly dispute pushed Mexico deeper into political crisis. </P>
<P> La Jornada said one source told it Salinas left the country after an envoy from Zedillo arrived at his home with a message and the plane tickets. It said that Salinas had apparently telephoned Los Pinos Friday, but that Zedillo had not taken his call. </P>
<P> Raul Salinas, a prominent figure in business and PRI circles, is in a maximum security prison outside Mexico City awaiting trial. </P>
<P> Ruiz Massieu had once been married to the Salinas brothers' sister. Investigators have not said if Raul Salinas ordered the murder for personal, business or political reasons but most Mexicans believe both Colosio and Ruiz Massieu were targeted as part of a power struggle inside the PRI. </P>
