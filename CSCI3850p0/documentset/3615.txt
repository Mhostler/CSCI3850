<P>  Vice President Al Gore, while acknowledging a rekindled interest in running for president someday, flatly ruled out the possibility Friday he would consider challenging President Clinton in 1996. </P>
<P> During an exchange with editors and reporters of the Los Angeles Times, broadcast by the C-SPAN cable system, Gore was asked if he ruled out challenging Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1996, as suggested by some disgruntled Democrats. </P>
<P> ``Absolutely, of course,'' Gore replied. ``President Clinton is going to be renominated and is going to run a very strong campaign. I predict that he will be re-elected to a second term.'' Clinton last week said he planned to seek a second term. </P>
<P> Asked about his future plans, Gore noted that he did not run for president in 1992 because of serious injuries to his son, Albert, who was struck by a car. His son has since fully recovered. </P>
<P> ``My outlook about the longtime future has changed,'' he said of seeking the presidency, adding that serving as vice president has been ``a great learning opportunity, a great privilege and I've enjoyed it immensely.'' </P>
