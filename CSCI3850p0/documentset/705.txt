<P>  Prince Tallal Hussein, nephew of King Hussein, visited Israel in secret for talks on whether Jordan might ship goods through the Jewish state, an Israeli mayor said Thursday. </P>
<P> Since the countries ended a 46-year state of war last month, Israeli leaders have openly visited Jordan. The prince was the first prominent Jordanian to publicly cross into Israel. </P>
<P> The Wednesday visit of the prince, a businessman and son of the king's brothe, Crown Prince Hassan, was accorded a banner headline in Israel's Yedioth Ahronoth daily. </P>
<P> Zvi Zilker, mayor of Israel's Mediterranean port city of Ashdod, quoted Prince Tallal as saying Jordan wanted to trans-ship 30,000 containers next year and 60,000 in 1996 through Ashdod rather than its own Red Sea port of Aqaba. </P>
<P> ``This represents a savings of $1,000 for each container, saving the kingdom of Jordan $30 million the first year, meaning 1995, and $60 million the next,'' Zilker told army radio, adding any proposal needed approval from both governments. </P>
