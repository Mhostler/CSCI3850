<P>  Residents of this port city marked a somber Good Friday after judicial authorities put a statue of a purportedly miraculous bleeding Madonna under ``house arrest,'' preventing them from carrying it in procession. </P>
<P> Since last February, when the 15-inch statue of the Virgin Mary first reportedly wept tears of blood, the city north of Rome has been caught up in miracle fever fueled by the prospects of a pilgrim tourism boom. </P>
<P> But questions arose when tests showed that the blood was male. </P>
<P> Outside the church of St. Agostino, in the flat Pantano farmland district north of the city, workmen had installed portable toilets in expectation that thousands of people would turn up for a special Good Friday procession with the statue. </P>
<P> Then last week Civitavecchia magistrate Antonio Albano ordered Bishop Girolamo Grillo to keep the statue locked in a sealed closet in his home pending the results of an investigation to determine whether the bleeding was a hoax. </P>
<P> Italian newspapers have dubbed Albano's decision, which put him on a highly publicized collision course with Grillo, a ``house arrest for the Madonna.'' </P>
<P> Albano said allowing the statue to remain the subject of veneration while the scientific verdict was still pending risked violating laws forbidding ``abuse of public sensitivities.'' </P>
<P> Residents of the Pantano district wanted to use a replica of the statue in a procession around their district but Church authorities forbade it. </P>
<P> A Good Friday prayer service was being held in the small church Friday afternoon and a customary procession commemorating Christ's passion and death was due to take place Friday night in the center of Civitavecchia. </P>
<P> Initial tests have shown that red liquid on the face of the white plaster statue was male blood but there has been no conclusive explanation as to how it got there. </P>
<P> ``I'm convinced this is a miracle,'' said an elderly woman who traveled more than 300 miles by train from northern Turin to be in Civitavecchia for Good Friday. </P>
<P> Grillo has said he himself saw the statue while it was ooozing blood and that X-rays had shown that there was no hidden internal mechanism which caused the ``bleeding.'' </P>
<P> But recently the prelate has toned down his religous rhetoric. </P>
<P> ``Now is the time for reflection, silence and prayer,'' he said in a statement Thursday. </P>
<P> Blood was first spotted on the statue, bought at a religious shrine in Medjugorje, Bosnia, after its owner Fabio Gregori built a small shrine for it in his garden not far from St. Agostino's church. </P>
<P> Since then there have been reports of at least 10 other ``weeping Madonnas'' in Italy. Sociologists put the spate of reports down to worry about the country's economic and political turmoil. At least one was a hoax. </P>
<P> Friends of the Gregori family, however, say there is no chance that the Civitavecchia statue is a hoax. </P>
<P> ``Fabio and his brothers are not the types to fake something like this. They are good Catholics, hard workers,'' said Giuliano Grosselli, 18, a parish volunteer. </P>
<P> ``For those who have faith, time will prove it,'' he said. </P>
