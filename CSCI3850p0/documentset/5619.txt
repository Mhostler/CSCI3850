<P>  Mexican police arrested a prominent labor leader Sunday on charges of stealing almost $1.5 million from union members at a Mexico City public bus company that was declared bankrupt over the weekend. </P>
<P> Police said they grabbed Ricardo Barco at a restaurant in Mexico City and arrested five other union leaders Saturday who were also implicated in the theft of nine million new pesos ($1.42 million) from former workers deprived of benefits due to them when they left the company. </P>
<P> Barco is the strongman in the union tied to the Ruta 100 public bus company, which was declared bankrupt by Mexico City authorites Saturday. </P>
<P> It is one of the most combative of the so-called independent unions that are not members of the huge, pro-government Confederation of Mexican Workers. </P>
<P> After declaring the bus company bankrupt early Saturday, city authorites hired 1,400 private buses to provide a free service for up to two weeks while a new system is set up for the city of about 20 million people. </P>
<P> The company has been taken over by a syndicate led by the government's public works bank Banobras. It is not yet clear if privatization is one of the options being mulled. </P>
<P> The city government said Sunday that Ruta 100 union members will be offered jobs in the revamped company. </P>
