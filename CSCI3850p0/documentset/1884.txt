<P>  Scores of people, all men of military age, have pitched tents on the Iraqi side of the border with Kuwait but there were no signs they were armed, a U.N. spokesman said early Sunday. </P>
<P> The spokesman for the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observer Mission (UNIKOM), patrolling a border demilitarized zone, said the men erected 16 tents, each with a capacity for five people. </P>
<P> ``They were described to us (by Iraqi officials) as refugees, but they are all men in military age. There are no women, no children, no elderly people. That does raise some suspicion among us,'' the spokesman told Reuters. </P>
<P> ``They are very close to the demilitarized zone. Initially they started building tents inside the zone ... Some Iraqi officials arrived later and ordered them to move a few yards back outside the zone,'' he added. </P>
<P> ``The Iraqi officials said the number of the tent people might reach 20,000. There is no evidence of any arms being carried. We are just keeping our watch. We believe that the number would continue to rise,'' he said. </P>
<P> He said the situation on the border was calm. </P>
<P> The news coincided with reports by Western governments of an Iraqi troop buildup north of the Gulf War border. Diplomats said they did not know whether the two developments were linked. </P>
<P> The diplomats had said Saturday that civilians were pitching hundreds of tents apparently to prepare for an anti-Kuwaiti demonstration just north of the six-mile-wide DMZ. </P>
<P> UNIKOM had sent several of its Bangladeshi peacekeepers to watch the tents from within the zone. </P>
<P> The official Iraqi News Agency reported Friday that stateless Arabs who it said had been expelled from Kuwait had pitched hundreds of tents along the border in protest. </P>
<P> On Wednesday, the Iraqi government said it decided to offer all help possible to tens of thousands of stateless Arabs to camp along Kuwait's borders. </P>
<P> Many stateless Arabs left Kuwait during or soon after the 1990-91 Gulf crisis. Almost none have been allowed back. </P>
<P> Kuwait's community of stateless Arabs numbered about 230,000 before Iraq's invasion but are now estimated at around 120,000. </P>
<P> Kuwaiti officials say most are actually Iraqis who have concealed their nationality to benefit from the extensive economic opportunities and welfare state provisions associated with residence in the emirate. </P>
<P> Iraq has not recognized Kuwait within new borders demarcated by a U.N. commission after the Gulf War. </P>
