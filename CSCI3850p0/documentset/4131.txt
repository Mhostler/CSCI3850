<P>  Cambodia's Khmer Rouge rebel group is weakening as a result of defections that have surged dramatically in recent months, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott said Friday. </P>
<P> Another senior official said the number of defections is at least several thousand soldiers and may be as high as 6,000 soldiers during that period. </P>
<P> Although the Khmer Rouge remains a ``lethally dangerous phenonmenon. ... We do have the impression that as an organization, the Khmer Rouge is weakening,'' Talbott told a news briefing, adding: </P>
<P> ``The most dramatic evidence of that is the fairly dramatic number of defections from the Khmer Rouge over recent months.''  The Khmer Rouge enforced its reign of terror and murder in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, killing more than a million people and imprisoning thousands of others, according to estimates. In the years since then, they have remained alive as a political entity, operating from guerrilla bases in Thailand and the Cambodian countryside. </P>
<P> What is significant is not just the number of Khmer Rouge who are defecting but the number of rebels who are also bringing their families with them, said Talbott, who just returned from a trip to Asia including a stop in Phnom Penh. </P>
<P> ``Now, as the Khmer Rouge shrinks, both in the amount of territory it controls and the number of people it has, it gets increasingly desperate, and in its desperation, is carrying out atrocities, particularly against the villages in that part of Cambodia. So while the overall trend is in the right direction, it is still a terrible problem for the government of Cambodia. No question about that,'' he added. </P>
<P> Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord, who handles Asian policy and accompanied Talbott on his trip, said Cambodian officials put the defection count as high as 6,000 ``but whether that includes militia as well as regular soldiers is not entirely clear.'' </P>
<P> ``But it's obviously several thousand by our own count as well, which is really quite significant, including the fact they're bringing their families,'' he said. </P>
<P> He said the United States is committed to help Cambodia with diplomatic, economic and selective military assistance as part of the Phnom Penh government's effort ``to give their own people a better life and therefore remove any attractiveness of the alternative, as well as to keep the pressure up on the Khmer Rouge.'' </P>
<P> The United States is giving the Cambodia armed forces non-lethal humanitarian aid and has not ruled out future lethal assistance if the military reforms its structure, Talbott said, reiterating a point he made in Cambodia. </P>
<P> He renewed concerns about human and political rights in Cambodia and what he called ``good governance.'' Nevertheless he said he is convinced the country and the government have made ''extraordinary progress'' since a coalition government came to power in 1993. </P>
