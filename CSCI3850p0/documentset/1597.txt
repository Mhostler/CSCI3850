<P>  A senior Church of England clergyman Monday shrugged off revelations that he was convicted of a homosexual act with a farmer 26 years ago, saying he intended to continue as Bishop of Durham. </P>
<P> ``I am much looking forward to planning with my senior staff my future ministry in this diocese,'' Michael Turnbull said in a statement issued from his home near Durham, northeast England. </P>
<P> The News of the World newspaper revealed Sunday that Turnbull was convicted in 1968 of an act of gross indecency with a male farmer in a public lavatory. He was chaplain to the Archbishop of York at the time of the offense. </P>
<P> Turnbull, who is married with three children and holds the fourth most senior post in the Anglican church, is due to be officially enthroned as Bishop of Durham on October 22. </P>
<P> The Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey, the spiritual leader of the world's 70 million Anglicans, and other church leaders said they supported Turnbull and believed his past should be forgotten. </P>
<P> The present Archbishop of York, John Habgood, confirmed the church had been aware of his conviction. </P>
<P> ``I deplore the fact that something that happened 26 years ago is now being publicized long after it had been forgiven and forgotten,'' Habgood said in a statement. </P>
<P> Turnbull has spoken against admitting homosexual priests to the Church of England, saying gay clergymen were ``incompatible'' with the ministry. </P>
<P> Turnbull succeeds David Jenkins, probably the most controversial bishop of recent years, to the Durham post. </P>
<P> Jenkins, who retired in July, denied the existence of a permanent hell and stirred great controversy with his views on the resurrection of Christ and the virgin birth. </P>
