<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  An Australian couple with a taste for adventure were ready to set sail Wednesday for a new home in Antarctica where they plan to spend a year in a cramped hut in what is reputedly the windiest place on Earth. </P>
<P> Don and Margie McIntyre have chosen Commonwealth Bay, where winds rip across the ice at speeds of up to 200 mph, to erect their tiny fibreglass hut in what Don McIntyre says should be ``a pretty interesting experience.'' </P>
<P> ``The biggest challenge will be surviving,'' the former solo round-the-world yachtsman told Reuters from the southern port of Hobart hours before setting sail in the couple's 60-foot yacht, Spirit of Sydney. </P>
<P> ``It (the hut) will be bolted to the ground to stop it blowing away,'' he added. </P>
<P> Commonwealth Bay became legendary in the history of Antarctic endeavor after Australian explorer Douglas Mawson, who called it the ``home of the blizzard,'' spent two years there early this century, surviving a heroic struggle for life. </P>
<P> When the McIntyres are not sheltering from icy gales in their eight-feet by 12-feet hut, they will photograph Mawson's old wooden hut, which still stands in Commonwealth Bay, he said. </P>
<P> The couple, who are sponsored by Telecom New Zealand and the U.S. satellite firm Comsat, also plan to plug into school-based computer networks in the United States, New Zealand and Australia, giving educational updates on their experiences. </P>
<P> ``We are a private expedition which is going there specifically to ... enthuse kids about technology and environmental issues,'' McIntyre said, adding his wife also planned to make teddy bears for a charity auction. </P>
<P> ``She's going to make 50 ... a limited edition,'' he said. </P>
<P> The couple will take more than a ton of food -- enough to last two years if the Spirit of Sydney, which is to be sailed back to Australia by a support crew, fails to penetrate sea ice when it returns to collect them in early 1996. </P>
<P> The McIntyres plan to leave nothing behind when they do leave, not even their own excrement. </P>
<P> ``We will give it to the water board in Sydney to use for their in-land compost program,'' McIntyre said. </P>
