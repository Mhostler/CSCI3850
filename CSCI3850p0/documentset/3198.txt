<P>  Environmental group Greenpeace Wednesday criticized planned safety measures for a cargo of nuclear waste to be shipped from France to Japan in 1995, saying radiation could leak in case of a fire. </P>
<P> French nuclear fuel firm Cogema, planning the shipment from its nuclear reprocessing plant at La Hague in northwestern France, rejected the charges as unfounded. </P>
<P> A report for Greenpeace by American physicist Edwin Lyman of Princeton University said nuclear waste could seep out of special containers if fire broke out at sea and temperatures exceeded 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. </P>
<P> Lyman told a news conference a fire aboard a ship could burn for days and reach such temperatures. His report said it was ``extremely doubtful'' whether international norms for transport of such waste were strict enough. </P>
<P> But Jean-Louis Ricaud, director of reprocessing at Cogema, said that Greenpeace's report contradicted findings of surveys both in France and other countries used in fixing safety standards. </P>
<P> Last year, a Japanese vessel carried to Japan 1.7 metric tons of plutonium refined in France from nuclear waste produced by Japanese power plants. While in transit, many nations on its route barred it from their territorial waters. </P>
<P> The waste to be shipped next year, which includes Caesium 137, is a byproduct of the refinement process that is now being returned to Japan. </P>
<P> The first shipment consists of 28 barrels. To be shipped, the waste is encased in glass and then placed in half-ton stainless steel barrels. </P>
<P> In the next 15 years, about 3,000 barrels of such waste are to be shipped to Japan from plants at La Hague in Normandy and Sellafield in England. </P>
