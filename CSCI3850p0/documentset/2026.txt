<DATELINE>FAIRBANKS, Alaska (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Fingerprint tests showed that human remains found in a gravel pit east of Fairbanks are those of Alaskan Independence Party founder Joe Vogler, who vanished in May 1993, the Alaska State Troopers said Friday. </P>
<P> No dental records were available, so the identification was made with fingerprints taken from Vogler in the 1940s, state troopers said. </P>
<P> Discovery of the remains came after troopers received an anonymous tip. The find, may solve the mystery surrounding Vogler, a feisty political figure who advocated that Alaska become an independent nation. </P>
<P> Vogler's disappearance from his home at age 80 sparked theories among his followers of conspiracies hatched by the National Park Service and other federal agencies with the state government and United Nations. </P>
<P> The remains were identified in laboratory tests after the body was sent to Anchorage for an autopsy, the troopers said. </P>
<P> The condition of the remains -- wrapped in a blue tarp with duct tape -- matched the description given months ago by a convicted thief who confessed to killing Vogler and then recanted, officials said. </P>
<P> Last summer, Manfred West was arrested after he was removed from a burning cabin. He had blown up the cabin and hidden there in what some officials said may have been a suicide attempt. </P>
<P> During a standoff with troopers, West confessed over the telephone to shooting Vogler and burying his body. He said a deal to sell plastic explosives had gone bad. The conversation was broadcast on the police radio, then reprinted in the local newspaper. </P>
<P> Trooper Sgt. Mike Corkill said West, who is jailed on other charges, remains a suspect in the Vogler case. </P>
<P> Vogler's followers, meanwhile, said they still believe a conspiracy felled their leader and that the autopsy should provide clues about the guilty parties. </P>
<P> ``Those remains are going to tell a story. He's going to come out of that hole in the ground on Chena Hot Springs Road pointing at people,'' Lynette Clark, secretary of the Alaskan Independence Party, told the Alaska Public Radio Network. </P>
<P> Born in Kansas, Vogler came to Alaska in 1946 and became a cult figure in the 1970s and 1980s for his ardent opposition to environmental regulations and the creation of national parks and other nature preserves in the largest U.S. state. He ran for governor several times. </P>
