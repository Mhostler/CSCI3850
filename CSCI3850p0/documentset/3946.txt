<P>  China's age-old faith in lucky number eight has made such a comeback that even atheistic communists can't resist, the People's Daily said Wednesday. </P>
<P> In a commentary condemning a broad resurgence of feudal superstitions, the communist mouthpiece warned party members to stick to science and technology. </P>
<P> ``The practice of 'loving eight and hating four' is infecting the whole country ... Even party members join in superstitious practices, which are backed by work-unit leaders,'' it said. </P>
<P> ``Party members are advanced elements, armed with the scientific theory of Marxism. They should certainly not take part in or support any superstitious activities.'' </P>
<P> Car license plates and telephone numbers bearing the number eight fetch high prices, while no one wants the number four. </P>
<P> Eight, pronounced ``ba,'' is a traditional favorite because it rhymes with the word for prosperity, ``fa.'' Likewise only a tonal difference distinguishes the words for four and death, both pronounced ``si.'' </P>
<P> Ironically, superstitious southern Chinese have been paying huge sums to snap up licence plates bearing ``44444,'' which can be pronounced ``five-fours'' or ``wu-si'' in Chinese, which sounds like ``never die.'' </P>
<P> People's Daily said Sept. 18 is widely considered a good day to start a company, open a restaurant or even commit a crime because the numbers ``nine, one, eight'' sound like ``will become prosperous.'' </P>
<P> Number preferences and other traditional practices such as burning paper money for the dead, making offerings to gods and building temples -- all banned as feudalistic under Mao Tsetung -- have flourished under market reforms launched in 1978 by Mao's pragmatic successor, Deng Xiaoping. </P>
<P> Alarmed officials in December ordered authorities across China to promote science and technology education to combat what it called ``pseudo-science,'' superstition and poverty. </P>
