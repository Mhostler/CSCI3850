<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Defensive ace Dennis Rodman made up for teammate David Robinson's miserable shooting with a season-high 22 points Monday to help the San Antonio Spurs to a 97-90 overtime victory over the Los Angeles Lakers. </P>
<P> The Spurs held the Lakers without a field goal in overtime until a meaningless bucket with three seconds left as they claimed a 2-0 lead in their best-of-seven Western Conference semifinal series that now shifts to Los Angeles for two games. </P>
<P> Robinson was a woeful 6-26 from the field but sank a perfect 10-of-10 free throws for 22 points. Rodman, who averaged just 7.1 points per game during the regular season, picked up the slack and shot 10-for-13. The NBA rebounding king also snared 22 boards for the Spurs. </P>
<P> Elden Campbell led Los Angeles with 25 points and 18 rebounds before fouling out with just over a minute left in overtime. </P>
<P> The Lakers had a chance to win in regulation, but Vlade Divac missed two free throws with 4.6 seconds to play. </P>
<P> Rodman fouled out at the end of regulation, but Robinson came alive in overtime. </P>
<P> Campbell gave the Lakers their final lead of the game when he hit one of two free throws to open the extra session, but Sean Elliott drilled a three-pointer to give the Spurs an 86-84 lead with 3:19 to play. </P>
<P> Divac tied it with two free throws 11 seconds later, but San Antonio took the lead for good on J.R. Reid's layup with 2:50 remaining. </P>
<P> After a steal by Doc Rivers, Robinson tipped in his own miss with 1:54 left for a 90-86 lead. Campbell had his shot blocked on the ensuing possession, then committed his sixth foul on Robinson on the other end. Robinson sank both free throws to give the Spurs a 92-86 lead with 1:14 to play. </P>
<P> With the score tied 81-81 with 1:47 left, Divac was fouled and sank both free throws for a two-point lead. The Lakers had a chance to build on the lead after Doc Rivers missed two three-pointers and Elliott missed a wild scoop shot in the lane for the Spurs. </P>
<P> But Robinson, playing with five fouls, made a spectacular block on a layup attempt by Campbell, and Elliott found Rodman underneath the basket for a layup with 26 seconds left to knot the game at 83-83. </P>
<P> The Lakers let the shot clock wind down before letting Divac post up Rodman. Divac drew the foul, Rodman's sixth, with 4.6 seconds left but missed both free throws. </P>
