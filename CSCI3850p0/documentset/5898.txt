<P> SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina - The Bosnian government Thursday shortened Sarajevo's war curfew to give people an extra hour on the city's shattered streets during the lighter summer nights. </P>
<P> The ministry of internal affairs said in a statement carried by the local ONASA agency that the curfew would begin at 11 p.m. instead of 10 p.m., and last as before until 5 a.m. </P>
<P> The curfew is strictly enforced, to the chagrin of the population of a city once famous for its night life. Despite three years of Serb siege, Sarajevo still has thriving bars and restaurants. </P>
<P> Punishment for those caught outside after hours is an uncomfortable night in a cell or a draughty police station corridor. </P>
<P> Sarajevo enjoys long, warm summer evenings but residents said Thursday they doubted they would take advantage of the extra hour to stroll if the sniping and shelling plaguing the city continued. </P>
