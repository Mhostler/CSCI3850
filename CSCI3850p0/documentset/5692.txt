<P>  The U.N. Security Council hopes to vote late Thursday on a resolution allowing Iraq to sell $2 billion dollars worth of oil over six months on a renewable basis, Argentine ambassador Emilio Cardenas, one of the sponsors, said Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``We expect to enact this resolution some time tomorrow, possibly late afternoon,'' he told reporters after meeting Iraqi deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz. Asked whether Iraq had dropped its objections to limited oil sales, Cardenas replied: ``Iraq is always interested. I think that Iraq's attitude is a bit more positive today and I'm very satisfied with the meeting I had this morning with Mr Tareq Aziz.'' </P>
<P> He said he would confer again with the Iraqi minister. </P>
<P> Iraq has been under stringent sanctions since its August 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Although Cardenas did not say so, one reason why it might now be more amenable to limited oil sales is a U.N. report this week that seemed to dash expectations normal oil sales could resume. </P>
<P> The report by the U.N. commission responsible for scrapping Iraq's weapons of mass destruction said Baghdad had failed to account for large quanitities of so-called ``growth media'' that could be used to produce bacteriological weapons. This would scupper any Iraqi hopes that sanctions might soon be lifted and normal oil sales permitted, since that depends on obtaining a clean bill of health from the commission. </P>
<P> The oil sales resolution, sponsored by Argentina, the United States, Britain and Oman, is aimed at enabling Iraq to earn foreign currency to purchase badly needed food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies. </P>
<P> Cardenas said agreement had not yet been reached on how much of the oil sales proceeds would be available to Iraq but he expected the figure to be close to $650 million of each $1 billion. A 30 percent deduction, $300 million of every $1 billion, would be earmarked for a U.N. Gulf war reparations fund and additional deductions would meet other costs stemming from the war. </P>
<P> A monitoring system would ensure that the supplies bought with proceeds from oil sales reached all sections of the Iraqi population. </P>
<P> Confirming the arrangement would be renewable, Cardenas said: ``We don't want a one-shot deal. We are proposing a deal for 180 days, to be reviewed 90 days after becoming effective... If there is cooperation by all parties, we may have a system that will continue after the first 180 days.''  The Security Council approved a proposal in 1991 allowing Iraq to sell $1.6 billion dollars worth of oil over six months, with similar deductions for reparations and other war-related expenses. But Iraq refused to accept the proposal on grounds it would violate its sovereignty. </P>
<P> The new proposal would allow the sale of a larger quantity of oil and the monitoring conditions would be less intrusive. </P>
