<P>  Britons, who pride themselves on their ability to stay polite even when being scathingly insulting, turn into raging monsters behind the wheel of a car, a survey released Monday finds. </P>
<P> More than 60 percent of motorists questioned admitted to suffering ``road rage'' while behind the wheel, although few admitted to acting out temper tantrums publicly. </P>
<P> Aggressive tailgating enraged 62 percent of the 1,700 motorists polled by MORI for the Automobile Association. Headlight flashing caused 59 percent to lose their tempers, while obscene gestures irritated 48 percent. </P>
<P> A ``worrying'' one percent of drivers reported having been physically assaulted by other motorists, the association said. </P>
<P> ``Stress and fatigue turns some drivers into anti-social bullies,'' said the Automobile Association's psychologist, Matthew Joint. ``Road works, congestion and the stress of everyday living turns otherwise mild-mannered motorists into boorish road-hogs.'' </P>
<P> How do drivers respond to this rude treatment? Only six percent admitted to tailgating, although 45 percent said they did flash their lights at annoying motorists. </P>
<P> Women kept their cool no better -- 54 percent of women admitted to aggressive driving, compared with 64 percent of men. </P>
