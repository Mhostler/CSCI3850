<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Federal agents sought Sunday to determine whether a gunman who fired a hail of bullets at the White House was a deranged protester or a potential assassin. </P>
<P> Francisco Martin Duran, a 26-year-old hotel worker from Colorado, is in custody after allegedly pulling a SKS Chinese-made semi-automatic rifle from under his raincoat Saturday and opening fire through the iron fence. </P>
<P> President Clinton was in the White House at the time of the attack but was not in any danger, officials said. But the incident raised fresh questions about the security of the president. </P>
<P> Federal agents were to make an inch-by-inch search for bullets in the grounds of the presidential mansion and also search Duran's truck and home to try to establish whether his motive was assassination, Secret Service Special Agent Carl Meyer said. He said Duran was ``not talking at all.'' </P>
<P> ``There are bullets all along the North Grounds here, in the house, in the trees, in the dirt,'' Meyer said as he took reporters on a tour of the damage. </P>
<P> Duran has been charged as a convicted felon with unlawful possession of a firearm and damaging government property and is to be arraigned Monday. He could be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison on each charge. Meyer said it appeared to be a random shooting, but additional charges could be brought, possibly including one of attempted assassination. </P>
<P> Cooperating in the investigation are the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the Secret Service, which is also an arm of the Treasury. </P>
<P> Treasury Undersecretary Ron Noble called the charges preliminary at a White House news conference. He said the investigation continued but there was currently no evidence of anything beyond that covered in the present charges. </P>
<P> He refused to discuss a report that a suicide note had been found in Duran's car. </P>
<P> The Treasury Department is already reviewing White House security following the crashing of a light plane at the rear of the mansion six weeks ago, and is to report on its findings next January. </P>
<P> President Clinton was on the second floor of the White House when the shooting occurred on a sunny Saturday afternoon, but agents said he was never in any danger. </P>
<P> One bullet hit the mansion near a second-story window above the East Room, another hit under the North Portico and a third struck a wall under the old family dining room. At least five bullets struck the wing that houses the press room, with one traveling through a window and landing in the trim. </P>
<P> The gunfire came from the sidewalk along Pennsylvania Avenue, a main thoroughfare and a favorite spot for tourists to gaze at the White House and pose for pictures. </P>
<P> After apparently emptying his magazine, Duran was wrestled to the ground by passersby and taken into custody. </P>
<P> The incident, along with the deliberate crashing of a plane onto the South Lawn of the White House, underscored the vulnerability of the U.S. president who traditionally seeks to maintain touch with the people by frequent public appearances. </P>
<P> ``We can't have the president operating in a vacuum,'' Meyer said. Clinton often jogs along the streets of Washington and enjoys interacting with crowds. </P>
<P> The Secret Service, the agency that guards the president, would like to close off Pennsylvania Avenue at the White House but such a move would conflict with long-standing traditions. Thousands of tourists troop through the White House daily. </P>
<P> White House adviser George Stephanopolous, said on NBC TV's ``Meet the Press'' program that Clinton would not like sealing off Pennsylvania Avenue. </P>
<P> ``The president has always said that the White House is the people's house,'' he said. ``Obviously we want to be as open as possible.'' </P>
<P> White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta said on CBS-TV's ''Face the Nation'' that the shooting would not change Clinton's plans for a trip to support Democratic election candidates. </P>
<P> Security has been tightened in recent years at the White House and other government buildings in Washington, with the addition of large concrete barriers to prevent suicide bombers driving a truck from crashing into the buildings. However, public pedestrian access remains relatively free. </P>
<P> The president told 3,000 people at an Italian-American dinner Saturday he was watching football on TV when when the sound of the bullets ``blended in with the cheers'' of the game. </P>
<P> A Secret Service spokesman, Dave Adams, said Duran had pleaded guilty on March 21, 1991 to felony assault and related charges and had been dishonorably discharged from the army and sentenced to five years in federal prison. He was released before serving his full sentence. </P>
<P> Duran, of Colorado Springs, served in the army from 1987 to 1991. Neighbors described him as a quiet man. </P>
