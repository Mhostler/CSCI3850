<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Senior U.N. official Rolf Ekeus will visit Iraq Monday for talks on long-term monitoring of its weapons amid a warning from Baghdad that it might halt the process unless sanctions imposed on it are lifted. </P>
<P> Ekeus, chairman of the U.N. Special Commission on Iraq, arrived Sunday in Bahrain, field headquarters of U.N. missions visiting Baghdad, and leaves for Iraq Monday. </P>
<P> Iraq said Saturday it would not allow U.N. monitoring of its arms industry if the crippling U.N. trade embargo imposed on it in 1990 for invading Kuwait was not lifted. </P>
<P> ``The coming two weeks will lead to a decisive stage in the course of the military, political and economic confrontation between Iraq and ... American imperialism,'' Iraq's most influential newspaper said. </P>
<P> ``There will be no future monitoring without lifting of the embargo and no cooperation with the U.N. from one side,'' Babel, published by President Saddam Hussein's eldest son, Uday, said. </P>
<P> Previous Iraqi attempts to stop cooperating with United Nations teams met stern U.N. reaction and threats of military force. </P>
<P> Ekeus has said his commission will need to conduct long-term monitoring of Iraq for at least six months before he can certify to the U.N. Security Council that Baghdad has complied on the weapons destruction, a prerequisite to lifting the oil embargo. </P>
<P> The sanctions have wrecked Iraq's economy, forcing the government to cut food rations by as much as half and pushing up prices of scarce staple foods to unprecedented levels. </P>
<P> The oil industry newsletter Middle East Economic Survey said last week that because of positions taken by Iraq and by the United States, which strongly opposes lifting the sanctions, it appeared unlikely the oil embargo would be lifted by mid-1995. </P>
<P> Dozens of U.N. weapons teams have visited Baghdad to destroy or neutralize Iraq's known nuclear, biological and chemical weapons as well as ballistic missiles, under the 1991 Gulf War cease-fire terms. </P>
<P> They have also laid the groundwork for long-term monitoring by installing video and still cameras and a data processing center to ensure that Iraq does not reacquire those weapons. </P>
<P> The proposed six-month test period to monitor Iraq's weapons industry is expected to start this month but the United States and Britain do not want to set a limit on how long the probation period should run. </P>
<P> French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said Friday that if Iraq recognized Kuwait ``I think we could start looking at a probation period enabling us to verify that the monitoring plans really do work.'' </P>
<P> Washington has said that the oil embargo could only be eased when Iraq showed a pattern of compliance in adhering to many Security council demands, not just weapons criteria. </P>
