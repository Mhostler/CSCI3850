<DATELINE>BRUSSELS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The European Union failed Friday to clinch a deal which would have allowed it to settle a bitter dispute over fishing with Canada. </P>
<P> ``We are unfortunately not in a position to announce complete agreement this evening,'' France's ambassador Pierre de Boissieu told a press conference after a day of discussions. </P>
<P> He said negotiations aborted because there were problems over fixing the amount of Greenland halibut EU trawlers would be allowed to catch off Newfoundland. </P>
<P> There were also problems in turning a bilateral agreement between the EU and Canada into a multilateral accord involving their partners in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) which oversees fishing in the area. </P>
<P> De Boissieu said there would be no more talks this weekend and he did not know when they would resume. </P>
<P> ``The problems of principle are all settled,'' he told reporters after the conference adding that the only problem was the quotas. </P>
<P> Canada maintains that it has had an agreement with the EU since last week and denied Friday that it was involved in the latest talks. </P>
<P> But de Boissieu made clear the EU was still seeking further concessions from Ottawa, telling the news conference that France, as the EU president, had suggested that from the moment an agreement was signed, EU boats should be allowed to catch 5,000 tonnes of Greenland halibut on top of what they have already taken this year. </P>
<P> He said there was also discussion about the quota for 1996 and the following years, but declined to give any figures, saying only that the EU wanted a bigger quota than that proposed by Canada. </P>
<P> ``Some in the EU estimate that our historical right in the zone is 69 percent,'' he said, adding: ``The Canadian government made real concessions on these two suggestions but this was not enough for us to seal an agreement.'' </P>
<P> Canada says catches must be limited in the once-rich fishing grounds if the Greenland halibut, the last commercially viable species in the region, is to survive. </P>
<P> The fishing dispute flared into a full-scale confrontation when Canadian coastguards seized the Spanish trawler Estai in international waters on March 9, accusing it of illegal fishing. </P>
<P> There have been other clashes with Spanish vessels in which nets have been cut. </P>
