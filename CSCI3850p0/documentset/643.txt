<DATELINE>PALE, Bosnia-Herzegovina (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Bosnian Serb leaders Sunday repeated objections to the latest international peace plan and said the authorities were preparing to put the economy on a full war footing after Serbia cut off all ties. </P>
<P> A senior Bosnian Serb leader, Aleksa Buha, said the international community had failed to justify the proposed division of Bosnia as called for under their peace plan. </P>
<P> U.S., Russia and European powers had ``never explained the criteria under which the offered map was drawn up,'' Buha said at a news conference in Pale, outside Sarajevo. </P>
<P> Buha and other Bosnian Serb leaders have stuck by their opposition to the peace deal even after Serbian-led Yugoslavia severed political and economic links last week with rebel Serbs over their failure to endorse the plan. </P>
<P> The peace proposals would give Serbs 49 percent of Bosnia and 51 percent to their Muslim-Croat adversaries. </P>
<P> Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, facing the threat of tighter U.N. sanctions, turned on his proteges in Bosnia and closed the border to Serb-held territory to all shipments except food, medicine and clothing. </P>
<P> Buha said Bosnian Serb authorities were preparing measures to endure Serbia's embargo, ``in the event the blockade of (self-declared) Republic of Srpska is total and lasts a longer time.'' </P>
<P> Momcilo Krajisnik, speaker of the self-declared Bosnian Serb parliament, said Sunday the assembly would meet ``soon'' to appoint a new cabinet to implement measures to compensate for Belgrade's move. </P>
<P> The parliament, based in the Serb stronghold of Pale, selected a new prime minister last month but has yet to select a new cabinet. </P>
<P> Krajisnik, quoted by the Belgrade-based Tanjug news agency, said the government would offer ``new measures adjusted to the new situation'' after Serbia cut off links to the Bosnian Serbs. </P>
<P> ``We do not think we will introduce a state of war, but we will introduce a war economy ...'' he said. </P>
<P> Bosnian Serb chief Radovan Karadzic ordered local authorities Saturday to mobilize a compulsory workforce to include all those of working age due to the blockade imposed by rump Yugoslavia. </P>
