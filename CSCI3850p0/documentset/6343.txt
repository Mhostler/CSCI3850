<DATELINE>POIPET, Cambodia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  More than 50 international peace marchers crossed from Thailand to the Cambodian town of Poipet Sunday to join about 500 Cambodian monks and nuns on a peace march through their troubled country. </P>
<P> The fourth Dhammayeitra Pilgrimage for Peace is scheduled to start Monday despite a spate of attacks by Khmer Rouge guerrillas in the area that have left 15 people dead and more than 30 wounded in the last 10 days. </P>
<P> ``We would like to pray to stop the war and have peace and reconciliation in Cambodia,'' Buddhist monk Maha Ghosananda said in a welcome speech for the international marchers. </P>
<P> Last year one monk and one nun were killed on a similar peace march when the procession was caught in crossfire between Khmer Rouge guerrillas and government troops in northwestern Cambodia. </P>
<P> The marchers arriving here Sunday come as part of an ``Interfaith pilgrimage for peace and life'' which started at the former Nazi death camp in Auschwitz, Poland, and is scheduled to end in Hiroshima in August on the 50th anniversary of the dropping of the atomic bomb there. </P>
<P> ``I have been looking forward to walking in Cambodia since I left Poland,'' said one of the marchers, who gave her name as Ariel from Boston in the United States. </P>
<P> An estimated one million Cambodians died during the three-and-a-half years the Khmer Rouge held power after the radical guerrillas defeated a U.S.-backed government in 1975. </P>
