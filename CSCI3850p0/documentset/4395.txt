<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Luc Robitaille scored four goals Thursday, all of them set up by Jaromir Jagr, as the streaking Pittsburgh Penguins remained the only unbeaten team in the National Hockey League with one of the best starts in history. </P>
<P> The Penguins romped to a 5-2 victory over the Hartford Whalers, extending their season-opening unbeaten streak to 13 games with a remarkable 12-0-1 record. </P>
<P> Jagr leads the league in scoring with 28 points in 13 games, while Robitaille notched his 12th career hat trick with help from the splendid Czech. </P>
<P> Pittsburgh is the first team to start with 12 wins in 13 games and is just two games shy of the record for the best start in NHL history. The 1984-85 Edmonton Oilers hold the record, going their first 15 games without a loss at 12-0-3. </P>
<P> Robitaille opened the scoring 2:31 into the game and made it 2-1 2:50 into the second period. He completed the hat trick at 8:35 of the second and scored number four with 2:52 left in the period. </P>
<P> Ron Francis also assisted on Robitaille's last three goals, giving him a league-leading 18 assists. </P>
<P> ``As for Robitaille, we tell him just to go up to the net and we'll get it to him,'' said Jagr. </P>
<P> ``To play with these guys all you have to do is get open,'' said Robitaille of linemates Jagr and Francis. </P>
<P> Pat Verbeek scored both goals for Hartford. </P>
<P> In Philadelphia, the surprising Quebec Nordiques kept up the torrid pace set by the Penguins in the Northeast Division, staying one point behind Pittsburgh with a 4-2 win over the Flyers. </P>
<P> Owen Nolan scored a pair of first-period goals and Stephane Fiset made 38 saves as the Nordiques recorded their seventh straight victory. </P>
<P> Joe Sakic and Wendel Clark each had a goal and an assist for Quebec, which ran its record to 12-1. </P>
<P> Rod Brind'Amour had a goal and an assist for the Flyers, who had a three-game winning streak halted. </P>
<P> The Flyers turned up the heat in the final period, but Fiset was up to the challenge, making 17 saves as Quebec was outshot 18-3 over the last 20 minutes. </P>
<P> In New York, Benoit Brunet's goal 8:18 into the third period pulled the Montreal Canadiens into a 2-2 tie with the Stanley Cup champion Rangers. </P>
<P> The Rangers carried a 2-1 lead into the third period after Stephane Matteau scored his second goal of the season 2:51 into the second. </P>
<P> But Brunet put a backhand shot past Rangers goalie Mike Richter for the tying goal. </P>
<P> Richter made 33 saves for the Rangers, while Montreal goalie Ron Tugnutt stopped 32 shots in his first start for Montreal. </P>
<P> Craig Conroy notched his first NHL goal to open the scoring for the Canadiens just under five minutes into the game. Mark Messier tied it on a powerplay tally, at 10:26 of the second period. </P>
<P> In Chicago, Sergei Krivokrasov scored a pair of powerplay goals 6:09 apart in the third period to rally the Blackhawks to a 2-2 tie with the Calgary Flames. </P>
<P> The Blackhawks appeared to have won it in overtime, but it was ruled that Krivokrasov kicked the puck into the net and the goal was waived off. </P>
<P> The Flames took a 2-0 lead when Paul Kruse and Theo Fleury scored second-period goals 72 seconds apart. </P>
<P> Calgary goalie Trevor Kidd had shut out the Blackhawks until Krivokrasov scored with 8:11 left in regulation. </P>
