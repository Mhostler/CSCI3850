<P>  President Clinton Wednesday condemned Iran as ``the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism'' and pledged to work to try to contain Tehran. </P>
<P> ``We call upon all our allies to recognize the true nature of Iranian intentions and to help us convince Tehran that we will not tolerate rogue behavior,'' Clinton said. </P>
<P> Clinton made the unusually strong attack against Iran in remarks by satellite hookup from the White House to an international convention in Chicago of the Jewish service organization, B'nai B'rith. </P>
<P> In answer to a question about recent bombings in Argentina, Panama and Britain, Clinton pledged to ``do all that we can'' to bring the perpetrators to justice. </P>
<P> ``Our policy is clear: to weaken and isolate those who reject a more peaceful future for the peoples of the troubled region. The two key obstacles of that future are Iraq and Iran and the radical groups they continue to support,'' he said. </P>
<P> In the case of Iraq, he said, the international consensus for strict sanctions must be maintained. </P>
<P> ``Of equal importance is our effort to contain Iran, the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism,'' Clinton said. </P>
<P> ``We pledge to work with like-minded countries to meet the challenge of Iran's support for terrorist groups, its efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction, and its campaign to subvert moderate regimes that have opted for peace. We must do this,'' he said. </P>
