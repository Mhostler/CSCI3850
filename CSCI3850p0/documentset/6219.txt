<P>  House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole asked President Clinton Tuesday to help them reform the Medicare program, which they must cut to carry out a promise to balance the budget. </P>
<P> ``We would hope the president would be willing after he speaks tomorrow (to a conference on aging) to come to the Capitol, sit down and visit with Republicans and see if we can't work this out,'' said Dole at a joint news conference with Gingrich. Clinton has made it clear he will reject their proposal. </P>
