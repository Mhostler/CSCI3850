<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Clinton's approval rating remains at a pretty low level, but Americans are even less pleased with the performance of Congress, according to a CBS News poll released late Thursday. </P>
<P> The poll, conducted Tuesday and Wednesday, showed that only 22 percent of Americans approve of Congress's performance now, versus 30 percent in the beginning of 1994. </P>
<P> It showed that Clinton's low approval ratings have not changed much lately, with 40 percent approving of his performance this month versus 42 percent approving last month. </P>
<P> The president's disapproval rating has remained constant, at 47 percent, since last month. </P>
<P> And despite the low rating, 57 percent of Americans said they believe Clinton cares about their needs and problems. By 43 percent to 26 percent, they said Clinton cares more about reducing crime than Republicans in Congress do. </P>
<P> On health care, only 22 percent of Americans expect Congress to pass a bill this year and only 33 percent believe most members of Congress are serious about reforming the health care system. </P>
<P> The poll showed that Americans think crime is the most important problem facing the country and that more Americans want the crime bill to pass than want it rejected. </P>
<P> According to the poll, 28 percent of Americans think crime is the most important problem in the country, followed by 21 percent who said health care reform and six percent who said unemployment. </P>
<P> In addition, 42 percent of Americans said they want the crime bill passed, versus 28 percent who rejected it. Of those who want the bill passed, 78 percent support the assault weapons ban contained in the bill, while 19 percent oppose it. </P>
<P> The poll was conducted by telephone among a random sampling of 1,076 Americans. It had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points, meaning results could vary by that much either way. </P>
