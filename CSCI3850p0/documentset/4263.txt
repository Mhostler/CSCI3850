<P>  The United States is set to send its largest and one of its finest teams ever to the Pan American Games in Argentina next month, U.S. officials said Thursday. </P>
<P> More than 1,200 athletes, coaches and support people -- the largest delegation ever sent abroad by the U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC) -- are being assembled for the March 11-26 multi-sport competition in Buenos Aires, Mar Del Plata and Parana, Argentina, U.S. chef de mission Sandra Baldwin said during a teleconference with reporters. </P>
<P> ``We are taking the finest Pan American team we've had'' in many years, Baldwin said. ``We are talking some really wonderful superstars.'' </P>
<P> Despite some initial concerns about the condition of the Buenos Aires stadium where the baseball competition is schedule to be held, USOC officials said they were confident the United States would field a baseball team. </P>
<P> ``I believe they will have it ready and I believe we will have a baseball team there,'' Baldwin said. ``We certainly want to give them every opportunity to have it simply be a safe playing field.'' </P>
<P> U.S. baseball officials had said last week if improvements were not in place by Friday, the United States might pull out of the 10- nation baseball tournament. </P>
<P> ``The infield is just a piece of grass, there is nothing cut out,'' USA Baseball executive director Richard Case said at the time. </P>
<P> A USA Baseball spokesman said on Thursday any decision on sending a team had been delayed until March 1. </P>
<P> Harney, who was in Argentina last week, said, ``At this point we are committed to sending a team.'' </P>
<P> ``They have been putting in a lot of work,'' he said. ``I could see progress from December. </P>
<P> ``I think the biggest concern now is the infield, with the pitcher's mound. But as we had indicated to USA Baseball, it's probably best to let this work out for another two weeks before they were to make any decision, one way or the other to us. But the final decision would come to the U.S. Olympic Committee whether to send a team.'' </P>
<P> While top stars in such sports as athletics may not be present because of the early date, ``you'll probably see about 75 percent of the same (U.S.) athletes in Atlanta'' for the 1996 Olympics, Greg Harney, director of international games preparations for the USOC, said. </P>
<P> ``The date of March, which at one time was thought to be very awkward for our teams to participate, has turned out better in many cases,'' he noted. </P>
<P> ``This will be our best swimming team, with several past Olympians. Cycling, which normally does not send their senior team, will have their best squad there as will the two volleyball teams.'' </P>
<P> The United States also will be sending its best teams in women's basketball, archery, diving, field hockey, shooting and softball, and strong teams in gymnastics and wrestling. </P>
<P> But the timing of the games -- in the collegiate school year -- could affect participants in some sports, including athletics, Harney said. </P>
<P> Men's basketball also will be missing the top U.S. stars because of the National Basketball Association and collegiate seasons. Their replacements will be players from the Continential Basketball Association, a developmental league for the NBA. </P>
