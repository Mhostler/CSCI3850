<P>  Mississippi Gov. Kirk Fordice, who got himself in hot water three years ago by calling America ``a Christian nation,'' defended that view again Tuesday and also called for teaching the existence of God in public schools.  Predicting that Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole will win the Republican presidential nomination, he prophesied as well that if independent Ross Perot runs again in 1996, President Clinton will be re-elected.  Fordice himself is running for re-election, the only Republican incumbent in three races for governor this year. Kentucky and Louisiana are the other governor's races. </P>
<P> He was elected in 1991 as the first Republican in the once-Democratic deep southern stronghold since 1874. </P>
<P> At a luncheon with political reporters, the 61-year-old businessman rekindled an issue that roused a controversy in 1992 at a Republican governors' conference, just when the party was healing its wounds after George Bush lost the presidency, that ''America is a Christian nation.''  ``This is a Christian country,'' he said Tuesday. ``That is not to denigrate anyone else's religion or to run it down in any way because the Constitution ... absolutely forbids that.''  In 1992, when Fordice used the Christian nation phrase, then-South Carolina Gov. Carroll Campbell said ``the value base of this country comes from the Judeo-Christian heritage,'' saying to Fordice he wanted to add ``Judeo.'' But Fordice replied, ``If I wanted to do that, I would have done it.'' </P>
<P> A few days later Fordice apologized to say he was not trying to knock anyone else's religion. </P>
<P> At the luncheon Tuesday, Fordice insisted ``the country was founded by Christian people on Christian principles.'' Jews and other religions disagree vehemently with his view as threatening. </P>
<P> On other hot-button subjects, Fordice said the existence of God should be taught in schools and the wall separating church and state has a door allowing prayer in schools. </P>
<P> Fordice, who has not endorsed a presidential aspirant, thinks Dole will win the nomination. </P>
