<P>  A Clinton administration-backed bill to provide Gulf War syndrome benefits was approved by the House of Representatives Monday along with $15 million for research to try to find out what the disease is. </P>
<P> The House approved the bill by voice vote and sent it to the Senate. </P>
<P> Secretary of Veterans Affairs Jesse Brown asked for the bill, saying he has no legal authority without it to provide benefits to Gulf War veterans suffering from the mystery disease because he is supposed to provide benefits only for known diseases. </P>
<P> The bill would also provide $5 million a year for the next three years for research to try to find out what caused the illness.  More than 700 veterans have reported having the severe flu-like symptoms of the syndrome. Theories on its causes range from the oil fires set by Iraqi forces in Kuwait during the 1991 war to immunizations given U.S. troops for initial protection against gas warfare. </P>
<P> ``The Gulf War may have been the dirtiest war that we ever fought,'' Representative Lane Evans, an Illinois Democrat, said during debate. </P>
<P> Brown has said all possible causes are being studied, including the possibility of some unexplained small exposure to gas warfare agents even though he said there is no evidence that Iraq used chemical war agents against allies. </P>
<P> The bill would also authorize $10 million for each of the next five years for marriage and family counseling for Gulf War veterans and their families. </P>
