<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A federal judge Monday sentenced former Kentucky congressman Carl Perkins to 21 months in prison for bank fraud, lying to federal election officials and signing false financial disclosure statements. </P>
<P> U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth rejected pleas for leniency for Perkins, 40, a Democrat who served in Congress from 1984 to 1993, and gave him the maximum time in jail under the range set by federal sentencing guidelines. </P>
<P> He cited the seriousness of the crimes committed by Perkins and said the former lawmaker had abused his position as a lawyer and public official. </P>
<P> Lamberth said he had been especially disturbed by a remark Perkins made to his ex-wife who had expressed concern over his use of campaign funds for personal trips. ``It's OK. Everyone in Washington does it,'' Perkins was quoted as saying. </P>
<P> The judge also placed Perkins on three years of probation and ordered him to perform 250 hours of community service. </P>
<P> He required Perkins to get any alcohol treatment as deemed necessary by his probation officer after the prosecutor said three people said the former lawmaker previously had a serious alcohol problem. </P>
<P> Perkins pleaded guilty in December to the three criminal charges in a Justice Department investigation stemming from the House bank scandal. </P>
<P> The bank fraud charges involved a check-kiting scheme in 1990 with various financial institutions, including the now- closed House bank. </P>
<P> He also admitted he lied on reports filed in 1989 and 1990 with the Federal Election Commission and made false statements, based on his omission or underreporting of $946,000 in liabilities from his financial disclosure forms. </P>
<P> Perkins served in the state House of Representatatives before his election to fill the unexpired term of his father, the late Carl Perkins, who had held the seat in Congress for 36 years. </P>
<P> In brief remarks before the judge, Perkins said he accepted responsibility for his acts. </P>
<P> His lawyer, Robert Lotz, said Perkins has experienced ``a fall from privilege, a fall from grace'' and was ``entering a hall of shame.'' He added that Perkins ``has to bear the burden of that.'' </P>
<P> He asked the judge to impose a prison sentence at the 15- month, low end of the guideline range for Perkins. ``He's anxious to put his life back together.'' </P>
<P> But Justice Department prosecutor Thomas Eicher said the pattern of illegal conduct warranted severe punishment. </P>
<P> He said a lenient sentence would sent a ``terrible message'' that a former public official could get off ``with a slap on the wrist'' after being caught. </P>
<P> Eicher said a tough sentence might deter any other corrupt lawmakers. </P>
