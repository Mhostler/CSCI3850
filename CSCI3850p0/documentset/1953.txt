<P>  British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd held talks with Kuwaiti leaders Wednesday to signal his government's determination to resist Iraqi threats as a first contingent of British troops arrived in the Persian Gulf state. </P>
<P> ``In moments of difficulty, Britain stands by her friends,'' he told Kuwait's foreign minister Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al- Jaber al-Sabah at an airport welcoming ceremony. </P>
<P> Hurd said the arrival of 200 British marine commandos and the despatch of 12 Tornado fighter aircraft and two warships to the Gulf was a tangible sign of Britain's resolve to deter Iraqi president Saddam Hussein, who massed troops near the border with Kuwait. </P>
<P> ``We have to make sure that the threat that Saddam Hussein has mounted is removed,'' the foreign secretary said. </P>
<P> Hurd, who immediately went into talks with Kuwait's ruler Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah and prime minister Sheikh Saad al-Abdulla al-Sabah, said he would discuss ways to prevent Iraq staging future military deployments in the border area. </P>
<P> Kuwait and the United States are pushing the idea of an exclusion zone for ground troops similar to the no-fly zones imposed over northern and southern Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War when U.S.-led allies ousted Saddam's forces from Kuwait. </P>
<P> Later Wednesday Hurd will hold talks with Secretary of State Warren Christopher and the two men will then address an emergency session of the Gulf Cooperation Council, which groups six Arab states in the region. </P>
<P> They are Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Bahrain. </P>
<P> British officials traveling with Hurd said there was still uncertainty over whether Iraq was pulling back its troops. </P>
<P> Hurd said if Saddam does withdrew ``it will be because of the resolve shown by Kuwait ... and the immediate solidarity of the friends of Kuwait, of which Britain has always been one.'' </P>
<P> Later Wednesday Hurd plans to fly by helicopter to HMS Cornwall, one of the two British warships stationed off Kuwait. Then he will head on to Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Turkey. </P>
