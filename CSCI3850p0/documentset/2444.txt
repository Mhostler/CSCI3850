<P>  Michael Moorer called the punch that ended his short reign as champion sneaky but his trainer said the straight right hand to the nose had been stalking him the entire fight against George Foreman Saturday. </P>
<P> And the possibility that the punch would find him looking the other way had been worrying Moorer's trainer, Teddy Atlas, even when his fighter had been comfortably ahead in the first defense of his World Boxing Association and International Boxing Federation heavyweight titles. </P>
<P> ``I was scared the whole fight,'' Atlas told Reuters on Sunday. ``I yelled at some of the guys in the corner. They were laughing and I told them to be quiet, that it's a long way to go.'' </P>
<P> Inexplicably, the 26-year-old Moorer was moving to his left instead of to his right as Atlas had instructed him throughout training camp and between rounds of Saturday's fight that ended when the 45-year-old Foreman caught Moorer with an anvil of a right hand that knocked him out at two minutes and three seconds of the 10th round. </P>
<P> ``During the fight he was feeling like a champion,'' said Atlas of Moorer, who appeared so confident that he was giving Foreman the sound effects of ``pop, pop, pop'' as he landed his punishing right jab on Foreman's face. </P>
<P> At the end of the ninth round, Atlas was heard in the television broadcast telling Moorer to be careful of Foreman's sneaky right hand. </P>
<P> ``I was saying it even earlier,'' Atlas said. ``I just said he was winning the fight and he was moving the wrong way, moving to the left (toward Foreman's right) and George was looking to land the right. </P>
<P> ``It was just weird that he was moving to his left,'' Atlas said. ``Not that he wanted (to disobey).... I even said, 'Do you understand me?' and he said, 'Yes.''' </P>
<P> Moorer ``wanted to be respected as a man. Maybe he was taking more chances because he wanted to meet Foreman on his terms,'' Atlas said, groping for an explanation of Moorer's failure to follow instructions. </P>
<P> Regardless, the result was that Foreman became the oldest heavyweight champion in history, setting a record that had stood for the 43 years since a 37-year-old Jersey Joe Walcott knocked out Ezzard Charles in the seventh round on July 12, 1951. </P>
<P> Atlas's style of training fighters is to form close bonds with them, to try to understand their psyches as much as their physical attributes. And Atlas from all reports from the Moorer camp and from disinterested observers, had worked especially hard to understand Moorer, whose dominant trait has never been emotional predictability. </P>
<P> Atlas often mentioned in recent months the progress made in shoring up Moorer's self-esteem. </P>
<P> The defeat is ``sad because I'm very proud of Michael and to lose it this way .... He felt proud about himself. He felt like a real champion. I would hate to see that all erased by one punch.'' </P>
<P> Atlas said Moorer, who took 14 stitches to close a cut lip from the knockout punch, said he would take a vacation before deciding whether to continue fighting. </P>
<P> ``He told me he was sorry after the fight and I said 'how can you say you're sorry? You're a person I have to thank. You gave me the title and you say thank you to me?''' </P>
<P> Obviously already working on rebuilding his fallen fighter's self-esteem, Atlas said he told Moorer, ``'You're always gonna be very special to me and you were very special tonight. You didn't know where the freak you were (after being knocked down) and you tried to get up. You were gallant.''' </P>
