<P>  Celebrating their conquest of polio in the Americas, hemispheric health officials Friday stepped up the war on measles and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton announced a new U.S. assistance program. </P>
<P> The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) last year announced it had wiped out polio in the western hemisphere. The World Health Organization this week announced the latest phase in its drive to wipe out the paralyzing disease, like it defeated smallpox. </P>
<P> But measles remains a problem in the Americas, and up to 15 percent of the children who contract the disease before their first birthday die. </P>
<P> In a speech marking World Health Day, Mrs. Clinton announced to the hemisphere's health organization a new five year $20 million grant to PAHO's child health programs, with $8 million earmarked for immunization. </P>
<P> Eradicating measles was a priority set by the first ladies at last December's Summit of the Americas in Miami. </P>
<P> Mrs. Clinton, who just returned from a tour of Asia, chastised anyone who dismisses children's health and education as ``marginal'' issues in the ``province of women'' and said children's well-being was a ``core issue that will determine the future of every one of our nations.'' </P>
<P> ``We must be guided by a desire in our heart to see that all children have the gift of hope in their lives,'' she said. </P>
