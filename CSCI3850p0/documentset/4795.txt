<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Clinton Wednesday barred the government from doing business with companies that permanently replace striking workers in a move welcomed by the labor movement and blasted by Republicans and business groups. </P>
<P> In a private Oval Office ceremony kept out of view of the press, Clinton signed an executive order that declared as a matter of policy that the U.S. government will not purchase goods or services from employers who hire replacement workers. </P>
<P> ``The use of replacement workers results in longer strikes, reduces economic productivity because you use less-experienced workers (and) results in more contentious labor relations,'' said White House spokesman Mike McCurry as justification. </P>
<P> The order would not appear to have a wide impact. While it would apply to about 90 percent of the 28,000 current federal contracts, Labor Secretary Robert Reich estimated that it would affect no more than 19 or 20 per year, based on past trends. </P>
<P> Reich, who said he asked all federal agencies to supply him with a list of their contractors, said the order would promote better labor-management relations in the long run and avoid a deterioration in the quality of goods and services the government buys. </P>
<P> ``We don't want our military fighting forces to have to rely on machines and equipment produced by the industrial equivalent of minor-league replacement players,'' Reich told a news conference. </P>
<P> The order prompted a torrent of criticism by business groups and some Republican congressional leaders, including Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, who charged Clinton with usurping the power of Congress in an effort to build up his support from organized labor. </P>
<P> ``The U.S. Chamber of Commerce will do whatever it takes -- including fighting this in Congress and the courts -- to reverse this outrageous decision,'' said Stephen Bokat, vice president and general counsel of the group. </P>
<P> Rep. William Goodling, R-Pa., who chairs the House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities, and Senate Labor Committee Chairwoman Nancy Kassebaum both said they introduced legislation that would nullify the order. </P>
<P> The order allows Clinton to reach further out to the traditional Democratic base and sets him apart from opposition Republicans, who last year mustered a large enough minority in the Senate to block consideration of a House-passed bill that would have given all strikers the right to go back to their jobs after their disputes are settled. </P>
<P> In recent weeks, Clinton has appealed to the left-tilting wing of the party by defending traditional Democratic social programs from Republican budget-cutters. Clinton must depend on this base for support in his 1996 re-election bid and his effort to head off a potentially disastrous primary challenge from fellow Democrats. </P>
<P> AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland, who witnessed the presidential signing, told reporters afterward that Clinton had taken ``an important step toward some restoration of a measure of fairness and democracy in the workplace.'' </P>
<P> He said labor has a ``good working relationship with the White House'' despite their differences over the North American Free Trade Agreement and the GATT world trade pact. </P>
<P> McCurry said White House counsel Abner Mikva was convinced that Clinton is acting under his authority under federal law to protect the economic interests of U.S. taxpayers and that the only way for the Republican-led Congress to act against it would be to bar the use of federal funds to implement it. Such a bill is pending in a House committee. </P>
<P> He said such an order has precedents from previous presidencies -- including Ronald Reagan's 1981 order firing striking air traffic controllers for violating the ban on walkouts by federal employees. </P>
<P> Under the order, if the secretary of labor determines that a firm with a federal contract worth more than $100,000 has replaced its striking workers since the order was issued, present and future contracts with that firm could be ended. </P>
<P> Reich has been particularly incensed by the use of some 2,300 replacement workers at Japanese-owned tire maker Bridgestone/Firestone, where 4,000 workers are on strike. </P>
<P> Since the order applies only to companies that permanently replace workers from now on, Reich could not terminate the government's contract with the tire-maker but could make the company ineligible for future government contracts. </P>
<P> The order does not affect companies that use temporary replacements to continue operating during strikes. </P>
