<P>  Bosnia's Muslim Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic Thursday renewed his call for the lifting of a United Nations arms embargo on his country, an issue that will soon confront President Clinton. </P>
<P> ``Bosnians should either be protected or else defend themselves,'' Silajdzic said in a speech at an exhibition of photographs of the war in former Yugoslavia. ``Any other option is a position of complicity.'' </P>
<P> The Clinton administration is under pressure from Congress to formally begin pushing the U.N. Security Council on October 15 to lift the embargo if Bosnia's Serbs have not accepted an international peace plan by then. </P>
<P> But key Western European allies and Russia oppose lifting the embargo. Britain and France have said that, if it is lifted, they will withdraw their troops from the U.N. Protection Force in former Yugoslavia. </P>
<P> ``Some people still have problems with Bosnians defending themselves,'' Silajdzic said in off-the-cuff remarks after viewing the exhibition at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. He mentioned no countries by name. </P>
<P> Silajdzic called the war in Bosnia ``a deep wound on the face of humanity'' and, in implied criticizm of the West, recalled the 1938 Munich agreement in which Britain and France allowed Nazi Germany to overrun part of Czechoslovakia. </P>
<P> Silajdzic also took issue with another speaker, Miles Lerman, chairman of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council, who said that Bosnians and Croats had collaborated with the Nazi invaders of Yugoslavia during World War Two. </P>
<P> ``Of the eight fascist offensives (in Yugoslavia), seven failed in Bosnia. So the fascists were mostly defeated in Bosnia, by Bosnians,'' he said to applause. </P>
<P> Silajdzic and Lerman later embraced and shook hands. </P>
<P> The Bosnian Prime Minister is in the United States to attend the U.N. General Assembly and meet U.S. officials. </P>
