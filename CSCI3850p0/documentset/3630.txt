<P>  United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali offered Saturday to resume talks with Iraq on a partial lifting of trade sanctions imposed after the Gulf War. </P>
<P> Boutros-Ghali said he was prepared to resume the talks, which were suspended after Baghdad turned down earlier proposals. </P>
<P> ``I officially make today the same proposal,'' he told France 3 television. ``I am prepared to start again negotiations toward a partial lifting of the embargo,'' he said. </P>
<P> Boutros-Ghali said he had discussed with Iraqi leaders a partial lifting of the embargo in order to create an atmosphere of trust. </P>
<P> ``We had long talks, then they changed their mind at the last minute,'' he said, without specifying which round of talks he was referring to. </P>
<P> Sanctions, including an oil embargo, were imposed on Iraq following its invasion of Kuwait, which was reversed in the 1991 Gulf War. </P>
<P> Iraq has in the past turned down a trial $1.6 billion oil sale because of the intrusive monitoring which included strict U.N. control of the contracts and distribution of humanitarian goods bought with the oil revenues. </P>
<P> The Security Council, which discusses sanctions every two months, is due to review at mid-January Iraq's implementation of U.N. resolutions, including the dismantling of its weapons of mass destruction. </P>
<P> The council has not yet seriously considered easing the sanctions and diplomats expect no attempt to change them until possibly in April, when Russia has given notice it intends to propose a temporary suspension of the oil embargo to allow Iraq to buy badly needed humanitarian goods. </P>
<P> France has advocated a gradual easing of sanctions to reward Baghdad's recognition of Kuwait's borders. </P>
<P> French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe officially received Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz on Friday and announced it was opening a diplomatic toehold in Baghdad, triggering criticism from Washington and London. </P>
