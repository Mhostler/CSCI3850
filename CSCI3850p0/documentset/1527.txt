<P>  Canada may cut the size of its 2,000-member peacekeeping force in the former Yugoslavia to fulfill other peacekeeping roles, Foreign Affairs Minister Andre Ouellet said Wednesday. </P>
<P> Ouellet also said Canada will send about 700 police and military personnel to Haiti to take part in a U.N. mission there. </P>
<P> ``I believe it is possible to sustain our role in the U.N. Protection Force (in the former Yugoslavia), at least in the short run,'' Ouellet said in a speech in parliament. </P>
<P> ``What may prove to be necessary are adjustments in the size or disposition of Canada's contribution at a time when there are other real demands on our peacekeeping forces,'' Ouellet said in the speech on Canada's role in peacekeeping. </P>
<P> He said Canada will play a prominent role in rebuilding democracy in Haiti. </P>
<P> Canada plans to send about 100 Royal Canadian Mounted Police for training and monitoring, and 600 members of the Canadian Armed Forces to support a U.N. mission in Haiti. </P>
<P> One option the government is looking at is to withdraw its 775 troops from strife-torn Bosnia, but leave a peacekeeping force in more stable Croatia, the Toronto Globe and Mail newspaper said Wednesday. </P>
<P> A Canadian Foreign Affairs official told Reuters, ``No decision of that nature has been made.'' </P>
<P> A spokesman for Ouellet said Canada was not alone in taking a second look at its engagements in Bosnia, since a peace agreement there is not as close as was envisaged when the government made a commitment to send in troops. </P>
<P> The Canadian government has been saying for some time that peacekeeping commitments are stretching its resources. </P>
<P> Ouellet said Canada finds it increasingly difficult to sustain its peacekeeping efforts in the former Yugoslavia ''especially at a time when the conflict still rages, when the parties are far from a peaceful settlement, and when the prospect of lifting the arms embargo may compromise the U.N.'s mandate and endanger all peacekeeping forces in the region.'' </P>
<P> Canada is expected to notify the United Nations by the end of the month whether it will maintain its presence in the former Yugoslav republics. </P>
