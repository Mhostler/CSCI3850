<P>  China's dirty and inefficient state enterprises are too busy fighting for economic survival to spend scarce resources on cutting emissions of the gases blamed for global warming, officials said. </P>
<P> With two-thirds of state firms in the red, averting a possible environmental catastrophe in the next century is not high on the priority list of most managers, delegates to a national seminar on greenhouse gases in Beijing said this week. </P>
<P> ``Enterprises are facing hard times,'' engineer Yu Naiyue said in an interview after the seminar. ``The main problem for managers is just the economic running of their enterprises.'' </P>
<P> Industry -- most of it state-owned -- accounts for more than half of China's carbon dioxide emissions, said a report by China's environmental agency presented at the seminar. </P>
<P> Major culprits are small and inefficient coal-burning boilers, furnaces and kilns, the report said. </P>
<P> Scientists say emissions of carbon dioxide, along with other greenhouse gases such as methane, are changing the global climate and could raise the world's temperature by 1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius in the next century, with catastrophic consequences. </P>
<P> Although China is responsible for only 10 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions, breakneck economic development and inevitable growth in emissions is arousing concern. </P>
<P> For hard-pressed factories in China, greenhouse gases and global warming are not an immediate concern, said World Bank energy economist Robert Taylor. </P>
<P> Studies showed improving energy efficiency was an effective way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, he said. </P>
<P> One answer for China's lumbering state enterprises is not merely to replace inefficient boilers but to restructure their entire plant to make them more economically viable and more environmentally friendly, he said. </P>
<P> ``I'm an optimist, I feel they can succeed,'' Taylor said. </P>
<P> Laws against excessive pollution were already focusing managers' attention on improving energy efficiency, said Tan Meijian, an engineer for the Global Environment Facility, which transfers environmental funds and technology from developed to developing nations. </P>
<P> ``Fines harm the interests of the factories, forcing them to think about raising the performance of their products,'' Tan said. </P>
<P> The proportion of China's carbon dioxide emissions put out by state enterprises would fall as the economy developed, said Chen Heping of the State Planning Comission. </P>
<P> Increased production of high value goods meant a more efficient use of energy in manufacturing, Chen said. </P>
<P> Lack of capital was holding back purchase of more efficient equipment from abroad and hindering development of better energy technology, delegates said. </P>
<P> Despite increased state spending on energy saving and carbon dioxide reduction, investment was well short of demand, Chen said. </P>
<P> ``In terms of international standards and reduction of carbon dioxide, investment is severely lacking,'' he said, but gave no figures. ``It's about half of what is needed.'' </P>
