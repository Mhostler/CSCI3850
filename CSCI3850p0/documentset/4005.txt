<P>  France reaffirmed its neutral policy toward Quebec Friday as Jacques Parizeau, separatist premier of the Canadian province, ended a five-day official visit to seek support for independence. </P>
<P> ``The French prime minister (Edouard Balladur) reiterated very clearly the traditional and unchanged position of France, which is a position of non-interference but not of indifference,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Richard Duque said. </P>
<P> ``It is up to Quebeckers to decide what they want,'' he added. </P>
<P> Duque made the statement after a spate of stories in Canadian newspapers that French leaders gave a boost to Parizeau by favoring recognizing Quebec independence if the province voted to split from Canada in a referendum to be held this year. </P>
<P> The issue of diplomatic recognition for a sovereign Quebec would complicate the heated debate in Canada over the legality of the Quebec government's independence plans. </P>
<P> Parizeau, whose visit to France was intended to give momentum to the referendum process, brushed aside the Foreign Ministry's attempts to play down the French leaders' comments. </P>
<P> ``There were some pretty clear statements. I will take them at face value,'' he told a news conference. </P>
<P> Parizeau appealed Thursday to Balladur, the leading contender to succeed President Francois Mitterrand in the April-May election, to advise ``tomorrow's president to approach with sympathy the new country that will appear.'' </P>
<P> In reply, Balladur said: ``The premier (Parizeau) has just made recommendations. I have no doubt they will be followed.'' </P>
<P> Earlier Thursday, Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac, who trails right-wing rival Balladur in the presidential race, said France should be the first to endorse an independent Quebec. </P>
<P> A Canadian embassy spokesman said Friday the Canadian government was ``satisfied with what the French government has said. Their policy has not changed.'' </P>
<P> France has shown a neutral face toward its former possession in recent years. </P>
<P> President Charles de Gaulle's cry of ``Vive le Quebec libre'' (Long live free Quebec) during a trip to Canada in 1967 chilled bilateral relations for nearly two decades. </P>
<P> But Parizeau said the Canadian embassy was in a difficult position. ``In this triangle (France, Quebec, Canada), the postion of France now seems to be quite clear.'' </P>
<P> The Parti Quebecois, which swept to power last September, plans to hold a referendum this year on sovereignty. Quebeckers voted in 1980 under a previous Parti Quebecois government by a margin of 60 percent to 40 percent against independence. </P>
<P> Parizeau plans to put a bill before the provincial legislature declaring the province of seven million a sovereign nation and then put forward the legislation for ratification in a referendum. </P>
<P> Parizeau said that Quebec was embarking on the ``most democratic exercise our society has ever attempted.'' </P>
<P> ``I think the long voyage (to independence) is drawing near a close. We're entering the last stretch surrounded by friends.'' </P>
