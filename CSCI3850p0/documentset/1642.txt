<P>  Top United States and North Korean negotiators met Wednesday for what diplomats said could be a make-or-break attempt to reach a quick accord on reshaping Pyongyang's nuclear program. </P>
<P> U.S. ambassador-at-large Robert Gallucci went to the North Korean mission in Geneva for the talks -- now in their sixth day and hitting what both sides have said are serious problems -- with first deputy foreign minister Kang Sok-ju. </P>
<P> After lengthy discussions Tuesday, the U.S. delegation said there had been ``no progress,'' and the diplomats said there were increasing signs that it would not be possible to wrap up an agreement this week. </P>
<P> Differences at this stage are believed to center on a North Korean demand for a $2 billion cash payment as additional compensation for dismantling its current nuclear energy program and replacing it with outside technology. </P>
<P> But the atmosphere around the talks, which followed an outline accord reached by Gallucci and Kang in August, has been soured by U.S. naval manouevers off the North Korean coast which Pyongyang has denounced as ``military pressure.'' </P>
<P> And in a report Wednesday, South Korea's Defense Ministry accused the North of making preparations for war and said Seoul was strengthening its own posture and improving the ``fighting capability'' of its own and U.S. forces in the South. </P>
