<P>  Romania's gypsy ``emperor'' Iulian Radulescu said he began a hunger strike Friday in protest at the government's decision to label gypsies ``Tigan, a term they consider racist. </P>
<P> Romania last week said it would no longer use ``Romani'' as the official name for gypsies, arguing the word could be confused with Romanian. </P>
<P> ``The government's decision to call us ``Tigan'' forces me to go on hunger strike. This is outrageous racial discrimination,'' Radulescu told Reuters from his ``royal'' residence in Sibiu, Transylvania. </P>
<P> The colloquial Romanian word ``Tigan'' literally translates as gypsies, but Radulescu, one of two self-styled leaders of the Romanian gypsies, said it is a pejorative racist term. Gypsies prefer Romani or ``Rom'' -- literally ``man.'' </P>
<P> There are 400,000 gypsies in Romania, according to the official census, but Radulescu says they number four million. </P>
<P> They are disliked and resented by many Romanians who blame them for most of the country's ills. </P>
<P> ``Tigan is a derogatary word from old Sanskrit for beggar and thief,'' said gypsy politician Petre Burtea, a member of the government's commission for minorities. </P>
<P> Radulesco warned of unrest unless the government revived the old name: ``There are enough of us to turn into a problem if the government won't change its decision and denigrates us.'' </P>
<P> Gypsies have some political clout in Romania and many are wealthy businessmen. </P>
