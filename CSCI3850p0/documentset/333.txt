<P>  Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac said Thursday he will sue a weekly newsmagazine over a cover photograph showing him leaping over a turnstile on the Metro subway. </P>
<P> Chirac ``has decided to sue Le Nouvel Observateur to obtain a symbolic condemnation of what he believes to be a serious violation of press ethics,'' his office said in a statement. </P>
<P> The left-wing weekly's black-and-white cover photo shows a young Chirac vaulting a turnstile. The words ``Cheaters in France'' appear in large yellow letters next to him. </P>
<P> But his office said the picture was taken 18 years ago ``as a joke.'' It was snapped in the presence of Metro and city officials following an equipment breakdown, it said. </P>
<P> Chirac, a presidential hopeful who leads the Gaullist Rally for the Republic party, is suffering from a less than ideal public image in the run-up to elections next May. </P>
<P> The magazine did not identify Chirac as the man on its cover, nor did an accompanying article on French people who cheat mention his name. </P>
<P> The article focuses on the results of a poll on cheating conducted by Le Nouvel Observateur that relied on face-to-face interviews with 1,000 adults. It found that 72 percent believe corruption to be present throughout French society. </P>
<P> It said that about seven percent of the French say they have cheated on their taxes while 12 percent have lied about their age. Nearly one in five have used public transport without buying a ticket while about one in four have parked in spaces reserved for the handicapped. </P>
<P> More than 90 percent consider electoral fraud to be morally reprehensible while 56 percent feel that way about cheating on taxes but just 12 percent would condemn lying about one's age, the survey found. </P>
