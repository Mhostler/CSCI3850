<P>  South Korea's President Kim Young-sam, in another step toward internationalization, named Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hong-koo as his new prime minister Saturday, a presidential spokesman said. </P>
<P> Lee, who is also the unification minister, replaces Lee Yung-dug. </P>
<P> ``The designation was based on the president's belief that Lee would be best suited to lead the nation's efforts for globalization, now a top priority of the government in anticipation of the impending birth of the World Trade Organization,'' the spokesman said. </P>
<P> ``Lee's wide administrative experience, as well as his moral integrity, was taken into consideration,'' he said. </P>
<P> The nomination was submitted to the National Assembly for approval. </P>
<P> The shuffle of jobs had been expected, although not until sometime next week. The reform-minded Kim wanted someone in the prime minister's slot that he felt could aid his push for globalization. </P>
<P> South Korean analysts and the main opposition Democratic Party said Lee was named because Kim trusts his international savvy and expertise on unification issues. </P>
<P> ``Lee has been educated abroad, and he has the international sense. That is what the new cabinet needs,'' said a professor at the prestigious Seoul National University. </P>
<P> After learning of the announcement, Lee told reporters he had ``never expected this.'' </P>
<P> ``But since a government post is not one you choose, you've no choice but to do your best when you're given the chance to serve the public,'' Lee told reporters after his appointment. </P>
<P> Lee, 60, takes his new post nearly seven months after he was appointed deputy prime minister and unification minister. </P>
<P> The newly appointed premier, who once served as a Seoul National University professor, studied at Emory University in Atlanta and receieved a doctorate in political science at Yale University in 1968. </P>
<P> Lee had also served as the unification minister under former president Roh Tae-woo in 1988 before becoming the president's special aide for political affairs. </P>
<P> Since taking office last year, Kim has led a drive to wipe out corruption and elitism among officials. He has repeatedly urged the reorganization of government to keep step with the country's growing internationalization. </P>
<P> News reports said Kim would name a new cabinet sometime next week, which would be led by Lee. </P>
<P> A cabinet reshuffle had been expected since the announcement earlier this month of a major plan to streamline the government by merging key ministries, creating two new administrative bodies and cutting senior posts. </P>
<P> With the reorganization, the most sweeping in three decades, the jobs of two ministers are expected to be eliminated. </P>
