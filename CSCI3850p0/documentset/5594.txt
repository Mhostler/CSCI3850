<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Ga.(Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Curtis Strange, who has not won a tournament since his second consecutive U.S. Open victory in 1989, shot a seven-under-par 67 Saturday to take the early third-round lead in the Masters. </P>
<P> Strange, who started the day with 28 players in front of him, posted a 54-hole total of eight-under 208 that put him atop of the leaderboard as the overnight leaders were faltering. </P>
<P> Only Masters rookie Brian Henninger, who had finished nine holes, was at eight under par along with Strange, who was in his best position in a Masters since 1985, when he tied for second. </P>
<P> Strange, who suffered from a mysterious illiness for several years after his back-to-back Open victories, made nine birdies and two bogeys on a warm, sunny day. </P>
<P> ``If you can't get your heart pumping and your blood flowing at the Masters and the U.S. Open, something is wrong with you,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``I'm full of emotion. This caught me off guard.'' </P>
<P> Augusta National meanwhile caught several of the front runners off guard. </P>
<P> Overnight leader Jay Haas saw his name come off the leaderboard after he double bogeyed the 360-yard third hole and bogeyed the par-three fourth. </P>
<P> John Huston, who stared play just a shot behind Haas, took even less time to play himself off the board. He triple bogeyed the first hole and was four over par after five holes. </P>
<P> Phil Mickelson, who started two shots off the pace, also fell back after going three over in six holes. </P>
<P> Their places were taken by 1992 champion Fred Couples, Australian Steve Elkington and the ageless Raymond Floyd, who Jack Nicklaus said was playing the best golf of his life. </P>
<P> Couples and Elkington were seven under after 11 holes. Floyd, who got to seven under after 10, was at six under with four holes to play. </P>
<P> Ben Crenshaw, the 1984 champion, made the turn at eight under after a steady front nine of eight pars and a birdie. </P>
<P> Briton Nick Faldo, who won back-to-back Masters at the turn of the decade, also made a move as he went to seven under after 13 holes. </P>
<P> Scott Hoch and South African David Frost were also seven to the good after nine holes. </P>
<P> The day got off to an amazing start when the 55-year-old Nicklaus, the first player off, eagled the 435-yard fifth hole for the second time in three days. </P>
<P> ``I don't believe it. It's just wild,'' Nickalus said to the gallery as he walked to the sixth tee -- after safely tucking the ball away for posterity. </P>
<P> It was only the sixth time in 59 Masters that the difficult hole had been eagled and Nicklaus made two of them. </P>
<P> ``I'm amazed there were four others,'' he said, adding that he thought the hole was one of the two hardest on the course. </P>
