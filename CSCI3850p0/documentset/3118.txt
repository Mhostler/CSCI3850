<DATELINE>MUNICH, Germany (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  U.S. Open tennis champion and world number two Andre Agassi was fined $6,000 Saturday for firing a volley of obscenities at the umpire during his losing quarter-final at the Grand Slam Cup. </P>
<P> Agassi swore in the first set of his match against Sweden's Magnus Larsson after a line call went against him, earning a warning for an audible obscenity. </P>
<P> He then swore again in frustration and was penalized a point which cost him his service game and set a discouraged Agassi on his way to losing the match. </P>
<P> The International Tennis Federation (ITF) referee fined him $2,000 for the audible obscenity, and a further $4,000 for verbal abuse. </P>
<P> It could have been worse. Agassi said he had sworn aloud a third time, but the umpire chose to disregard the offense for which the automatic penalty would have been a default and presumably an even stiffer fine. </P>
<P> There was also a $1,000 fine for Goran Ivanisevic for an ill-tempered outburst at the umpire during his winning quarter-final against Boris Becker. </P>
<P> Aside from ruffled pride, the fines will not significantly dent either player's earnings here. </P>
<P> Agassi took home $500,000 including a $250,000 bonus for being U.S. Open champion, and Ivanisevic was assured of $425,000 even if he lost Saturday's semifinal against world number one Pete Sampras. </P>
