<P>  The co-author of California's controversial anti-immigration measure has launched a radio advertising campaign and at the end of two days claimed on Wednesday that he has received more than 300 reports of voter fraud. </P>
<P> Fraud by illegal immigrants in the Nov. 8 elections ``was serious and massive,'' said Howard Ezell, who co-authored Proposition 187, which denies most social benefits to illegal immigrants. </P>
<P> Ezell claimed on Wednesday that his ad campaign launched Tuesday in Sacramento, Los Angeles, San Diego, Fresno and Bakersfield generated hundreds of calls. </P>
<P> ``Our task force is after changing the system of registering and voting in California,'' Ezell added. </P>
<P> Acting Secretary of State Tony Miller has rejected claims of massive voter fraud. </P>
<P> Ezell said he expects Senatorial candidate Michael Huffington, who has refused to concede defeat to Senator Dianne Feinstein, to pick up part of the ad campaign. </P>
<P> Republican Huffington, who spent $28 million of his own money to challenge Feinstein, told CNN's ``Larry King Live'' on Monday that many anti-187 voters registered illegal aliens and brought immigrants into the state for the Nov. 8 vote. </P>
