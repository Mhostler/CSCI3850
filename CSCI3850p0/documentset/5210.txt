<P>  Paul McCartney and Yoko Ono have ended a feud which lasted nearly three decades with a secret joint musical recording, the Sunday Times newspaper said. </P>
<P> Ono, the widow of murdered Beatle John Lennon, and McCartney recorded a song she wrote as a memorial to the dropping of the atomic bomb on Japan 50 years ago, the paper said. </P>
<P> McCartney's wife Linda, three daughters and son accompanied Ono and her son Sean on the recording of ``Hiroshima Sky is Always Blue'' at the former Beatle's studio in southern England this weekend. </P>
<P> The Times said McCartney gave Ono the mastertape to use as she liked, while in exchange she agreed to give him some of Lennon's unfinished songs with permission to use them in new Beatles tracks which will be released at the end of 1995. </P>
<P> McCartney could not be reached for comment Sunday. </P>
<P> The private reconciliation, which took place while Ono and Sean were spending a weekend with Lennon's family, was seen as the final conclusion to the bitter recriminations which followed the breakup of the group from Liverpool. </P>
<P> ``It was a cool way to cement our friendship,'' the paper quoted McCartney as telling a friend after the session. </P>
<P> Ono compared the event to the warring families of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet making peace. </P>
<P> ``Montague and Capulet coming back together was beautiful ...it was a healing for our families to come together in this way. That feeling was very special,'' she told the paper. </P>
