<P>  Canada has less money to spend on foreign aid and will become more picky about which United Nations peacekeeping missions it supports, Foreign Affairs Minister Andre Ouellet said Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``It is clear that every department of government has been asked to trim down and participate in the overall effort to fight our deficit,'' Ouellet said at a news conference outlining Canada's new foreign affairs policy. </P>
<P> The government will focus its efforts on supporting Canadian trade and will try to promote Canadian ``values and our culture,'' Ouellet said. </P>
<P> Canada has built up a huge public debt by running budget deficits but now vows to cut back spending. </P>
<P> The Liberals, brought to power in October 1993 elections, are expected to present a tough budget this month, with broad cuts in all areas of government spending. </P>
<P> Officials say foreign aid will not be spared, and in fact, overseas assistance could be cut by up to 10 percent. </P>
<P> Ouellet refused to give a specific dollar figure on how deep the cuts will go. </P>
<P> In 1990/91 Canada's direct foreign aid had grown to over $3.0 billion Canadian ($2.14 billion U.S.). But that has since fallen. Spending estimates for 1994/95 have dropped to $2.47 billion Canadian ($1.76 billion U.S.). </P>
<P> A large trading nation, Canada is now seeking to turn its foreign efforts to more clearly promote trade. </P>
<P> ``The government is committed to implementing a foreign policy that promotes access of Canadian goods and services to foreign markets,'' Ouellet said in his speech in Parliament. </P>
<P> Canada said it will continue to promote human rights. </P>
<P> Another area where tighter budgets are hurting is Canada's contribution to United Nation's peacekeeping operations. </P>
<P> Canada has been a major contributor to the U.N. peacekeeping missions, but Ouellet said Canada ``cannot be everywhere and do everything; it intends to be selective in its peacekeeping involvement.'' </P>
<P> Ouellet said Canada is studying the creation of a rapid response unit for the U.N. peacekeepers. </P>
<P> He said that a good part of Canada's trade effort will be to promote its ``culture'' in order to widen its influence. </P>
<P> ``The government is committed to defending the competitiveness of our cultural industries and of the educational products and services of our universities and colleges, and to help our artists penetrate foreign markets,'' he said. </P>
<P> The new policy statement was attacked by the opposition Reform Party, which said that the promotion of culture should left to businesses. </P>
