<P>  Team New Zealand chief Peter Blake says if he wins the America's Cup he will ``clean up'' the kind of rules tinkering the Americans have engaged in to Dennis Conner's advantage. </P>
<P> ``If we are fortunate enough to win this event, and we're a long way away from it yet, we're going to clean it up,'' Blake said Friday, a day before his best-of-nine series against Conner was to begin. </P>
<P> ``We're not going to have rules different from one side to the other,'' Blake said. ``That's the only way any fair sporting event should be.'' </P>
<P> Backroom bargaining and new rules interpretations helped Conner, a San Diego hometown hero, survive the defender semifinal round and reach an unusual three-boat final. </P>
<P> Then after he won the defender final in Stars & Stripes, considered the slowest of the three defender boats, Conner was allowed to borrow the yacht Young America from the formerly rival U.S. syndicate PACT 95, which is helping him prepare to use it in the America's Cup finals. </P>
<P> Team New Zealand, by contrast, has been allowed to use only its Black Magic boat tandem, which dominated the challenger trials. </P>
<P> Conner said Thursday: ``The rules were that the rules could be changed by mutual consent of the three teams.'' </P>
<P> Speaking at a news conference and to a small group of reporters afterwards, Blake, a national idol for winning the Whitbread while setting a round-the-world record last year, said if he were to beat Conner and take the Cup home to Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron, things would be fairer. </P>
<P> ``We're going to make it an event where people want their sons and daughters to get involved in sailing because they see they've got a fair sporting chance of getting through and actually winning the America's Cup. </P>
<P> ``And if that means New Zealand only holds it for one time and we lose it, so be it.'' </P>
<P> The only non-Americans ever to win the Cup, the Australian team led by John Bertrand, lost it right back in 1987 in their first time as host, but theirs was the defense Blake would like to emulate. </P>
<P> ``I would like people in the rest of the world to think about the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron in a nice way, like they'd go away saying, wow -- like they did in Fremantle,'' Blake said. ``What a nice feeling was left about that part of the world. </P>
<P> ``It's not happening here, I'm afraid to say. And it should be, the individual people are fantastic to us here, they're really, really nice.'' </P>
<P> Asked who was to blame, the tall, plain-spoken New Zealander said flatly: ``San Diego Yacht Club.'' </P>
<P> But he said the Kiwis were not fazed. </P>
<P> ``We're not put out by it. We realized coming here to San Diego the rules were going to be changed -- they kind of went by the theory, just change the rules and see what you can get away with.'' </P>
<P> He noted the rules for the match-racing for the Cup had only been signed off on this week. ``How ridiculous can you get? How come they weren't agreed to a year ago?'' he asked. </P>
<P> While defenders have always had the rules advantage in America's Cup racing, a number of changes were installed this time around to try to make for a more level playing field, but in Blake's opinion it hasn't worked out that way -- ``Probably the opposite,'' he said. </P>
<P> However, since Conner and crew are having to learn a whole new layout on Young America, Blake said maneuvers that would have come as second nature on a familiar boat might now cost precious seconds. </P>
<P> ``It's quite tough. It's not all wine and roses, you know,'' Blake said, despite Young America's supposed speed advantage over Stars & Stripes. </P>
<P> ``And it isn't a heck of a lot faster, because if it was, the boat would have won probably a lot more races than it did on the racetrack.'' </P>
<P> He said the Kiwis were quite content with Black Magic I. </P>
<P> ``What we have we don't want to change. We've got a boat that covers the whole range of conditions,'' Blake said. </P>
<P> ``We've done everything we think we can do. There's nothing else we know to make it go faster. We're at full noise.'' </P>
<P> If the Kiwis lose, he vowed, they will continue to show the good sportsmanship he espouses. </P>
<P> ``We'll go and shake the hands of the other guys and say you did it better,'' said Blake. ``That's the way it is.'' </P>
