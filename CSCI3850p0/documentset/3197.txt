<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Former Brazilian President Fernando Collor said in an interview published Wednesday that he yearned to return to public life following his Supreme Court acquittal for corruption. </P>
<P> ``I have a great desire to meet the masses again. That is where I feel the best,'' he told the capital's Correio Braziliense daily. </P>
<P> ``My world is being together with the masses. We understand each other; I know we understand each other,'' said Collor, whose acquittal Monday on a single count of passive corruption shocked Brazil. </P>
<P> However, he said he had no immediate plans to return to politics. </P>
<P> ``A lot of people are hoping for my getting involved in politics, but I still have no decision in that respect,'' Collor said in the interview at his Brasilia home. </P>
<P> The high court rejected the charge against Collor, 45, saying prosecutors had not proven he was involved in an alleged multimillion-dollar influence-peddling scheme. </P>
<P> Paulo Cesar Farias, a businessman who became Brazil's main symbol of high-level corruption as the scheme's alleged mastermind, was sentenced by the court late Tuesday to seven years in prison and a $25,000 fine for using fictitious bank accounts. </P>
<P> Three people received sentences of 14 to 16 months for the same charge and one, pilot Jorge Bandeira, was fined $800. The Supreme Court declared four other suspects not guilty. </P>
<P> Collor, a former governor who took office in 1990 vowing to clean up politics and open up the economy, resigned in December 1992 during his Senate impeachment trial on the accusations of corruption. </P>
<P> His resignation amid mass protests was seen as a sign of strength for Brazil's young democracy and a blow against corruption. </P>
<P> The Senate banned Collor from holding public office for eight years and he said in his interview that he had no plans to seek an amnesty from Congress. Legislative allies had said they would try to get one passed. </P>
<P> ``I didn't ask for it and I'm not looking for one. What I asked for and looked for throughout the last two years was justice,'' he said. </P>
<P> Collor said he might move to Sao Paulo and open a consultancy as a way to get involved in politics. </P>
<P> Collor sent telegrams Tuesday to 60 world leaders, including German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Francois Mitterrand, informing them of the aquittal, Jornal do Brasil daily reported. </P>
<P> ``Starting now, I return to the national and international political debate,'' Collor wrote. </P>
<P> Despite the acquittal, Collor could face another legal fight. Attorney General Aristides Junqueira, strongly criticized for his weak case against Collor, is reported to be weighing charging him with embezzlement. </P>
