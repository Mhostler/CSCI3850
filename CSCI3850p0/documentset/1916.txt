<P>  Texas Democratic Reps. Jim Chapman and Bill Sarpalius denied on Monday any wrongdoing regarding a published report that said they are being investigated for their connections to a San Antonio moving company. </P>
<P> ``Absolutely,'' replied Chapman spokesman Bill Mashek when asked if Chapman denied wrongdoing. </P>
<P> Sarpalius also denied violating any law and said he believed the news reports of an investigation, a month before congressional elections, were politically motivated. </P>
<P> In its Monday editions, Roll Call, a newspaper that reports on Congress, quoted a source close to the investigation as saying the FBI was investigating whether Chapman, Sarpalius and a third Texas Democratic congressman, Greg Laughlin, misrepresented honoraria for a 1989 convention in Las Vegas hosted by Sherwood Van Lines Inc. </P>
<P> Laughlin could not be reached for comment but he also denied wrongdoing in statements to the Houston Post. </P>
<P> Roll Call said investigators were also probing whether the officials accepted cut-rate moving services from Sherwood and intervened with the Defense Department on behalf of Sherwood in exchange for gifts. </P>
<P> Chapman and Sarpalius denied those allegations. They also denied published allegations that they received gambling chips at the convention but never reported it. </P>
<P> FBI officials were unavailable for comment. </P>
<P> Mashek said Chapman received a $2,500 honorarium on Dec. 29, 1988, and refunded the $500 excess amount the same day. The congressional honorarium limit at the time was $2,000. </P>
<P> Sarpalius said he has never been been informed he is the target of an investigation. He said he met voluntarily with the Justice Department about six months ago regarding an investigation of Sherwood and cooperated fully. </P>
<P> He said he had failed to report the honorarium for the Las Vegas convention from Sherwood because of a clerical oversight and amended his disclosure report last December. </P>
