<P>  The woman at the center of U.S. investigations into alleged killings in Guatemala called on President Clinton Tuesday to speed up the release of documents and ensure that no U.S. cover-up takes place. </P>
<P> Jennifer Harbury, an American lawyer and widow of a Maya Indian guerrilla leader apparently tortured and killed after his 1992 capture, said declassification delays by U.S. agencies could harm prospects for bringing her husband's killers to justice. </P>
<P> ``The U.S. government, by denying me immediate access to all documentation in this country, is assisting and supporting the obstruction of justice in Guatemala,'' she said in a May 2 letter to Clinton made public Tuesday. She told a news conference that Richard Feinberg, a White House National Security Council staff member, had promised her on March 10 the earliest possible handover of government files on the fate of her husband, Efrain Bamaca Velasquez. </P>
<P> ``The inexplicable delay in delivering to me the agency files in this country is providing a large window of opportunity for the Guatemalan army to destroy files and other evidence and to coerce witnesses,'' she wrote to Clinton. </P>
<P> She complained that alleged foot-dragging by the State and Defense departments, Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, Justice Department and other executive branch units was causing her ``grave and irreparable injury.'' </P>
<P> ``To date, I do not know where, how, or when my husband died, or where he is buried,'' she said. ``If I do not locate his remains immediately, the (Guatemalan) army will have them destroyed and scattered...in order to conceal the forensic evidence.'' </P>
<P> The White House had no immediate comment on the declassification delay. Clinton ordered a government-wide review of U.S. involvement with the Guatemalan military in late March after a congressman alleged that a paid CIA informant was involved in the killing of Bamaca and the 1990 murder of Michael Devine, an American innkeeper in Guatemala. </P>
