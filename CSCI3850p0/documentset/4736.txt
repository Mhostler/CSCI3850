<P>  How and why an unidentified woman was mauled to death in the lion pen at the National Zoo remained a mystery Sunday as police waited for a medical examiner's report. </P>
<P> The woman's mutilated body was found Saturday morning in the outdoor pen at the zoo. Authorities have not been able to say whether her death was a tragic accident or a bizarre suicide attempt. </P>
<P> Initial police reports said there was no evidence of foul play. </P>
<P> WRC-TV, the local NBC affiliate, reported that an autospy was still being completed, but the cause of death was clearly the mauling by the lions. </P>
<P> Zoo spokesman Bob Hoage told the station the exhibit would remain closed and the lions would remain inside for several days. </P>
<P> ``The lions were acting high-strung and skittish,'' Hoage said, adding, ``The zookeepers would like to keep them inside and calm them down for a couple of days until they return to their normal routine.'' </P>
<P> Hoage said the lion pen was designed with several barriers to prevent accidental entry. </P>
<P> The outdoor pen, home to one adult male and one adult female African lion, is surrounded by a three-foot-high, four-foot-wide wall that drops 15 feet into a 25-foot-wide moat, making it unlikely that the woman fell into the pen by accident. </P>
<P> Police are still trying to reach the family of the woman, who carried a driver's license from Little Rock, Ark. </P>
<P> It was the zoo's first mauling death since 1958, when a 2-year-old year girl approached the lions, then kept in a cage, and was pulled through the bars. WRC-TV said. </P>
