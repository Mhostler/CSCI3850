<P>  Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali Wednesday said poor Haitians faced growing malnutrition, medical problems and other hardships, presumably as a result of U.N.-imposed sanctions. </P>
<P> He said there was a sharp increase in prices, an umeployment rate of over 50 percent, persistant malnutrition and increasing medical problems such as diarrhoea, malaria, typhoid, accute respiratory infections and measles. </P>
<P> His report to the Security Council did not directly link the deterioration to the trade embargo imposed on Haiti but said the lack of fuel made distribution of goods difficult. The Security Council first imposed a fuel embargo and then in May tightened sanctions to ban all trade except humanitarian supplies. </P>
<P> Boutros-Ghali said rice production was expected to decrease although a satisfactory rainy season should permit a good harvest of corn and sorghum. But he said ``the situation in the farming sector is expected to remain critical and in most urban center food supply will remain tight.'' </P>
<P> He touched briefly on human rights, saying that after U.N. rights monitors were told to leave this month reports indicated ``a continuation of the abuses being committed against Haitians'' including assaults and killings. </P>
