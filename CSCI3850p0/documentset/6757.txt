<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Billionaire Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri was back in the saddle Monday after a weekend resignation that many Lebanese saw as a staged maneuver to allow him to purge his cabinet of his enemies. </P>
<P> ``I have a feeling it was all prepared in advance and that Syria had a key role to play. It was a pre-packaged exercise,'' a Beirut political analyst said after Hariri's reappointment for a second term. </P>
<P> The 50-year-old billionaire, who took office in October 1992 without political experience, tried but failed to resign last December, complaining of obstruction of his ambitious postwar reconstruction program and opposition within his cabinet. </P>
<P> But he made the mistake that time of announcing his resignation in an apparent fit of pique before visiting Damascus to seek the views of Syrian leaders, who with 35,000 troops in Lebanon are the country's main power brokers. </P>
<P> Hariri was summoned to Damascus for talks with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad and Vice President Abdel-Halim Khaddam and had to back down. He dropped his resignation and returned to carry on in Beirut. </P>
<P> This time Hariri went to Damascus Thursday, spent three hours with Assad, returned to Beirut and announced his resignation Friday. </P>
<P> By Sunday he was nominated for a second term as prime minister and Monday he started consultations on the formation of a new ``consolidated and cohesive cabinet.'' </P>
<P> ``He got something that he wanted for a long time,'' said the analyst, who declined to be identified. </P>
<P> In a country of 17 different religious sects, the composition of Lebanese cabinets usually responds more to the need to represent major political forces than to the prime minister's need for a united team to get the job done. </P>
<P> That was one reason Hariri was exposed in his first 31 months in office to attacks by ministers from inside his cabinet and outside. Reports of shouting matches and bitter personal attacks on Hariri at government sessions have been frequent. </P>
<P> He was also the target of repeated power plays by parliament Speaker Nabih Berri who is keen to show that although he holds the third highest post in the land after Hariri and President Elias Hrawi, he represents the biggest community, the Shiites. </P>
<P> Much of the criticism of Hariri was due to his status as Lebanon's richest businessman, owning banks, real estate companies and construction companies active in the country, with which the law does not require him to sever his ties. </P>
<P> ``There is a clear and definite conflict of interest here which Western democracies would clearly see but here it is taken as a matter of course,'' another political analyst said. </P>
<P> Hariri has publicly said that if there was a law in Lebanon prohibiting officials from buying and doing business he would obey it. </P>
<P> As it is, he believes much of the criticism has been personal and he is ready to purge his opponents. Potential candidates for presidential elections due in November are also expected to depart and up to half the 28 ministers may go. </P>
<P> Syria gave Hariri the green light for the maneuver after refusing to support his demand for parliament to amend the constitution to allow Hrawi's presidential term to be immediately extended without elections scheduled for November. </P>
<P> Hariri has long been pressing for Hrawi's six-year term to be extended, while Berri argued that normal procedures should be followed in November rather than changing the constitution now. </P>
<P> But after winning his battle against immediate extension, Berri said he had nothing against Hrawi getting the nod in November. If that happens, Hariri will have won both the points he was fighting for. </P>
<P> Berri and Hrawi will also have got what they wanted, opening the possibility that Lebanon may be facing a period of increased political stability after months of friction between the three leaders. </P>
