<P>  President Clinton eulogized former Sen. J. William Fulbright Friday as a latter-day Thomas Jefferson who changed America and the world for the better. </P>
<P> ``In the work he did, the words he spoke, the life he lived, Bill Fulbright stood against the 20th century's most destructive forces and fought to advance its brightest hopes,'' Clinton said of his political mentor who died last week at 89. </P>
<P> Speaking at a memorial service at Washington's National Episcopal Cathedral, Clinton said the man known for his fiery opposition to the Vietnam War and the scholarship program that bears his name was ``the heir of Jefferson in our time.'' </P>
<P> ``He believed in the American idea, but he respected others who saw the world differently. He lived with passion, tempered by reason. He loved politics, but cautioned against the arrogance of power. He cherished education as the answer to our common problems, but he knew there would always be more to learn,'' Clinton said. </P>
<P> Fulbright, a silver-haired southern Democrat who served in the Senate from Arkansas from 1944 to 1974, gained international prominence as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. </P>
<P> He became the leading congressional anti-war voice through a series of Senate hearings from 1966 to 1970. </P>
<P> But he once said the accomplishment he prized most was creation of the ``Fulbright Scholars'' program, which uses congressionally-approved funds to help Americans study abroad and bring foreign scholars in the United States. </P>
<P> ``The Fulbright program is a perfect example of Bill Fulbright's faith in different kinds of people learning side-by-side, building what he called a capacity for empathy, a distaste for killing other men and an inclination for peace,'' the president said. </P>
<P> Clinton, who worked on Fulbright's staff when he was a college student, said that ``we owe a lot to Bill Fulbright, some of us more than others.'' </P>
<P> ``Let us all remember the life he lived, and the examples he set ... Thank you, friend, and Godspeed,'' he said. </P>
<P> Fulbright's remains were cremated after he died of a stroke at his Washington home on Feb. 9. His ashes will be interred in Arkansas this weekend. </P>
