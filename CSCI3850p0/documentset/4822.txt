<P>  The Clinton administration is quietly feeling out congressional opinion on amending a nuclear nonproliferation law that has severely restricted U.S. ties with Pakistan, a senior official disclosed Thursday. </P>
<P> The law was invoked in 1990 to bar U.S. aid to Pakistan, long a recipient of American military hardware, because then-President George Bush could not certify to Congress that Pakistan did not possess a nuclear device. </P>
<P> The law, known as the Pressler amendment, after Republican Sen. Larry Pressler of South Dakota, has prevented U.S. cooperation with Pakistan in many areas of benefit to the United States, officials told a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee. </P>
<P> Assistant Secretary of State Robin Raphel said the administration had no specific recommendation on changing the law but ``we have a lot of ideas'' that were being discussed with members of the comitttee and Senate staff. </P>
<P> ``We'd like to continue to do that so that we can come up with something that we all believe would be constructive and useful and broadly acceptable,'' she said. </P>
<P> She said the issue had to be considered in a regional context that included both China and India and the administration wanted to avoid any appearance of undermining the U.S. commitment to nuclear nonproliferation. </P>
<P> ``We're ready, indeed eager, to discuss it further,'' she said. </P>
<P> Early in the Clinton administration officials had proposed repealing the law, but backed off in the face of congressional opposition. </P>
<P> That opposition was affirmed Thursday by former Foreign Relations Chairman Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., who said in a statement: ``I think that when the United States promises to punish a state for going nuclear, we should follow through or risk having our words ring hollow in the future.'' </P>
<P> But subcommittee Chairman Hank Brown, R-Colo., said the current policy appearing to demand that Pakistan row back unilaterally on its nuclear program was in conflict with policy toward India. </P>
<P> Assistant Defense Secretary Joseph Nye said the Pressler amendment had not succeeded in its objectives, and noted that U.S. refusal to deliver F-16 warplanes that Pakistan had already paid for was a sore spot in relations. </P>
<P> Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Robert Einhorn said the law was an ``all or nothing amendment'' that had deprived Washington of a number of foreign policy tools and noted that Pakistan was not prepared to unilaterally roll back its nuclear program to zero. </P>
<P> Raphel said that in both India and Pakistan there was wide public sentiment for the ``nuclear option.'' </P>
<P> Both countries could assemble a limited number of nuclear weapons in a relatively short period of time and were seeking to acquire or develop missiles able to deliver nuclear warheads, Raphel said. </P>
<P> She said the United States and others were concerned about a possible ballistic missile race between India and Pakistan but no one believed war was imminent or likely between the two countries or between India and China. </P>
