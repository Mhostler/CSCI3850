<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The ``terror trial'' of a militant Muslim cleric and his followers could prove to be one of the government's most costly with bills already exceeding $4 million, a legal publication reports in its Thursday edition. </P>
<P> The New York Law Journal points out that the trial is only entering its third month and predictions are it could last another eight. </P>
<P> The daily trade paper based its information on documents obtained from the Administrative Office of U.S. Courts in Washington. </P>
<P> Prosecutors allege that Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman and his followers planned to wage a ``war of urban terrorism'' in this country by planning the fatal World Trade Center blast and plotting the bombing of the United Nations and other landmarks. </P>
<P> They are also accused of the 1990 assassination of radical Rabbi Meir Kahane and plotting to kill Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak during a U.S. visit. </P>
<P> The New York Law Journal said documents show that 23 court-appointed private lawyers who are or have been involved in representing defendants in the case have billed the government $1.9 million since 1993. </P>
<P> In addition defense experts, including translators, private investigators and paralegals have sought $1.2 million in payments. </P>
<P> The New York Law Journal reports, however, that the bills give no hint to the huge prosecution and security costs of the case. The paper said this could mean this will be one of the government's most costly trials. </P>
<P> The court-appointed defense lawyers are provided for under the Criminal Justice Act, which took effect in 1965. It authorizes payment of hourly compensation rates -- in this case $75 an hour -- and out-of pocket expenses for lawyers appointed by the courts to represent criminal defendants. </P>
<P> The lawyers' bills for $1.9 million represent a big chunk of what is paid annually to CJA lawyers in the Southern District of New York, which includes Manhattan. Payments in the past four years were $8.4 million in 1994; $6 million in 1993; $6.1 million in 1992 and $3.5 million in 1991, the paper reports. </P>
<P> The journal said that the top biller among the lawyers is Andrew Patel who sought more than $247,000 for 2,592 hours of work. He is currently representing El Sayyid Nosair, who was acquitted of state charges that he murdered Kahane. He was convicted of lesser weapon and assault charges. </P>
<P> Patel also represented Earl Gant, a minor figure in the case who previously pleaded guilty. </P>
<P> Defense lawyers told the paper that their expenditures ''pale'' compared to the prosecution's expenses that include more than $1 million to informant Emad Salem, who is currently on the stand. </P>
