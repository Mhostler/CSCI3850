<P>  The top U.S. negotiator in talks with China to avert a trade war over intellectual property piracy said Saturday significant progress needed to be made with just hours to go before bruising sanctions go into force. </P>
<P> ``There were meetings that were held last night,'' U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky told reporters. ``There was no progress made.'' </P>
<P> ``If there is going to be agreement there will have to be very significant progress made today,'' she said as she left for a final day of talks at the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. </P>
<P> ``Whether that is possible or not, I can't predict,'' she said. </P>
<P> Chinese and U.S. negotiators have been immersed in last-ditch bargaining since February 14. Meetings stretched late into Friday evening as the clock ticked toward the deadline. </P>
<P> More than $2 billion in tit-for-tat trade sanctions are due to take effect at 0500 GMT Sunday if the two sides fail to reach agreement on preventing counterfeiting of copyrights, trademarks and patents in China, heralding a trade war that would damage both sides. </P>
<P> ``The ball is with the Chinese side,'' one Chinese Foreign Trade Ministry official said privately. </P>
<P> Barshefsky's participation this week marked the shift of the talks into a higher gear. </P>
<P> ``It's not surprising that there are differences in Sino-U.S. trade and economic relations,'' the Xinhua news agency quoted Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi as saying in a Friday meeting with visiting U.S. Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary. </P>
<P> ``What's important is that the controversies should be settled thorugh consultations on an equal footing,'' she said. </P>
<P> She described Sino-U.S. relations as standing at a ``complicated and delicate stage.'' </P>
<P> Diplomats said there were indications the two sides could find an 11th-hour compromise, but did not rule out the possibility that excessively tough U.S. demands and a Chinese desire to save face could sabotage a deal. </P>
<P> On the other side of Beijing, the intellectual property division of the Beijing Intermediate People's Court opened hearings Friday of a case brought by eight U.S. film makers against two Beijing audio-video shops for copyright violations of 18 movies, a court official said. </P>
<P> Universal City Studios, Walt Disney, United Artists, Tristar Pictures, Twentieth Century Fox, Paramount Picture, Time Warner and Columbia Pictures asked the court to confiscate unsold copies of the films and to force the two shops to pay a minimum of 50,000 yuan ($6,000) as fees. </P>
<P> Lawyers for the two Beijing shops said they could not be responsible for copyright infringement for distributing a legal publication produced by legal agencies in the southern boomtown of Shenzhen, local newspapers reported. </P>
<P> The judge adjourned the case until next month, requesting more evidence. </P>
<P> Washington says piracy of U.S. patents, copyrights and trademarks in China costs U.S. industry nearly $1 billion a year and has ordered $1.08 billion in punitive tariffs on Chinese exports from Sunday if no deal is struck. </P>
<P> China has ordered retaliatory measures. </P>
<P> U.S. demands have included an end to copyright and patent violations through tougher law enforcement, creation of anti-piracy strike forces, and quick, impartial court action. </P>
<P> The United States is pressing Beijing to raid 29 plants in southern China alleged to be flooding Asia with pirated laser and compact discs as a down payment toward building a better environment for intellectual-property protection. </P>
<P> China has hailed a crackdown by customs officials since the end of last year and seizures of pirated goods in Guangdong province in the south, where many factories churn out bootleg laser discs, compact discs and computer software. </P>
