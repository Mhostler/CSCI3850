<P>  Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic told the General Assembly Tuesday he would agree to accept a Security Council resolution lifting the arms embargo against his country that would take effect only after a six-month delay. </P>
<P> The leader of Bosnia's Muslim-led government, which has long demanded the immediate lifting of the three-year-old weapons ban, thus confirmed a policy switch already disclosed by other officials. </P>
<P> But he also warned that if his proposal were rejected, Bosnia would call on its friends to work for an immediate, and even unilateral, end to the arms embargo. </P>
<P> While the United States has favored ending the ban, countries such as Britain and France, which have troops serving with the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia, have already made known their opposition to any lifting of the embargo, whether immediately or triggered automatically at a later date. </P>
<P> They fear this would widen the conflict and result in their troops being targeted by the Bosnian Serbs. </P>
<P> Russia, which has historic ties with the Serbs and also troops serving with UNPROFOR, also strongly opposes any lifting of the arms embargo. </P>
<P> ``We would limit our demand for the lifting of the arms embargo only to the adoption of (a) formal decision, while its application, or its consequences, would be deferred to another six months,'' Izetbegovic said. </P>
<P> But, in an addition to his prepared text, he said that if ``for any reason our compromising proposal ... be rejected, we will then seek from our friends that this embargo we lifted immediately and even unilaterally.'' </P>
<P> Izebtegovic, who earlier held meetings with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, added: ``Unfortunately, just today I learned that this compromise proposal is meeting resistance and even rejection from some contact group countries.'' </P>
<P> He was referring to a five-nation group, made up of the United States, Russia, Britain, France and Germany, which drafted a Bosnia peace plan awarding the Bosnian Serbs 49 percent of the territory and the remaining 51 percent to a Muslimm-Croat federation. </P>
<P> The Bosnian government's policy switch would ease the pressure on the United States administration, which had been told by Congress to press the U.N. council to lift the arms embargo if the Bosnian Serbs failed to accept the comntact group's peace plan by October 15. </P>
<P> But European opposition to any automatic lifting of the embargo at a future date means that Washington's basic dilemma remains unresolved. </P>
<P> Izetbegovic also made his agreement to deferral of any lifting of the arms embargo subject to a number of conditions, including implementation of all existing Security Council and General Assembly resolutions on Bosnia, and creation of a 2.5 km (1.5 mile) demilitarized zone on either side of routes north of Sarajevo. </P>
<P> He also said there should be no further easing of saanctions against the rump Yugoslav state comprising Serbia and Montenegro until it recognized Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia within their internationally recognized borders. </P>
<P> Yugoslavia has been the target of broad U.N. sanctions for having supported the Bosnian Serbs. But the Security Council last Friday agreed to lift some of the curbs to reward Belgrade for ending this assistance and allowing international observers to monitor the closing of its borders to the further passage of supplies. </P>
