<DATELINE>AMELIA ISLAND, Fla.(Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Top-seeded Conchita Martinez of Spain cruised through her match with Asa Carlsson of Sweden 6-1, 6-2 Wednesday at the $430,000 Bausch & Lomb Championships. </P>
<P> Also winning a second-round match was third-seeded Magdalena Maleeva of Bulgaria with a 7-5, 6-2 victory over Ruxandra Dragomir of Romania. </P>
<P> Intermittent rain interrupted play throughout the day and a number of matches were played even though it was drizzling. By late afternoon the rain became heavier and second-seeded Gabriela Sabatini's third-round match against fellow Argentine Bettina Fulco-Vilella, scheduled for Wednesday evening, was postponed. </P>
<P> The fourth-ranked Martinez, the reigning Wimbledon champion, is playing iron-clad tennis in 1995. The successful defending champion at last week's event at Hilton Head, South Carolina, Martinez has a 17-4 win-loss record in matches played this year. </P>
<P> Martinez comes on-court with an air of authority that tends to keep opponents at bay. Even having to play the entire second set through a constant spitting rain didn't unnerve Martinez. </P>
<P> ``It's pretty annoying and tough to play when it's rainy and sprinkly during the whole second set,'' Martinez said. ``It changes the conditions and it gets really heavy. It's difficult to move the ball around. It's not very comfortable to play like that, but atleast you can play and finish the match.'' </P>
<P> It took Martinez only 66 minutes to defeat Carlsson in their first career meeting. </P>
<P> Although the 92nd-ranked Carlsson was able to break Martinez in the third game of the first set and the sixth game of the second set, she never seriously threatened her. </P>
<P> The ninth-ranked Maleeva, who won only two games against Martinez in last week's Hilton Head final, went into Wednesday's match with a 1-1 career match record against the 62nd-ranked Dragomir. </P>
<P> Maleeva's one-hour, 24-minute match against Dragomir was interrupted twice by rain showers, including when she was about to serve at 6-5 for the first set. She came back on-court and served out the first set at love. </P>
<P> With a 4-2 lead in the second set, Maleeva won the final two games to take the match. As in the first set, she served out the final game at love. </P>
<P> ``I played really good clay court tennis today,'' Maleeva said. ``I was aggressive, yet patient.'' </P>
