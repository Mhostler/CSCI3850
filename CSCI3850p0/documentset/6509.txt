<DATELINE>CHICAGO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Bulls' superstar Michael Jordan wants to wear his old jersey No. 23 in Friday's playoff game, the team said, despite incurring a fine and the threat of an unspecified penalty against the team at the end of the season. </P>
<P> ``We understand that the commissioner has good and sufficient reasons for not wanting players to change uniform numbers during the season,'' Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf said in a statement. </P>
<P> ``However, it is extremely important to Michael that he be permitted to wear his original number (23), and after decisions with all involved, the Bulls have concluded that we will issue No. 23 to Michael for the balance of the playoffs.'' </P>
<P> The team was fined $25,000 after Chicago's win Wednesday over the Orlando Magic because the club allowed Jordan to switch from the No. 45 he had worn since his abrupt return at the end of the regular season. Jordan was also fined $5,000 for wearing differently-colored shoes from his teammates. </P>
<P> The famed No. 23 jersey had been officially retired by the Bulls after Jordan left the team to pursue a baseball career. </P>
<P> Jordan made the switch after a sub-par performance Monday in Game 2 of the series, which led Magic player Nick Anderson to say that ``No. 45 is nothing like No. 23.'' </P>
<P> Wearing his old familiar 23 Wednesday, Jordan bounced back to score 38 points as Chicago took a 2-1 lead in the series. </P>
<P> The league said Thursday that it would not approve a change in unform number this season and that if the Bulls continued to permit Jordan to appear in a number other than 45 the matter would be dealt with at the end of the season. </P>
<P> Bulls general manager Jerry Krause made it clear that having Jordan happy and performing at his highest level was his chief concern. </P>
<P> ``Personally, I could care less if Michael Jordan shows up in a jock strap,'' Krause said. ``The importance is that he be Michael Jordan and do the things that have to be done.'' </P>
