<P>  Four out of every five women smokers are addicted to nicotine, making it difficult for them to quit the habit, federal health researchers said Thursday. </P>
<P> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said a survey of 7,137 women smokers found that 81.2 percent reported at least one indicator of nicotine addiction, such as feeling dependent on cigarettes, needing more cigarettes to get the same effect, feeling unable to cut back on smoking, or feeling sick when they do. </P>
<P> ``One of the major reasons people fail to quit smoking is the difficulty dealing with withdrawal symptoms,'' said Dr. Michael Eriksen, director of the CDC's Office on Smoking and Health. </P>
<P> The nationwide survey, conducted in 1991 and 1992, found that 35.4 percent of women suffered nicotine withdrawal symptoms when they tried to reduce their smoking. The study included only women and made no comparison with male smokers. </P>
<P> The CDC said that 73 percent of female smokers want to quit, but find it difficult to do so. Even among women who smoked less than six cigarettes a day, over half reported a symptom of nicotine addiction, the agency said. </P>
<P> The CDC estimates that 61,000 women aged 35 or higher died from smoking-related cardiovascular diseases in 1990. It said the risk of a heart attack can be cut in half by not smoking for a year. </P>
<P> ``Women now are more likely to die of lung cancer than breast cancer,'' Eriksen said. ``At the beginning of this century there was virtually no lung cancer in women. Now it's the leading caause of cancer death. It's all attributable to smoking.'' </P>
<P> Despite the health benefits, only 2.5 percent of all smokers quit each year. On a positive note, the CDC reported in November that smoking among women of reproductive age declined from 29 percent to 27 percent between 1987 and 1992. </P>
<P> Knowing the role that nicotine addiction plays in cigarette smoking underscores the value of the proper use of nicotine-replacement patches by women who wish to quit, Eriksen added. </P>
