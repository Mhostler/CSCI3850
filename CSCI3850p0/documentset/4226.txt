<P>  Italy's former prime minister Giulio Andreotti, battling efforts to bring him to trial on Mafia charges, alleged Wednesday that a turncoat had been bribed to incriminate him. </P>
<P> The 76-year-old former Christian Democrat, in an interview with Reuters, also said explosive testimony by two key informers that they had witnessed him meeting Mafia godfathers had been invented in a plot to discredit him. </P>
<P> ``That is not hearsay. That is an invention and someone put them up to it,'' he said, arguing he was being framed by the Mafia for past anti-mob legislation and by political opponents out to sweep away all vestiges of Italy's old governing class. </P>
<P> Andreotti, premier seven times and a powerful force for almost half a century, is accused of having been the Mafia's prime political protector for at least 14 years until 1992 and effectively a full member of the crime organization. </P>
<P> A preliminary court hearing to decide whether the case brought by prosecuting magistrates, based on the evidence of six leading ``pentiti'' (turncoats), should go to trial is due to open in the Sicilian capital Palermo Feb. 17. </P>
<P> ``I say clearly that my lawyer has proof that money was given to one of these characters (turncoats) and not in the form of the official payment to which they are entitled'' under Italy's witness protection scheme, Andreotti said. </P>
<P> Andreotti, speaking at his offices in parliament where he is a life member of the Senate (upper house), refused to identify the turncoat, who made the purported payment or how much money was involved beyond saying it was ``a lot.'' </P>
<P> ``Let me retain a certain reserve,'' he said. ``I love the Italian state, so the less controversy there is over the way the country is administered the happier I am.'' </P>
<P> Andreotti has previously voiced suspicions that turncoats received ``sweeteners'' to testify against him. </P>
<P> But his claim of firm evidence could stoke controversy over the role of turncoats in Italy's battle against organised crime and how investigating magistrates treat them. </P>
