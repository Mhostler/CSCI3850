<P>  Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel has accepted an invitation from the White House to lead the U.S. delegation at ceremonies in Poland marking the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Nazi death camps, a spokesman for the World Jewish Congress said on Monday. </P>
<P> Wiesel, a survivor of Auschwitz, where more than one million Jews were murdered by the Nazis during World War Two, will attend an official Polish government ceremony at the camp Thursday and a separate Jewish memorial Friday. </P>
<P> Polish President Lech Walesa is hosting the ceremonies, involving camp survivors, Nobel peace Prize winners and representatives of 26 countries, 50 years after the Soviet Army liberated the camps on Jan. 27, 1945. </P>
<P> An estimated 1.5 million people were killed at Auschwitz-Birkenau, about 90 percent of them Jews brought from all over Europe. Six million Jews were killed by the Nazi German forces during the Holocaust. </P>
<P> The announcement last week that Wiesel would attend the Polish ceremony appeared to end a dispute between Wiesel and the WJC on the one hand and the Polish organising commission on the other over whether the Kaddish, the Jewish prayer for the dead, would be recited. </P>
