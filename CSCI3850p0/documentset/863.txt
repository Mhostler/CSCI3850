<P>  Police Thursday detained five people who attended a far-right party in the east German town of Cottbus to commemorate the death of Hitler's deputy Rudolf Hess. </P>
<P> The five were accused of inciting racial hatred and glorifying violence, a police spokesman said. </P>
<P> Police seized swastika stickers, a far right-wing newspaper and tapes of extremist songs. </P>
<P> Last weekend, far-right radicals failed in their attempt to stage rallies in Germany in memory of Hess, who became a cult figure for neo-Nazi extremists after killing himself in Berlin's Spandau prison in August 1987. </P>
<P> Planned rallies were banned in several cities and police went on the alert to stop extremists from holding rallies elsewhere. A small group of right-wingers held a brief demonstration in Luxembourg. </P>
