<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A car bomb exploded in the Beirut bastion of the militant pro-Iranian Hizbollah group Wednesday, killing three people including the brother of Lebanon's most wanted kidnapper. </P>
<P> The blast in the Bir al-Abed district of Beirut's Shiite Muslim suburbs shattered Lebanon's longest period of calm in two decades. Eleven people were injured in the explosion, which occurred in a shopping area. </P>
<P> Hizbollah (Party of God) sources said Fuad Moughniyeh, a 30-year-old district security official of the fundamentalist movement, was one of three people killed. </P>
<P> Moughniyeh's brother Imad, a high-ranking Hizbollah security officer, is believed to have masterminded many of the hostage-takings that made Beirut the kidnap capital of the world during the 1980s. </P>
<P> He is suspected of kidnapping several Westerners including Associated Press correspondent Terry Anderson, British Anglican envoy Terry Waite and Thomas Sutherland, Dean of Agriculture at the American University of Beirut. </P>
<P> Hizbollah, which is waging guerrilla war on Israeli troops occupying a border strip in south Lebanon, accused Israel of the bombing and said it would retaliate with ``special operations.'' </P>
<P> The blast followed recent Israeli threats against Hizbollah whose fighters killed two Israeli soldiers in fighting on Monday. Nineteen Israeli soldiers have been killed in the south this year. </P>
<P> ``Israel resorts to such heinous attacks, sowing death and destruction among civilians, after reaching a state of despair in the face of our guerrillas in south Lebanon,'' the head of Hizbollah's politburo, Haj Hussein al-Khalil, told Reuters. </P>
<P> ``The resistance will retaliate against the enemy and teach it a lesson ... through special operations,'' Khalil added. </P>
<P> Military prosecutor Khaled Hammoud said the car bomb packed with more than 100 pounds of TNT. </P>
<P> It left a crater in the street, hurled the car onto the roof of a gasoline station, wrecked two other cars, damaged buildings and brought electricity and telephone wires down into the quagmire of mud in the street. </P>
