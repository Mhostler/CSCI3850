<P>  At last report Ski Captain's Japanese handlers were not going make him run blindfolded in the Kentucky Derby Saturday. </P>
<P> That may be one of the few handicaps that the gray colt is not being asked to endure. </P>
<P> All Ski Captain's owner and trainer are asking is that he win perhaps the world's most prestigious thoroughbred racing event just two days after a gruelling 17-hour trip from Japan, after racing only four times in his young life, never having run for money on a dirt track. </P>
<P> And -- hang on old Ski -- your jockey has never ridden at Churchill Downs, let alone in the Kentucky Derby. </P>
<P> Ski Captain, looking a bit thin around the ribs, stepped off his van Thursday and was confronted by a phalanx of reporters, photographers and onlookers herded against a fence by cautious guards not wanting the colt to be spooked. </P>
<P> But the mottled, silver-gray colt, already saddled and looking spiffy with his red halter and bright yellow saddle blanket, hardly could be expected to be rattled after his ordeal, which included a two-hour layover in Chicago and another flight to Louisville. </P>
<P> In the eyes of at least one trainer, Ski Captain's handlers deserves an award for sheer effrontry to 121-years of Kentucky Derbys. </P>
<P> ``This is THE race and you can't take it lightly,'' trainer Nick Zito, winner of two of the last four Derbys, said earlier this week. ``You have to have your horse prepared. </P>
<P> ``You can't approach this race just like any other race.'' </P>
<P> But Ski Captain's owner Zenya Yoshida and his trainer Yutaka Take only smile when asked about giving Japan's first Kentucky Derby horse so many handicaps. </P>
<P> ``The only thing we have worried about was losing condition on this trip, but he travelled well,'' said Yoshida, adding that Ski Captain, a 12-1 longshot as part of a six-horse mutuel field, was thriving on a special diet of English oats. </P>
<P> ``This horse is very suitable to the distance'' Yoshida said of the 1 1/4 miles Ski Captain will run against 18 horses. </P>
<P> Of course Ski Captain, who drew a dreaded outside 17th post position, has never run that far in a race. </P>
<P> Yoshida said he was fulfilling a lifelong dream of his late father by racing in the Derby. But long-time racing observers could not remember a colt coming from so far away so late in Derby week. </P>
<P> ``They did not feel it would be good for the horse to get here too early,'' said Ski Captain's jockey, Yutaka Take. </P>
<P> Yoshida said the experimental training of having his horses run up ``about a 3.5 percent grade'' makes them stronger. </P>
<P> Asked whom he sees as the horse to beat Saturday, Yoshida heartedly laughed and said, ``everybody,'' adding that Ski Captain would not try to set the pace or look for a special spot before making his move. </P>
<P> ``This horse runs by himself.'' </P>
