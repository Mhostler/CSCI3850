<P>  Rolf Ekeus, the head of a U.N. commission in charge of Iraqi disarmament, Tuesday hinted that his work might go beyond April in completing current weapons destruction operations in Iraq. </P>
<P> Ekeus at one time estimated it would take six months for him to complete a long-term monitoring program, which began in October, and then make a recommendation which would allow the Security Council to lift the oil embargo against Iraq. </P>
<P> But in past months he has been non-commital and Tuesday he indicated that his work could go beyond April. </P>
<P> ``Iraq in the autumn stopped providing us with necessary information,'' he said in answer to a question on the six-month estimate. </P>
<P> ``This delayed things and forced us to ring alarm bells.'' He was referring to his report last month pointing out missing data on past arms programs. </P>
<P> Ekeus spoke to reporters after briefing council members behind closed doors. He said he was satisfied with progress on the long-term monitoring program to make sure Iraq does not reacquire nuclear, chemical, biological and ballistic weapons.  But he said he was still searching for data on past programs, particularly on chemical and biological arms. </P>
<P> Ekeus said he was currently in discussions with an Iraqi technical team, now in New York, on the past data but added, ''I don't see that there is any radical addition but there is improvement on what we had before.'' </P>
<P> Ekeus's analysis of past weapons programs and his setting up of a long-term monitoring project are crucial in determining when the ban on Iraqi oil exports is eased. </P>
<P> A key 1991 Gulf War cease-fire resolution ties destruction of weapons to lifting exports from Iraq while other demands are tied to imports to Iraq. </P>
<P> The United States, however, is at loggerheads with several other Security Council members, such as France and Russia, believing Iraq must show its peaceful intentions by fulfilling a series of resolutions, not just weapons demands. </P>
<P> To prove its point, U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright circulated evidence Tuesday that Iraq still retained some 9,000 pieces of military equipment, plus thousands of civilian items, stolen from Kuwait during the Gulf War. </P>
<P> The equipment included missile launchers and armored personnel carriers used by Iraq in a military buildup which threatened Kuwait last October. </P>
<P> Tuesday's session was in advance of a closed-door council meeting Thursday to review Iraqi sanctions, an exercise the council schedules every 60 days and which will again result in no action, diplomats said. </P>
