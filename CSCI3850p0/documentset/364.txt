<DATELINE>PARIS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  France, rejecting a United Nations appeal for its troops to remain in southwestern Rwanda, said Saturday soldiers would stay in Goma in Zaire to help the refugees who had fled there. </P>
<P> On a visit to Goma, French junior Health Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy meanwhile made an impassioned plea for an international mobilization ``to stop refugee camps becoming death camps.'' </P>
<P> ``It is horrible, undescribable because there are bodies, 8,000 bodies in the last 48 hours. I traveled down a road in a two-hour interval and on the way back there were 500 more bodies. People walk and fall down,'' he told France 2 television. </P>
<P> ``There are only the French here. That's not normal. The international community must do something if we are to stop these refugee camps becoming death camps.'' </P>
<P> The head of the U.N. refugee agency has urged France to extend its humanitarian military intervention in Rwanda beyond an August 22 deadline if no replacement is ready in time. </P>
<P> Sadako Ogata, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), told the daily Liberation that a gap between the French leaving and new forces arriving would prompt ``a new disaster.'' </P>
<P> Ogata said Prime Minister Edouard Balladur had asked her agency to extend its operations into Rwanda as soon as possible. </P>
<P> ``In return, I said stabilizing the situation in the country was crucial for humanitarian efforts. I also told him the French army should stay in place as long as necessary, until some sort of replacement is established,'' she said. </P>
<P> President Francois Mitterrand, a driving force behind the original decision to send troops, gave a guarded response when asked about Washington and U.N. appeals for them to stay on. </P>
<P> ``I will have the opportunity to discuss this with the government,'' he told reporters on leaving a Paris hospital following prostate surgery. </P>
<P> Mitterrand said he had spoken about Rwanda with President Clinton at great length during the recent Group of Seven summit of leading industrialized countries in Naples. </P>
<P> ``I dearly want to thank him because I have heard that he decided massive help would be given to the unhappy people who are subjected to suffering and death,'' he said. </P>
<P> Asked about Ogata's appeal, an official said France would stick by its decision to pull out troops from a French-declared safe area in Rwanda by the time its U.N. mandate expired. </P>
<P> ``The disaster will be avoided if the U.N. peacekeepers who are due to replace us arrive in time,'' the official said. </P>
<P> ``We have succeeded in our aim which was to make our area safe, where people can remain. The humanitarian part of our operation in Zaire will continue and we will fly in more food and medical supplies.'' </P>
<P> After the U.N. mandate expired, French troops would enter the safe zone only to guard relief convoys if requested to do so, the official said. </P>
<P> France, which sent 2,500 troops to Zaire and a U.N.-backed safe area in southwestern Rwanda, has repeatedly said it will start withdrawing them later this month. </P>
