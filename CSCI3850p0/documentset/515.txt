<P>  American B-52 bombers will blast the Kuwaiti desert Tuesday to mark the fourth anniversary of Iraq's invasion and show Washington's determination to prevent a repetition. </P>
<P> Residents have been told not to be worried by the noise, the first time the small emirate will have heard thunderous aerial bombing since the 1991 Gulf War. </P>
<P> It will be the first participation by the giant Boeing Stratofortresses in a series of U.S.-Kuwait joint exercises that have been held regularly since the emirate's 1991 liberation. </P>
<P> The series is designed to show Washington's commitment to the emirate's security, provide desert training to U.S. forces and help improve Kuwaiti military skills. </P>
<P> A U.S. official said about four B-52s refuelling in mid-air would fly non-stop from a base in the United States, bomb a target area near Adera range some 30 miles northwest of Kuwait City and fly straight back to the United States. </P>
<P> Kuwaiti and U.S. land forces also plan a live firing exercise at the same time, the U.S. official said. </P>
<P> A Kuwaiti military spokesman said he expected a lot of noise from the exercises but declined to say what would produce it. </P>
<P> ``If the wind is from the north, then noise from the exercise might carry into Kuwait City. Everyone knows it is disaster day (the invasion anniversary) and if people hear the noise they just might think it means trouble.'' </P>
<P> ``We are telling them that it is just a military exercise and please do not be scared.'' </P>
<P> The Kuwaiti official said he had no details about U.S. air operations and referrred queries to U.S. officials. </P>
<P> The land exercises, involving about 1,500 troops and an unspecified number of Kuwaitis, will continue for 12 days. </P>
<P> The armies of the two countries have held dozens of military exercises since the war. Kuwait has also held war games with the armed forces of France, Britain, Russia and Italy. </P>
<P> Iraq invaded Kuwait on August 2, 1990 and annexed its former ally after months of disputes over financial aid and ownership of border oilfields. A U.S.-led alliance advancing from bases in Saudi Arabia expelled Iraqi troops in February, 1991. </P>
