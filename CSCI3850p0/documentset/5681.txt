<DATELINE>BELFAST, April 12 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Britain said on Wednesday it is withdrawing 400 more troops from Northern Ireland because the formerly war-torn province has been at peace for seven months. </P>
<P> It is the second major troop reduction since Irish republican and rival pro-British Protestant guerrillas began a ceasefire after 25 years of bitter conflict. </P>
<P> Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew said: ``This decision, which represents a further welcome step towards normality in Northern Ireland, has been take solely on the basis of security advice, and can be quickly reversed should the situation require it.'' </P>
<P> He said an artillery unit would return to its base in Germany within two weeks but could return at short notice if needed. Mayhew said the decision had been taken against the background of ``the improved security situation.'' </P>
<P> Britain withdrew 400 troops last month and soldiers no longer patrol in most cities and towns of the British-ruled province. The latest decision will cut the number of British troops in Northern Ireland to 17,500. </P>
<P> Life has been transformed in the province, with trade increasing and tourist numbers growing. </P>
<P> But hardline Protestant politician, Peter Robinson, of the Democratic Unionist Party, condemned Wednesday's decision, saying Britain was appeasing the IRA (Irish Republican Army.) </P>
<P> The guerrilla group's political wing, Sinn Fein, countered, saying all British troops should be recalled to barracks pending their complete withdrawal from the province. </P>
<P> Violence in the province claimed more than 3,200 lives until the illegal IRA ended an ``armed struggle'' against British rule last September. The Protestant guerrillas agreed to put away their guns a month later. </P>
<P> The early fragile peace has strengthened and the political representatives of the former warring factions are in exploratory talks with Britain. </P>
<P> But peace talks between Britain and Sinn Fein have bogged down over London's reluctance to allow ministers to talk to the republicans before the IRA gives specific assurances over its weapons caches. </P>
