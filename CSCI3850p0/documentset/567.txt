<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Bangladesh feminist writer Taslima Nasrin ended two months of hiding from extremist Muslim death threats to appear in High Court Thursday, where she was granted bail on a charge of insulting Islam. </P>
<P> Nasrin, looking pale and worried, entered the courtroom flanked by an army of lawyers headed by former foreign minister Dr Kamal Hossain, witnesses said. </P>
<P> ``I was afraid of surrendering because of the death threat. I can say nothing more,'' Nasrin told Reuters at the courthouse. </P>
<P> Nasrin left court quickly after bail was granted. She rushed to her Dhaka residence, met her mother and left in a private car. </P>
<P> ``We don't know where she has gone now,'' a police officer said outside her apartment. </P>
<P> Family members declined to disclose her destination, saying she still feared for her safety. </P>
<P> ``The government will do whatever necessary to protect Nasrin,'' Attorney General Aminul Huq said. </P>
<P> Nasrin had been in hiding since June 4 after the government ordered her arrest for insulting Muslim feelings by telling India's Statesman newspaper that Islam's holy book, the Koran, should be ``revised thoroughly.'' </P>
<P> Nasrin later said she was misquoted. The newspaper stood by its report. </P>
<P> The comments by Nasrin, a physician-turned-writer, provoked Muslim fury. Islamic militants offered cash rewards for her death. </P>
<P> Nasrin appeared in court at the request of judges after Hossain, her chief attorney, moved a bail petition for her. </P>
<P> ``The petitioner never uttered any words of the kind alleged nor had any intention whatsoever to injure the religious feelings of any person,'' the petition said. </P>
<P> ``If the words mistakenly ascribed to her have caused injury to religious feelings of any person the petitioner regrets this and is genuinely sorry.'' </P>
<P> Huq, the government's chief lawyer, did not oppose the bail petition. </P>
<P> ``In Bangladesh women are always granted bail. Nasrin is a woman and she should be granted bail,'' he said. </P>
<P> Police and political analysts said they were not immediately sure if her submission would be enough to pacify her foes. </P>
<P> ``This is too early to comment,'' said a leader of the ultra-rightist Jamaat-e-Islami party. </P>
<P> ``We are relieved by the news of Nasrin getting bail, at least for the moment,'' an Asian diplomat said. But he said more time would be needed to ``get a full feel of the exact circumstances.'' </P>
<P> A Dhaka Magistrate Court had set an August 4 deadline for Nasrin to give herself up or be arrested. If not, her property would have been forfeited and charges formally laid in her absence. </P>
<P> The High Court, in granting Nasrin's bail, said she must appear before the magistrate's court ``in person or through a lawyer.'' </P>
<P> If convicted on the charges she could be jailed for up to two years, law officials said. </P>
