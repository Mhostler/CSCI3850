<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A U.N. crime conference called Sunday for tighter cooperation on extradition to fight what it called the twin threat of organized crime and terrorism. </P>
<P> Delegates to a U.N. Conference on Crime Prevention and Treatment of Offenders approved a draft resolution urging states to ``enhance international cooperation...for the sake of combating terrorist crimes and transnational organized crime.'' </P>
<P> The non-binding resolution overshadowed the remaining agenda for international cooperation in fighting transnational crime, which delegates rattled off in Sunday's plenary session with little argument. </P>
<P> The resolution, jointly sponsored by Turkey and hosts Egypt, called for sharing of information to help extradition of members of groups who use ``proceeds of...organized crime for financing terrorism.'' </P>
<P> Egypt has for years sought easier extradition of exiles it says are linked to the Gama'a al-Islamiya (Islamic Group), the largest militant group fighting the government. </P>
<P> But its attempt to put the spotlight on links between organized crime and terrorism upset some delegations, including South Africa and Iran, who said it risked confusing terrorism with legitimate armed struggle for self-determination. </P>
<P> Syria proposed that the resolution should define terrorism, as distinct from liberation struggles of ``peoples under the yoke of colonial and racial regimes.'' </P>
<P> Iran, Sudan, Iraq and Lebanon, citing Palestinian and Lebanese armed struggle against Israel, supported the Syrian proposal, but the conference declined to insert it in the text. </P>
<P> Egyptian Minister of Interior Hassan al-Alfi, asked if his country would now press harder for extradition of its exiled opponents, said the resolution ``will ease communication and bilateral agreements amongst countries where those people are, so they can be handed over for their sentences to be carried out, or to be put to trial.'' </P>
<P> In other resolutions the conference called for updating legislation to keep up with new forms of crime, such as computer crime and crimes against the environment, and approved calls for greater regulation of firearms. </P>
<P> The conference also urged moves to eliminate violence against children and women, though Muslim delegates upset women campaigners by deleting references to marital rape. </P>
<P> Conference Executive Secretary Eudardo Vetere told reporters it was too early to judge if the meeting, which concludes Monday with a formal session, was successful. </P>
<P> ``The litmus test of what we are doing is not how many resolutions we pass...but whether people will live in better conditions, with less crime and more justice.'' </P>
