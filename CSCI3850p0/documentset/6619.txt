<P>  Conservative Jacques Chirac was inaugurated Wednesday as the fifth president of France's Fifth Republic, assuming leadership for a seven-year term from Socialist Francois Mitterrand who ended a record 14 years as head of state. </P>
<P> The president of the Constitutional Council proclaimed Chirac elected and he was handed the chain of office in a ceremony at the Elysee presidential palace. A 21-gun salute was fired at the nearby tomb of the Emperor Napoleon. </P>
<P> Chirac, 62, was prime minister from 1974 to 1976 and again from 1986 to 1988 and served as mayor of Paris for the past 18 years until his resignation Tuesday. He won the presidency on his third try May 7, defeating Socialist Lionel Jospin. </P>
<P> Chirac had a one-hour handover meeting with Mitterrand before his ceremonial inauguration. </P>
<P> The outgoing president briefed him on France's state secrets and gave him the launch codes for the nation's nuclear strike force before leaving the presidential palace as an ordinary citizen. </P>
<P> Chirac pledged in his inaugural address to restore France's social cohesion and fight unemployment. </P>
<P> ``France is an old country but it is also a young, enthusiastic nation ready to give the best of itself if only it is shown a horizon and not narrow, closed walls,'' he declared. </P>
<P> The new Gaullist president promised a better balance between the executive, legislature and judiciary, saying he would be an arbiter and guide, leaving the government to conduct policy and putting more means at the disposal of an independent judiciary. </P>
<P> Chirac said Mitterrand had left his mark on France in his 14 years in office and added, ``I would like the French people at the end of my term to notice that the change they hoped for has been achieved.'' </P>
<P> He began the day by flying to the grave of his political mentor, Gen. Charles de Gaulle. </P>
