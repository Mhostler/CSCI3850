<P>  Talks on ending Ireland's month-old political crisis stalled Thursday when a left-right ``Rainbow Coalition'' of parties failed to agree on who should take what cabinet seats, political sources said. </P>
<P> The talks were adjourned just hours before parliament had been expected to elect Fine Gael leader John Bruton as the new prime minister. </P>
<P> But the crisis looked set to linger with caretaker prime minister Albert Reynolds left at the helm on the first anniversary of an Anglo-Irish declaration that paved the way to peace in Northern Ireland after a 25-year guerrilla conflict. </P>
<P> Reynolds resigned Nov. 17 in a legal dispute over the handling of a child abuse case. </P>
<P> Wednesday night, the three members of the potential new government -- Fine Gael, Labor and Democratic Left -- had all separately ratified a policy program drawn up during more than 100 hours of weekend talks. </P>
<P> Bruton, Labour's Dick Spring and Proinsias de Rossa of Democratic Left had all confidently forecast that the cabinet posts could be agreed upon. </P>
<P> But overnight talks apparently failed to solve the ministerial impasse. Eight had been expected to go to Fine Gael, five to Labor and two to the Progressive Democrats. </P>
<P> After leaving the stalled discussions, Proinsias de Rossa said he was still prepared to back Bruton for the post of prime minister. </P>
<P> But if that failed to happen, Ireland would be then plunged into a New Year election. </P>
<P> All parties are eager to avoid an election for fear that it could stall the delicate peace process in Northern Ireland where Republican and Protestant foes have both called cease-fires and the war-weary province faces its best chance of peace. </P>
