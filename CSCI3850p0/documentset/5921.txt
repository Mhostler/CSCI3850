<DATELINE>PARIS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Foreign policy has barely figured in France's presidential campaign but victory for conservative favorite Jacques Chirac would make Paris more assertive in Europe and reassure old Arab and African allies, diplomats say. </P>
<P> There were few differences in the foreign policy platforms that Chirac, his fellow conservative rival Edouard Balladur and Socialist contender Lionel Jospin set out during the campaign. </P>
<P> All three endorsed a single European Union currency, although only Balladur said France should work to achieve it by 1997. The other two said that 1999, the later of two dates set in the Maastricht treaty, was more realistic. </P>
<P> And all three pledged to build on the strategic partnership with Germany that has been the axis of French foreign policy for three decades. </P>
<P> ``The difference is not so much in what they say as in their instincts towards Europe,'' an EU diplomat said. ``Chirac is instinctively an assertive France-first nationalist, Balladur is a cautious, pragmatist. Only Jospin is an enthusiast.'' </P>
<P> But opinion polls suggest Jospin has virtually no chance of succeeding Socialist President Francois Mitterrand, the last in a generation of fervently pro-European leaders. </P>
<P> Other prominent pro-Europeans, former European Commission chief Jacques Delors, ex-president Valery Giscard d'Estaing and former prime minister Raymond Barre, decided against entering the presidential race. </P>
<P> Bosnia briefly became a campaign issue when two French U.N. peacekeepers were shot dead by snipers in Sarajevo last weekend. </P>
<P> True to their characters, Chirac demanded that U.N. forces be empowered to shoot back, Balladur threatened to withdraw them and Jospin called for more diplomatic pressure on the Serbs. </P>
<P> Among France's European neighbors, only Britain is likely to have cause for celebration of a Chirac victory. </P>
<P> Prime Minister John Major praised the anti-federalist view of the EU's future that Balladur outlined in the newspaper Le Monde last year so warmly that he embarrassed its author. </P>
<P> Both Balladur and Chirac propose restricting the powers of the Brussels commission and the European parliament and giving more authority to the council of EU member states. </P>
<P> Chirac said recently his aim would be to reconcile the British position, opposed to any further EU integration, with Germany's support for a much more integrated, federal system. </P>
<P> ``Chirac is an old-style Gaullist. He may give the British trouble on agriculture and fisheries, as he did when he was prime minister, but he has an instinctive respect for Britain as an old nation,'' another European diplomat said. </P>
<P> The Paris mayor counts among his supporters both Philippe Seguin, leader of the referendum campaign against the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, and pro-Europeans such as Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and Enterprise Minister Alain Madelin. </P>
<P> German policy-makers have made clear they would prefer to deal with Juppe as prime minister and would be worried by a Chirac-Balladur run-off in which Seguin might emerge as Chirac's key asset and a potential premier. </P>
<P> However National Assembly speaker Seguin sought to reassure the Germans this week, saying he accepted a single EU currency and pledging that Chirac would seek agreement with Bonn before changing economic policy to give priority to creating jobs. </P>
<P> In the Middle East, diplomats say Arab states, including Iraq, which have traditionally benefited from Gaullist rule, would welcome a Chirac victory. </P>
<P> The Foreign Ministry received anxious Arab inquiries after Balladur said in an interview with a Jewish newspaper last month that the Jews had ``a little bit more'' of a right to Jerusalem than did other religions. </P>
<P> Chirac has close personal ties with many African leaders and counts among his advisers Jacques Foccart, long-time Gaullist kingmaker on the continent. </P>
