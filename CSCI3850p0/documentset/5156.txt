<DATELINE>UNIONDALE, N.Y. (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  With Tommy Soderstrom in the net Thursday, the New York Islanders needed just one goal to end their five-game losing streak and extend the misery of the reeling New York Rangers. </P>
<P> Soderstrom made 37 saves, including a game-saver in the closing seconds, and Steve Thomas scored midway through the third period to give the Islanders 1-0 victory over their hated local rivals. </P>
<P> Thomas converted a rebound of a Bob Beers shot to cap a 4-on-2 break at 10:05 of the third period, as the Islanders handed the slumping Stanley Cup champions their fifth straight loss. </P>
<P> The Rangers have been shut out three times this season after going through all of last season without getting blanked. They have just seven goals during the losing streak. </P>
<P> ``Tommy was outstanding. It was the best game I saw him play,'' Thomas said of the Islander goaltender, who notched his eighth career shutout. </P>
<P> ``We all know Tommy (Soderstrom) stole the game,'' said Islanders coach Lorne Henning, whose team was otherwise outplayed. </P>
<P> Soderstrom made 30 saves in the first two periods, when the Islanders managed just nine shots on goal. He made a key save on Rangers captain Mark Messier shortly before Thomas broke the scoreless tie with his seventh goal of the season. </P>
<P> As the final seconds ticked off with the Rangers swarming the Islanders' net, Soderstrom robbed Brian Leetch to preserve the victory. </P>
<P> In Dallas, Kevin Hatcher broke a 1-1 tie with a powerplay goal in the second period as the Stars extended their home unbeaten streak to seven games with a 2-1 win over the Edmonton Oilers. </P>
<P> With Edmonton's Kelly Buchberger in the penalty box for tripping, Hatcher's wrist shot from the right point got through a crowd and beat Oilers goalie Bill Ranford. </P>
<P> Mike Stapleton had opened the scoring for Edmonton with just over four minutes left in the first period. The Stars, who improved to 5-0-2 in their last seven home games, tied it when Mike Donnelly scored with 39 seconds left in the first. </P>
<P> Dallas goalie Andy Moog made 32 saves, including 12 in the third period. </P>
<P> With 12 seconds remaining, an altercation began when a fan threw a cup of beer onto Edmonton's bench. The trainer pointed out the fan to security and Oilers defenseman Kelly Buchberger squirted him with a water bottle. </P>
<P> More cups of beer rained down on the bench and players began climbing the glass. Some members of the crowd came back at the players but security was able to control the situation. </P>
<P> ``It's not a situation you want to happen but I'm glad we stuck together as a team,'' Oilers coach George Burnett said. </P>
<P> In Vancouver, Bernie Nicholls snapped a tie with his 20th goal and Ed Belfour made 23 saves to lift the surging Chicago Blackhawks to a 3-1 victory over the Canucks. </P>
<P> Tony Amonte had a goal and an assist and Jeremy Roenick set up a pair of goals for Chicago, which won its fourth straight. Patrick Poulin had the Blackhawks' insurance tally. </P>
<P> Gino Odjick scored the lone goal for the Canucks, who lost for the third time this season to the Blackhawks. </P>
<P> In San Jose, Steve Rucchin scored twice and Bobby Dollas had a goal and two assists to lead the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim to a 6-3 win over the Sharks. </P>
<P> Valeri Karpov added a goal and an assist for the Ducks, who won for just the second time in their last nine games. </P>
<P> Chris Tancill had a goal and an assist for the Sharks, who lost for the seventh straight time at home. The Sharks are 1-6 in their last seven games overall. </P>
<P> Stephan Lebeau and Joe Sacco scored Anaheim's other goals while Viktor Kozlov and Pat Falloon also tallied for San Jose. </P>
<P> Anaheim is 2-0 against the Sharks this season after San Jose won all six meetings last season. </P>
