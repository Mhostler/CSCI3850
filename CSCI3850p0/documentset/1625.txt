<P>  If the entire U.S. population stopped drinking alcohol, there would be an additional 81,000 deaths from heart disease every year, researchers said Tuesday. </P>
<P> That figure can be balanced against more than 100,000 people who die each year from alcohol-related causes, the article in the Journal of the American Medical Association said. </P>
<P> Moderate alcohol consumption increases the levels of a key enzyme in the bloodstream that unclogs blood clots, said Paul Ridker of the Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston in a study released Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``Prohibition did not work in the 1920s,'' Ridker wrote. ''Generalized messages to abstain from alcohol are probably no more responsible than generalized recommendations to drink it. </P>
<P> ``Since alcohol will continue to be available, the physician has the key role in ensuring that its well-documented detrimental effects are minimized, allowing the remainder of the adult population to receive its cardiac 'protective benefits','' he wrote. </P>
<P> The scientists encouraged physicians to use data and common sense to provide patients with the proper solution to this ''apparent conundrum.'' </P>
<P> By studying 631 male physicians randomly selected from a larger health study, the researchers found an association between moderate alcohol consumption and the body's production of plasminogen activator (t-PA antigen), which plays a central role in preventing thrombosis, or chronic internal blood clotting. </P>
<P> ``The highest levels of endogenous (produced in the body) t-PA antigen were found among daily consumers of alcohol and the lowest levels of t-PA-antigen were found among rare or never consumers of alcohol,'' the study said. </P>
<P> By extending the figures to the entire population, the researchers estimated nearly 81,000 additional deaths from coronary heart disease would occur each year if every American stopped drinking entirely. </P>
<P> Previous studies have found that moderate drinking also causes favorable increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, the beneficial type of cholesterol. In addition, it may help explain why the heavy wine drinking population of France has such a low rate of heart disease. </P>
