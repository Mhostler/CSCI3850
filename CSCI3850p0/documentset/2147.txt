<P>  The former mayor of the French riviera city of Nice, Jacques Medecin, will be extradited to France in the next two weeks to face trial on corruption charges, Uruguay's top judge said Thursday. </P>
<P> ``The delay for the extradition ... could be between 10 and 15 days,'' Head Justice Luis Alberto Torello told Reuters after the Supreme Court upheld a lower tribunal's ruling that Medecin should be sent home. </P>
<P> The flamboyant former mayor, wanted on charges of corruption and fraud, fled Nice four years ago. </P>
<P> He moved into a seaside mansion in Uruguay's Atlantic resort of Punta del Este -- the summer playground for the rich and powerful of neighboring Argentina, some of whom posed with an arm around him for local gossip magazines. </P>
<P> Medecin, 66, was arrested by Uruguayan police last November after French prosecutors issued an international warrant for him. </P>
<P> The former Nice mayor said at the time he wanted to stay in Uruguay forever. </P>
<P> ``I want to stay here for the rest of my life. Everybody is so nice -- businessmen, people on the street,'' he told local media. </P>
