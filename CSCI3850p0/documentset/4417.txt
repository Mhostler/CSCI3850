<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Mayor Marion Barry plans to eliminate millions of dollars worth of services for the homeless, the elderly, children and the poor in reponse to the city's budget crisis, the Washington Post reported Saturday. </P>
<P> Quoting unidentified administration sources, the newspaper said Barry also planned to lay off an additional 500 workers. </P>
<P> The mayor, who faces a projected budget shortfall of $722 million this year, would cut deeply into social programs through steps such as forcing heroin addicts to pay for methadone treatment and cutting the city's grant to the Special Olympics for mentally retarded children, according to the Post. </P>
<P> The report said municipal services for homebound senior citizens were being cut by as much as 50 percent, the working poor who relied on city-subsidized day care would have to pay more, residents of halfway houses would get two meals a day instead of three, and the stipend paid to poor families to help with burial assistance was being reduced. </P>
<P> The cuts were supposed to total $224 million but still fell far short of solving the city's financial problems, the Post said. </P>
