<DATELINE>PORTAGE, Wis., (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Jeffrey Dahmer, who confessed to murdering 17 young men and boys in a 13-year orgy of dismemberment, necrophilia and cannibalism, was murdered in prison Monday while cleaning a toilet, prison officials said. </P>
<P> Officials at the Columbia Correctional Institution said Dahmer died of massive head injuries while en route to a hospital. </P>
<P> A prison statement said Dahmer was killed while cleaning a toilet and shower in a receation area of the maximum security prison. A second inmate, convicted murderer Jesse Anderson, was also attacked but survived. </P>
<P> Further details were not immediately available. </P>
<P> Dahmer had been serving 15 life terms at the prison in central Wisconsin where he was taken in 1992. </P>
<P> He survived an attempt on his life earlier this year at the hands of a fellow inmate who attacked him with a sharpened toothbrush in the prison chapel. </P>
<P> Dahmer's arrest in July 1991 led to revelations of a 13-year crime spree that shocked the world. </P>
<P> Police entering the then 31-year-old candy factory worker's foul-smelling apartment in Milwaukee found his only food was a bag of potato chips, while in the refrigerator was the preserved head of one of his 17 victims. A kettle hid human hands and genitals. </P>
<P> Dahmer lured his victims away from gay bars, drugged their drinks and then killed and dismembered them, using body parts for sex and cannibalism. </P>
<P> Dahmer had admitted killing 17 people and based his defense on an insanity plea, but that was rejected by the jury hearing the case. </P>
<P> A judge sentenced him to 15 life terms. </P>
<P> At his trial Dahmer attempted to apologize saying: ``I know society will never be able to forgive me. I know the families of the victims will never be able to forgive me for what I've done. </P>
<P> ``I promise I will pray every day to ask for their forgiveness ... I have seen their tears and if I could give my life right now to bring their loved ones back I would do it.'' </P>
<P> Dahmer's lawyer, Gerald Boyle, depicted him during the trial as a man possessed by lust and the devil. </P>
<P> ``He became enamored, overwhelmed, caught up in the character in the (horror movie) 'Exorcist III.' The character was Satan because he was the personification of evil,'' Boyle said. </P>
<P> Dahmer was baptized in May of this year in the prison gymnasium through the efforts of a woman who had sent him letters and a Bible. </P>
<P> In a television interview in February of last year Dahmer said he would kill again if given a chance. </P>
