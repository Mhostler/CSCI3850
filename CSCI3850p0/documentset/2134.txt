<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Outgoing Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy launched a landmark reorganization of the government's third largest department Thursday that will cut thousands of jobs and shut down hundreds of USDA offices across the country. </P>
<P> ``Through this reorganization we will save taxpayers $3.6 billion and improve service to our many diverse customers,'' Espy said in remarks prepared for the ceremony at which he was to sign orders implementing the widespread reform. </P>
<P> Signed into law last week by President Clinton, the reorganization will cut the number of Agriculture Department agencies by fourteen, reduce staff by up to 11,000 over five years and eliminate some 1,100 field offices across the United States. </P>
<P> To better reflect the six major mission areas of the department, Espy named six new undersecretary positions including for the first time an Undersecretary for Food Safety. </P>
<P> Michael Taylor, currently head of the controversial Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), was named Undersecretary for Food Safety. </P>
<P> Under the new structure food safety issues will be separate from the agency's marketing activities. Recently there has been sharp criticism of the FSIS's dual responsibilities of both regulating and promoting an industry. </P>
<P> The new undersecretaries have to be confirmed by the Senate. </P>
<P> Espy, the target of an ethics investigation by an independent counsel, announced Oct. 4 that he would resign effective Dec. 31. </P>
<P> The former three-term congressman from Mississippi has repeatedly denied breaking any laws, but in announcing his resignation he said he had been careless and apologized to Clinton and his staff members. </P>
<P> The Justice Department earlier this year began probing charges that Espy broke the federal meat inspection law, which bars anyone involved in meat inspection from accepting anything of value from meat processing firms. </P>
<P> In August, the department said it had evidence that Espy accepted gifts from Tyson Foods in May 1993 and January 1994 amounting to ``at least several hundred dollars in value.'' </P>
<P> The agency's investigation also said Espy may have received gifts from ``organizations and individuals with business pending before the Department of Agriculture.'' </P>
