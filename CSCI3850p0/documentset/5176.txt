<DATELINE>BONN, Germany (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Germany's main opposition parties accused the government Friday of clumsiness in arranging its commemoration of the end of World War II in Europe and of slighting Warsaw by not inviting a Polish leader. </P>
<P> The Social Democrats (SPD) said Chancellor Helmut Kohl was wrong to invite only the leaders of the United States, Britain, France and Russia to the May 8 ceremonies in Berlin marking the 50th anniversary of the war's end. </P>
<P> Poland, as the first country to be invaded by Adolf Hitler's Wehrmacht in 1939, had also sought to be invited to Germany's official anniversary event. </P>
<P> ``If we in Germany celebrate the end of the war and the beginning of peace, then we should invite our friends and partners, especially those who were invaded by Germany in the past,'' SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping told ARD Television. </P>
<P> ``I have the impression that Kohl has...stomped around like a bull in a china shop. It is an affront, especially to Poland, and I think it must be corrected as quickly as possible.'' </P>
<P> Antje Vollmer, vice-president of parliament and a leading Green deputy, said the government obviously did not realize that ``the highest aim of foreign policy is to live in a state of fairness and understanding with one's neighbors.'' </P>
<P> ``Relations have been strained by clumsiness and a lack of diplomatic finesse,'' she told Saturday's Neue Press daily. </P>
<P> Criticism of Kohl's decision to limit the guest list to the World War II victors also emerged from his own Christian Democrats (CDU) Friday. </P>
<P> CDU deputy Friedbert Pflueger said it was not right to reject Poland's wish to be invited. </P>
<P> ``This was a gesture of reconciliation that we should have been pleased about,'' he told ARD, adding the decision must be changed to avoid any strain to German-Polish relations. </P>
<P> Kohl said Thursday that parliament might invite a Polish leader to address a special session, an idea that emerged after criticism was first directed at the chancellor for not using May 8 as an opportunity to strengthen German-Polish relations. </P>
<P> He said the choice of guests in Berlin was not meant as an affront to Poland. But Germany could not possibly invite all the countries that suffered under the Nazis. </P>
