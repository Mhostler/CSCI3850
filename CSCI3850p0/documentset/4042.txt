<P>  Jordan raised its flag at a patch of desert formerly controlled by Israel Monday as the two countries began realigning their border under their October peace deal, a witness said. </P>
<P> Jordanian officers shook hands with Israeli commanders in a ceremony on southern Jordan's Rift Valley border in the first phase of the Israeli pullout, a Reuters photographer said. </P>
<P> The Jordanian officers then implanted a Jordanian flag on the site. </P>
<P> The Israeli pullout follows completion of demarcation along the southern part of the frontier from the Red Sea to the southern tip of the Dead Sea and the northern stretch up to the Syrian border. </P>
<P> Israel's withdrawal to cease-fire lines of the 1967 Arab-Israeli war is to be completed by Feb. 10 as part of the peace deal that Jordan and Israel signed last year. </P>
<P> The Jordanian commander of the site, Gen. Mansour Abu Rashid, speaking above the singing of his troops celebrating the handover, told Israel Radio: ``I am feeling so proud. I am feeling so happy to see the Jordanian flag raised here.'' </P>
<P> The Israeli officers quickly cleared off the site after shaking hands with their Jordanian counterparts. Israel Radio said only two Israeli farmers were present at the ceremony. </P>
<P> One, Yaacov Ziegler of Israel's Paran village, expressed disappointment there was not at least one Israeli flag flying opposite the Jordanian colors, but said the withdrawal was fine with him. </P>
<P> ``I don't see any problem with it,'' he told the radio. </P>
