<P>  The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating possible influence peddling in Orange County, looking specifically to determine if brokers paid kickbacks to elected officials, according to a report published Friday. </P>
<P> The probe has focused on ``campaign contributions and kickbacks, things of that nature, and the relationship of broker-dealers to those officials,'' a high-ranking source close to the investigation told the Los Angeles Times. ``When someone is making a lot of money on you, is there a quid pro quo? It's happened in the area of municipal secruties before.'' </P>
<P> Late Wednesday, the SEC issued subpoenas to the members of the Orange County Board of Supervisors, demanding documents related to local finance as well as any documentation of county communications with Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc. </P>
<P> Board members said Thursday they would cooperate fully with the SEC. Officials also said they do not believe the Board is the subject of the SEC investigation. </P>
<P> A spokesman for Merrill Lynch confirmed last week that the firm received a subpoena from the SEC and said it would cooperate fully. The firm has handled millions of dollars worth of securities transactions for the county. </P>
<P> Orange County, Calif., declared bankrutpcy last week after disclosing heavy losses in its investment pool. Those losses are now estimated at $2 billion. </P>
<P> SEC subpoenas received by the Orange County Supervisors also asked for documents relating to communications with Merrill Lynch brokers Michael Stamenson, Debra Harris and Diane Canaga, according to county sources. </P>
<P> According to the Los Angeles Times, the SEC is also asking for the checking and savings account statements of the supervisors, campaign accounts, documents related to securities accounts and records of any gifts or loans. </P>
<P> In addition to the SEC, the National Association of Securities Dealers is investigating contributions made by Merrill Lynch employees, including Stamenson. </P>
<P> The NASD is investigating whether the employees violated new Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board rules that bar most political contributions to bond issuers from bond dealers. </P>
<P> The Orange County District Attorney and U.S. Attorney General's office are also investigating the county investment crisis, according to county sources and published reports. </P>
