<P>  A U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation team arrived in Israel Thursday to look into the death of a New Jersey woman in a suicide bombing in Gaza, Israeli police said. </P>
<P> An official of the Palestinian secret police in Gaza said the team would be briefed on Sunday's suicide bombing that killed the 20-year-old Alisa Flatow and seven Israeli soldiers but would not conduct its own investigation. </P>
<P> Israeli police said the FBI initiated the trip under a U.S. law that allows Washington to investigate deaths of citizens abroad. </P>
<P> Flatow was buried Wednesday in West Orange, N.J. in a funeral attended by about 2,000 people. </P>
