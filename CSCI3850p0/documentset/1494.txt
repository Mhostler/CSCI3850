<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO, Calif (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  An appeals court late Monday affirmed a lower court ruling that rejected a six-year-old copyright suit filed by Apple Computer Inc against Microsoft Corp and Hewlett-Packard Co. </P>
<P> Apple claimed in its suit that Microsoft's recent Windows program and Hewlett-Packard's NewWave program violated copyrights on Apple's Macintosh computer screen graphics. </P>
<P> ``We are disappointed with the decision,'' said Apple spokeswoman Betty Taylor. ``We're evaluating our options.'' </P>
<P> The federal appeals court found no reason to overturn the ruling of U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker, who dismissed Apple's charges against Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft in 1993. </P>
<P> The appeals court said today that Walker was ``on target.'' </P>
<P> Apple filed its suit against Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft in March 1988, alleging copyright violations by both companies.  In its suit, Apple alleged that Hewlett-Packard's NewWave, a personal computer software product, and Microsoft Windows (TM) 2.03, violated copyrights that protected the ``look and feel'' of the Macintosh user interface. </P>
<P> The suit was later expanded. </P>
<P> ``From the outset we maintained that Microsoft had developed our products well within our 1985 license agreement and had not violated any copyrights,'' said William Neukom, senior vice president of law and corporate affairs at Microsoft. ``We are gratified with the positive outcome of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision. It vindicates the position we asserted from the start of this litigation.'' </P>
<P> ``We're delighted the courts have agreed with (Hewlett-Packard's) long-held view that the company did not copy anything belonging to Apple and that Apple's broad claims that only it could use icon-driven interfaces were not defensible,'' said Jon Stark, a partner in Pennie & Edmonds, Hewlett-Packard's trial counsel. </P>
