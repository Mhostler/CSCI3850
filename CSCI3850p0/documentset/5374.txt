<P>  Russia's new part-privatized television station, whose launch has been surrounded by controversy and violence, started broadcasting Saturday to a potential audience of over 200 million. </P>
<P> Public Russian Television (ORT) was created by a decree of President Boris Yeltsin last November, a decision that sparked accusations from his political opponents, mainly communists, that he was seeking to control the media. </P>
<P> The new station immediately distanced itself from its state-owned predecessor Ostankino by not carrying any advertisements -- a decision that may have led to the murder of its first director. </P>
<P> The new station went on the air one month to the day after its executive director and television star Vladislav Listyev was gunned down in an apparent contract killing outside his home. The murderers have not been found. </P>
<P> Many linked the killing of Listyev, who was also a hugely popular talk show host, to the new-look network's decision to ban advertising for an unspecified period in a bid to squeeze out middlemen who have been making fortunes through it. </P>
<P> Listyev had planned eventually to bring advertising sales under ORT's direct control, cutting out the intermediaries. </P>
<P> The state is to retain a 51 percent controlling stake in ORT. Ostankino is to have nine percent and the rest is divided between eight private shareholders, including banks and the industrial company Logovaz. </P>
<P> In a country the size of Russia, television is by far the most effective means of mass communication and opponents of the reshuffle, notably communists, said the new company was likely to act in Yeltsin's interests. </P>
<P> Russia faces parliamentary elections in December and a presidential poll next year and several political and commercial groupings have been seeking stakes in the media. </P>
