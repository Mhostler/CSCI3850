<P>  In one of the worst political scandals to hit Colombia's ruling Liberal party in years, nine of its congressmen have been temporarily suspended following allegations that they received money from drug traffickers. </P>
<P> The party suspended the congressmen, including the president of the House of Representatives, after the country's prosecutor-general called Friday for a probe of allegations that they accepted money from Colombia's Cali cartel, one of the world's most powerful drug organizations. </P>
<P> ``These people are temporarily suspended until the (Supreme) Court decides their judicial situation,'' the coordinator of the party's Council of Ethics Control told the RCN radio network in an interview broadcast Sunday. </P>
<P> Alvaro Coral Ceron, whose council issued one of its most severe resolutions ever in the suspension of party members on drug money allegations, said a preliminary investigation would also be opened against other members implicated in the allegations, including former Senator Eduardo Mestre Sarmiento. </P>
<P> Prosecutor-General Alfonso Valdivieso stunned the country by asking the Supreme Court to investigate evidence suggesting that the congressmen and other people had accepted money from the cartel or one of its front companies. </P>
<P> Valdivieso, who also ordered the arrest of Mestre for illicit enrichment, said his office was investigating 23 other suspects on similar charges. </P>
<P> Most of the congressmen have denied any wrongdoing. </P>
<P> It is not the first time that the Liberal Party, which has ruled the country through successive governments for years, has been struck by a drug scandal. </P>
<P> In 1984, leading party members reportedly met in Panama with Colombian drug traffickers, who supposedly offered to cancel the national debt in exchange for some political favors. </P>
<P> A year earlier, now-deceased drug lord Pablo Escobar acted briefly as an alternate congressman for a Liberal party fringe group. He eventually went into hiding after being accused of leading the Medellin cartel. </P>
<P> The allegations against the nine congressmen come at a time when the government, under heavy pressure from the United States, has bolstered its fight against drug trafficking. </P>
<P> U.S. Ambassador Myles Frechette applauded Saturday the prosecutor-general's initiative, describing it as a ``very positive step'' in the drug war. </P>
<P> Meanwhile, Colombia's RCN and Caracol radio networks reported Sunday that Colombia's chief prosecutor is to question singer, soap star Margarita Rosa de Francisco about a recent tour to the southwestern city of Cali, home of the Cali drug cartel. </P>
<P> The networks said Rosa de Francisco, who stars as a poor coffee picker who works her way up the coffee industry, would have to explain why her stay at the Intercontinental Hotel in the city was paid for by Inversiones Ara, a local company suspected of being a front for the cartel. </P>
