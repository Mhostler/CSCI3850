<P>  A 12-mile oil slick began hitting the beaches of northern Portugal Sunday after a tanker hit rocks and spilled as much as 1,300 tons of crude into the sea, port authorities said. </P>
<P> Rocks and sand on along Leca beach were already covered with a thick black film and residents complained the noxious smell caused by the spillage prevented them from leaving their houses. </P>
<P> ``The water is black and there's crude on the sand,'' local government official Narciso Miranda said. ``The beach has been invaded by oil,'' he added. </P>
<P> The Panamanian-flagged Cercal, carrying 82,795 tons of crude oil, punctured its tanks when it ran on to rocks off the coast near the city of Oporto. </P>
<P> It leaked oil for more than six hours, and the port of Leixoes was temporarily closed to shipping. </P>
<P> Port captain Commander Coelho Rito called the spillage ``signicant, but not a catastrophe.'' </P>
<P> The slick stretched around 200 yards across the sand by nightfall, Lisbon's TSF radio said. </P>
<P> ``Between 1,200 and 1,300 tons of crude oil were spilt,'' Coehlo Rito told Portuguese RTP television. </P>
<P> The 53,974-ton Cercal was quickly towed out to sea. ``The remaining oil is being pumped into another tanker to reduce the risk,'' a port official told Reuters. </P>
<P> Nevertheless, the slick had fouled one beach and port authorities said in a statement that it was ``inevitable'' the slick would reach other beaches around the densely populated area. </P>
<P> The ship arrived in Portugal early Sunday from Algeria, with a crude oil cargo bound for state oil refiner Petrogal - Petroloes de Portugal SA. </P>
<P> ``Authorities are doing all they can to contain the spillage,'' he said. ``There is no direct health risk to the public although it's a very volatile crude,'' he added. </P>
<P> An operation to begin cleaning the beaches would begin early Monday, port authorities told Portuguese news agency Lusa. </P>
<P> The Spanish vessel Ria de Vigo arrived at the spill site to help contain the slick, Lisbon's TSF radio reported, and barriers had been put up within the port to check the flow of oil. </P>
<P> ``Most efforts now will deal with cleaning up the coast,'' Coelho Rito said. </P>
<P> A port official said he did not know when the port would be reopened. </P>
