<P>  The reopening of Berlin's largest synagogue and community center should help rejuvenate a small part of the city's Jewish culture that had flourished before the Nazis tried to destroy it, Jewish leaders said Thursday. </P>
<P> The New Synagogue, which was nearly destroyed by Allied bombs during World War II, will be officially rededicated at a ceremony Sunday attended by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and broadcast live on German and Israeli television. </P>
<P> ``We hope that this building will be the center of a revival of Jewish life,'' Jerzy Kanal, chairman of Berlin's vestigial Jewish community, told a news conference. </P>
<P> ``Of course we cannot compare ourselves with the Jewish community that once lived here. It was a flourishing Jewish life and we can never recreate such a time. We can rebuild a building but we can never replace the people who are gone.'' </P>
<P> The Jewish culture thrived in Berlin before the Nazis took power -- it was one of the world's 10 largest Jewish centers and many of Germany's leading scientists were Berlin Jews. </P>
<P> There were about 160,000 Jews in Berlin in 1933, but only 1,400 were left in 1945. The rest emigrated or were killed in Nazi death camps. The size of the Jewish community in Berlin in recent years has climbed to 10,000 as several hundred Jews from the former Soviet Union stream into the city each year. </P>
<P> When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, there were about 6,000 Jews in West Berlin but only about 200 in communist East Berlin, where the pre-Nazi era Jewish life was centerd. </P>
<P> ``The number of Jews coming to Berlin will continue to grow in the years ahead,'' said Hermann Simon, director of the foundation that rebuilt the synagogue over the last seven years. ``Our aim is to bring Jewish life back here.'' </P>
<P> The New Synagogue, whose golden dome dominates the old Jewish quarter in eastern Berlin, was spared destruction during the Nazi's ``Kristallnacht,'' or ``Night of Broken Glass'' when Jewish shops and synagogues were ransacked and burned. </P>
<P> A courageous Berlin policeman chased away Nazi thugs before the building could be destroyed. </P>
<P> But the synagogue fell victim to Allied bombs during World War II, in 1943 and lay in ruins until 1988 when East Berlin's communist authorities, eager for a rapprochement with the United States and Israel, began renovating it. </P>
<P> The synagogue was first opened in 1866 as testimony to the growing importance and status of the city's growing Jewish community. Prussia had granted equal rights to the Jews, ending centuries of suppression. </P>
<P> The rededicated New Synagogue will be primarily a center for Jewish culture. A small area has been set aside for prayers. The foundation of the original synagogue lies behind the building. </P>
<P> ``We want to bring Jewish life back here,'' Kanal said. ``We didn't want to build a synagogue that would stand as an empty monument. There will be Jewish life where this is a Jewish center.'' </P>
