<P>  Irish Republican leader Gerry Adams predicted Friday that Britain would begin peace talks on northern Ireland with Sinn Fein before the end of the year. </P>
<P> ``We're going to have negotiations, I would say certainly before the end of the year, involving the British government,'' Adams told a civic group during his first visit to Canada. </P>
<P> But Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, also accused Britain of stalling the peace process. </P>
<P> ``The British government is making excuses for not talking,'' Adams said, repeating a criticism he made often during a two-week tour of the United States that ended Friday. </P>
<P> Adams headed to Vancouver from California Friday night and plans a week-long tour of Canada. About 15 protesters demonstrated and shouted at his car as he arrived at a downtown Vancouver hotel. </P>
<P> Britain has insisted the IRA declare its current cease-fire ``permanent'' before Sinn Fein can win a place at the negotiating table in any future peace talks. </P>
<P> The IRA, which wants a united Ireland, declared a cease-fire in its 25-year war against British rule in northern Ireland at the end of August. </P>
<P> In his speech in Vancouver, Adams stressed he wanted an end to conflict and a ``demilitarization'' in northern Ireland. ``I want to see the gun taken out of Irish politics,'' he said. </P>
<P> Northern Ireland is under British rule while the rest of the island country to the south is independent. The Protestant majority in Northern Ireland wants it to stay that way while the Catholic minority wants to join the south. </P>
<P> Adams urged Canada to push Britain toward the bargaining table. ``The British government needs to be encouraged to join with the Dublin government to facilitate discussion. That does need to be fast-tracked,'' he said. </P>
<P> After Vancouver, Adams plans stops in Toronto and Montreal. The Canadian government granted Adams a visa for the first time but is barring him from meeting government officials or raising funds while in the country. </P>
<P> The restrictions means his visit to Canada will be more low-profile than his U.S. tour which included meetings with members of Congress, a chat with Vice President Al Gore and several fund-raisers. </P>
