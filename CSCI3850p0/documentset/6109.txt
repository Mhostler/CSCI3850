<P>  In what political analysts called the first shot in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's 1996 re-election bid, a key aide said on Friday he was resigning his government post to focus on party politics. </P>
<P> Rabin, 73, has broadly hinted he will seek the premiership in elections due to take place in November 1996 but he has yet to formally declare his candidacy. </P>
<P> Shimon Sheves, director-general of the prime minister's office, told Israel Radio: ``We agreed that at the end of May I would end my role as director... I will coordinate the prime minister's Labour party operations.'' </P>
<P> ``The target important to us is to succeed in the 1996 elections,'' Sheves added. He dodged when asked directly if that meant Rabin had decided to run. </P>
<P> Israeli political analyst Hanan Crystal told the radio Rabin wanted Sheves, who ran Rabin's 1992 campaign, free of government restraints ahead of the Labour party convention in June. </P>
<P> He added that one of Sheves's prime tasks would be to ensure that Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, in the past Rabin's oldest and fiercest party rival, would not stand in Rabin's way. </P>
<P> The move ``comes to make sure that Peres does not run against Rabin in 1996 and that if he does, he fails,'' Crystal said. </P>
<P> The elections pose a challenge to Middle East peace moves. Officials say that in particular a peace deal with Syria, involving domestically controversial Israeli territorial concessions, must be reached soon or wait until after the poll. </P>
