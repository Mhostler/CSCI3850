<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Mike Hudson's goal early in the third period gave the Pittsburgh Penguins their fourth straight win to open the season, a 5-4 triumph over the Ottawa Senators Friday. </P>
<P> Pittsburgh equaled the best start in club history. The Penguins also opened the season 4-0 in 1975-76 and 1986-87. </P>
<P> Hudson, picked up from the New York Rangers in the January 18 waiver draft, scored his first goal as a Penguin. He finished off a 2-on-1 with Chris Joseph by deking goaltender Don Beaupre to the ice and sliding the puck into the net. </P>
<P> ``I don't get too many 2-on-1 opportunities,'' Hudson said. ''(Joseph) slipped the puck to me and I faced a wide open net. I've had a lot of chances over the past week. Chris caught up and he made it work as a 2-on-1.'' </P>
<P> Pittsburgh squandered a 4-1 second-period lead as Dave Archibald, Rob Gaudreau and Radek Bonk scored to bring Ottawa even at 4-4 with 2:49 left in the period. </P>
<P> ``In the second period we put it on cruise control,'' Hudson said. ``There's so much parity in the league, you can't afford to do that.'' </P>
<P> Pittsburgh stretched its unbeaten streak in home openers to nine games (7-0-2). Ottawa fell to 0-2-1 this season. </P>
<P> Pittsburgh's Kevin Stevens and Ottawa's Norm Maciver traded power-play goals before Joe Mullen and John Cullen scored to give the Pens a 3-1 lead after the first period. </P>
<P> In Buffalo, Bob Bassen scored twice, including the go-ahead tally 16 seconds into the second period, as the unbeaten Quebec Nordiques handed the Sabres their first loss, 7-3. </P>
<P> Joe Sakic, Wendel Clark, Valeri Kamensky and Adam Deadmarsh each added a goal and an assist for the Nordiques (3-0), who are off to their best start since going 4-0 to open the 1991-92 season. </P>
<P> ``We're not getting over our heads,'' Sakic said. ``We're working hard. We're very happy.'' </P>
<P> Dale Hawerchuk scored twice and Derek Plante had a goal and an assist for Buffalo, which was trying for its first 4-0 start since 1975. </P>
<P> In Chicago, Joe Murphy scored twice and Steve Smith added a goal and an assist, leading the Blackhawks to a 4-1 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs. </P>
<P> Ed Belfour turned aside 18 shots for Chicago, which won for the second time in as many games at the new United Center. </P>
<P> The teams were meeting for the first time since the Maple Leafs ousted Chicago in the first round of last year's Western Conference playoffs. </P>
<P> Murphy and Brent Sutter scored 27 seconds apart midway through the first period to put the Blackhawks ahead to stay. </P>
<P> ``In the first period, they outplayed us, beat us to the puck and that was pretty much the story of the game,'' Leafs defenseman Dave Ellett said. ``They outworked us.'' </P>
<P> Toronto coach Pat Burns was more blunt, calling it an ``ugly game to watch, ugly game to coach and probably an ugly game to play.'' </P>
<P> Doug Gilmour scored the Leafs' only goal on the power play with just under five minutes left in the opening period. </P>
<P> At Washington, Keith Jones and Sylvain Cote each had a goal and an assist as the Capitals made their home opener a successful one with a 5-2 victory over the New York Islanders. </P>
<P> Olaf Kolzig made 24 saves and recorded his first NHL win for Washington, which posted its first victory of the season and won for just the fourth time in its last 13 home openers. The Capitals also broke a three-game winless streak against New York (2-1-1), which suffered its first loss of the season. </P>
<P> Rookie Jason Allison, Dimitri Khristich and Peter Bondra also scored for Washington while Derek King and Benoit Hogue tallied for New York. </P>
<P> In Anaheim, Guy Hebert made 39 saves and John Lilley snapped a second-period tie as the Mighty Ducks remained unbeaten against the Winnipeg Jets with a 3-2 victory. </P>
<P> Anaheim improved to 6-0 all-time against the Jets, who have lost eight straight road games dating back to last season. </P>
<P> With the score tied 1-1, Lilley took a pass from Bob Corkum in the slot and beat Nikolai Khabibulin to the stick side with 4:15 remaining in the second period. </P>
<P> Valeri Karpov had scored first for Anaheim but Keith Tkachuk tied it up in the first period. </P>
<P> After Lilley's goal, Paul Kariya tallied in the second period for Anaheim and Teemu Selanne scored in the third for the Jets. </P>
