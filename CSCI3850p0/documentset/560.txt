<P>  Officials in China's central Hubei province squandered $2.4 million in flood relief funds on buying more than a hundred smuggled luxury cars, the People's Daily said Wednesday. </P>
<P> It said party and county government officials spent the state funds and public donations on 130 sedans. </P>
<P> It said two top officials, Liu Youqing and Zhu Youxue, were sacked for changing cars every year since 1990 and squandering $95,000 in public funds. </P>
<P> The Communist Party's Central Commission for Discipline removed Liu and Zhu as party secretary and magistrate of Gucheng County, the People's Daily said, but did not specify whether the money the pair spent was intended as flood relief. </P>
<P> The newspaper did not say if the two would face criminal charges or whether other party and government officials would be punished. </P>
<P> Corruption among officials has blossomed with economic reforms and is the subject of repeated official anti-graft campaigns. </P>
<P> But ordinary people complain they will never succeed since, they say, the campaigns cannot target the family and associates of top party and government leaders who are protected from prosecution by their connections. </P>
