<P>  Canadian doctors said Friday they are optimistic the tiny suriving twin from high-risk separation surgery will make a full recovery despite the sudden death of her sister this week. </P>
<P> Nida Jamal died Wednesday afternoon of a heart attack caused by a blood clot on her heart and lungs a month after she was separated from her sister Hira in a 16-hour operation at Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children. </P>
<P> The two-year-old Pakistani sisters had been joined at the brain since birth and shared a blood circulatory system. </P>
<P> ``Although this is not an outcome we hoped for, (separation) was still the only chance they had,'' critical care physician John Edmonds told reporters. </P>
<P> Nida's friends and family gathered to mourn her death at a mosque in a Toronto suburb Thursday and she was later buried nearby. An autopsy was not held because of the family's religious and cultural beliefs, doctors said. </P>
<P> The children's father, Anwar Jamal, said Hira, still adjusting to life physically unattached from Nida, has not yet been told of her sister's death. </P>
<P> ``Hira is doing very fine,'' Jamal said on Thursday. ``She is talking and singing.'' </P>
<P> Edmonds said Hira could suffer some emotional setbacks when she learns her sister is dead, but noted that she would be helped by her young age and the fact she is one of triplets and has another sister, Faryal. </P>
<P> ``We believe she will make it. At the moment she doesn't have any life-threatening problems ... but she still has some hurdles to cross,'' Edmonds said of Hira, who was removed from intensive care about 10 days ago. </P>
<P> ``We would see her developing as a normal person. The ultimate outcome we think is going to be really good.'' </P>
<P> The skin on top of Hira's scalp is still not fully healed and liable to infection. Her heart, which was weakened because of the demands on it from both girls, is still not fully recovered. </P>
<P> The operation on the two girls, born in Karachi, Pakistan, was a rare procedure performed about 30 times before. Either one or both of the twins died in about two-thirds of the previous operations, usually shortly after surgery. </P>
<P> Doctors had been concerned about Nida's health immediately after the operation because of congestion in her brain and she never emerged from a comatose state. </P>
