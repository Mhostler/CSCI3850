<P>  Self-exiled feminist writer Taslima Nasrin must face charges for ``insulting Islam and hurting sentiments of the Muslims,'' the Bangladesh High Court ruled Tuesday. </P>
<P> The court rejected an appeal by her lawyers to drop the charges and asked a lower court to go ahead with her trial. </P>
<P> Justice A.K.M. Sadeque and Justice Abu Sayeed Ahmed, while rejecting the appeal, however said the Magistrate's Court must obtain a further order under section 188 of Bangladesh Penal Code to proceed with the trial. They gave no details. </P>
<P> Defense attorneys earlier said the order was required for a trial of any Bangladeshi citizen ``who commited any alleged offense outside the territory of Bangladesh.'' </P>
<P> Nasrin, 32, faces charges of ``insulting Islam and hurting sentiments of the Muslims'' stemming from an article in India's Statesman newspaper, which quoted her as saying Islam's holy book, the Koran, should be ``revised thoroughly.'' </P>
<P> Nasrin says she was misquoted but the writer of the article says she was not. </P>
<P> Nasrin's lawyers filed a petition to the High Court Jan. 2 seeking to quash the charges and challenging an order given in November by Justice Kamaluddin Ahmed, Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (ACMM), for her to stand trial. </P>
<P> The ACMM court put off the trial until Jan. 15 to enable the High Court to hear the petition. </P>
<P> The defense argued that ``under the Bangadesh evidence act, no presumption about an alleged crime committed across the frontiers existed on the basis of a newspaper report.'' </P>
<P> But the judges said the trial could proceed ``as there may be more evidence in the process apart from the newspaper evidence.'' </P>
<P> Nasrin' trial began in her absence Dec. 10 in the ACMM court but proceedings were suspended to allow her lawyers to appeal. </P>
<P> Nasrin, who received death threats from fundamentalist Muslim groups in Bangladesh, left for Sweden a week after the High Court granted her bail on a complaint lodged by police that she had insulted Muslim religious feelings. </P>
