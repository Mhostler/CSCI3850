<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Christmas came early for six National Football League teams Saturday as the last of the Super Bowl tournament berths were claimed on the eve of the holiday. </P>
<P> The Patriots celebrated a return to the playoffs for the first time in eight years, while the Chiefs happily advanced at the expense of their longtime rivals, the Raiders, 19-9. </P>
<P> ``This was a playoff game for us,'' said Kansas City running back Marcus Allen, who once starred for the Raiders, who were eliminated by the result. Allen ran for 132 yards and became the ninth NFL player to rush for more than 10,000 yards. </P>
<P> ``Obviously, from a human side, it is a little special when you do it against your former club.'' </P>
<P> Allen's backfield partner, quarterback Joe Montana, had to leave the game in the fourth quarter after hurting his knee. </P>
<P> ``The knee doesn't feel too bad right now,'' Montana said. ''It probably scared me more than anything right off. After I got over to the sideline it sort of eased up. I probably could have gone back in the game if I had to.'' </P>
<P> New England took care of their playoff destiny on the road against defensive-minded Chicago. The Patriots, winners of their last seven games for a 10-6 record, prevailed 13-3. </P>
<P> ``I never thought I would see it happen the way things have happened the last five or six years,'' Pats linebacker Vincent Brown said. ``But we are no longer the doormats of the league.'' </P>
<P> In the National Football Conference, the Bears' defeat to the Patriots combined with a victory by the Green Bay Packers made it a banner day for the Central Division, which had four teams qualify for the playoffs including Chicago, despite their loss, Detroit and Minnesota. </P>
<P> ``It's a special day,'' said Packers' coach Mike Holmgren after his team's 34-19 rout of the hosting Tampa Bay Buccaneers. ``We've had our backs to the wall all season.'' </P>
<P> Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre, who connected on three scoring strikes to star receiver Sterling Sharpe, was full of confidence. </P>
<P> ``We're right at the top of our game at the right time. I'm looking forward to the playoffs,'' Favre said. </P>
<P> The San Diego Chargers, champions of the AFC West, clinched an opening round bye with a wild 37-34 victory over AFC Central champion Pittsburgh Steelers. </P>
<P> One player relieved by the outcome was Chargers' quarterback Stan Humphries, who left in the fourth quarter with a sprained thumb on his throwing hand. </P>
<P> ``It started to swell and I couldn't grip the ball the way I need to,'' Humphries said. ``It should definitely be fine in two weeks.'' </P>
<P> The Cleveland Browns assured themselves of hosting a wild card game next week with a 35-9 win over the Seattle Seahawks. </P>
<P> ``I'd like to congratulate the team,'' Browns coach Bill Belichick said. ``They did a heck of a job this year. </P>
<P> ``But the real season starts next week.'' </P>
