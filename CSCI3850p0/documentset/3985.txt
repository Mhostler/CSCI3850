<P>  He is high strung and lean like a thoroughbred race horse, he still gets butterflies before big games and he never, never stops to smell the roses. </P>
<P> He is Jerry Rice, simply the finest receiver ever to play the game of football and the most dangerous weapon in the San Francisco 49ers' Super Bowl arsenal. </P>
<P> ``He is the standard everybody is going to be measured against,'' said San Diego General Manager Bobby Beathard, whose Chargers must contend with Rice in Super Bowl XXIX Sunday. </P>
<P> This season Rice joined baseball's Hank Aaron and hockey's Wayne Gretzky as athletes who have broken records that many thought would stand forever. </P>
<P> Rice surpassed legendary running back Jim Brown's 126 career touchdowns in the first game of the season with a three-touchdown performance. By the end of the year he had taken the mark to 139. </P>
<P> The lanky Rice, who also has an NFL-record nine 1,000-yard receiving seasons, has some bad news for the Chargers, as if they aren't already worried enough about him. </P>
<P> ``I feel more explosive than I ever felt,'' he said. ``You would think going into your 10th season you would slow down a little bit, but I feel really good.'' </P>
<P> During the late 1980s Joe Montana and Jerry Rice were considered the game's greatest combination, hooking up for 55 touchdowns. In the '90s it is Rice and Steve Young, who surpassed that mark this season. </P>
<P> Rice doesn't remember exactly when he and Young fully clicked. But the two now have a mutual admiration society. </P>
<P> ``Joe is gone, Steve Young is the quarterback. We have confidence in him and when everything is on the line, we know he is going to get the job done,'' said the 32-year-old Hall of Fame shoe-in. </P>
<P> ``When you drop back to pass and there are five guys paid to kill you, you appreciate a guy who gets open all the time,'' Young said of Rice. </P>
<P> And what opposing coaches have come to dread is what he can do after he catches the ball. </P>
<P> ``Jerry is possessed by the end zone. He can catch the ball at the 50 (yard line) surrounded by eight guys and still be thinking end zone,'' said Young. </P>
<P> ``I feel the fun is just starting after I catch the football,'' Rice says. </P>
<P> Rice is a workaholic who literally cannot remember when he last took a vacation. </P>
<P> ``The longest I have taken off is maybe a week and a half. When the season's over I go back into my (training) regimen,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``This year I'm going to try to make my wife happy by taking her on a vacation...and I'll just take all my equipment with me.'' </P>
<P> Some vacation. </P>
<P> ``You have to pay the price to stay on top. I can't say okay, 'I had a great season I'll be a couch potato for about two months.''' </P>
<P> This from an athlete who has probably never sat still long enough to leave an impression on a couch. </P>
<P> Rice said Thursday that he was beginning to get into his game mode. </P>
<P> ``I know by Saturday night it's going to be impossible for me to sleep. </P>
<P> ``I get butterflies and I'm anxious. At times I get too emotional. I have to try to tone that down,'' he admitted. </P>
<P> ``Whenever you get an opportunity like this you don't want it to slip away from you, because Super Bowls are so hard to come by now,'' said Rice who never dreamed it would take six years to get back after winning two in a row. </P>
<P> ``We have to take advantage of this.'' </P>
<P> And if the underdog Chargers take advantage instead? </P>
<P> ``I got 65, 70 people coming, so if things don't go right I'll still have my own little cheering section,'' he said, laughing. </P>
<P> The last time the Super Bowl was played in Miami, Rice was named the game's MVP for his 11-catch, 215-yard performance. </P>
<P> All he remembers about the 20-16 victory over Cincinnati was the thrilling 92-yard drive that ended with John Taylor's game winning touchdown catch -- made possible, in part, because most eyes were on Rice. </P>
<P> ``Everybody thought I would be the primary (receiver) and that really caught Cincinnati off guard.'' </P>
<P> Being called the greatest is nice, Rice says, but it can go to your head. </P>
<P> ``If it goes to my head I feel like I'm not going to work as hard, I'm not going to be as productive, then you're on your way out,'' he said. </P>
<P> Will he ever give himself a chance to enjoy the accolades? </P>
<P> ``Maybe when it's over,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``But if the fire's still inside me, I'll be back.'' </P>
