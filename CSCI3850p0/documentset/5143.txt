<P>  The United States Thursday demanded the immediate release of a U.S. citizen kidnapped by a rebel group in Chad, saying he was a diabetic who could die if he was not freed at once. </P>
<P> State Department spokeswoman Christine Shelly named the man as Anthony Johnson, but gave no further details. Reports from Chad said he was working on an agricultural project for the United Nations Development Program. </P>
<P> Johnson, his Malian cook and two Chadian guards were kidnapped Sunday by the rebel Movement for Democracy and Development (MDD) in the western part of the West African country. </P>
<P> ``Mr. Johnson is a diabetic who requires daily medication,'' Shelly said in a statement. ``His life is in imminent danger if he is not released immediately.'' </P>
<P> She said insulin -- the drug used to treat diabetes -- and a doctor were awaiting Johnson in the town of Bosso. U.S. embassy staff from neighboring Niger were also standing by in the Niger town of Diffa. </P>
<P> ``The United States Government holds the kidnappers responsible for the health and safety of Anthony Johnson and repeats its demand for his immediate release,'' she said. </P>
<P> MDD leader Moussa Medella promised Wednesday that the kidnapped men would be freed in the next few days. ``Our aim is to find a solution for the Chadian people, not to detain aid workers,'' he told Radio France Internationale. </P>
<P> He gave no motive for the abduction. The MDD, a group based in western Chad, is split into several factions. </P>
<P> The U.S. embassy in the Chad capital of N'Djamena said earlier Wednesday no demands had been received from the captors. ``They haven't contacted us or sent anything to the Chadian government,'' a spokesman said. </P>
<P> The four disappeared on Sunday night in Mao, in the Kanem district. The half-dozen rebel groups opposing Chad's President Idriss Deby have not previously targeted foreigners. </P>
