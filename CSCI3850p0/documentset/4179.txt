<P>  North Korea Tuesday declared the birthday of leader Kim Jong-il ``the greatest holiday of the nation'' but offered no indication of whether Kim will make a rare public appearance on that day, Feb. 16. </P>
<P> It also gave no clue as to when Kim, who will be 53, will formally assume control of the Stalinist state. </P>
<P> ``It is the unanimous desire of all the Korean people to significantly celebrate the birthday of comrade Kim Jong-il, the great leader of our party and our people,'' the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said. </P>
<P> It said the central people's committee had issued a decree designating Feb. 16 and 17 as national holidays and ordered that ``all the organs, enterprises, organizations and families shall hoist the national flags of the DPRK (North Korea) on these days.'' </P>
<P> The decree is the culmination of a 20-year process of elevating the importance of Kim's birthday that parallels his grooming as heir-apparent to his father Kim Il-sung, founder and paramount leader of North Korea until his death last July. </P>
<P> Analysts of the secretive communist state said Kim's birthday was made an ``extraordinary day off work'' in 1975, upgraded to a ``regular day off work'' in 1976 finally made a ``public holiday'' in 1982. This was extended to include Feb. 17 in 1986, they said. </P>
<P> The late Kim Il-sung sought to make his son's birthday the ``greatest holiday of the nation'' in 1992, but the younger Kim declined out of his ``absolute loyalty and noble moral sense of duty'' to his father and his ``unbounded modesty,'' KCNA said. </P>
<P> KCNA's announcement of the decree, in a report monitored in Tokyo, was followed by official reports that Kim's birthday was celebrated in Russia, Mozambique, Madagascar and other states. </P>
<P> But the state-run media gave no indication that Kim will mark next week's birthday by making a public appearance. He has been seen in public only three times since his father's death. </P>
<P> Pyongyang has repeatedly asserted that Kim is in control of North Korean affairs, but he has yet to assume the posts of president and chief of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea held by his father. </P>
