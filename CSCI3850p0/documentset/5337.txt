<P>  Five African foreign ministers met their Libyan counterpart in the eastern Libyan town of Tobruk Thursday to discuss the Lockerbie affair, the official Libyan news Agency JANA reported. </P>
<P> The ministers -- from Ghana, Tunisia, Cameroon, Zimbabwe and Uganda -- are members of an Organization of African Unity (OAU) committee seeking a solution to the rift between Libya and Western countries over the bombing of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988. </P>
<P> JANA said Libyan Foreign Affairs Minister Omar al-Montasser attended the meeting. It gave no details. </P>
<P> Libya is under U.N. sanctions since 1992 for failing to hand over for trial to the United States or Britain two Libyan suspects charged with planting the bomb that killed 270 people. </P>
<P> The original sanctions include an air embargo, a ban on the sale or transfer of arms to Libya and the downgrading of diplomatic links with that country. Additional sanctions became effective in December 1993, including a freeze on some Libyan assets abroad. </P>
<P> Thursday, the Security Council of the United Nations, after a periodic review, made no changes to the Libyan sanctions. The sanctions are reviewed every 120 days. </P>
<P> But U.S. ambassador Madeleine Albright called on fellow council members to ``consider tougher economic sanctions, including an oil embargo,'' and said the United States was strengthening its own unilateral sanctions against Libya. </P>
<P> A total of 270 people, including all 259 aboard and 11 on the ground, were killed in the Lockerbie disaster. </P>
<P> The OAU has been pressing for a ``rapid and peaceful solution'' and an end to the U.N. sanctions imposed on Libya. </P>
<P> Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi said Tuesday that Libya would defy a U.N. air embargo by sending planes of Muslim pilgrims to Saudi Arabia and was seriously considering quitting the world body. </P>
