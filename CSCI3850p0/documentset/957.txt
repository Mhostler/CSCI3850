<P>  A Madonna fan who allegedly stalked the singer for months pleaded no contest Tuesday to scaling a fence surrounding her million-dollar estate and to assaulting a police officer after being arrested. </P>
<P> Todd Lawrence, 26, of Arizona was sentenced to 12 months in jail. He entered his plea shortly before a jury was to hear opening arguments in the case. </P>
<P> Lawrence had previously pleaded innocent to a misdemeanor charge of attempted illegal entry and to assaulting a police officer in the July 18 incident. </P>
<P> It was not immediately clear why Lawrence decided to change his mind. </P>
<P> But his lawyer, public defender Denise Daniels, told reporters earlier Tuesday that the city attorney's office had offered a plea bargain that would land her client in jail for one year instead of the maximum of two years and three months. </P>
<P> Following Lawrence's arrest, Madonna won a court order barring him from making contact with her or visiting her home or offices for three years. </P>
<P> Lawrence had stalked Madonna for about three weeks before his arrest, according to court documents. </P>
<P> He had allegedly rung the bell on the gate of her mansion, which sits just below the famous ``Hollywood'' sign, on a number of occasions, telling the maid who answered that he was Madonna's ``husband'' and was ``coming home.'' </P>
<P> On July 18, according to court records, one of Madonna's security guards, Basil Stephens, arrested Lawrence at gunpoint and handcuffed him after watching him on a television monitor as he scaled the eight-foot fence on a television monitor. </P>
<P> He was then handed over to police. He allegedly assaulted an officer at the Hollywood police station by spitting at him and trying to kick him. </P>
<P> The 35-year-old performer's Hollywood Hills estate is guarded by an electronic gate, security fence and television cameras. </P>
