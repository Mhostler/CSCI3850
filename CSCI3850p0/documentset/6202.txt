<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Giants came up big in the pitching department once again but were short on attendance as fallout from the baseball strike put a damper on the famed San Francisco-Los Angeles Dodgers rivalry. </P>
<P> Terry Mulholland pitched seven scoreless innings and Glenallen Hill hit a two-run homer to lead the Giants to their third shutout win of the season, a 7-0 win over the Dodgers. </P>
<P> The game was played before only 10,828, the lowest turnout at San Francisco's Candlestick Park since September 10, 1992. It was the smallest crowd to witness a Dodgers-Giants game in San Francisco since September 1985. </P>
<P> ``It was strange seeing such a small crowd for a Dodger game in Candlestick,'' said Dodgers manager Tom Lasorda. ``I could hardly believe it. I hardly got booed.'' </P>
<P> The loss was the fourth in a row for Los Angeles, who opened the season with three wins. </P>
<P> Mulholland (1-1), a free agent acquisition, allowed six hits over seven innings to earn the win. </P>
<P> ``I went out and challenged them. It's nice to shut teams out, but it was better to get that type of production from our offense,'' said Mulholland. </P>
<P> Barry Bonds, who entered the game 0-for-11, singled home a run in the first inning for his first hit of the season. </P>
<P> In St Louis, pitching continued to take top billing as Ken Hill tossed a five-hitter through seven innings as the Cardinals posted their second straight shutout, a 4-0 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates. </P>
<P> ``That reminded me of Bob Gibson tonight,'' said Cardinals manager Joe Torre. ``Not that Ken Hill isn't a man in his own right...but that was get a lead, and know what to do with it. He was like a locomotive.'' </P>
<P> Ray Lankford, Scott Cooper and John Mabry all had two hits for the Cardinals. Cooper started a three-run burst in the second inning with a double and scored on Mabry's single. </P>
<P> The Pirates lost for the fourth time in five games. </P>
<P> At Colorado, Andres Galarraga's RBI single sparked a five-run eighth inning and Dante Bichette slugged a three-run homer to lead the Colorado Rockies to an 8-3 victory, snapping the San Diego Padres' four-game winning streak. </P>
<P> The Rockies broke the game open in the eighth off loser Willie Blair with successive run-scoring singles by Galarraga, Mike Kingery, Joe Girardi and Jason Bates. </P>
<P> Darren Holmes (1-0) earned the win with two perfect innings in relief of starter Bill Swift. Tim Mauser (0-1) was the loser in relief. </P>
