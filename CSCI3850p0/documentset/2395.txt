<P>  A new poll Thursday showed Democratic Sen. Charles Robb moving ahead of Republican challenger Oliver North by two percentage points in advance of Tuesday's election. </P>
<P> The statewide Virginia Commonwealth University poll of 807 likely voters showed Robb with 38 percent against North's 36 percent, and 15 percent for independent Republican Marshall Coleman. </P>
<P> With the margin of error plus or minus 3.5 percentage points, the poll showed the race a toss-up. </P>
<P> The last poll by the group Oct. 13 showed Robb and North deadlocked at 39 percent, with Coleman at 12 percent. </P>
<P> An earlier poll this week by Virginia's Roanoke College had Robb moving ahead 39 to 35 percent -- the equivalent of an even race since it had a four-point margin of error. Coleman had 14 percent with 12 percent undecided. </P>
