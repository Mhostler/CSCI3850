<P>  The Security Council, after a periodic review, made no changes on Thursday in sanctions imposed on Libya for failing to surrender for trial in Britain or the United States two men wanted in connection with the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, a Council source said. </P>
<P> There was no immediate move to toughen the sanctions by adding an embargo on Libyan oil, for which the United States said Monday it would try to win support among council members. </P>
