<P>  The country mansion of Prince Charles' old flame Camilla Parker Bowles has been sold to Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason for $2.1 million, newspapers reported Thursday. </P>
<P> Eighteenth century Middlewick House in Corsham, southern England, including gatekeeper's cottage, stables and resident ghost, was sold as part of a divorce settlement between Camilla and her army brigadier husband Andrew. </P>
<P> ``Camilla had many happy times there including meetings with Prince Charles but it has also been the scene of much heartache,'' a friend was quoted as saying in the Today tabloid. </P>
<P> The middle-aged mother of two who romanced the British royal heir in the 1970s was, and perhaps remains, the great love of Prince Charles' life but is the complete opposite from his estranged glamorous wife Diana, friends say. </P>
<P> The Sun newspaper said Camilla was ``upset'' to leave the mansion and would be moving, along with her staff, to a secret home in the Surrey stockbroker belt in southern England. </P>
<P> Mason, 50, who will be moving in with his wife Lynette in July said: ``We like Camilla's house very much.'' But he added: ``I'm not really interested in the royal connection. I'm more interested in the (traditional) ghost.'' </P>
