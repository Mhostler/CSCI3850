<P>  A Canadian housewife opened a walnut and was shocked to find a condom inside. </P>
<P> ``When I cracked one open for my son, I discovered a condom inside,'' Tracy Chalcraft of Chatham, Ontario, told the Canadian Press news agency. </P>
<P> The supermarket where she bought the nuts gave her a $20 food voucher as compensation, but its manager was at a loss for an explanation of how the unused prophylactic got there. </P>
<P> The item apparently came from a nearby sex shop that sells walnuts with condoms as a novelty and a prankster may have tossed one into the supermarket's bulk foods section. </P>
