<DATELINE>GAZA, April 21 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  PLO leader Yasser Arafat said on Friday he was happy Gazan pilgrims were travelling to Mecca for the first time on Palestinian passports. </P>
<P> But he criticised Israel's seizure of travel documents for other Palestinians. </P>
<P> Around 500 Palestinians from the self-ruled Gaza Strip left Gaza for Egypt on Friday on their way to Mecca in Saudi Arabia for the haj pilgrimage, a sacred duty in Islam. </P>
<P> ``I am very happy that... I had the opportunity to say farewell to our pilgrims who are going to Saudi Arabia for the haj and I am very happy that they are carrying Palestinian passports for the first time,'' Arafat told reporters. </P>
<P> Arafat's self-rule Authority in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank-Jericho enclave began issuing passports to Palestinians in the two self-rule areas earlier this month under the terms of an Israel-PLO interim peace deal. </P>
<P> In the past, most Palestinian pilgrims from the West Bank and Gaza traveled on passports or travel permits issued by Jordan or Egypt. </P>
<P> ``I am very sorry that till now the Israeli government are still insisting to confiscate the 4,000 Palestinian passports which will prevent our pilgrimage from (most of) the West Bank...which reflects negatively on the whole peace process,'' Arafat said. </P>
<P> Earlier this month, Israel seized 4,080 PLO-issued passports bearing the names of Palestinians in parts of the West Bank still under Israeli occupation, saying the documents were issued in violation of the peace accord. </P>
<P> Israel said a Palestinian official was trying to smuggle the documents to Jordan for pilgrims to use to travel to Mecca. </P>
<P> ``We see this as a sharp violation of the (1993 Israeli-PLO) accord on self-rule in Gaza and Jericho, which allows the Palestinian Authority to issue passports only to residents of the self-rule areas,'' an Israeli army spokesman said. </P>
<P> Israel and the PLO signed their interim peace deal in September 1993 and have since been negotiating implementation of Palestinian self-rule in the rest of the West Bank. </P>
<P> PLO officials have also complained that Saudi officials had cut the haj pilgrimage quota for Palestinians from Israel, the West Bank and Gaza to 10,000 this year from 15,000. </P>
