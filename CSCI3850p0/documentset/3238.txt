<P>  The crisis in California's Orange County produced its first layoffs Thursday, as Saddleback Valley Unified School District told 47 employees they had one more day on the job. </P>
<P> District spokeswoman Elaine Carter said the employees who were dismissed included custodians, clerks and classroom aides. </P>
<P> They were laid off, Carter added, because school officials are ``unsure what type of loss the district will take'' as a result of Orange County's investment debacle. </P>
<P> The county declared bankruptcy last week after disclosing losses in its investment pool that are now estimated at $2 billion. </P>
<P> Saddleback Valley has $66 million invested in the county pool, which was frozen when the county declared bankruptcy. About $42 million of the total invested is used by the district for day-to-day operations. </P>
<P> The employee cutbacks will affect both part and full-time district workers who were hired in recent weeks, Carter said. </P>
<P> Saddleback Valley has 35 schools, with about 29,000 students and about 1,830 employees. </P>
<P> Carter said upcoming school district payrolls would be met despite the county's financial crisis. </P>
