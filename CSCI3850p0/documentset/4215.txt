<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao faced a fresh challenge Wednesday from rival Arjun Singh, thrown out of the ruling Congress party, as a survey forecast the party would be trounced in a key state election this week. </P>
<P> ``Political matters are not decided in a court of law,'' Singh told reporters after the party's disciplinary committee voted five to one Tuesday to expel the former Cabinet minister. </P>
<P> ``It can only be decided by the court of Congressmen and the court of the people.'' </P>
<P> The disciplinary committee, dominated by Rao loyalists, accused Singh of committing a serious breach of discipline by spreading ``propaganda'' and trying to harm the party's prestige. </P>
<P> Singh, who resigned as human resources minister Dec. 24 after Congress was routed in state elections, has accused Rao of ignoring Muslims and Hindu lower castes -- the party's power base. </P>
<P> Singh said he would not float a new party as former Prime Minister V.P. Singh did in 1987 after Congress threw him out. </P>
<P> But Arjun Singh made it clear he would not be silenced. ``If anyone feels that I have been expelled from the ranks of workers, they are sadly mistaken,'' he said. </P>
<P> Surendra Mohan of the opposition Janata Dal party said: ``This expulsion only means that the split is inevitable.'' </P>
<P> The Hindustan Times said: ``Mr Narasimha Rao will be committing a major folly if he assumes that with the expulsion of his key rival, his troubles are over.'' </P>
<P> Rao's immediate headache was elections this week in the western state of Maharashtra, which accounts for almost one quarter of the country's industrial output. </P>
<P> Maharashtra's 52 million voters go to the polls on Thursday and Sunday, with vote-counting delayed until March 11. </P>
<P> ``Never before has Congress appeared to head for an upheaval so close to a crucial electoral fight,'' The Hindu daily said. </P>
<P> A poll by the independent Center for Media Studies said Congress would lose half its seats in the Maharashtra assembly and surrender power to an alliance including the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). </P>
<P> ``This election in Maharashtra signals the end of the monopoly of Congress among its traditional vote banks,'' The Pioneer quoted center chairman Bhaskara Rao as saying, referring to Muslims and lower-caste voters. </P>
<P> The results of polling in five other states will also be announced in March, except in the northeastern state of Manipur which was set to count votes on Feb. 20. </P>
<P> The Times of India said if Congress fared badly in the polls, dissidents might launch a campaign to force Rao to step down from the party leadership. Rao has said he will not call general elections before his five-year term ends in mid-1996. </P>
<P> Within hours of Singh's expulsion, Rao visited Sonia Gandhi, who inherited political clout following the 1991 assassination of her husband, former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. </P>
<P> Rajiv Gandhi was the son of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, whose father Jawaharlal Nehru was independent India's first premier. </P>
<P> Singh is close to Sonia Gandhi, who as the standard-bearer of the Gandhi dynasty commands fervid support from a large segment of Congress. The enigmatic Gandhi caused a political stir last Saturday when she attended a party hosted by Singh. </P>
<P> Rao's meeting with Gandhi at her heavily guarded New Delhi bungalow was interpreted as an effort to contain fallout from the decision to expel his rival. </P>
<P> ``Mrs Sonia Gandhi will have to openly come out in his (Singh's) support for a significant change to take place in the party's future,'' The Pioneer newspaper said. </P>
