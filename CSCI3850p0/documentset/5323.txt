<DATELINE>TUNCELI, Turkey (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Up to 15,000 Turkish troops have launched an offensive against Kurdish guerrillas in eastern Turkey, military officials said Thursday as Turkish forces continued an 11-day-old incursion into northern Iraq. </P>
<P> Convoys of military vehicles blocked the roads in and around mountainous Tunceli province for an expected assault on well-entrenched Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) positions there. </P>
<P> ``This is going to be like the north Iraq offensive,'' a military official told Reuters. </P>
<P> Troops, including airborne units and special forces, backed by long-range artillery have been converging on the province from other parts of the country for the last three days. </P>
<P> Security officials reported clashes taking place on the mountainous border between Tunceli and neighboring Erzincan province. It was unclear if this was part of the new drive. </P>
<P> The total number of soldiers posted in Tunceli may reach over 30,000, they said. About 35,000 troops have been hunting the PKK in northern Iraq since March 20. </P>
<P> Turkey launched a huge offensive on the PKK in Tunceli over the winter which the military later acknowledged had produced few results. </P>
<P> The guerrillas, ensconced in mountains towering more than 10,000 feet, ambushed a military convoy in Tunceli in mid-March, killing 18 soldiers. </P>
<P> The attack cast doubt on Turkish assurances that the PKK was all but defeated inside Turkey. </P>
