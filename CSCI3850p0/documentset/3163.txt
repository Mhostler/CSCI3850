<P>  As high waves and strong winds continued to pound a crippled cargo ship adrift in the North Pacific, the U.S. Coast Guard Monday launched a helicopter rescue of the 27 stranded crew members. </P>
<P> The helicopter evacuation started Monday afternoon from the Coast Guard cutter Munro, which arrived at the scene earlier in the day, Coast Guard spokesman Randy Midgett said. A helicopter carried on the cutter was expected to ferry three or four crew members at a time, Midgett said. </P>
<P> The crew members huddled since Friday in the hull of the Hyundai Seattle, a Greek Cypriot cargo ship en route from Pusan, South Korea, to Seattle. The ship has been drifting for days without power about 550 miles south of the Aleutian island of Adak, officials said. </P>
<P> The ship was hit by a fire that blazed Friday and Saturday, and was reported to have rolled to a 30-degree list. No injuries were reported to the mostly Filipino crew, however, and Coast Guard rescuers have dropped food and supplies to the stricken vessel. </P>
<P> The weather continues to be too poor to allow the cutter to come alongside the Hyundai Seattle, Midgett said. </P>
<P> Waves of 30 to 40 feet and winds up to 50 knots have precluded a ship rescue by other merchant vessels in the area, he said. </P>
<P> ``The weather on scene is extremely hazardous,'' he said. </P>
<P> The crew members and the ship's Greek captain are scheduled to be ferried by the Coast Guard cutter to land, Midgett said. </P>
<P> ``They're dry and they're still alive. I'm sure it hasn't been the greatest 48 hours, or 72 hours for them,'' he said. </P>
<P> Alaska Air National Guard and U.S. Air Force aircraft were standing by in Adak to assist with the rescue if needed, officials said. </P>
