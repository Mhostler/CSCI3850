<DATELINE>PSKOV, Russia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Boris Yeltsin stood on Russia's disputed border with Estonia Wednesday and vowed Moscow would not give up ``one single centimeter'' of land. </P>
<P> The Baltic country is demanding the return of some 750 square miles of territory now in Russia which belonged to it before World War II. </P>
<P> But Yeltsin, on a brief visit to the border point of Kunichina Gora, told frontier guards: ``We will not give up one single centimeter (0.4 inch) of land no matter who claims it. They (territorial claims) are futile.'' </P>
<P> The land Estonia wants returned belonged to it between 1920 and 1940, the year when the Soviet Union annexed Estonia and dictator Josef Stalin handed over some of its territory to Russia's Leningrad and Pskov regions. </P>
<P> Russia began erecting a fence last August along the existing border after Tallinn renewed its claims. </P>
<P> The blunt comment by the Kremlin leader, who was accompanied by Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, was certain to cast a deeper shadow over already uneven relations with Estonia. </P>
<P> There was no immediate substantial reaction to Yeltsin's visit from Tallinn. But Estonian Foreign Minister Juri Luik, in a comment to Hommikuleht newspaper made ahead of the visit, said Yeltsin's trip could hardly be seen as friendly. </P>
<P> ``As far as President Yeltsin's visit to the border is concerned, Estonia can in no way view it as a sign of friendship,'' Luik said. </P>
<P> Yeltsin, in separate comments to reporters after arriving at Pskov airport, declared that foreign intelligence services were exploiting the border ``to penetrate the territory of Russia.'' </P>
<P> He said Russia needed a strong border with Estonia to protect itself against these agents and smugglers from the Baltics. </P>
<P> At the same time, however, it had to be a ``human one'' across which Russians living on each side of the border could freely visit each other, Yeltsin said. </P>
<P> Last August Russia pulled its remaining troops out of Estonia which gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. </P>
<P> But some nationalists in Estonia are still angry over a deal which has allowed Moscow to keep a nuclear submarine reactor operating until September 1995. </P>
<P> Russia, for its part, is unhappy with Tallinn over the legal status which ethnic Russians have in Estonia. </P>
<P> Estonia insists Russia should return the district of Pechory -- called Petseri in Estonia -- by its south-eastern frontier and a slice of land east of the Narva river, which belonged to it between the two world wars. </P>
<P> It says the only document setting out the border is the Tartu Peace Treaty of 1920. </P>
