<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Talk show host Oprah Winfrey, presenting a communications award to author Toni Morrison, told an assembly of women who work in communications Tuesday to use their newly attained power wisely. </P>
<P> Hosting the annual awards presentation by the New York Women in Communication Inc. honoring women in books, magazines, broadcasting, newspapers, advertising and public relations, Winfrey paid homage to the women who broke ground in public speaking and writing. </P>
<P> ``I never forget them. I believe they are all bridges I crossed over,'' she said. ``I often think of (abolitionist) Sojourner Truth up there somewhere saying, 'You got a talk show?''' </P>
<P> She urged women in the audience to concentrate on a ''message of hope'' rather than ratings. She recently suffered a ratings drop after directing her own show toward spirituality and away from sensationalism. </P>
<P> Morrison, winner of both a Pulitzer and Nobel Prize and author of ``Beloved,'' to which Oprah has acquired the movie option, said women's voices historically have been muffled or downgraded as ``evil, mischievous, lies, gossip, small talk, rumor, lore (and) old wives' tales.'' </P>
<P> Other award winners included New York Times Assistant Managing Editor Carolyn Lee; ABC News reporter Cokie Roberts; Harper's Bazaar editor-in-chief Elizabeth Tilberis; Ogilvy & Mather President, North America, Shelley Lazarus; and Patricia Matson, vice president at Capital Cities/ABC. </P>
<P> The group released a survey of 288 media executives showing 81 percent of women and 96 percent of men believe there have been ``vast or considerable improvements in opportunities for women in communications'' in the last 25 years. </P>
<P> But 43 percent of women feel ``opportunities for men are better,'' while only 10 percent of males agree with that statement. </P>
<P> Only 31 percent of the women surveyed would describe opportunities for women as ``excellent,'' compared with 71 percent of men. </P>
<P> The survey was conducted by the women's media group, Baruch College and CDB Research and Consulting. </P>
