<P>  Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres blamed Syria Wednesday for the slow pace of peace talks between the countries and said he doubted an accord was imminent. </P>
<P> ``Ostensibly you can reach an agreement by the middle of 1995 (but) I'm not so sure that with the Syrian rhythm we can really attain it,'' Peres told a news conference while on a state visit to Venezuela. </P>
<P> The Israeli-Syrian peace talks, which opened in Madrid in 1991, have been stalled over withdrawal from the Golan Heights, a 600-square-mile territory captured by Israel from Syria during the 1967 war. </P>
<P> Also at issue are security arrangements to be implemented after the signing of any future peace treaty. </P>
<P> Peres said Syria was blocking talks by demanding concessions before substantive negotiations begin. </P>
<P> ``We do not demand that Syria change at the opening stage (of negotiations) her positions,'' he said. ``But the Syrians are asking that Israel first of all accept the Syrian position and then negotiate. Well, you don't start negotiations like this.'' </P>
<P> Peres added that Israel will ``have to be on the giving side'' to achieve peace with Syria. </P>
<P> ``We shall have to give them back a mountain or a part of a mountain in real terms and what we shall get back is a mountain of promises,'' he said. </P>
<P> Peres added that Israel was ``very seriously trying to complete the peace process in the Middle East'' by reaching accords with Syria and Lebanon similar to those it has struck with Jordan and the Palestinians. </P>
<P> Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara was quoted in Damascus earlier Wednesday as expressing similar doubts about an early breakthrough with Israel. </P>
<P> But the U.S. State Department's number three official, Peter Tarnoff, told reporters in Washington that U.S. leaders believe Syria and Israel are ``moving ahead very positively.'' </P>
<P> Peres, who shared the 1994 Nobel peace prize with Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, was in Caracas on the first leg of a tour through Latin America. </P>
<P> In other comments, he said Israel was ready to be a partner in greater trade links throughout the Middle East but ``the big question is not if Israel will integrate in the economy of the Mediterranean people, but whether the Mediterranean people will integrate in the 20th century.'' </P>
