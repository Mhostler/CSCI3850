<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Prosecutors abruptly rested their case against accused ``Hollywood Madam'' Heidi Fleiss on Friday, without calling as witnesses two of her alleged call girls who had been expected to testify. </P>
<P> Deputy District Attorney Alan Carter rested after presenting only four witnesses over three days -- a fact that appeared to please defense attorneys. </P>
<P> ``Obviously, there's some problem with respect to those other two (alleged call girl) witnesses, or they would have been called,'' said Fleiss attorney Donald Marks. ``I was surprised.'' </P>
<P> Fleiss, 28, the daughter of a prominent Los Angeles pediatrician, is accused of running a high-priced prostitution ring catering to the rich and famous in Hollywood. </P>
<P> She faces five counts of pandering -- securing women for prostitution -- and one count of cocaine possession, which could land her in prison for up to 11 years if convicted. </P>
<P> Carter's final witness was Kimberly Burch, who was one of four women arrested during a June 9 sting operation at the Beverly Hilton hotel. </P>
<P> Burch, who testified by videotape because she has been ill, in large part echoed Wednesday's turn on the stand by self-confessed call girl Samantha Burdette. </P>
<P> But Burch -- who, like Burdette has been granted immunity against prosecution in exchange for her testimony -- said she had never been paid for sex before Fleiss sent her to the hotel that night. </P>
<P> ``I never had to do it,'' she said. </P>
<P> Burch, who appeared on the brink of tears during much of the videotaped questioning, did say that she expected to get paid $1,500 for sex that night. </P>
<P> ``When you went into the hotel room, you expected to engage in sex for money, is that right?'' Carter asked. </P>
<P> ``Yes I did,'' she answered. </P>
<P> The case has gained worldwide attention in the expectation that Fleiss' so-called ``black book'' of customers would reveal the names of celebrities and Hollywood moguls who were her clients. </P>
<P> But her co-defense attorney, Anthony Brooklier, has said he was unlikely to name names because he did not want to wreck marriages or hurt the children of those marriages. </P>
<P> Asked Thursday about Fleiss' clients, he said they were ''high-end male customers ... men of importance, from all walks of life, including the film industry.'' </P>
<P> Brooklier has never denied that Fleiss ran the supposed call girl ring, but has sought to prove that the crime, if any, was victimless and that she was entrapped by a police sting in which an undercover detective, posing as a Japanese businessman, asked her to supply four girls to have sex with his colleagues. </P>
<P> The attorney has also maintained that in the history of the 101-year-old California statue against prostitution, not one male customer has been prosecuted. </P>
<P> Fleiss and her father also are scheduled to stand trial in federal court in January on charges that they laundered hundreds of thousands of dollars in proceeds from Fleiss' alleged call girl ring. Both have pleaded not guilty. </P>
