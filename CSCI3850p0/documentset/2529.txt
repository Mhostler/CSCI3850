<P>  Hillary Clinton says she does not plan to end her involvement in formulating policy to play a more traditional role as America's First Lady. </P>
<P> In an interview with BBC television, which released extracts Thursday, she said she had been hurt by some of the attacks on her still-born plan to overhaul the U.S. health-care system. But, speaking before President Clinton's Democrats were mauled in Tuesday's elections, she denied the interpretation of some commentators that she was in retreat and intended to be a more traditional president's wife in the future. </P>
<P> ``No, no they've never been right: it gives me a good laugh every time I read it,'' she said. ``I will be involved in doing what I can on those issues that I have both an interest in and an expertise and that the president asks me to work on. </P>
<P> ``Those are issues that I have a traditional interest in -- education issues, family issues, health care,'' she said. </P>
<P> She said she had not sought a political career herself because there are different ways of serving without running for office. ``Besides, I am married to the greatest political person of our generation,'' she said. </P>
<P> The BBC interviewed her for a documentary that will be broadcast Saturday. </P>
