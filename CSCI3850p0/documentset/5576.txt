<P> A Prison spokeswoman said Ingram declined his last meal as well as the chance to make a last statement. He was frightened when guards escorted him to a holding cell adjacent to the electric chair but later appeared sullen, asking only for a cup of coffee. </P>
<P> Ingram, who was born in Cambridge, England, to a British mother and an American father, was executed for the 1983 murder of 55-year-old J.C. Sawyer. </P>
<P> Then 19, Ingram forced his way into the Sawyer home in the Atlanta suburb of Cobb County, tied the man and his wife, Mary Eunice Sawyer, to a tree and shot both of them in the head. </P>
<P> Mr. Sawyer died but Mrs. Sawyer -- now remarried as Mary Eunice Jones -- was only grazed. She feigned death and then ran for help after Ingram had absconded with $60 and the couple's vintage pickup truck. </P>
