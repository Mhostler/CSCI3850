<P>  Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina gave a spirited defense of Cuba's political system Tuesday, saying his people were not ``political chameleons'' who would change color to protect themselves. </P>
<P> Robaina, speaking at a solidarity meeting, also condemned President Clinton's forthcoming Summit of the Americas in Miami to which President Fidel Castro has not been invited. </P>
<P> Robaina cited a delegate's comment that the summit without Cuba amounted to a ``mutilation of America.'' </P>
<P> Washington has invited heads of state and government it views as democratically elected, and Cuba will be the odd man out at the Dec. 9-11 meeting in Miami. </P>
<P> Delighting a supportive audience of some 2,500 delegates from around the world, Robaina said that Cuba was not going to fall like any other wall -- a reference to the fall of the Berlin Wall five years ago and the collapse of communism in the former Soviet Union and old East bloc. </P>
<P> Cuba was not ashamed and was not going to be ashamed of ''embracing the ideas of men like Marx and Lenin,'' Robaina said to applause from the audience at Havana's Karl Marx Theater. </P>
<P> And his country would not make changes because anyone told it to do so, Robaina added. </P>
<P> ``We're not political chameleons who change color in order to protect themselves,'' he told the delegates, gathered to show support for Cuba against Washington's longstanding economic embargo. </P>
<P> Robaina and other Cuban leaders who spoke on the opening day Monday stressed that Cuba's current process of economic reform is not aimed at dismantling socialism. </P>
<P> Aside from condemning the trade ban, which he said hurt U.S. business as well as Cuba, Robaina called the Miami summit ill-planned. </P>
<P> Cuba supported any meeting that was good for Latin America, he said, but this meeting was being held with a poorly defined agenda that suggested ``little seriousness.'' </P>
<P> This week's solidarity meeting, which lasts until Friday, has drawn representatives of left-wing political parties, trade unions and Cuba solidarity groups from some 108 countries. </P>
<P> It is part of Havana's efforts to rally support against a 32-year-old embargo that Washington maintains in order to pressure the Caribbean island into political and economic reform. </P>
<P> Castro presided over the event Monday and Tuesday morning, but has so far not addressed the meeting. </P>
