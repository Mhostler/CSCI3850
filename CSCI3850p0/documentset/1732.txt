<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Antonio Di Pietro, Italy's most famous anti-graft judge, is being investigated by fellow magistrates after a man he sent to jail accused him of slander and abuse of office, judicial sources said Saturday. </P>
<P> Lawyers for financier Sergio Cusani filed the complaint against Di Pietro in the northern city of Brescia, forcing magistrates there to put their fellow judge on a list of people being investigated. </P>
<P> The procedure is routine in Italy when a complaint is filed in which someone is accused of breaking the law. </P>
<P> This is far less significant than a judicial warrant, which magistrates issue after they have investigated a complaint and suspect a crime may have been committed. </P>
<P> Di Pietro, who has spearheaded Italy's two-year judicial crusade against rife political and business corruption, was the public prosecutor at a trial that sentenced Cusani to eight years in jail last April. </P>
<P> The financier was convicted of channelling huge bribes from Italy's Ferruzzi foods-to-chemicals group to politicians. </P>
<P> Cusani's lawyers have accused Di Pietro of slandering the financier during the trial and disregarding evidence they said could have helped his defense. </P>
