<DATELINE>PARIS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  French media Thursday pronounced Bernard Tapie ``KO'd'' and ``finished'' after a court declared him bankrupt, but friends of the dashing self-made tycoon warned his political foes they had not seen the last of him. </P>
<P> The media declared unanimously that Paris' Tribunal of Commerce had wrecked Tapie's political career by stripping him of his seats in the French and European parliaments and banning him from running for public office for five years. </P>
<P> The rags-to-riches left-wing maverick, long a protege of President Francois Mitterrand, immediately appealed Wednesday's ruling and accused ``the government and its justice system'' of seeking to eliminate him. </P>
<P> ``The struggle continues,'' Tapie, 51, said in a typically defiant statement, adding that he would fight to prevent conservative Prime Minister Edouard Balladur from being elected president. </P>
<P> Jean-Francois Hory, head of the Radical Party which hoped to field Tapie as a candidate in next year's presidential election, accused ``the aristocracy which confiscated the Republic'' of seizing on a commercial dispute to try get rid of Tapie. </P>
<P> ``I warn Mr. Balladur and his government not to count their chickens before they are hatched because Tapie has proved he could get out of difficult situations,'' Hory told television. </P>
<P> ``He is not down. He is serene, calm and in fighting mood, determined to counterattack,'' Hory said after calling on Tapie, closeted in his 17th-century Paris mansion, which had been due to go under the hammer Thursday to pay for his huge debts to the state bank Credit Lyonnais. </P>
<P> A side effect of the ruling was to delay the auction of the mansion, one of the last jewels in Tapie's shattered empire. </P>
<P> Tapie's lawyer, Thierry Levy, told reporters there were many ways of reversing the judgment. ``Give me some time to reflect and to choose my weapons,'' he said. </P>
<P> But commentators said the ex-Cabinet minister and former Marseille soccer club boss seemed certain to lose his chance of being elected mayor of Marseille next year, which would have given him a formidable power base. </P>
<P> Under French law, a bankrupt person may not hold or run for public office for five years and appeal does not automatically stop implementation of the rulings, although his lawyers applied for a stay of execution. </P>
<P> A spokesman for the Constitutional Council said Tapie would be ineligible until a court ruled on his appeal. </P>
<P> Tapie served in a Cabinet in 1992-93 as minister of urban affairs and led Marseille to win the European Cup in 1993, but the club was barred from European soccer and relegated to the second division this year in a match-rigging scandal. </P>
