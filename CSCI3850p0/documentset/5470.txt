<P>  Egyptian film director Youssef Chahine, who battled Islamists in court to release his film, said moderates and militants must talk to one another to prevent Egypt from becoming another Algeria. </P>
<P> ``The problem is that of fundamentalism against freedom of expression,'' Chahine told a packed meeting at the Egyptian journalists' union Tuesday night. </P>
<P> His film ``el-Mohager'' (The Emigrant) was held up pending the outcome of court proceedings. </P>
<P> ``We should talk first before using arms against each other,'' he said in his first appearance since the court ruling. ``We can all see what is happening in Algeria because of the lack of democracy. Innocent people are being killed, including intellectuals and journalists.'' </P>
<P> An Egyptian court banned Chahine's film after a militant lawyer said its plot closely resembled the story of Joseph, thus violating Islamic rules against portrayal of a prophet. </P>
<P> Chahine won on appeal, calming fears of Egyptian secularists who saw militants using courts to control cultural activities. </P>
