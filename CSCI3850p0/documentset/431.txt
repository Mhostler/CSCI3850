<P>  A cache of fossil specimens that provide important evidence about extinct animals and ancient Indians has been unearthed at the tourist attraction Monkey Jungle, researchers said Wednesday. </P>
<P> The more than 5,000 specimens found on the site include bone and shell tools and burnt bones considered evidence of cooking by the Paleo Indians, who lived 10,000 years ago. </P>
<P> Archeologists also unearthed thousands of bones from extinct animals such as the short-faced cave bear, Pleistocene horse and saber tooth tiger. </P>
<P> ``This will be an important data bank for scientists for years and years to come,'' said Dade County Archeologist Robert Carr. </P>
<P> Set in a small hardwood jungle, Monkey Jungle was founded in 1933 as North America's first colony of free-ranging monkeys. Its owners had been aware that potentially important fossil deposits were on the site since the 1960s. </P>
<P> But current research only began with a state grant they received for cleanup following Hurricane Andrew, the powerful hurricane that lashed the region in August 1992. </P>
