<P>  An exchange of gunfire allegedly occurred in Pyongyang last month between followers of North Korea's new leader Kim Jong-il and his half-brother Kim Pyong-il, South Korea's domestic Yonhap news agency said Thursday. </P>
<P> Yonhap said seven or eight people were reported killed or wounded in the shootout. </P>
<P> The agency said the allegation was made Wednesday by Kim Young-hoon, a Korean-American researcher at the U.S. National Security Council, during a seminar. </P>
<P> According to Kim, North Korean officials informed senior Chinese officials in Hunchun of an abrupt postponement due to ``an urgent situation'' of an international conference scheduled for December in the North, Yonhap said. </P>
<P> Asked about the ``urgent situation,'' Pyongyang officials were quoted by Hunchun officials as saying, ``an exchange of shots took place in Pyongyang between Dec. 12 and 17 between the followers of Kim Jong-il and Kim Pyong-il. Seven or eight persons were killed or wounded in the incident,'' Yonhap said. </P>
<P> Kim Pyong-il is now the North's ambassador to Finland. </P>
<P> ``The shooting incident, however, ended in itself. In spite of rumors about Kim Jong-il's health, there seems to be no room for doubt that Kim Jong-il has grasped complete power in North Korea,'' Kim Young-hoon was quoted as saying. </P>
<P> Yonhap said Kim Young-hoon traveled to Beijing and Hunchun to meet senior Chinese officials before arriving in Seoul Tuesday. </P>
<P> Kim Young-hoon was not available for comment. </P>
<P> South Korean and U.S. intelligence officials said this week they saw no signs of a power struggle against Kim Jong-il. </P>
<P> ``We see nothing at this point to suggest that there is a succession struggle in North Korea,'' outgoing CIA Director James Woolsey told the Senate Intelligence Committee Tuesday. </P>
<P> South Korea's intelligence chief Kwon Young-hae was reported as saying Tuesday that Kim Jong-il is likely to be installed as president of North Korea in May, although that could be delayed until Oct. 10, the 50th anniversary of the North's ruling Workers' Party. </P>
<P> Kwon, head of the Agency for National Security Planning, added that his agency saw no sign of a power struggle against Kim. </P>
<P> Kim Jong-il, the eldest son of supreme leader Kim Il-sung, was groomed for decades to take over from his father, who died last July. </P>
<P> While hailed as leader in the state press, the younger Kim has yet to be formally named president or leader of the ruling Communist Party, raising speculation of sickness or a power struggle. </P>
