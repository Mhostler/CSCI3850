<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Two researchers pleaded not guilty Monday to charges that they lied to the government about an experimental drug linked to several deaths. </P>
<P> John Najarian, 67, former chairman of surgery at the University of Minnesota Medical School, and a one-time colleague there, Richard Condie, 68, were ordered to stand trial on the charges Aug. 7 during an appearance before a federal magistrate. </P>
<P> Najarian pleaded not guilty to all 17 counts of an indictment handed up against him last week by a federal grand jury. Condie did the same for the four counts lodged against him. </P>
<P> The indictment charges that both men engaged in a lengthy conspiraracy to ``falsify, conceal and cover up'' information the Food and Drug Administration should have been given about antilymphocyte globulin or ALG, an anti-rejection drug for organ transplants. </P>
<P> The two were accused of failing to report adverse reactions, including nine deaths, among patients given the drug. The indictments also allege theft, tax evasion and other offenses and contend that Najarian lied to the FDA in saying that the drug was not being sold or making a profit. </P>
<P> The deaths occurred from 1969 to 1989 during a time when the drug was being sold to other medical centers as if it had won government approval even though it was still an experimental drug, the indictment said. </P>
<P> The FDA halted distribution of the drug in 1992. </P>
<P> ``I'm innocent on every one of the counts,'' Najarian, a transplant surgeon, told reporters after his court appearance. </P>
<P> ``I'm sorry I have to spend all this time away from my patients. I will continue to practice. That is the most important thing in my life. My patients are calling like crazy and this whole thing is devastating for me personally,'' he added. Najarian is now in private practice. </P>
<P> The Department of Health and Human Services said it had been investigating the university's ALG program for more than two years. The anti-rejection drug was developed with grants from the department. </P>
