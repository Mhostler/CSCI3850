<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Everything went wrong for the Buffalo Sabres Sunday -- a 6-1 trouncing by the Tampa Bay Lightning, yet another injury and a fight between two coaches and a fan. </P>
<P> Denis Savard had a hand in the first three goals and Chris Gratton had a goal and three assists as the Lightning set a club record with five power-play goals. </P>
<P> Rookie Alexander Selivanov scored a pair of goals and Brian Bradley added a goal and two assists for the Lightning, who won consecutive road games on back-to-back days after a five-game losing streak. </P>
<P> The Sabres were without goaltender Dominik Hasek, who has an injured shoulder, and suffered another in a long line of injuries five minutes into the third period when defenseman Alexei Zhitnik injured his right leg in a collision. </P>
<P> After the game, Buffalo coach John Muckler tried to punch a fan and assistant coach John Tortorella grabbed the fan and tried to pull him over the guardrail, ripping the man's jacket. Muckler did not comment on the altercation after the game, replying only ``Next question'' when asked. </P>
<P> The Sabres had chance after chance to break the game open in the first period with five power-play chances, including a full two minutes with a two-man advantage during which they failed to get off a single shot. </P>
<P> ``Everything went wrong,'' said Buffalo defenseman Petr Svoboda. ``There is no excuse to lose to a team like this at home, 6-1.'' </P>
<P> ``A key weekend for us, things were kind of falling apart,'' said Tampa Bay goalie Daren Puppa, who made 24 saves. ``The key was the first period. They had five power plays and the 5-on-3 and they never got a shot on goal.'' </P>
<P> Alexander Mogilny scored Buffalo's only goal. </P>
<P> In Ottawa, Jaromir Jagr scored twice and Ron Francis had a goal and an assist as the Pittsburgh Penguins held on for a 4-3 victory over the Senators. </P>
<P> Jagr's league-best 22nd goal came 8:44 into the second period, giving the Penguins a 3-0 bulge when he banked the puck in off an Ottawa defenseman's leg from behind the net. </P>
<P> Larry Murphy scored the final goal for the Pens. </P>
<P> Randy Cunneyworth scored a pair of power-play goals for the Senators, who are winless in six of their last seven games. Alexei Yashin scored Ottawa's first goal. </P>
<P> League-leading Pittsburgh (19-8-2) had injuries to two top forwards. </P>
<P> Joe Mullen got a cut over his right eye when Ottawa's Lance Pitlick hit him with his stick on the follow-through of a shot. There was a lot of blood and Mullen did not return. </P>
<P> ``I got 15 to 20 stitches,'' said Mullen. ``It was only an accident.'' </P>
<P> John Cullen was kneed in the thigh by Ottawa's Troy Mallette midway through the second period and did not return. </P>
<P> ``We just happened to collide,'' Mallette said. ``He was on a turn, I was on a turn, I could have got hurt just as easily as he did. They have a couple of defensemen that knee people deliberately. I didn't mean to hurt Cullen.'' </P>
<P> At New Jersey, Stephane Richer blasted a slap shot from the top of the right circle through Blaine Lacher's pads with 96 seconds left in overtime for his second goal of the game to give the Devils a 4-3 victory over the Boston Bruins. </P>
<P> Tom Chorske and Bill Guerin also tallied for New Jersey. </P>
<P> Cam Neely got two power-play goals for Boston, including his 19th of the season to tie the game at 3-3 with 2:50 left in regulation. Mats Naslund scored Boston's first goal. </P>
<P> In Calgary, Todd Elik and Pat Falloon scored goals 1:31 apart and Jeff Friesen added an empty net goal to lead the San Jose Sharks to a come-from-behind 5-3 victory over the Calgary Flames. </P>
<P> The Sharks had lost nine of their previous 11 games, including their last four. </P>
<P> Goals by defensemen Zarley Zalapski and Steve Chiasson 1:25 apart had given the Flames a 3-2 lead with 6:19 remaining in the third period. </P>
<P> Jeff Friesen and Dody Wood gave San Jose a 2-0 lead before Joe Nieuwendyk scored Calgary's first goal. </P>
<P> In Winnipeg, Ed Belfour stopped 36 shots and the Chicago Blackhawks held on for a 3-2 victory. </P>
<P> Brent Sutter, Chris Chelios and Joe Murphy scored for Chicago, which has won its last two games following a four-game winless streak. The victory was the Blackhawks' first at Winnipeg since January 11, 1991. </P>
<P> Igor Korolev scored both goals for the Jets, who are winless in their last four games (0-3-1). </P>
<P> In Anaheim, Steve Duchesne had a goal and an assist and Al MacInnis set up three goals to lead the St Louis Blues to a 4-2 win over the Mighty Ducks. </P>
<P> Glenn Anderson, Brendan Shanahan and Vitali Karamnov also scored for St Louis. </P>
<P> Shaun van Allen and Bobby Dollas tallied for Anaheim. </P>
