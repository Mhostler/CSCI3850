<P>  Chechen independence fighters Saturday shot down a Russian SU-25 fighter plane just outside the Chechen capital of Grozny, a Russian television camera crew said. </P>
<P> The footage by the independent NTV channel showed parts of the blackened fuselage and turbines of the plane scattered in a field at a place called Geshy about three miles southeast of Grozny city limits. </P>
<P> Though Chechen irregulars have shot down Russian helicopters before, it was the first time they have brought down one of the deadly fighter planes which have carried out air raids on Grozny. </P>
<P> A member of the NTV crew said the plane was brought down by anti-aircraft fire at about 10:30 a.m. (2:30 a.m. EST). He said residents in the area had told him that the body of the dead pilot, an unnamed major, had been taken away. </P>
<P> The NTV footage showed a Chechen civilian holding up a bright orange parachute and harness from the wreckage. Smaller pieces of debris were scattered across about one mile. </P>
