<P>  Big differences remain between Washington and Tokyo on how to open Japan's auto and auto parts market to U.S. firms, but both sides want to settle the contentious trade issue, a senior U.S. negotiator said Friday. </P>
<P> ``I would characterize the mood as very businesslike, very serious, very cooperative and a clear desire on both sides to reach agreement after what has been a very long stretch,'' U.S. Undersecretary of Commerce Jeffrey Garten said of negotiations this week. </P>
<P> The United States is anxious to complete agreement on what officials have called the government's top trade priority by March 31. Garten, though, took care to say the date was not a deadline but a ``benchmark'' for talks to conclude. </P>
<P> The two sides have a long way to go before they narrow differences on the major issues. </P>
<P> ``Both sides worked very hard, but there is still a significant gulf between the U.S. and Japanese positions on all the significant issues,'' Garten said at a news conference at the conclusion of the senior level talks. </P>
<P> The United States is seeking to open Japan's huge auto market and it's highly regulated replacement parts market to more foreign competition. It also wants to beef up sales of U.S.-made parts to Japanese factories in North America. </P>
<P> Japanese car makers say the ``Big Three'' U.S. auto makers are responsible for a large share of the auto parts imported into the United States from Japan. The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said Chrysler, Ford and General Motors account for about $4 billion worth of parts imports from Japan, about one-third of the total. </P>
<P> Car and car parts trade has been a constant sore spot in relations between the two economic superpowers. It accounted for about two-thirds of the record $60 billion U.S. trade deficit with Japan last year. </P>
<P> This week's talks were the first on the car trade issue since September when they broke down. The car talks are part of an overall framework agreement on trade reached in 1993. </P>
<P> Garten said negotiators have been able to smooth over differences in one area that the two sides have clashed over in the past -- the idea of measuring progress once agreement is reached. </P>
<P> The United States has insisted on some ``objective criteria'' in measuring progress, which the Japanese interpreted as setting numerical targets for imports. They flat out rejected that idea. </P>
<P> Garten said there has been a lot of ``controversy'' and ''misunderstanding'' over the issue. </P>
<P> ``But after all this time, we have, I believe, a consensus technically on what that means,'' he said. </P>
<P> He described it as a ``yardstick'' by which progress can be judged. But the details of what those ``yardsticks'' are have to be worked out, another official said. </P>
<P> The two sides have agreed to hold another round of lower level talks to deal with technical issues by mid-February. Those discussions most likely will be held in Tokyo, but no date or location has been set, Garten said. </P>
