<DATELINE>ARAB, Ala., (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A tornado spawned by severe thunderstorms whipped across northern Alabama Thursday, killing at least five people and injuring more than 60, authorities said. </P>
<P> High winds tore through a trailer park just before dawn outside the towns of Arab and Joppa, located near the Tennessee River about 40 miles south of Huntsville. </P>
<P> ``There are reports of people missing and trapped in the debris from their homes this morning,'' said Scott Adcock, spokesman for the Alabama Emergency Management Agency in Montgomery. </P>
<P> Gov. Fob James called in the National Guard and is expected to request federal disaster aid. </P>
<P> Authorities said at least five people were killed by high winds while hospitals reported treating more than 60 people for injuries, many amounting to simple cuts and bruises. Two people were also reported missing. </P>
<P> The dead included 5-year-old Kristen Parker, who was inside an apartment complex leveled by the whirlwinds. </P>
<P> A neighbor, Virginia Robinson, huddled under a door frame with her teen-age son and daughter after a friend phoned the sleeping family and urged them to take cover. </P>
<P> ``The door went over me, furniture was flying and all I kept thinking was, 'Please, God, don't touch my kids,''' Robinson said. The family was unharmed, but their home was destroyed. </P>
<P> The other victims were two adult men killed in the Arab area as a direct result of the tornado, and two people who died in car crashes blamed on the weather, officials said. </P>
<P> The winds destroyed up to 200 homes in five Alabama counties, downed trees and power lines throughout the area, and left many areas without phone service. Tin roofs hung from trees, mobile homes lay on their sides and wreaths from a cemetery were strewn throughout the community. </P>
<P> The tornado ripped apart Joppa Elementary School, leaving soggy Valentines and basketball nets visible among the splintered rafters and broken bricks. </P>
<P> Principal Mickey Tankersly said he felt ill when he saw the destruction at the school, which had been rebuilt in 1973 after it was gutted by fire. </P>
<P> ``This is the last thing we needed. This is going to be so hard to deal with,'' Tankersly said. ``I don't even want to think about what it's going to cost this time.'' </P>
