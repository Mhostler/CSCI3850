<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The only way out of Mexico's current crisis is to accept much greater economic hardship in the months ahead and to accelerate the pace of political change, Mexico's new president Ernesto Zedillo told the New York Times in its Tuesday editions. </P>
<P> ``I know that this is going to be painful,'' Zedillo told The Times in a wide-ranging interview dealing with his first 100 days in office. </P>
<P> ``I know that nobody is going to like it. But this is what the country needs. It was said that I am not a good politician to put it that way. But some of the most traumatic experiences that we have had in Mexico around financial crises have had to do with the fact that people were not told the truth,'' he said. </P>
<P> Zedillo's first 100 days in office have been marked by turmoil and scandal. The country's economy is in dire straits and a series of revelations have tarnished Mexico's political landscape. </P>
<P> The new Mexican leader told The Times though he expected his first few months to be difficult, he was not prepared for how hard it has been. </P>
<P> ``I thought it was going to be rough,'' Zedillo said. ``But I must be honest -- I never expected anything as complex as to what we have lived through over these last three months. </P>
<P> His biggest surprise, he told The Times, has been the vulnerability of Mexico's economy. </P>
<P> Zedillo, a 43-year-old economist with a doctorate from Yale University, said he had not been able to foresee the seriousness of the huge short-term debts that Mexico was contracting. </P>
<P> He told The Times from his point of view, Mexico was merely the first so-called emerging economy to confront the growing power and immediacy of global financial markets. </P>
<P> ``It is obvious that the speed at which international financial markets have evolved over the last 25 years has been much faster than the capacity of governments and international organizations to cope,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``We have a new, global agreement on trade. But we don't have a new financial arrangement. So there's something missing there, and that's very dangerous for the world. Mexico was the first to pay for this problem,'' he told The Times. </P>
<P> Zedillo warmly praised the Clinton Administration for its $20 billion in help for Mexico's economic woes. </P>
<P> ``I am surprised at the speed with which the U.S. Government reacted,'' he told the paper, recalling the long struggle between Latin American debtors and the United States after Mexico led the region into its foreign debt crisis in the 1980's. ``Mr. Clinton,'' he added, ``was extremely quick to get it.'' </P>
<P> As for what Mexico needs now, Zedillo said his country needs some bold strokes. </P>
<P> ``Mexico now needs a high speed of change regarding democracy, regarding the rule of law,'' he said. ``And it is obvious what we have to do to make a better democratic system. We just have to do it.'' </P>
