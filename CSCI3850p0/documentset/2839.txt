<DATELINE>ROME (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi cast himself as the savior of Italy as an opinion poll Saturday suggested sympathy was swinging toward him despite a corruption probe. </P>
<P> More than 300 supporters of the billionaire businessman demonstrated against the investigation at the offices of Milan's ``Clean Hands'' magistrates Saturday in a protest organized by Berlusconi's Forza Italia party and other groups. </P>
<P> In a move that could buy valuable time for Berlusconi to strengthen his hand, the prime minister's lawyer said there was no immediate prospect that he would be questioned in the inquiry launched against him. </P>
<P> ``The questioning has been put off until a date that has yet to be set,'' lawyer Giuseppe De Luca told Italian radio. </P>
<P> He said the meeting would take place in Milan but the time and place had not been decided. </P>
<P> Berlusconi, elected in March on promises to end corruption in politics, suffered a hammer blow when Milan investigators informed him he was under inquiry over bribes his Fininvest business empire is alleged to have paid tax inspectors. </P>
<P> News of the investigation broke Tuesday as the suntanned tycoon-turned-politician was chairing a U.N. conference in Naples on organized crime and after voter support for Forza Italia slumped in local elections. </P>
<P> Swearing on the lives of his five children that he had done no wrong, Berlusconi has refused to resign over the affair. </P>
<P> He has instead called a cabinet meeting for Tuesday to try to rally his shaky six-month-old coalition -- and primarily the combative Northern League party -- around a program for government over the coming months. </P>
<P> He will also meet trade unions Wednesday for talks, which his aides believe should yield a compromise deal on his vital but unpopular cost-cutting 1995 budget and avert an eight-hour general strike set for December 2. </P>
<P> ``When you're chosen by the people it's like being annointed by the Lord. There's something divine about the citizen who picks a leader,'' Berlusconi told a rally of the small center-right UCD group in his coalition Friday. </P>
<P> ``It would be easy to say 'enough is enough', to say 'I've had it', but then that sense of responsibility prevails. We have the eyes of the world upon us and if I were to leave my post Italy would plunge into a mindless vacuum,'' he said. </P>
<P> An opinion poll published Saturday suggested that what La Stampa newspaper called Berlusconi's ``smile offensive'' was beginning to pay dividends. </P>
<P> The survey by the CIRM institute for Il Messaggero newspaper said 64 percent of Italians believed the Berlusconi government should stay on as things stand and that 54 percent thought it should continue after the budget goes through parliament. </P>
<P> The opposition has said it wants Berlusconi to quit when the budget becomes law, a process that must be over by the end of this year. </P>
<P> The survey also showed respondents split down the middle on whether the magistrates, whose inquiries toppled Italy's corrupt old guard, were using their office in a political plot to get Berlusconi. </P>
<P> The prime minister, who has tried and failed to rein in the magistrates since coming to power, denied Saturday that he was ``at war'' with the judiciary but repeated his accusation that they were part of a conspiracy. </P>
<P> Referring to Saturday's demonstration at Milan's Palace of Justice and a second protest set for Sunday in the northern city of Turin, he said his mainly middle-class voters were ready to march on the streets to defend him. </P>
<P> ``It is a way of showing solidarity for the leader who embodies their expectations, their enthusiasm, their hopes,'' Berlusconi told Corriere della Sera newspaper. </P>
