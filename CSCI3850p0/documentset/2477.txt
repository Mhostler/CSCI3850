<P>  Al Cowlings, the long-time friend of O.J. Simpson who took him on a wild freeway drive on the day of his June 17 arrest on double murder charges, will not be charged with aiding the flight of a fugitive, District Attorney Gil Garcetti said Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``The evidence was insufficient to warrant prosecution. There is no developing investigation under way. We cannot prove the case. It does not meet our filing standards,'' Garcetti said. </P>
