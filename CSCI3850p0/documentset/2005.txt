<DATELINE>MELBOURNE, Australia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A former Catholic priest was sentenced Friday to 18 years in jail for sexually abusing altar boys and other children between 1961 and 1982. </P>
<P> Gerald Risdale, 60, who was described in earlier hearings as the most notorious pedophile in Australia, had pleaded guilty to 46 charges of sexually abusing children. </P>
<P> The offences involved 20 boys and one girl, aged nine to 15, who were molested mainly in rural areas in the southeastern Australian state of Victoria. </P>
<P> Melbourne County Court judge John Dee said Ridsdale used his status as a priest to prey on his child victims, exercising power over them and ultimately devastating their lives. </P>
<P> The offences came to light in 1992 after police asked people to phone in if they had been victims of sexual abuse. </P>
<P> The judge ordered Risdale to serve a minimum of 15 years before becoming eligible for parole. </P>
