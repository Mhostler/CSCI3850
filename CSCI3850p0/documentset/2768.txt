<P>  Dade County police were on the lookout Tuesday for a pair of thieves who held dozens of preschoolers at gunpoint and then robbed the day care center. </P>
<P> Two men wearing ski caps over their faces walked into Skipper Chuck's Child Care Center in Carol City, a neighborhood north of Miami Monday morning brandishing a gun. One ordered six adults and 70 three-, four- and five-year-olds to hit the floor. </P>
<P> As teachers begged the crying children to duck, the accomplice grabbed teachers' purses and cash and checks from a register. The two then ran out of the building, jumped into a green, mid-sized car and fled. </P>
<P> No one was injured, but teachers told the Miami Herald they spent hours calming the crying children and trying to convince them that the men were part of a practice drill in case the center is ever attacked. </P>
<P> ``I tried to tell them the man was pretending,'' center director Alice Williams told the newspaper. ``But they said, 'That was a real gun.''' </P>
<P> A spokesman for the Metro-Dade police department said no suspects were in custody by Tuesday morning. </P>
