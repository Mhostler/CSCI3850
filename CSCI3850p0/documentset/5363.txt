<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  British officials met Sinn Fein, political wing of Irish nationalist guerrillas IRA, for unscheduled talks Friday to ease a deadlock in Northern Ireland peace moves. </P>
<P> Their task was to clear a way for the first ministerial talks between the Irish nationalist party and a British government minister on a political settlement. </P>
<P> Sinn Fein, which seeks to reunite Ireland and Northern Ireland, wants talks to include a demilitarization of the British province -- a phrase that would imply discussing a withdrawal of British troops and armed police. </P>
<P> But Britain says it will only discuss a ``decommissioning'' of Irish Republican Army weapons used in a guerrilla struggle against British rule until the gunmen declared a cease-fire last September. </P>
<P> The unannounced talks took place after more than a week of stalemate over a draft agenda for a ministerial-level meeting to underpin the peace process since the IRA truce. </P>
<P> Britain has refused Sinn Fein calls for the agenda to include a withdrawal of its 18,000 troops and disbanding of a 12,000-strong armed police. </P>
<P> It says it wants to discuss scrapping IRA arms used in a 25-year war against British rule until last year's cease-fires by the IRA and its pro-British Protestant Loyalist foes. </P>
<P> Ministers say that IRA arms, which include ground-to-air missiles, cannot be put on the same level as weapons held by security forces to protect the 1.5 million population. </P>
<P> Sinn Fein says it wants nothing excluded from the agenda. </P>
<P> The Sinn Fein delegatation was led by its senior strategist, Martin McGuinness, who has held several rounds of exploratory talks with British civil servants. </P>
<P> In Dublin, Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring told reporters he hoped the deadlock would be broken soon to advance peace. </P>
<P> ``What is important is that we find a solution to allow the talks to take place and I know that both sides are anxious that this can happen,'' he said. </P>
<P> Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams accused the British government of delaying the talks to score a point when British Prime Minister John Major visits the United States next week. </P>
<P> Britain was angered by President Clinton's decision to grant Adams a visa this month and further annoyed by Clinton's call on the London government to open talks with Sinn Fein. </P>
<P> Adams argued that Major was delaying the ministerial meeting to demonstrate to Clinton that Britain alone would decide on the timing and the agenda of the peace process. </P>
