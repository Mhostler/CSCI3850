<P>  President Clinton has improved the prospects for peace in Northern Ireland by his invitation of Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams to the White House, Irish Prime Minister John Bruton said Friday.  But Bruton, in town for the traditional St. Patrick's Day festivities, called for Adams, leader of the Irish Republican Army's political wing, to assert leadership and ask the IRA to put down its arms. </P>
<P> Clinton has moved the peace process along by inviting the controversial Adams, a visit that has been criticized by the British who had viewed him as a mouthpiece for the IRA, he said. </P>
<P> ``I think the U.S. administration has played a crucial role in bringing peace to Ireland and I think it is going to move the process a bit further,'' he said of the Adams visit. </P>
<P> But he said outstanding issues remain, such as decommissioning arms and release of prisoners held by the British, and he specifically asked Adams to get the IRA to lay down weapons now that there is a cease-fire. </P>
<P> ``I want him to get the IRA to get rid of their guns, to put them out of commission,'' he said in the interview. He said as long as the guns are around, those in Northern Ireland wanting to keep ties to Britain will not feel secure. </P>
<P> He also called for decommissioning of arms by the Northern Ireland loyalists, talks between opposing sides and also said Britain should release prisoners and reach an accord on a police force in Northern Ireland. </P>
<P> Clinton meets Bruton later Friday and hosts a White House St. Patrick's Day reception later for Bruton and Adams. </P>
<P> The U.S. president chatted briefly with Adams Thursday during a congressional reception hosted by House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich. </P>
<P> Clinton has taken a high-profile role in seeking to advance Northern Ireland peace. After allowing Adams to visit the United States last year, he moved further last week by allowing the Sinn Fein leader to raise funds here. </P>
<P> At the meeting with Clinton Thursday, Adams said the decommissioning of IRA weapons didn't come up Thursday and appealed to British Prime Minister John Major to drop a ban on ministerial level contacts between Sinn Fein and British officials. </P>
<P> Adams said all weapons, in the hands of the IRA, the unionists and the British army, had to be removed. </P>
<P> ``It means a total demilitarization of the situation,'' he said. </P>
<P> Bruton echoed his remarks at an American Ireland Fund dinner Thursday, where he called for the confiscation of weapons, the release of prisoners, police reform and negotiations between the two sides. </P>
<P> ``The next step has got to be to get the Unionists talking to the Nationalists on the ground in Northern Ireland itself. And that's got to happen very, very soon,'' he said. </P>
<P> Vice President Al Gore struck a hopeful note at the same dinner and called for a negotiated political settlement. </P>
<P> ``We must all support the only real avenue to peace, a negotiated political settlement that involves all sides, that is embraced by all sides, that respects the vital interests of all sides. Nothing else will do,'' Gore said. </P>
<P> U.S. Ambassador to Ireland, Jean Kennedy Smith, appearing with Bruton on the ABC show, predicted the strained relations with Britain over the visit by Adams will heal. </P>
<P> ``I'm sure that this will mend, that there have been differences before with Great Britain on other matters, but I think that this is a temporary -- I'm sure a very temporary -- problem ...'' she said. </P>
