<P>  The woman who claims she was sexually harassed by President Clinton said Friday his rejection of a settlement offer would force her to take the matter to trial. </P>
<P> ``I am sorry that Bill Clinton did not accept my settlement offer,'' said Paula Jones, a former state government worker in Arkansas. ``It provided him with a chance to end the case without having to admit his own conduct. At the same time, it would have restored me my reputation. No payment of money was ever required.'' </P>
<P> Jones, who claims Clinton dropped his pants and propositioned her in a Little Rock hotel room in May of 1991 when he was governor of Arkansas, sued the president earlier this year for violation of her civil rights. </P>
<P> Clinton, through his attorneys, has denied the accusations and has sought a stay of the proceedings until his term in office expires. </P>
<P> According to Jones' lawyer, Gilbert Davis, of Fairfax, Virginia, Clinton could have avoided the lawsuit with an apology saying, ``I am sorry for the untrue assertions which have been made about (Jones), and which have adversely affected her character, good name and reputation.'' </P>
<P> A spokesman at the offices of Robert Bennett, Clinton's personal lawyer, said Friday that Bennett's response to the settlement offer was ``basically, no.'' </P>
<P> Jones, who has largely avoided the media since going public with her claims, appeared briefly at a news conference in Hollywood Friday to read a statement to reporters about the failed settlement negotiations. </P>
<P> ``I do not seek fame or fortune, nor do I want to hurt the president,'' she said. ``All I want is to reclaim my good name from Bill Clinton, the only person in the world who can give it to me.'' </P>
<P> But now that he has declined her offer, Jones said, ``I will fight as long as it takes to assure that the truth is heard.'' </P>
<P> Jones asked rhetorically why Clinton, who maintains his innocence, should avoid a trial. </P>
<P> ``The reason is that he knows I am telling the truth,'' she said. ``I have witnesses. And I know what the 'distinguishing characteristics' are. I intend to file, with the court, my affidavit which details them. This is not just his word against my word.'' </P>
<P> The Arkansas native, who now lives in Southern California, declined to answer questions from reporters. </P>
