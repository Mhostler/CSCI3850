<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Leading Senate Democrats Monday challenged Republicans to work with them on a health reform plan that would prevent individuals from losing insurance if they changed jobs or became ill and to provide expanded coverage for children. </P>
<P> Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle and other Democratic lawmakers charged that Republicans had not made health care a legislative priority, even though studies showed affordable care was still a major concern for Americans. </P>
<P> By pushing a scaled-back plan, the Democrats acknowledged there was no political support for a universal health bill. President Clinton's sweeping reform plan died in Congress last year without a vote. </P>
<P> ``There is unanamious agreement among Democrats that the problem (of health care) has not gone away, that it deserves a high priority in the 104th Congress,'' Daschle said. </P>
<P> ``But Republicans made it clear that it is not yet a priority for them. It is not addressed in the Contract with America and no legislation has yet been introduced,'' the South Dakota Democrat said. </P>
<P> The House Republicans' ``Contract with America'' lays out an ambitious legislative agenda for the first 100 days of this Congress, including welfare reform, a balanced budget amendment and tax breaks for the middle class. </P>
<P> Congressional Republicans have also been talking about reforming the Medicare program for the elderly and giving states authority to run the Medicaid program for the poor, while capping the rate of growth in the program. </P>
<P> Republican lawmakers hope to save billions of dollars by changing the programs, using the savings both to pay for promised tax cuts and to meet their goal of a balanced budget. </P>
<P> Minnesota Democrat Paul Wellstone said the Republicans, who complained last year that the White House health reform plan would force rationing of care, are now advocating proposals that would force states to cut back on services. </P>
<P> Daschle, Massachussetts Senator Ted Kennedy, West Virginia Senator Jay Rockefeller and Arkansas Senator Davide Pryor said they stood ready to work with Republicans on legislation far less comprehensive than President Clinton's plan. </P>
<P> Democrats have introduced a bill to reform the insurance market, allow individuals to write off 100 percent of health insurance premiums, expand coverage to children and control health care costs. </P>
<P> Clinton proposed no new health care spending cuts in his 1996 budget and told Republicans he stood ready to work with them on a modified health care reform plan. </P>
<P> Daschle said Democrats had not decided whether they would oppose Republican efforts to cap spending on Medicaid and give the states authority over the program. </P>
<P> ``That's something we will be addressing in future days and weeks. Obviously, there is a lot to discuss in that regard and I don't (think) we've reached a consensus ourselves with regard to the approach we might take,'' he said. </P>
