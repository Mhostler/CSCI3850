<P>  Doping reared its ugly head at the Pan-American Games Monday. </P>
<P> The sport of weightlifting once again was tarnished when the Pan-American Sports Organization (PASO) announced that two competitors in the event, Rolando Marchinares of Peru and Nelson Stanley of Honduras, had tested postive for a banned substance. </P>
<P> Elsewhere, games records were set in all eight shooting events, with the United States taking five golds and Cuba three. </P>
<P> Canada dropped its first point in men's hockey against Cuba, and Paraguay was beaten 11-0 by the United States in both the men's and women's hockey. </P>
<P> By the end of the day, the United States led the gold medals count with 135, followed by Cuba with 59, Canada with 36 and the host nation with 24. </P>
<P> The games had been free of doping until Monday's annoucement by PASO that Marchinares and Stanley had tested positive for Nandrolone, an anabolic steroid. </P>
<P> Ironically, neither had won medals. Marchinares finished fifth in the over 108 kg category and Stanley was sixth in the 91 kg class. </P>
<P> Weightlifting, hit by a major doping at the Seoul Olympics when five lifters tested positive, spends several hundred thousand dollars a year on testing, said Jim Schmitz, a member of the executive board of the sport's world governing body. </P>
<P> Schmitz said the two offenders, who come from countries which do not conduct out-of-competition testing, would receive lifetime bans. </P>
<P> Canada is still second in the men's field hockey, despite conceding a second-half goal and drawing 1-1 with Cuba. Canada faces favorites Argentina, which have won five games out of five, in their last round-robin game on Wednesday. </P>
<P> The United States again had the sport of shooting to boost its gold medals total. </P>
<P> In the men's individual events, Web Wright won the 300 meters free rifle prone with 592 points while Kenneth Johnson scored 1,169 points as he won the 300 meters free rifle 3x40. </P>
<P> In the men's team events, the Americans won the rapid fire pistol with a total of 1,739 points, the 300 meters free rifle prone with 1,767 points and the 300 meters free rifle 3x40 with 3,475 points. </P>
<P> Servando Puldon and Guido Arbona won the men's individual rapid fire pistol and men's individual skeet events respectively for Cuba, who also took gold in the men's team skeet event. </P>
