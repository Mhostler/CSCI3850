<P>  Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aghazadeh said on Wednesday Iran would sell Turkey four million tonnes of crude oil this year, the same amount as in 1994. </P>
<P> ``We have decided to give Turkey four million tonnes of oil this year and this will reach a ceiling of five million tonnes,'' he was quoted by Anatolian news agency as telling Aykon Dogan, Turkish state minister in charge of economy, in Ankara. </P>
<P> Iran was Turkey's second largest oil supplier after Saudi Arabia in 1994, exporting four million tonnes of crude oil. </P>
<P> Aghazadeh, who is on a three-day visit, met Turkish Energy Minister Veysel Atasoy on Tuesday and discussed a long-standing plan to supply Turkey with natural gas from Iran. </P>
<P> ``We are planning to buy a total of eight to 10 billion cubic metres (283 billion to 353 billion cubic feet) of natural gas from Iran. The first two billion cubic metres (71 billion cubic feet) of it will come in 1998 under the project which we are trying to realise,'' Atasoy told Reuters on Tuesday. </P>
<P> Aghazadeh said his talks with Turkish officials on natural gas supplies were ``very productive and we are hoping to get a conclusion tomorrow (Thursday).'' </P>
<P> He declined to comment on an impending U.S. trade ban on Iran. Atasoy said Aghazadeh's visit was planned months ago. </P>
<P> A senior Turkish foreign ministry official said Turkey would not join a U.S. trade embargo on Iran and did not think Washington expected it to do so. </P>
<P> ``A Turkish embargo on Iran is out of the question without a U.N. Security Council resolution,'' Ozdem Sanberk, undersecretary of the foreign ministry, told the Hurriyet daily newspaper. </P>
<P> Sanberk said Turkey would lose out if a ban on Iran curtailed Tehran's oil sales and pushed up world prices. </P>
<P> Energy officials say oil accounted for the bulk of Turkey's imports from Iran in 1994 -- about $650 million out of a total $700 million. </P>
<P> Officials from Turkey's Hakkari, Agri and Van provinces -- all bordering Iran -- said on Wednesday they would lose up to $47 million a year only from border exports to Iran if Turkey complied with the U.S. trade ban on Tehran. </P>
<P> ``We mainly sell glassware and fabrics to Iranians and buy fresh fruits and vegetables,'' said Lutfullah Bilgin, governor of the remote southeastern province of Hakkari. </P>
