<P>  Despite an ongoing probe in Mexico, the United States is ruling out a link between Mexican drug cartels and the slayings of two top Mexican politicians this year, a senior U.S. official said Thursday. </P>
<P> ``We have seen no evidence that there is a connection between drug trafficking groups and either one of the two assassinations,'' a senior Drug Enforcement Administration official, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters. </P>
<P> Mexican investigators continue to believe that Mexican cocaine cartels may have had a hand in the assassination on Sept. 28 of ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) Secretary-General Francisco Ruiz Massieu. </P>
<P> Hard-liners in the PRI, perhaps with links to drug traffickers, are among the main suspects, the investigators say. </P>
<P> There are also suspicions in Mexico that the murder of presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio in March may have stemmed from a similar blend of politics and drug dealing aimed at preventing reform in the ruling party that has held power since 1929. </P>
<P> One of the suspects widely mentioned in both killings is Juan Garcia Abrego, alleged head of Mexico's northeastern Gulf Cartel, whose brother Humberto was arrested, and later released, by Mexican authorities last week in connection with the Sept. 28 assassination. </P>
<P> Eduardo Valle, a former Mexican official who once worked closely with the DEA, testified here in August that he had evidence linking Garcia Abrego and top Mexican officials to the murder of Colosio that he said he had gathered while working at the Mexican attorney general's office. </P>
<P> The DEA official dismissed many of Valle's assertions. He did acknowledge, however, that Garcia Abrego's highly-organized, rich and violent mafia may have spread its tentacles into the Mexican government. </P>
<P> ``Needless to say, anyone of (Garcia Abrego's) stature has to have influenced people in and out of government to remain successful,'' the official said. </P>
<P> The official described Garcia Abrego's cartel -- based in the state of Tamaulipas -- as one of the main conduits for Colombian cocaine coming into the United States. </P>
<P> He said the United States is hopeful that Ernesto Zedillo, the PRI candidate who won the Aug. 31 presidential elections, will crack down on the cartels and stem the growing tide of violence associated with Mexico's drug trade when he takes office in December. </P>
<P> The official said that the threat from Mexican drug gangs on this side of the border has grown recently since Garcia Abrego and others begun setting up distribution networks inside the United States, muscling into a business usually controlled by Colombian cartels. </P>
<P> Drug cartels have also begun using jet -- rather than propellered -- planes to fly cocaine from Colombia, via Mexico, to the United States, which makes them harder for agents from both countries to detect, the DEA official said. </P>
