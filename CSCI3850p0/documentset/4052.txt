<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va.(Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Attorneys for the Citadel, an all-male, state-funded military academy told a federal appeals court Monday the school should be given a chance to design a separate leadership program for women similar to that proposed by Virginia Military Institute (VMI). </P>
<P> Shannon Faulkner, the first woman to challenge the Citadel's all-male policy, applied for admission to the school's Corps of Cadets in March 1993 and sued after she was denied admission. </P>
<P> Her lawyer -- Valerie Vojdik, said that the Citadel had no plan for the separate program and that a ruling by a District Court Judge should be upheld by the First U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. </P>
<P> Faulkner's lawyer and the Citadel's lawyer, Dawes Cooke, both gave oral arguments Monday before a three-judge panel of the Appeals Court. </P>
<P> Cooke said that the Citadel can have a plan ready to implement by August if the Appellete Court upholds U.S. District Judge C. Weston Houk's finding that the admissions policy is discriminatory. </P>
<P> Faulkner, who is currently a day student at the school, has only until August to make it onto the Corps of Cadets. </P>
<P> She will be a junior in August, and after that, the Citadel's policy does not allow cadets to transfer after their junior year. </P>
<P> In July, the judge ruled in her favor to be accepted into the Corps of Cadets but the school appealed. ``Shannon has eight months in order to obtain any relief in this case,'' said Vojdik. </P>
<P> A U.S. appeals court ruled last Thursday that publicly funded single-sex schools were justifiable if separate but equal education was available for the other sex. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., said the VMI could proceed with its plan to form the Virginia Women's Institute for Leadership on the campus of Mary Baldwin College, a private women's school. </P>
<P> ``We concluded single-gender education was 'pedagogically justifiable,'' Judge Paul Niemeyer wrote, ``and the United States has acknowledged in this case that state sponsorship of single-gender education, if provided to both genders, is not per se a denial of equal protection.'' </P>
<P> The U.S. Department of Justice, which brought the lawsuit against the VMI, had argued that an alternative program runs against equal protection laws. It has not said yet whether it would appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. </P>
<P> The Citadel has spent more than $1.6 million to defend its all-male policy. The state of South Carolina has kicked in an additional $722,000. </P>
<P> The three judges serving on the panel were the same judges who ruled in November 1993 to uphold Houk's decision to grant Faulkner an injuction to attend her classes. Lawyers for both sides in the case have said they will appeal if they lose. </P>
