<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Arab leaders celebrated the golden anniversary of the Arab League Wednesday in a mood subdued by the legacy of the Gulf War and by concern that Israel continues to defy attempts to inspect its nuclear program. </P>
<P> Foreign ministers from the 22 member states gathered in Cairo 50 years to the day after five of them -- Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria -- signed the league charter in 1945. </P>
<P> But there was little to celebrate and the only head of state present was President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, who described the occasion as a turning-point requiring a radical review of the way Arab states deal with each other. </P>
<P> ``It is a historic turning-point which might impose on us a difficult choice -- to be or not to be,'' he said. ``All we can do is take matters firmly in hand and press on through a world of conflicts and heated rivalries.'' </P>
<P> Mubarak made no attempt to brush differences over Iraq under the carpet but said the best way to bring about reconciliation was to find a way to avert similar crises in the future. </P>
<P> ``We must accept that reconciliation does not come about by some emotional gesture based only on the desire to forget the past. It comes about by creating a mechanism for dealing with such a situation anywhere and at any time,'' he added. </P>
<P> Most of the Gulf states, especially Kuwait and Saudi Arabia on the front line, remain deeply suspicious of the government of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and of the Arab governments which were sympathetic to Iraq in the 1991 Gulf War. </P>
<P> The distrust prevented the Arab League from organizing a summit meeting to celebrate the anniversary. </P>
<P> Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid said the Arab world needed to rise above what he called ``wounds and pains, however deep and persistent they might be.'' </P>
<P> The gathering was also the opening session of a regular foreign ministers meeting, the 101st since 1945, and the agenda for that is dominated by Israel's refusal to sign the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. </P>
<P> Egypt has been lobbying against Washington's campaign for indefinite extension of the treaty, arguing that the time has come for the international community to make Israel open its nuclear installations to inspection. </P>
