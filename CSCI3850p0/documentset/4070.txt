<P>  Princess Diana's bold, sleeked-back hairstyle, revealed at a New York fashion gala, drew mixed reviews Wednesday after she arrived back in Britain from her one-day visit. </P>
<P> Diana dazzled America's top fashion designers when she attended the Council of Fashion Designers annual awards dinner Monday in a low-cut dress sporting the wet vamp look made famous by pop star Madonna. </P>
<P> New York fashion experts raved about the new look favored by fashion models and film stars, but reaction in Britain was more muted. </P>
<P> ``The new style is very Madonna-ish. I think she looks lovely,'' hair expert Jackie Wadeson told The Sun newspaper. </P>
<P> ``Gone was the shy shop-girl ... replaced instead by a confident female version of Wall Street's Gordon Gekko,'' said London's Evening Standard. </P>
<P> But not everyone was pleased with Diana's new image. </P>
<P> ``The old hairstyle was frumpy, but at least it was pretty. This one makes her look like a victim,'' said Kate Reardon, style director of Tatler magazine, was quoted as saying. </P>
<P> Jeff Banks, host of Britain's The Clothes Show, was also not impressed. ``She has a lovely face but her nose is quite prominent and with a feature like that it is not a good idea to grease the hair back,'' he told The Daily Mail. </P>
<P> Briain's top-selling Sun newspaper even launched a phone-in for readers to express their views. </P>
<P> Only Diana's hairdresser, Sam McKnight, knows for sure why she decided to try the new look but some British tabloids were speculating that she could be changing her short, softly permed hairstyle for a sexier image in preparation for a permanent move to the United States. </P>
<P> Even as Diana presented an award to Elizabeth Tilberis, editor of Harper's Bazaar magazine at the dinner, a member of the audience shouted ``Move to New York!'' </P>
<P> The 33-year-old estranged wife of Prince Charles has made four visits to the U.S. within a year but Buckingham Palace dismissed rumors she was planning to make it her second home. </P>
<P> Diana's navy designer dress also revealed a fuller figure, dispelling recent reports that the estranged wife of the heir-to-the-throne had been battling against a bout of the eating disorder bulimia. </P>
<P> One newspaper described her as ``broad-shouldered and full-armed'' and looking positively beefy, proof that her frequent visits to a London gym have paid off with a healthier physique. </P>
