<DATELINE>KUWAIT, March 25 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Kuwaiti oil workers said on Saturday they had suspended a week-old strike and that union leaders would meet officials in an attempt to resolve the dispute over employment conditions. </P>
<P> Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) Labour Union chairman Mohammad al-Sarhan said the strike was suspended at 0400 GMT and he would hold talks with Oil Minister Abdul-Mohsen al-Mudej and KOC managers at 0500 GMT. </P>
<P> Sarhan said in a telephone interview he would hold a brief meeting with union colleagues before the talks. </P>
<P> The union wants a reshuffle of employment grades to improve terms for long service staff. The government has said granting the union's demands would break Kuwaiti labour law and KOC's own rules on training and promotions. </P>
<P> Sarhan said on Friday he expected the meeting with Mudej to result in agreement on a final return to work. </P>
<P> The Kuwaiti oil industry produces three percent of world production. Exports of crude and products earn $1 billion a month. </P>
<P> Oil officials welcomed the suspension of the strike, saying they hoped strikes would not be used again to solve disputes in an industry still recovering from devastation wrought in the 1991 Gulf War. </P>
<P> They said the rare industrial action had failed to dent Kuwait's two million barrels per day crude oil output or hit sales that earn 90 percent of state revenue. </P>
<P> Mudej and KOC had refused to resume negotiations until the union suspended the strike, which they said was illegal. </P>
