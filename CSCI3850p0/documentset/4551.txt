<P>  The outlawed Khmer Rouge Saturday told U.S. military advisers in Cambodia to leave immediately or face retribution. </P>
<P> U.S. military personnel are in the country to give non-lethal military training to the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces. </P>
<P> ``If America does not abide by this (warning) the Cambodian people will crush your heads. This is a right of self-defense of Cambodian people,'' said the Khmer Rouge radio report monitored by Reuters in Phnom Penh. </P>
<P> Multi-million dollar assistance has been given by Washington in engineering, removing land mines, legal and human rights training and medical assistance. </P>
<P> The Khmer Rouge had earlier issued similar threats against Australians after Canberra authorized a similar non-lethal assistance package to the Cambodian armed forces. </P>
