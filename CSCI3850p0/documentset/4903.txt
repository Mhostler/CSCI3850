<DATELINE>GAZA (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  British Prime Minister John Major met PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat in self-ruled Gaza Tuesday, becoming only the second head of government to visit the Palestinian leader's headquarters. </P>
<P> Major travelled to the enclave's border in a helicopter, was met by Arafat and the two men rode together in the same car to the PLO chairman's beachfront headquarters in Gaza City. </P>
<P> They reviewed an honor guard beside the Mediterranean and then went inside for talks on the state of the Israeli-PLO peace deal signed in 1993 and now badly stalled. </P>
<P> Major Monday said Israel risked undermining support for the peace process by keeping its borders closed to Palestinians. But he also said the importance of security for Israel was incontestable. </P>
<P> Israel in January barred Palestinian entry, cutting off some 60,000 workers from their livelihoods, after two Islamic Jihad suicide bombers from Gaza killed 21 Israelis near Tel Aviv. </P>
<P> Tuesday a spokeswoman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Israel would allow another 3,600 workers to enter. The announcement made official an earlier statement by Israel that it would soon allow a total of 21,000 workers to enter. </P>
<P> Arafat took over Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho from Israel in May under a landmark self-rule agreement and hosted Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller in November last year. </P>
<P> Extension of self-rule to more of the West Bank has been delayed by disagreement over Palestinian elections and Israeli security concerns. </P>
<P> Major, expected to announce extra aid for the Palestinians during his meeting with Arafat, has said rising prosperity was the surest antidote to terrorism. PLO officials said he would donate 50 vehicles to the Palestinian police. </P>
<P> The British prime minister arrived in Israel Sunday and has met with Rabin and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres. Major is to meet Rabin again just before leaving for Jordan later on Tuesday. He is due to meet King Hussein in Amman. </P>
<P> British officials said Major, accompanied by leading businessmen, wanted to stake Britain's claim to a share of a future Middle East peace dividend. </P>
<P> The businessmen met their Israeli counterparts in Jerusalem Monday. In Gaza Tuesday they met Palestinian businessmen and officials on prospects of investment in the self-rule areas. </P>
