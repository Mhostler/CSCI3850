<DATELINE>CHICAGO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A federal task force is investigating alleged ties between U.S. Muslims and militant and charitable wings of the group Hamas, the Chicago Tribune reported Wednesday. </P>
<P> After last month's suicide bus bombing in Tel Aviv that killed 23 people, U.S. State Department officials vowed to stop Hamas' financial support coming from Americans. </P>
<P> The Tribune said a federal task force was created to look into the financial links, as well as Israeli allegations that Hamas recruited and trained members in the United States. </P>
<P> Some Israeli officials, a former FBI counterterrorism chief and a young Muslim appearing as a witness in the trial of an American Muslim in Israel, have implied that strong links exist between U.S. Muslims and Hamas, a group responsible for a series of bombings and deadly attacks in Israel, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> Oliver Revell, former chief of the Federal Bureau of Investigations counterterrorism unit, said on the CBS show ``60 Minutes'' that Hamas ``collects money, produces propaganda, films, video ... recruits and even engages in paramilitary training in the U.S.'' </P>
<P> A 25-year-old U.S. Muslim from Kansas City is expected to testify at a trial in Israel that he attended Hamas indoctrination sessions in Chicago, the newspaper said. Naser Hidmi will testify in the case of Chicago-area car salesman Mohammed Salah, 39, who was arrested in Israel last year for allegedly funneling money to Hamas. </P>
<P> A Chicago grocer arrested with Salah in Israel was released after six months confinement, and he and other U.S. Muslims say they are being persecuted. They note that American Jews give billions of dollars annually to Israel with no questions asked. </P>
<P> Ali Baghdadi, editor of the Arab Journal, a newspaper published in both Arabic and English, called allegations of recruitment or military training a ``lie and fabrication.'' </P>
<P> ``Hamas does not need Arab-Americans to fight for Hamas, what they really need is money. They have the whole population of Gaza and the West Bank,'' he said. </P>
<P> Ray Hanania, a Palestinian who is also a political consultant and journalist, said ``There's a real misunderstanding about how the Arab community is organized.'' </P>
<P> Hanania said there is a vocal minority opposed to the peace process and supportive of Hamas. ``Sure they raise money, sure they talk politics, but to say it's an organized group in Chicago is ridiculous,'' Hanania said of Hamas supporters. </P>
<P> While Hamas is associated with violent acts aimed at dissolving the peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization, it also runs charitable networks of schools, clinics and nurseries. </P>
<P> The Tribune said investigators will have difficulty, because much of the fundraising takes place in mosques, which are off-limits to wiretaps and surveillance. </P>
<P> Baghdadi said fundraising for Arab causes in the United States probably amounts to less than $1 million a year. </P>
