<P>  The remains of 12 women and girls believed to be victims of Britain's alleged ``House of Horrors'' mass murderer Frederick West have been released for burial after West was found dead in prison, police said Wednesday. </P>
<P> The remains were dug up last year from the foundations of West's home in the western English town of Gloucester, and other sites where they had lain for years, by police investigating what may be one of Britain's worst serial killings. </P>
<P> Their reburial had been delayed by objections from lawyers defending West, 53, who was found hanging in his prison cell on New Year's Day after an apparent suicide. The reburial was authorized by Gloucester coroners Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``This is the news we have been waiting for. It's a great release,'' said Joan Owen, mother of one of the women. West's victims include his first wife and their daughter, who died over two decades ago. </P>
<P> West's 41-year-old wife Rosemary, jointly charged with nine of the 12 murders her husband was accused of, is still expected to appear in court next month for a hearing to see if there is sufficient evidence for a trial. </P>
<P> Her lawyers claim she will not be able to get a fair trial because of media coverage of her dead husband's alleged crimes. </P>
