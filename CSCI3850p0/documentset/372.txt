<DATELINE>ERFURT, Germany (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Neo-Nazi skinheads rampaged through the Buchenwald World War II death camp in east Germany, throwing stones at buildings and threatening to burn a supervisor to death, police said Sunday. </P>
<P> The rampage late Saturday night came amid a spate of rightist violence that swept the eastern part of the country over the weekend. </P>
<P> Police said 22 rightists shouted ``Sieg Heil'' and gave the stiff-arm Hitler salute as they charged through the former Nazi concentration camp in which 56,000 Jews were murdered during World War II. </P>
<P> Two were initially detained by police. One was held and the other released. The rest of the neo-Nazi group were allowed to go home pending police investigations, a spokesman said. </P>
<P> German officials recently announced plans to remodel the Buchenwald museum to reflect post-war Soviet abuses and the 10,000 people who died there after the Nazis were defeated. </P>
<P> About 20,000 of the concentration camp's inmates died making the V2 rocket, Hitler's ``wonder weapon,'' in the Dora underground tunnel network, northwest of Buchenwald. </P>
<P> In Magdeburg, also in east Germany, police detained seven rightist youths Saturday for singing banned Nazi songs. </P>
<P> Residents had complained after a gang chanting Nazi slogans and singing Nazi songs paraded through the streets. </P>
<P> In Ruhlsdorf, near the eastern city of Eberswalde, police were investigating a group of 10 to 15 youths on suspicion of distributing banned Nazi propaganda, a spokesman said on Saturday. </P>
<P> Three Germans were jailed Friday for up to 3 3/8 years for their role in riots in Magdeburg in May when far-right extremists smashed up a Turkish-owned cafe and hunted down foreigners in one of the worst outbreaks of neo-Nazi violence that has haunted Germany since unification in 1990. </P>
