<P>  Pediatricians and U.S. health officials have agreed on a new increased dosage schedule for immunizing children against common childhood diseases, it was announced Thursday. </P>
<P> The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics new recommended timetable reflects an increase for improved disease protection. </P>
<P> It raises from nine to 15 the number of vaccine doses recommended to prevent nine diseases in preschool-age children. Additional doses of some vaccines are being urged to better protect children against disease. </P>
<P> As many as 2 million children have not received all of the recommended doses, said Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala. </P>
<P> ``By the year 2000, we want to ring in the turn of the century with at least 90 percent of our children receiving all of their vaccines,'' Shalala said. ``This uniform schedule will help health care professionals deliver this message to parents.'' </P>
<P> Most of the recommended vaccinations should be given before a child is 18 months old, including inoculations against hepatitis B, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, influenza, poliovirus, measles, mumps and rubella. </P>
<P> ``This change provides a uniform childhood immunization schedule to support greater collaboration between the private and public medical communities to increase childhood immunizations in the United States,'' said CDC Director Dr. David Satcher. </P>
<P> During the past two years, there were 21,868 cases of hepatitis B in the United States that could have been prevented by childhood vaccination, the CDC said. There were also 8,887 cases of pertussis, 2,696 cases of mumps and 2,253 cases of hemophilus influenza that occurred because children had not been immunized, said the centers. </P>
