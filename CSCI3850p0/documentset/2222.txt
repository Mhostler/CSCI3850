<P>  A lawyer for General Electric Co told a court on Tuesday the U.S. government had no evidence to prove there was a price fixing agreement between GE and an affiliate of the world's largest diamond producer. </P>
<P> ``There will be event after event (which the government will cite), when in fact there will be no evidence it did occur. There will be no documents, no witnesses, no testimony (to prove it),'' lawyer Dan Webb said. </P>
<P> ``The government will substitute guesswork and speculation for evidence,'' he told a 16-member jury in federal court. </P>
<P> Webb's statements came at the start of a trial involving the world's two largest industrial diamond makers. The government contends that GE and De Beers Centenary AG, a Swiss company affiliated with De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd, and two individuals conspired to fix the prices of industrial diamonds. </P>
<P> The alleged conspiracy occurred from 1991 until at least 1992, according to a federal indictment handed up in the case. </P>
<P> Both companies deny any wrongdoing. </P>
<P> Max Gillam of the U.S. Justice Department's antitrust division said in his opening statement: ``There was no signed formal written agreement to fix prices. The mechanism (was to) exchange prices under...the cover and pretext of conversations between supplier and buyer.'' </P>
<P> He said the government evidence will demonstrate that in a meeting and via telephone calls and facsimile communications the head of GE's European sales and a representative of De Beers exchanged price information with the intention of dirving up prices. </P>
<P> Webb will continue his opening statement on Wednesday. </P>
<P> GE, De Beers Centenary and two individuals were indicted in February. The government says Peter Frenz, who was managing director of GE Superabrasives Europe GmbH, and Philippe Liotier, at the time an executive of a Belgian firm connected with De Beers, exchanged detailed pricing information. </P>
<P> GE has contended that while both companies imposed price increases in early 1992, prices soon returned to a lower level. </P>
