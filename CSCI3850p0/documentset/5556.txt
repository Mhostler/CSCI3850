<DATELINE>PRETORIA, South Africa (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  South African police said Friday they had seized one of the largest caches of explosives yet found in the country. </P>
<P> The cache, including 1040-lbs of commercial explosives, was discovered by workers on a farm near Bronkhorstspruit east of the capital Pretoria Tuesday, police said in a statement. </P>
<P> ``Police have recovered one of the largest ever caches of explosives ... The cache (is) the most sophisticated found to date ...,'' the statement said. </P>
<P> The explosives and other arms, including anti-personnel mines, two anti-tank rocket launchers, hand grenades, an assault rifle and hundreds of rounds of ammunition, were found in a sealed watertank buried among trees. </P>
<P> Police said no arrests have been made and detectives were investigating. They had no further details. </P>
<P> Commercial explosives were used by white rightwingers in a pre-election bombing blitz which killed at least 21 people in the run-up to South Africa's all-race elections last April. </P>
<P> Twenty-six members of the white supremacist Afrikaner Resistance Movement (AWB) are on trial in connection with the bomb attacks. </P>
<P> In a separate incident, police have arrested two former policemen and two other men after another arms cache was found at a house in a Pretoria suburb. </P>
