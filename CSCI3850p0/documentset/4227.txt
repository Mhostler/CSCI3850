<P>  Seve Ballesteros is looking forward to another successful year after attending ``a very happy funeral'' in the United States last week. </P>
<P> Ballesteros, who is playing in the Canary Islands Open which begins Thursday, said: ``I spent a week with my coach Mac O'Grady in Palm Springs, working on my driving and chipping, but particularly on my short game. </P>
<P> ``But the most important thing I did last week was to take an empty cardboard shoe box, fill it with all the photographs I could find which showed me swinging badly, and then Mac and I drove out into the desert and buried the box. </P>
<P> ``We buried all my bad habits and I have kept all my good ones. It was the happiest funeral I have ever attended. Mac and I prayed together, so maybe I will have a very good year now.'' </P>
<P> This will be the last European Tour event for Ballesteros until after the Masters in April, and he added: ``I played in Manila two weeks ago and that tournament and the one this week are just to get a competitive feeling. </P>
<P> ``But if I have a chance to win this week, I will take it. I have been having a little problem off the tee, but maybe after the funeral all my drives will be straight.'' </P>
<P> He plans a fortnight's rest after this week before going to the United States to play in four tournaments in preparation for the Masters, which he has won twice. </P>
<P> Ballesteros, 37, is currently well ahead in the European Ryder Cup points table after his return to prominence last year but says he is not worried about possibly dropping down the list. </P>
<P> He believes he has almost enough points already to make the Ryder Cup team and most of his leading rivals will also be concentrating on American events in the next few weeks. </P>
<P> ``The Ryder Cup is not until September and I have four major tournaments to play before then. At the moment, I am just thinking it would be nice to win the U.S. Masters for a third time,'' he said. </P>
