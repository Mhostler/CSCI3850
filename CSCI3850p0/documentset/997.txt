<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Negotiations between players and owners aimed at ending the Major League Baseball strike broke off Thursday, just one day after the start of full-scale face-to-face talks and 14 days into the work stoppage. </P>
<P> ``We're not at the stage where someone walked out in a huff and said I don't ever want to talk to you again,'' said players' union chief Donald Fehr. ``We are at the stage where there isn't anything to talk about.'' </P>
<P> Said the owners' chief negotiator, Richard Ravitch: ``I think the meetings were very valuable. It established a proper atmosphere. Maybe by next week we can meet and resolve this.'' </P>
<P> No date was set for further talks, but participants said they hoped the federally mediated contract negotiations, stuck on the owners' desire to limit salary costs and players' rejection of any kind of salary cap, could resume as early as the middle of next week. </P>
<P> Gene Orza, legal counsel for the players' union, said, ''Maybe we can get together in the middle of next week.'' </P>
<P> ``I am hoping for meetings either next week or in the first week of September,'' said Kansas City Royals pitcher David Cone. </P>
<P> ``If we talk we can still save this season, but I am worried about conditioning. This would be like starting spring training. I don't know how long my arm would last if I had to pitch.'' </P>
<P> The players, who have been playing without a new contract, called the strike out of fears that the owners would unilaterally impose a salary cap next season. Owners have said a cap is needed to help small-market clubs. </P>
<P> Ravitch said: ``Basically we need a salary cap to survive. The players do not recognize this in any way and at this point we see no reason to meet further at this time.'' </P>
<P> Fehr said: ``We suggested to the mediator that it would almost be all about the salary cap and it was. There is no movement and no indication of any movement.'' </P>
<P> Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Curt Schilling said: ``They (owners) said they need a salary cap to survive and we don't believe it. I don't think there will be (any more) baseball this year.'' </P>
<P> ``Today's discussion was much more heated, much more personal,'' said Cone. </P>
<P> ``There was a lot of substance but not really a lot of negotiating,'' said Toronto Blue Jays representative Paul Molitor. </P>
<P> ``We really haven't have been able to break ground in terms of the differences.'' </P>
<P> Despite the lack of a date for resumption of formal collective bargaining, behind-the-scenes wheeling and dealing is likely to continue. </P>
<P> Boston Red Sox chief executive officer John Harrington said, ``So I guess now we're going to go into the stage where both sides will carefully consider what we heard both yesterday and today from each other's side and see if we can present further information to each other that would make further impressions on each other.'' </P>
<P> Federal mediator John Calhoun Wells said: ``The talks have recessed. Obviously we have reached a point where it is better to recess and resume at a later date than continue now.'' </P>
<P> A group of 12 owners and club officials had joined their negotiator Ravitch in the talks for the first time Wednesday, the first formal negotiating session since the baseball players went on strike on August 12. </P>
<P> The two sides met for eight hours Wednesday. Talks resumed Thursday morning at a New York hotel before breaking off early in the afternoon. </P>
<P> If a settlement cannot be reached soon, the post-season playoffs and World Series -- which generate about $140 million in revenues -- could be jeopardized. </P>
<P> ``It won't be for several weeks until we hit a hard wall on this thing (to call off the season) but we're closing in on that date,'' Harrington said. </P>
<P> So far 182 games have been scrubbed from a season that was shaping up as one of the best ever, with some of the game's most glorious records under siege and several perennial second-tier teams in contention for division titles. </P>
