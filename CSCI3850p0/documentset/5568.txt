<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The murder of a police chief in Tijuana city was the work of drug-traffickers who are also wanted for killing a Roman Catholic cardinal, a leading newspaper reported Friday. </P>
<P> Three men are now being sought by investigators for the police chief killing a year ago in the northern Mexican city, one of them a drug-trafficker and the other two federal policemen, Reforma newspaper reported. </P>
<P> The names of the two policemen also figure in the probe into the assassination on March 23, 1994 in Tijuana of ruling party presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, which Tijuana Public Security Director Federico Benitez Lopez was investigating when he was shot dead on April 28, 1994. </P>
<P> Reforma said, though, that Benitez was killed not because of his Colosio probe but for refusing a bribe from the powerful Tijuana drug-smuggling cartel, which is headed by the Arellano Felix family. </P>
<P> Officials at the Attorney General's Office declined to comment on the report. </P>
<P> The Arellano Felix brothers have been accused by investigators of the May 1993 killing of Guadalajara Archbishop Cardinal Juan Posadas Ocampo, either deliberately or in a bungled attempt to murder rival drugs baron Joaquin ``El Chapo'' Guzman. </P>
<P> Reforma quoted investigators from the Attorney General's Office as saying the two policemen sought for killing Benitez, both of whom worked for the Tijuana cartel, were also on unspecified ``special security duty'' at the campaign rally at which Colosio was shot. </P>
<P> One of the men, Federal Judicial Police commander Marco Antonio Jacome, made a videotape of the rally which captured the moment of Colosio's death and has since become a key piece of evidence. His whereabouts are unknown. </P>
<P> The other, Federal Judicial Police commander Rodolfo Garcia Gaxiola, has been linked to a mysterious phone call made to authorities after the Colosio killing in which a woman claimed to have details of an elaborate plot against Colosio. </P>
<P> Garcia denied any links to the Benitez murder in a letter reproduced by Reforma. He threatened to name politicians linked to drug-trafficking in and around Tijuana and said he would turn himself in to authorities only if his safety is guaranteed. </P>
