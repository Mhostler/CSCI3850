<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif.(Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Two local businessmen have reached a preliminary agreement to buy the Oakland Athletics and keep the team in Oakland, the club said Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``We are delighted to report that we have reached an agreement on the major deal points, including price, for Steve Schott and Ken Hoffmann to purchase the Athletics,'' Walter Haas, chairman and chief executive officer of the team, said. </P>
<P> The Haas family put the Athletics up for sale last year, saying the team had lost money for years. </P>
<P> The family had set an asking price of $85 million, said to be below the team's market value, on condition that the new owners keep the team in Oakland and not move it elsewhere. </P>
<P> Haas said details of the agreement would remain confidential pending the sale being approved by Major League Baseball. </P>
<P> The Athletics said that, while the final sale agreement did not meet the terms of the Haas family's initial offering, the family agreed to additional concessions to allow the team to remain in Oakland. </P>
<P> Schott and Hoffmann both own home-building companies in the San Francisco Bay area. </P>
<P> The Oakland Coliseum, home of the Athletics, said in a separate statement that Schott and Hoffmann had reached agreement with the Coliseum guaranteeing that the team will stay in Oakland through the year 2004. </P>
<P> The new license agreement with the Coliseum includes a $20 million construction program to upgrade the 28-year-old Coliseum and to enhance revenues, the Coliseum said. </P>
<P> The improvements, including a new club lounge area, club seats, remodeled sky boxes, new diamond-level seats and improved fan amenities, will bring the Coliseum into first-class status as a baseball venue, the Coliseum said. </P>
<P> The improvements, to be completed over six years, will be paid for partly by a ticket surcharge. </P>
<P> The agreement with the Coliseum requires final approval by the Oakland City Council and the Alameda County Board of Supervisors. </P>
<P> City and Coliseum officials were full of praise for the new owners' commitment to keep the team in Oakland. </P>
<P> Coliseum Board President George Vukasin said the new owners knew they would sustain losses in the near term. </P>
<P> ``But they believe they can turn that around and, with our goodwill and support, make this a very successful franchise both for them and for us,'' he said. </P>
