<P>  Pausing from pre-Kentucky Derby hype, more than 150 people gathered in a downtown Louisville mall Thursday to welcome home three-time heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali. </P>
<P> Ali, just back from North Korea and Japan, beguiled the audience with tricks as part of the grand opening ceremonies for the Muhammad Ali Museum and Education Center in downtown Louisville. </P>
<P> Several fans, including Ronnie Paloger of Marina Del Ray, Calif., came to Louisville to see Ali. </P>
<P> ``He's transcendental to the sport. He's an inspiration to the nation and there comes a time to honor our heros,'' said Paloger, who has more than 3,000 pieces of Ali memorabilia. </P>
