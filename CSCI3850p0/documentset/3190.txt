<P>  Bulgaria may use planes to try to make it rain because years of drought have virtually dried up Sofia's reservoir and forced severe water rationing in the capital, a government official said Wednesday. </P>
<P> The drought has caused water supplies in much of the country to shrink to critical levels. The antiquated water mains system has been unable to cope with rising consumption. </P>
<P> Water rationing was introduced in Sofia and its suburbs 24 days ago, supplying water for 24 hours every three days. The capital's central district has been excluded from the water cuts but its hot water supplies have been shut off until March. </P>
<P> Rationing was introduced after the Sofia municipality warned its 1 million inhabitants that the reservoir which supplies the city with water was so low it was dangerously close to being a health hazard. </P>
<P> ``Our plan is to stimulate rain and relocate rain (by planes),'' said Petar Pavlov, head of the government body Fight against Hail Directorate (FHD). ``We need a month and a half to prepare technically if the government approves and funds it.'' </P>
<P> Pavlov said the planes would inject clouds with special substances to make snow or raindrops form. </P>
<P> The FHD has had experience provoking rain by firing special rockets into clouds to stop hailstones damaging crops, but has never used planes. Pavlov said expert foreign help might be called, for example from Moldova. </P>
