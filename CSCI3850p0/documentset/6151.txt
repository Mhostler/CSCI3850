<DATELINE>HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam, April 30 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Saigon has stayed frozen in the minds of many people round the world as a war-torn city with a communist tank smashing through the gates of the presidential palace on April 30, 1975. </P>
<P> But the past 20 years have seen big changes in Ho Chi Minh City, its name since the communist victory in the Vietnam War. </P>
<P> Truong Tan Sang, the People's Committee chairman, or mayor, summed up the achievements and ambitions of this city of 4.5 million in a keynote speech at Sunday's celebrations of the 20th anniversary of the war's end. </P>
<P> After the war, problems included a war-oriented economy, social vices, huge unemployment and ``a no-man's land filled with mines and bomb craters in the rural districts,'' he said. </P>
<P> Like the rest of Vietnam, the city ``experienced its difficult days, partially as a consequence of the centrally planned, subsidised, command mechanism,'' he said in a rare public critique by a senior official of orthodox communist policies up to 1986. </P>
<P> But Ho Chi Minh City never lost its bustling business atmosphere, especially since that year, when the Communist Party launched market-oriented doi moi (renovation) policies. </P>
<P> Foreign investment has increased, Vietnamese living overseas have contributed and ``the various economic sectors are booming,'' Sang said. </P>
<P> The city was undergoing a complete change, with new industrial zones and residential complexes laying the groundwork for faster change in future, he added. </P>
<P> Sang said the city's gross domestic product (GDP) had more than tripled in the past 20 years, and GDP per head had more than doubled to $810. </P>
<P> Investment from all sectors had increased ninefold since 1990, the city's annual growth rate averaged 12.5 percent and exports were increasing at 15 percent a year, he said. </P>
<P> Sang said Ho Chi Minh City intended to attain a steady annual growth rate of 15 percent up to the year 2000, to raise per capita GDP to $1,500 by then, to cut unemployment to five percent and triple the value of exports. </P>
