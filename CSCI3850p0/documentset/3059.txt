<P>  President Carlos Menem of Argentina will sleep in a room once favored by gangster Al Capone during this weekend's Summit of the Americas, a spokeswoman for the city's Biltmore hotel said Wednesday. </P>
<P> Biltmore spokeswoman Walesca Lugo said Menem would stay in the Everglades suite, where Capone used to sleep in the late 1920s. It has a fireplace, a piano and a hand-painted cathedral ceiling, two floors and a 180-degree view of Miami. </P>
<P> The summit will bring together 34 heads of government for the first gathering of Western Hemispheric leaders since 1967. </P>
<P> In his heyday during the Prohibition era, Capone directed his gambling and rum-running activities from luxurious hotels such as the Biltmore, which was built in 1926 and boasts one of the world's largest swimming pools with a surface area of 2,000 square yards. </P>
<P> Lugo said that apart from Capone, famous occupants of the Everglades suite have included the Duke of Windsor, actresses Ginger Rogers, Judy Garland, singer-actor Bing Crosby and members of the Roosevelt and Vanderbilt families. </P>
<P> During the summit, the Biltmore will serve as headquarters for Menem as well as the presidents of Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras. </P>
