<P>  A 29-year-old Frenchman attempting to row across the Atlantic was rescued by a Canadian fishing boat after sending out a distress signal, the U.S. Coast Guard in Boston said Tuesday. </P>
<P> Jean Luckes of Brest set off on the trans-Atlantic crossing from the Massachusetts port of Chatham in a 24-foot, double-hulled rowboat on July 28. He was picked up Monday suffering from exhaustion in Canadian waters about 120 miles east of Cape Cod, the Coast Guard said. </P>
<P> ``He owes his life to his emergency-position-indicating radio beacon beaming out a signal to an orbiting search-and-rescue satellite,'' a Coast Guard spokesman said. </P>
<P> Luckes was transferred to a Coast Guard cutter, which will bring him back to Boston Wednesday. </P>
