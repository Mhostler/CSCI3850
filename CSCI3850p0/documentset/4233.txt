<P>  Five suspected drug traffickers who planned to rob a bank died in a shootout with police in Rio de Janeiro Wednesday, police said. </P>
<P> In a separate incident Wednesday, a guard and a suspected robber were killed during a shootout between a gang and police inside a bank, he said. </P>
<P> In the first incident, police acting on a tipoff prevented an armed gang from holding up a bank and then chased them into a hillside shanty-town in Penha in northern Rio. </P>
<P> Police sharpshooters, backed up by a helicopter, exchanged fire and five members of the gang were killed. Two police officers were slightly injured. There were no reports of any arrests, the police spokesman said. </P>
<P> Brazil's SBT television showed a police helicopter swerving violently to avoid fire from the gang during the shootout. Later, SBT's cameras captured the image of a corpse dangling from a line beneath a police helicopter, its arms outstretched, as it was removed for identification. </P>
<P> ``Without a doubt, they were members of a drug gang,'' he said. ``The traffickers have been looking for alternative sources of income since the start of Operation Rio.'' </P>
<P> Operation Rio began in October 1994 when the military was ordered to head a crackdown on organized crime, particularly heavily armed drug gangs in the city. Since then, however, bank raids and kidnappings have increased as the gangs diversify their criminal activities, police say. </P>
<P> Operation Rio is no longer under military control. </P>
