<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Indonesia's military said Thursday it had committed an error in the killing of six East Timorese in January, but had yet to decide what action to take against officers involved, the Antara news agency said. </P>
<P> The official agency quoted army chief Gen. Hartono as saying there was an indication of ``procedural violations'' by the military during the attack Jan. 12 in Liquiza, west of the East Timorese capital, Dili. </P>
<P> ``We haven't been able to determine what kind of actions to take because the officer honorary council is still examining the violations,'' he said. </P>
<P> The general said the council, which consists of senior military officials assigned to probe the killings, was expected to finish its work next month at the latest. </P>
<P> Hartono said the army would decide who to blame after the council finished its investigation, but said it would be the officers, not the soldiers, who would he held responsible for the deaths of the six. </P>
<P> Hartono said the military was adamant that the six Timorese were members of the Fretilin guerrilla movement. Human-rights groups, East Timorese exiles and local residents have said the six were only villagers. </P>
<P> The Liquiza incident refocused world attention on East Timor, a former Portuguese colony invaded by Indonesia in 1975 and annexed the following year. Unrest followed the killings and Jakarta has barred foreign journalists from visiting the territory. </P>
<P> The government-appointed human rights commission has accused the Indonesian military of torture and murder and the United Nations Human Rights Commission has also sharply criticized Jakarta for human-rights abuses in the troubled territory. </P>
