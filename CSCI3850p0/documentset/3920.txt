<P>  O.J. Simpson's so-called ``trial of the century'' is being used as a launching pad to propel the U.S. judicial system from the dusty technological mires of the 19th century into the 21st century. </P>
<P> Welcome to the cutting-edge courtroom of Superior Court Judge Lance Ito, where computers replace lawyers' notepads and a giant television screen displays video images, photographs, documents and other evidence. </P>
<P> If television viewers tuning in to the Simpson double murder trial think they've mistakenly turned to a channel showing ''Star Trek'' space adventures, the confusion is understandable because of the banks of computers and a giant screen in Ito's courtroom. </P>
<P> Simpson, a football legend who became famous worldwide as an actor, sportscaster and TV pitchman, has pleaded not guilty to the June 12 murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman. </P>
<P> What better forum for computer technology to conquer the last bastion of resistance to the inevitable than a trial that will be seen around the world? </P>
<P> Judge Ito, the lawyers, and even those taking the witness stand will have computers on which will be displayed transcripts of the testimony as it is being given as well as the photos and documents seen on the big screen. </P>
<P> Light pens and touch screen technology will allow witnesses, lawyers and the judge to highlight and mark what is being seen on the screens. </P>
<P> Much of the technological wizardry is being supplied by the Los Angeles consulting firm, Trial Presentation Technologies. </P>
<P> Pamela Huenke, a managing partner of the company, said everyone, from the jurors to the judge, as well as the television stations showing gavel to gavel coverage of the proceedings, will benefit from the high-tech courtroom. </P>
<P> Instead of straining their eyes to see photographs and documents from 20 yards across the room, jurors will be able to examine them on a huge, 84-inch screen. </P>
<P> In addition, a software program built in to the court stenographers' typing machine will afford simultaneous translation of shorthand into the printed word on computers used by lawyers and the judge, giving them the ability to save the transcripts and highlight certain portions for later arguments or judgments. </P>
<P> Huenke said her company, one of the few in the United States with expertise in computerized courtrooms, had previously specialized in displaying evidence through advanced technology for either one side or the other mainly in civil cases. </P>
<P> The company's present task, she said, was to give each side an equal opportunity to use the ``bells and whistles'' of the computer age. </P>
<P> ``Judge Ito retained us to consult on ways to counteract and equalize the playing field against the strategies and methodologies of each particular side,'' she said. </P>
<P> In the courtroom of the 21st century -- and there are those who say it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that the Simpson case might drag on into that new era, with hung juries and multiple appeals -- the advantage lies with the side best able to utilize the emerging science. </P>
<P> ``The more the jury can interact and relate to and understand and see the evidence, the better equipped they are to give a (decision), and if one side gives them that and the other side doesn't, our experience is that they will side with the people who give them that opportunity,'' Huenke said. </P>
<P> Properly used, she added, the modernized court will make the job of the jury much easier and help them understand the most perplexing aspects of the case. </P>
