<DATELINE>DORADO BEACH, Puerto Rico (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The host Puerto Rico team made an inauspicious start to the World Cup of golf when one of its players was penalized two strokes for a rules infringement during the first round Thursday. </P>
<P> Due to torrential rain which saturated the Dorado Beach course, the players were allowed preferred lies, as long as they were in the fairway. </P>
<P> However, Puerto Rico's Manuel Comacho, unaware of the rule's fine print, broke it on the very first hole. </P>
<P> Comacho, 48, lifted his ball, cleaned it and placed it within a club's length of where it was -- not closer to the hole -- in accordance with the rules. </P>
<P> Unfortunately for Comacho, his ball was in the rough, where it had to be played as it was. </P>
<P> For his infraction, Comacho was penalized two strokes, which will be added to his score when he completes the first round on Friday. </P>
<P> He was among eight players unable to complete the first round due to a rain suspension. </P>
<P> Comacho, playing his first World Cup since 1977, was one over par through 16 holes when play was halted. That becomes three-over when the penalty is added. </P>
<P> His teammate, 16-year-old Puerto Rico junior champion Wilfredo Morales, was one-under the card. </P>
