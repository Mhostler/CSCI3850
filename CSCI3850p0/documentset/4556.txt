<DATELINE>MARSEILLE, France (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Up to 15,000 protesters marched through the Mediterranean port city of Marseille Saturday to denounce the extreme-right National Front after the murder of a French teen-ager of African descent. </P>
<P> Three right-wing extremists were held in custody Friday over a murder that prompted calls to ban their anti-immigrant National Front movement. </P>
<P> Investigators suspect that 17-year-old Ibrahim Ali, shot dead in Marseille Tuesday, was murdered by National Front supporters sticking up campaign posters for their leader Jean-Marie Le Pen ahead of the April-May presidential election. </P>
<P> The National Front has said its activists fired in self-defense after coming under attack from a group of Africans. Police said Ali was shot in the back and his group was unarmed. Ali's friends have denied attacking the rightists. </P>
<P> Le Pen - Murderer,'' the demonstrators chanted. They demanded the killers be punished and that all candidates for the presidency condemn the National Front. </P>
<P> Socialist party leader Henri Emmanuelli and some 20 national anti-racism and civil rights groups including SOS-Racism took part in the march. Organizers put the number of participants at 15,000, while police said 10,000 were present. </P>
<P> The family of Ibrahim Ali had appealed for a ``silent and dignified'' demonstration but slogans hostile to Le Pen soon broke the silence. </P>
<P> Opinion polls show Le Pen could win around 10 percent of the votes in the first round of the election on April 23. </P>
<P> In an attempt to prevent any political coloring to the march, the only banner on display read: ``Justice for Ibrahim.'' </P>
<P> A delegation of young people from the depressed housing project where Ibrahim was shot met a deputy representing the local prefect (government representative). </P>
<P> ``We told him this must never happen again. We're not hooligans, we showed that by holding a dignified demonstration. Now, they have to do something for us,'' one delegation member told reporters. </P>
<P> In a dozen other cities across France including Paris and the central city of Lyon, smaller demonstrations up to 1,000 strong were held Saturday to pay tribute to the victim. </P>
<P> Justice sources said Friday that pensioner Robert Lagier, 63, had admitted shooting Ali while Lagier was putting up presidential election posters for Le Pen. </P>
<P> He was formally placed under investigation for murder. </P>
<P> Two other National Front members, Pierre Giglio, 37, and Mario d'Ambrosio, 41, were placed under investigation as suspected accomplices to murder. Both had been previously convicted of violence. </P>
