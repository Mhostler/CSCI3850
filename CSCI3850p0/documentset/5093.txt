<DATELINE>DAMASCUS, March 22 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Syria said on Wednesday it was waiting for fresh Israeli ideas at peace talks that resumed in Washington this week. </P>
<P> It said no real progress would be made if Israel did not approve full withdrawal from the Syrian Golan Heights, occupied by Israel in 1967. </P>
<P> ``Syria is waiting for new Israeli ideas at the ambassadorial talks to push the peace process forward on the basis of U.NN Security Council resolutions 242, 338 and 425 and the land for peace principle,'' the government daily al-Thawra said. </P>
<P> Talks between Syria's ambassador to Washington Walid al-Mualem and Israeli Envoy Itamar Rabinovich resumed in Washington on Monday with U.SS participation after a three-month break. There has been no public word on progress. </P>
<P> The talks resumed after U.SS Secretary of State Warren Christopher visited Israel and Syria this month. </P>
<P> Al-Thawra accused Israel of trying to prolong previous negotiations but said the Jewish state would not be able to do so at the current session because the mechanism agreed with Christopher linked discussions of further peace steps with the outcome of the ambassadorial talks. </P>
<P> Officials said earlier the success of the ambassadorial talks would pave the way for talks at a higher level involving the army chiefs of staff of Syria and Israel. </P>
<P> They said a December session in which the Syrian and Israeli chiefs of staff took part had failed because of tough Israeli demands, including one for preservation of Israeli observation posts at the Golan. </P>
<P> Al-Thawra said the current session was very important ``because its outcome will decide the fate of the peace process.'' </P>
<P> It urged Washington to play a greater role to persuade Israel to accept U.NN resolutions. </P>
<P> Syria's peace talks with Israel which opened in 1991 are stalled over withdrawal from the Golan, security arrangements and future ties. </P>
<P> Syria wants full Israeli withdrawal and says any security arrangements should be equal and balanced. Israel said it will not reveal the extent of a pullback from the Golan before Damascus agreed to establish full normal ties. </P>
