<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Clinton's approval rating among Americans has again fallen, continuing a six-month slide, according to a survey released Sunday. </P>
<P> The poll by Louis Harris and Associates found that only 40 percent of adults surveyed gave the president an ``excellent'' or ``pretty good'' approval rating, while 59 percent thought his job performance was ``fair'' or ``poor.'' </P>
<P> The Harris group noted that Clinton's approval rating is sliding despite an improvement in the economy. </P>
<P> ``In the past, the state of the economy has usually been the single most important factor in helping or harming other presidents' standings,'' pollster Humphrey Taylor said in releasing the results. </P>
<P> The survey found that poorer people were more likely to approve of the president's job performance, with those earning less than $7,500 per year the only income group to show a 50 percent or better approval rating. </P>
<P> Blacks were much more positive than the nation as a whole with 64 percent offering a positive rating, compared with 37 percent for whites and 42 percent for Hispanics. </P>
<P> Harris said that Clinton's approval rating has dropped consistently since a February survey when it was 50 percent positive and 48 percent negative. </P>
<P> The survey was conducted between July 25 and July 28 of a nationwide sample of 1,249 adults. The poll has a statistical margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. </P>
