<DATELINE>KIGALI, Rwanda (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A team of international investigators began work in Rwanda Monday to determine how many Hutu refugees died when the army's attempt to close Kibeho camp by force ended in slaughter. </P>
<P> Rwanda promised total cooperation but one of the investigation's first tasks will be to check reports that the Rwanda Patriotic Army (RPA) secretly buried many of those killed by weapons and stampedes on April 22. </P>
<P> ``We gather here not to ascribe blame, not to witch-hunt, but to find the objective truth,'' the United Nations special representative in Rwanda, Shaharyar Khan, told the panel before it started work in camera. </P>
<P> The independent international commission of inquiry, to give its full name, has representatives from seven Western nations, the United Nations, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Rwandan government. </P>
<P> The truth about Kibeho is hotly disputed, even within the United Nations, and the international outrage about the army's role in the carnage led to a partial suspension of foreign aid. </P>
<P> Kibeho severely damaged relations between the government and the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR), whose Security Council mandate expires on June 9. </P>
<P> Australian and Zambian U.N. peacekeepers at Kibeho said they counted 4,000 bodies on April 22 and 23 in about half the sprawling camp for internally displaced Hutus. </P>
<P> This led a U.N. spokesman in Kigali to extrapolate on April 23 that there could be up to 8,000 deaths -- a figure now considered by most witnesses to be highly exaggerated. </P>
<P> Later on April 23 Khan and other U.N. officials reckoned the toll at about 5,000. A few hours later, UNAMIR said a ``scientific count'' showed about 2,000 deaths. </P>
<P> Rwanda's government rejected any such figure with President Pasteur Bizimungu saying only 200-300 Hutus had died. He and other leaders blamed most of the deaths on panic stampedes and machete attacks by Hutu hardliners against their own people. </P>
<P> Since then more than 330 bodies have been exhumed but some U.N. sources say RPA troops have ferried bodies from mass graves at Kibeho to secret sites where they will never be counted. </P>
<P> The people living in indescribable squalor at Kibeho are the defiant rump of up to 250,000 Hutus whose camps were closed by the army last month and who were ordered back to their homes. They fled to camps in the southwest last July when the mainly Tutsi Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) defeated the Hutu government army. </P>
<P> The Hutus fear reprisals for the genocide of up to one million Tutsis and Hutu allies between April and June last year. </P>
