<DATELINE>BEIJING (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Chinese and U.S. officials took active steps Monday toward resuming talks on intellectual property piracy with U.S. sources saying the sides could tackle the multibillion-dollar feud as soon as Feb. 13. </P>
<P> Restarting negotiations by then would give top global economy and the world's most populous country 13 days to strike a deal to avert a trade war that looms with threats of tit-for-tat import sanctions on Feb. 26. </P>
<P> The U.S. Embassy and China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation confirmed the sides were in contact most of the day but said no date or venue had been fixed. </P>
<P> ``As of right now the date is not really set,'' embassy spokesman Robert Laing told Reuters in the late afternoon. </P>
<P> ``But the contact has been made and we are really confident that the talks will resume,'' he added. </P>
<P> Neither side would confirm a report from a U.S. source that they were aiming to return to the bargaining table during the week of Feb. 13. </P>
<P> The sides hope to reach a settlement that addresses U.S. complaints about rampant theft of U.S. copyrights, trademarks and patents in China, which U.S. firms say cost them hundreds of millions of dollars a year. </P>
<P> Only such a deal can avert imposition on Feb. 26 of crippling import tariffs and other sanctions that analysts say would explode into a trade war with many regional casualties. </P>
<P> Washington and Beijing ordered the sanctions Saturday but gave each other a 22-day grace period for further talks. </P>
<P> Another U.S. Embassy spokesman said diplomats had taken note of local media reports of new enforcement moves against some of the 29 south China factories alleged by Washington to be flooding Asia with cheap copies of U.S. compact discs. </P>
<P> He gave no details. </P>
<P> Optimism about new talks ran strong among U.S. business leaders in Beijing. </P>
<P> American Chamber of Commerce chief William Warwick said there was ample time to strike a deal, noting that two earlier Sino-U.S. disputes had been settled during the days between annoucement of sanctions and their effective date. </P>
<P> ``There is not a trade war yet,'' Warwick, who is also chairman of AT&T China, told Reuters in an interview. </P>
<P> ``A trade war would not settle the issue of intellectual property and would poison the commercial relationships between the two countries on a broader basis than the items named in the sanctions,'' he added. </P>
<P> The Hong Kong stock exchange, a hypersensitive barometer of China's economic and political outlook, soared 5.6 percent on a tide of bullish foreign capital. </P>
<P> On China's main exchange at Shanghai, the domestic A share index plunged 5.3 percent on trade-war fears, but analysts said optimism about a settlement kept losses in check. </P>
<P> Word that new talks were in the works came less than a day after China's tough foreign trade minister Wu Yi said defiantly that Chinese exporters could find ``countless'' other markets if sanctions bar them from U.S. markets. </P>
<P> U.S. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown spoke in more cooperative tones Sunday, saying he hoped the potentially devastating dispute could be resolved. </P>
<P> ``We never stop wanting to engage the Chinese and others with whom we are having disputes and I would hope that there could be a re-engagement so that this problem could be overcome,'' Brown told reporters in Jerusalem. </P>
<P> U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor had invited Beijing to send a negotiating team to Washington after the last round of talks collapsed in Beijing on Jan. 28, but Beijing did not reply before Saturday's deadline. </P>
<P> China's silence prompted Kantor to follow through on his threat to order punitive 100 percent tariffs on $1.08 billion in Chinese imports, and China reacted with its own carefully aimed counter-measures. </P>
<P> The reciprocal three-week grace period was seen widely as a sign of mutual unwillingness to go to the brink of a trade war that both sides admit neither could win. </P>
