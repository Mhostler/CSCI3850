<P>  A flood of calls to buy tickets on the Eurostar Channel Tunnel train swamped telephone lines Monday, indicating customers were ignoring the service's public relations fiascos of last week. </P>
<P> Eurostar aims to snag passengers from airlines on the London-Paris route, the world's busiest, and London-Brussels. </P>
<P> Tickets went on sale early Monday at a central telephone booking office at Ashford in southern England, near the site of the channel tunnel, and at the gleaming International Rail Terminal at London's Waterloo station two hours later. </P>
<P> ``In the first three hours they dealt with over 600 calls,'' said Malcolm Parsons, a spokesman for European Passenger Services (EPS), the British arm of the Eurostar consortium, which also has the Belgian and French railways as members. </P>
<P> He said the telephone system was unable to cope with the flood of calls and many customers had been unable to get through. </P>
<P> The high interest was encouraging news for Eurostar's operators after two public relations fiascos last week. </P>
<P> Thursday, some 400 journalists were kept waiting for around an hour at Waterloo when one of the $39 million trains broke down and no replacement was on standby. </P>
<P> The next day another train ground to a halt outside the French port of Calais, this time carrying Sir Alistair Morton, the chief of Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel, and Sir Bob Reid, head of British Rail. </P>
<P> ``Every new engineering project has its problems,'' said Martin Holmes, a 41-year old civil servant who had just bought a ticket for $155, one of the special introductory offers that need to be booked 14 days in advance. </P>
<P> A standard return is priced at $253 and a first class return at $318. </P>
<P> Cormac Sheedy, booking a second-class ticket for himself and his wife for a trip to Paris, thought prices a bit high and said they would need to come down to be competitive with the airlines. </P>
