<P>  Pope John Paul II left Sri Lanka Saturday at the end of a exhaustive four-nation tour that also took him to the Philippines, Papua New Guinea and Australia. </P>
<P> The pontiff, overcoming fatigue, security alerts and protests from Buddhist monks, said on departure he had profound esteem for the strong religious sense which marks many Asian societies. </P>
<P> ``I am fully convinced that the time is ripe in human history for the followers of the various religions to seek a new respect for one another,'' he said in a departure speech. </P>
<P> John Paul, whose Sri Lankan visit roused the ire of Buddhists hurt by remarks he made against their religion in a recent book, appealed to Sri Lankans to work for reconciliation and harmony. </P>
<P> ``I encourage the government and all other parties involved to persevere in negotiating a just end to the conflict which has marred Sri Lankan life in recent years...,'' he said referring to a 12-year Tamil revolt in which more than 30,000 people have been killed. </P>
<P> The pontiff beatified Father Joseph Vaz, a 17th century Goanese missionary, during his two-day visit. He now is returning to Rome. </P>
