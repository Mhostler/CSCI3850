<P>  A third victim died Friday from injuries sustained when a gunman opened fire in a downtown Seattle courthouse where a judge was hearing his petition for a marriage annulment, hospital officials said. </P>
<P> Veronica Laureta, 46, died of gunshot wounds in the head, chest, abdomen and arms, said Larry Zalin, spokesman for Harborview Medical Center. </P>
<P> Police said Timothy Blackwell, 47, a computer technician, was being held in connection with Thursday's shooting spree with a semi-automatic handgun. </P>
<P> Also killed were Blackwell's wife, Susana Remerata Blackwell, 25, who was eight months pregnant, and Phoebe Dizon, 46. Efforts to save the baby were unsuccessful. </P>
<P> Blackwell reportedly met his wife, who was from the Philippines, through a correspondence arranged by International Connections in Bellingham, Wash., and they married in the Philippines in 1993. </P>
<P> Shortly after Susana Blackwell came to the United States in early 1994 the couple separated and she filed assault charges against him, which were later dismissed, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported. </P>
<P> Blackwell then filed for annulment of the marriage on grounds of fraud, which could have led to Susana Blackwell's deportation. The other two women were scheduled to testify at the hearing on behalf of Susana Blackwell. </P>
<P> As a result of the shooting, metal detectors were installed Friday at entrances to the King County Courthouse in downtown Seattle, where judges have been pleading for years for increased security. </P>
<P> Previously metal detectors had been installed only outside selected courtrooms. </P>
