<DATELINE>KUALA TERENGGANU, Malaysia, April 19 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Malaysia's Islamic party could capture an oil-rich state in the Malay heartland in next week's election as infighting has weakened the ruling National Front, politicians and analysts say. </P>
<P> The Pan-Malaysian Islamic party, known by its acronym in Malay as PAS, could capitalise on a rising tide of rural Islamic sentiment in the election on April 24-25, they said. </P>
<P> ``PAS stands a real chance of forming the state government in Terengganu just like they did in Kelantan state in 1990,'' political analyst Wan Hamid Musa told Reuters. </P>
<P> PAS and its coalition partner, the Malay Spirit of '46 party (Semangat 46) swept all 39 state and 13 parliamentary posts in neighbouring Kelantan in the 1990 general elections. </P>
<P> It was the first time Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) -- the dominant party in the National Front coalition that has ruled Malaysia since independence in 1957 -- had been shut out in elections. </P>
<P> PAS advocates an Islamic state in rapidly-growing Malaysia and has been trying to implement a harsh Islamic justice system, which prescribes limb amputation for thieves and stoning women for adultery, in Kelantan. </P>
<P> Hamid said UMNO is riven by feuds over candidates picked for the polls in Terengganu. </P>
<P> ``Some old guards are being phased out by the National Front as the coalition wants new blood to chart out Terengganu's industrialisation,'' he told Reuters here in the state capital. </P>
<P> Incumbent Terengganu Chief Minister Wan Mokhtar Ahmad said last week 19 new faces will debut in the election, mostly UMNO candidates from its influential youth movement. </P>
