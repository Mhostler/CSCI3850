<P>  The Aga Khan, worldwide leader of 15 million Shi'ite Ismaili Moslems, is seeking a divorce from his British-born wife, a spokesman said on Tuesday. </P>
<P> The spokesman said lawyers had been told on September 30 to seek the divorce from his wife, born Sarah Frances Croker-Poole, after nearly 25 years of marriage. </P>
<P> ``The Aga Khan does not normally make statements on his or his family's private lives and therefore will issue no further statement on this development,'' the spokesman said. </P>
<P> Karim Aga Khan, 57, a British citizen and at the time the ``world's most eligible bachelor,'' married fashion model Lady Sarah in October 1969. The daughter of a British army officer, she became a MusliM and took the name Princess Salima. </P>
<P> The couple, who are reported to have been living apart for several years, have three children -- Princess Zahra, 24, Prince Rahim, 23, and Prince Hussain, 20. </P>
<P> Karim Aga Khan is believed by his followers to be the 49th direct descendant of the prophet Mohammed. Many see him as a ``living god.'' </P>
<P> He is reputedly one of the richest men in the world, controlling a vast commercial empire benefiting his devotees and others, while his bloodstock acumen has made him one of the biggest names in international horse racing. </P>
<P> He was the eldest son of Aly Khan, who lived a jetset life that ended when he died at the wheel of his Italian sports car in 1959. </P>
<P> A society debutante in 1958, Lady Sarah married Lord James Crichton-Stuart, younger brother of the sixth Marquis of Bute, but they divorced later. </P>
<P> She became a much sought-after model and was introduced to the young Aga Khan in the Swiss ski resort of St Moritz on New Year's Eve, 1968. </P>
<P> At their society wedding she wore a white sari and pearls were thrown at her feet by fervent followers. </P>
