<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A soldier was injured when suspected IRA guerrillas fired a mortar bomb at a police and army base in Northern Ireland Wednesday, police said. </P>
<P> A police spokesman said the attack, in Newtonhamilton on the border with Ireland, was almost certainly the work of the Irish Republican Army, which is fighting to oust the British from Northern Ireland. </P>
<P> ``There was an explosion inside the base and one soldier was injured, it is not known how seriously,'' a police spokesman said. </P>
<P> Last week the IRA fired three mortar bombs into another security forces base on the border, injuring more than 30 people. The group's political arm Sinn Fein recently rejected Anglo-Irish offers for it to join peace talks if it renounced violence, saying all sides must first disarm. </P>
