<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Steve Tisch, the co-producer of ''Forrest Gump,'' got a Valentine's Day kiss on his birthday Tuesday from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences as the hit movie received 13 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. </P>
<P> John Travolta, the dancing heart-throb who sizzled in ''Saturday Night Fever'' and ``Grease'' in the 1970's but thought Hollywood had forgotten him in the 1990s, found his career revived with a long-stemmed Valentine rose with a Best Actor nomination from the Academy. </P>
<P> It came for his serious acting role in ``Pulp Fiction,'' a violent, dark satire set in Los Angeles. </P>
<P> ``It's a very original birthday present,'' said Tisch, who turned 46 Tuesday as ``Gump'' became only the fifth film in Hollywood history to be nominated for as many Oscars by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. </P>
<P> ``In a word, it's just thrilling. The film deserves it ... It was terrific that the Academy recognized so many people in so many different areas,'' he said in an interview with Reuters. </P>
<P> Only one film, ``All About Eve,'' has surpassed ``Gump's'' achievement. It received 14 nominations in 1950. </P>
<P> ``Gump'' was the first time a film piled up 13 nominations since the 1966 classic drama ``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' The others were ``Gone With the Wind'' (1939), ``From Here to Eternity'' (1953) and ``Mary Poppins'' (1964). </P>
<P> If his highly acclaimed hit film about a simple person's brush with history wins the Best Picture Oscar, Tisch will walk up to the podium with co-producers Wendy Finerman and Steve Starkey. </P>
<P> Travolta, last nominated for ``Saturday Night Fever,'' was elated at being recognized once again by the film industry after years in the Hollywood wilderness. </P>
<P> ``I'm so excited just to be part of the game again. I feel like I've rekindled my whole career,'' Travolta said in an interview on ``Good Morning America.'' </P>
<P> Krzysztof Kieslowski, the director of the film ``Red,'' said he was completely surprised by his Best Director Oscar nomination, calling himself a pessimist. </P>
<P> Asked if he was surprised by the nomination, Kieslowski said, ``Absolutely. I'm a pessimist,'' he said in a phone interview from his home in Warsaw, Poland. ``As a pessimist I cannot see the clear, nice future.'' </P>
<P> Kieslowski, a Polish native who had lived in France for several years because that is where he found the most film work, said he sees his chances of actually winning an Oscar at ``zero point five percent.'' But he called the nomination ``an important distinction. ... I am pleased. I am happy,'' he said. </P>
<P> Originally Kieslowski had hoped ``Red,''would be nominated for Best Foreign Language Picture category, but it was ruled ineligible because of its mixed parentage. </P>
<P> This year, Switzerland, where ``Red'' was filmed, submitted the film as its entry in the foreign language category. ``But the Academy refused because it was too little Swiss,'' Kieslowski said. </P>
<P> It was the second consecutive year that the Academy's arcane rules on foreign language films had excluded Kieslowski. </P>
<P> Cuba saw another revolution of sorts as that nation's film was nominated for Best Foreign Picture for ``Strawberry and Chocolate.'' </P>
<P> An excited announcer read the news of Cuba's first Oscar nomination hot from news agency wires in a morning news program on state Radio Rebelde. </P>
<P> ``Even if it doesn't get past the nomination, Cuban cinema has won one of its biggest prizes,'' said the film's leading actor Jorge Perugorria. </P>
<P> ``It's a taking off, an opening into the international market,'' he added. </P>
<P> The film, an instant hit in Cuba that won eight awards when it was first shown at Havana's Latin American film festival in December 1993, is a witty account of a friendship between a sophisticated homosexual and a plodding Communist Party militant. </P>
<P> Co-directed by Tomas Gutierrez Alea and Juan Carlos Tabio, the film is a warm-hearted appeal for tolerance of homosexuality and of difference in general. </P>
<P> Tabio's reaction was more muted. He said he was pleased at the news of the nomination, although he was not a fan of awards in general. ``I don't think a prize says it all, but there's no doubt that this is gratifying,'' he said. </P>
<P> For the gambling community, British bookmaker Ladbrokes made ``Forrest Gump'' the odds-on favorite at 4-5 to win the Academy Award for best picture, with ``Pulp Fiction given odds of 7-4. </P>
<P> Ladbrokes was also betting that Tom Hanks, the star of ''Gump,'' would walk away with his second Oscar for best actor, after winning the top prize last year for his performance as a lawyer battling AIDS in the film ``Philadelphia.'' </P>
