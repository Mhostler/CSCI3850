<P>  President Alberto Fujimori scored a resounding first-round victory with more with than 60 percent of the valid vote in Sunday's elections, allowing him to rule Peru until the end of the century, polling agencies said. </P>
<P> Preliminary results from 99 percent of a nationwide sample of voting tables showed Fujimori with 63.7 percent of the valid vote and chief rival, former U.N. chief Javier Perez de Cuellar, with 24.4 percent, polling firm Apoyo S.A. said. </P>
<P> The National Elections Board was due to give first official results by 11 p.m. local (midnight EDT). </P>
<P> ``The overwhelming support in this first round shows Peru has decided to continue on the same road,'' Fujimori told foreign correspondents on Sunday night. ``Continuity of a government program is fundamental for a country to develop.'' </P>
<P> His aim, he said, was to make Peru ``the leading country in Latin America.'' </P>
<P> Earlier, Fujimori, the 56-year-old son of Japanese immigrants, stood with his two daughters at his side, in the absence of his estranged wife Susana Higuchi, on the balcony of a downtown Lima hotel waving at the crowd below. </P>
<P> Apoyo S.A. said its figures showed Fujimori's party would likley win a majority in the congress with 51 percent of the vote. Pollsters had predicted he would not have a majority. </P>
<P> Taking a conciliatory tone towards his opponent, Fujimori said: ``I salute Dr. Perez de Cuellar for having participated in this campaign. He has contributed a lot of ideas, some of which we are going to take into account.'' </P>
<P> Fujimori had been favored to win the elections although the voting was clouded by a vote-tampering scandal in the northeastern provincial city of Huanuco which caused the opposition to cry foul on the eve of the vote. </P>
<P> But the incident, which involved officials of the National Elections Board and Fujimori's Change 90-New Majority party and members of opposition parties, did not appear to sway voters from casting their ballots for the Fujimori camp. </P>
<P> Cesar Gaviria, head of an Organization of American States election observer team, told a news conference that the elections board had acted rapidly to investigate the incident, in which 15 people have been detained and charged, but called on authorities to conclude the probe. </P>
<P> The attempt to tamper with up to 3,000 tally sheets could have affected 600,000 votes in five Peruvian provinces and prompted seven of 13 opposition candidates, including Perez de Cuellar, to call the fairness of the vote into question. </P>
<P> No major incidents were reported although voting got off to a slow start due to lack of staff or materials, Gaviria said. </P>
<P> ``In our opinion, the vote has taken place without any incidents we could even describe as irregularities,'' he said. </P>
<P> Fujimori, who describes himself as ``president-manager,'' has maintained a high level of popular support during his five-year rule by slashing inflation, stabilizing the economy and virtually stamping out a bloody 15-year-old Maoist insurgency. </P>
<P> ``He (Fujimori) has brought peace to Peru,'' said Eduardo Saavedra after voting for Fujimori at a Miraflores school. </P>
<P> Shining Path guerrillas entered a few towns in the coca- growing Upper Huallaga valley and threatened voters ahead of the election. They killed two members of self-defence forces in southeastern Ayacucho region but for the most part the balloting was not marred by violence. </P>
