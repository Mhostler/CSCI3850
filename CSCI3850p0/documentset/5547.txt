<DATELINE>DHAKA, April 7 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Bangladesh's Home (Interior) Ministry has given prosecutors the go-ahead to begin formally the trial of Taslima Nasrin, the self-exiled feminist writer who fled the country eight months ago after death threats from Islamic extremists. </P>
<P> Public Prosecuter Abdur Razzak Khan submitted on Thursday a copy of the permission order to the Additional Chief Metropolitan Megistrate (CMM), A.K.M. Kamaluddin, the judge of the trial court, court sources said. </P>
<P> ``The permission has removed a technical snag standing in the way of Nasrin's trial,'' they said. </P>
<P> The trial will now begin on April 15. </P>
<P> Under Bangladeshi law, a person who commits an offence outside the country cannot be tried without special permission from the Home Ministry. </P>
<P> Nasrin, 32, received death threats from Moslem fundamentalists after she told India's Statesman newspaper last year that Islam's holy book, the Koran, ``should be revised thorougly.'' </P>
<P> In the interview she bitterly criticised Islam for curtailing rights of the women. </P>
<P> Nasrin, who fled to Sweden in August, has said she was misquoted by the interviewer. </P>
<P> The CMM told prosecutors on March 11 that a trial in her absence could not be started unless they obtained permission from the ministry. </P>
