<P>  A dying mother's wish was that her son would give her the gift of death and he told how he fulfilled that desire in a medical journal report published Tuesday. </P>
<P> Dr David Eddy, of Jackson, Wyoming, said his 85-year-old mother, Virginia, was in declining health following surgery and had developed a number of health problems that significantly decreased her quality of life. </P>
<P> She saw no point in continuing to live, Eddy said in a report published in this week's Journal of the American Medical Association. She asked him to help her end her own life. </P>
<P> Eddy recalls his mother saying shortly before she died: ''I'd like this to be my gift. Whether they are terminally ill, in intractable pain, or like me, just know that the right time has come for them, more people might want to know that this way exists. And maybe physicians will help them find it.'' </P>
<P> Eddy, after considering the legal and emotional implications for those involved, decided the best solution was for his mother to discontinue taking fluids. </P>
<P> She spent her remaining days in a relaxed state until she died peacefully with her family at her side, he said. </P>
<P> ``My own philosophy, undoubtedly influenced heavily by my parents, is that choosing the best way to end your life should be the ultimate right - a right to be exercised between oneself and one's beliefs, without intrusions from government or the beliefs of others,'' Eddy wrote. </P>
