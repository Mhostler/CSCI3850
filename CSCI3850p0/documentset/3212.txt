<P>  Canadian scientists reported Wednesday that they had found a new substance that seems to work against herpes, a virus that afflicts people in the form of venereal disease, shingles, chickenpox and cold sores. </P>
<P> The synthetic peptide -- a simple compound formed by amino acids, the building blocks of proteins -- stops herpes from replicating itself. It works in test tubes and in laboratory animals but has not been tested in humans. </P>
<P> ``This compound suppresses the replication of HSV (herpes simplex virus)-1, HSV-2 and acyclovir-resistant HSV strains in cell culture, and also strongly potentiates (helps) the anti-viral activity of acyclovir,'' they wrote in the science journal Nature. </P>
<P> They said it could perhaps be used in conjunction with acyclovir to help herpes sufferers. </P>
<P> Many herpes infections lie dormant in the body, popping up regularly, and are considered incurable. </P>
