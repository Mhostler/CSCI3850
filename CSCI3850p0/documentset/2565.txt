<P>  Mexico will send a team of law enforcement agents to Chiapas to determine if peasant rebels are behind a string of armed robberies in the troubled state, the attorney general's office said Saturday. </P>
<P> It said the agents were requested by Mexican Peace Commissioner Jorge Madrazo after self-styled Zapatista guerrillas said they had nothing to do with recent acts of bandidtry in the Chiapas towns of Teopisca and Tapachula. </P>
<P> In a statement, the attorney general's office said armed gangs using army and air force weapons have carried out various robberies and intimidated citizens of the two towns in the southerrn state. </P>
<P> Teopisca is 20 miles southeast of San Cristobal de las Casas, the Chiapas city that was briefly invaded by the Zapatista rebels during their uprising in January. </P>
<P> Tapachula, on the Mexican border with Guatemala, is 125 miles from San Cristobal de las Casas and is far from territory held by the rebels. </P>
<P> The attorney general's office said it wanted to find out who is behind the attacks in Chiapas. Zapatistas opponents in Chiapas have blamed the banditry on the rebels. </P>
