<DATELINE>TEHRAN, Iran (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said Friday the United States should abandon its campaign to isolate Iran, saying it had failed. </P>
<P> ``Iran ... cannot be put under embargo any more. You (U.S.) lack information. Come and see what is happening in Iran,'' Rafsanjani said in a speech carried by Tehran Radio. </P>
<P> Washington, which accuses Iran of sponsoring terrorism and seeking to build nuclear arms, has mounted a campaign to isolate Tehran. </P>
<P> The Islamic republic has tried to break its isolation by bolstering ties with countries such as India and former Soviet republics. </P>
<P> ``The recent trip of the Iranian delegation to India and Georgia was a demonstration ... that it is a lie that Iran is isolated,'' Rafsanjani told worshippers at the mausoleum of the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to mark the 40th day of the death of his son, Ahmad Khomeini. </P>
<P> The Iranian leader acknowledged that his country faced economic difficulties but urged Iranians to withstand the hardships. </P>
<P> Iran has faced a flurry of new price increases after the doubling of fuel prices last month. The government's 43 percent devaluation of one of the rial exchange rates this week led to the rial weakening against hard currencies on the open market. </P>
<P> Rafsanjani accused foreign media of carrying out a psychological war against Iran and urged critics at home not to feed this propaganda. </P>
<P> ``Do not allow them (foreign media) to feed on your negative statements,'' he said in an apparent reference to foreign radio programs that quoted critical articles in the local press about economic difficulties and widening corruption in Iran. </P>
