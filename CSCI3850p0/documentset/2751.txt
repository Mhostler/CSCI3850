<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Greece's former conservative prime minister Constantine Mitsotakis will go on trial in January on charges of illegally phonetapping his political rivals from 1988 until late 1990, the Supreme Court said Monday. </P>
<P> The socialist-controlled parliament voted in June to send Mitsotakis to trial, and ordered the Supreme Court to set up a special 13-judge criminal tribunal and fix a trial date. </P>
<P> A Supreme Court announcement said the Mitsotakis trial would open Jan. 23 and Supreme Court President Vassilis Kokkinos would preside over the trial. </P>
<P> Mitsotakis, 75, has also been charged by parliament with allegedly accepting millions of dollars in bribes during the sale of the state AGET-Heracles cement company in 1992. No date has been set for that trial. </P>
<P> Prime minister from 1990 to 1993, Mitsotakis has denied any wrongdoing and said the charges were a political vendetta by the ruling socialists. </P>
<P> ``Your (socialist) party is trapped in a pathological thirst for revenge,'' he told parliament before the vote to send him to trial. </P>
<P> Mitsotakis led a relentless campaign in 1989 to have a conservative-controlled parliament lay separate phonetapping and corruption charges against his long-time foe -- socialist leader and now Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou. </P>
<P> Papandreou refused to attend his televised trial on charges of instigating an embezzlement scheme, calling the proceedings a farce. He was cleared of all charges in 1992 and parliament then dropped the phonetapping charges. </P>
<P> Mitsotakis faces five counts of involvement in illegal telephone wiretapping, ranging from breach of faith to moral instigation of the wiretaps. He could be sentenced to up to 30 years in prison if convicted. </P>
<P> Mitsotakis is accused of instigating a scheme to wiretap dozens of political opponents and journalists from 1988 to 1990, a period of political uncertainty in Greece when many political deals among parties were done over the phone. </P>
