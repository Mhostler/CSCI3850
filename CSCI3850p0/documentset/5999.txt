<P> The suspect jurist allegedly flung some of the cash from the bribery payment out her window when police came to arrest her. </P>
<P> The case of lower court Judge Melida Aleksic Molina has highlighted a notoriously corrupt legal system and stirred up Venezuelans long angered that those who pay stand a better chance of getting justice. </P>
<P> Aleksic was being detained for allegedly asking defendents for a total of $17,650 in bribes to rule in their favor. </P>
<P> One of them, irate over having to pay, filed a complaint with police, law enforcement authorities said. </P>
<P> After he paid the bribe, police rushed to her apartment in the nearby community of San Antonio early Saturday. </P>
<P> Eager to get rid of the evidence, Aleksic sent more than $5,880 fluttering out her 20th-story window, authorities said. </P>
<P> Some wide-eyed onlookers below thought the money was a gift from heaven at first but were quick to snatch up the loot, newspapers reported. Police recovered most of the evidence. </P>
<P> El Universal newspaper, in a detailed account of the arrest, entitled its story on Monday, ``The Night It Rained Money.'' </P>
<P> The Judiciary Council, the legal watchdog body, said Monday it will probe various courts alleged to be corrupt. </P>
