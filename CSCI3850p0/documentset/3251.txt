<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Bill Clinton, addressing America in an effort to refloat his floundering presidency, said on Thursday he was offering the nation ``a middle-class Bill of Rights'' with a new tax-cutting proposal. </P>
<P> Recalling that President Harry Truman had provided returning U.S. soldiers with a GI Bill of Rights to finance their education after World War Two, Clinton said in a televised speech from the Oval Office: ``Tonight, I propose a middle-class Bill of Rights.'' </P>
<P> ``My fellow Americans, ours is a great country ... But at this holiday season everybody knows that all is not well with America, that millions of Americans are hurting, frustrated, even angry,'' Clinton said in a 10-minute speech awaited by partisans and critics for its importance to his presidency. </P>
<P> ``The question is, what are we going to do about it? More jobs aren't enough, we have to raise incomes.'' </P>
<P> The Democratic president unveiled a tax-cut proposal that he said would provide $60 billion worth of tax breaks for middle-income families to help finance the costs of education, home-buying, medical care and child-rearing. </P>
<P> His plan would be financed by major reductions in five federal agencies. It would compete with proposals already put forth by the Republicans, who will control both houses of Congress in January thanks to the November 8 election results. </P>
<P> Clinton appealed to the Congress to work with him to enact his plan. But, in an attempt to display some of the toughness critics say he has lacked, he said: ``It's not about the next election ... That's in your hands. Meanwhile, I'm going to do what I think is right. My rule for the next two years will be country first and politics-as-usual dead last.'' </P>
<P> Clinton's four-year term runs out in two more years and it is assumed he will seek a second term in 1996. Republican challengers are expected to begin tossing their hats in the ring for their party's nomination early next year. </P>
<P> Senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee, who gave the Republican response in a brief televised speech that followed Clinton, advanced his party's view that the president is merely following where the Republicans have led on the tax-cutting issue. </P>
<P> ``If the president's new position tonight represents a real change of heart, we say, 'Welcome aboard,''' Thompson said. </P>
