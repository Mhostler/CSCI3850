<P>  Former President Jimmy Carter said Tuesday that Haiti's former provisional President Emile Jonassaint, widely thought to be a powerless figurehead, was crucial in securing acceptance of the pact that led to the return of exiled leader Jean-Bertrand Aristide. </P>
<P> In a speech at Southern Methodist University, Carter disclosed that during 11th-hour talks with Haiti's generals last month he had appealed to the generals for a chance to present a settlement proposal to Jonassaint. </P>
<P> When they agreed, Carter said he and his entourage slipped out of military headquarters and were driven to the presidential palace. </P>
<P> He said that when Jonassaint announced his agreement to ''vote for peace'', a revolt broke out in the Haitian cabinet. </P>
<P> Carter said ``all of the cabinet members stood up and said 'we will not accept the treaty'. And the defense minister said he would resign ...'' </P>
<P> ``And president Jonassaint said, 'All right, we already have a weak government and your leaving won't make it any weaker.''' </P>
<P> Carter said that when another minister stated that the cabinet would make their decision in an adjoining room, Jonassaint said: ``The decision already has been made. The decision is for peace.'' </P>
<P> Carter said Clinton had reluctantly agreed to let Jonassaint, an unelected leader, sign the pact which would set the stage for a return to democracy. </P>
<P> He said that when he asked Gen. Cedras whether he accepted the decision, the military leader answered: ``That's an insult (to) even ask me that.'''  The former president said Gen. Colin Powell, one of three U.S. negotiators at the crucial talks, told Cedras: ``I am talking to you as a military man, and you know that American forces are on the way and we have to have an answer.'' </P>
<P> ``Gen. Cedras stood up at attention, put his hat under his arm and said, 'I give you my word of honor as a military officer that I would obey the command of my president.'''  ``So I called the president and told him we had an agreement,'' said Carter. </P>
<P> ``And he said, ``Thank God, Thank God.'' </P>
