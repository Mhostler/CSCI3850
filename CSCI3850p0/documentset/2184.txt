<P>  A year after angry Canadians revolted at the polls and brought a decade of Conservative party rule to an end, the man who picked up the pieces is one of the most popular Canadian leaders in history. </P>
<P> Prime Minister Jean Chretien, written off before the election last Oct. 25 as yesterday's man, has shrewdly kept out of trouble since his Liberal party swept to power on an anti-incumbent wave, and he now enjoys the support of some 60 percent of Canadians. </P>
<P> ``There is still that halo effect,'' said University of Toronto political scientist Nelson Wiseman. ``Chretien has been very shrewd in not expending his political capital.'' </P>
<P> But a host of thorny problems loom on the horizon, political analysts said. </P>
<P> The new government of the French-speaking province of Quebec has promised to hold a referendum next year on whether Canada's largest province should secede from the federation, and Chretien will be called on to lead the fight to preserve the union. </P>
<P> The debate over Quebec could be heating up just as Chretien prepares to chair a summit of the world's major industrial powers in Halifax, Nova Scotia, next June. </P>
<P> Chretien's government could also run into opposition to its plans to slash spending on social programs such as unemployment, education, and welfare to reduce the budget deficit, a move sure to galvanize interest groups. </P>
<P> ``Reforming social programs and the referendum in Quebec are the tripwires for Chretien,'' said University of Toronto political scientist Nelson Wiseman. </P>
<P> Voters, fed up with high taxes and the air of corruption that clung to the governmment of former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, humiliated the Conservatives in October 1993, reducing them to a mere two seats in the 295-member Parliament. </P>
<P> The Liberals won 177 seats, and almost immediately after the election the new government received a big gift -- an economy growing at the fastest rate of major industrial countries. </P>
<P> ``Chretien is like a grandfather sitting in his rocking chair on a porch with a pipe in his mouth not doing very much,'' said University of Waterloo political scientist Peter Woolstencroft. </P>
<P> The most recent public opinion polls give the Liberals over 60 percent of voter support, the highest ever for a governing party in Canada, according to the Gallup polling organization. </P>
<P> The personal popularity of Chretien, who has a wooden speaking style because he suffers from a partial facial paralysis, is also about 60 percent, the highest rating for a Canadian leader in recent history, pollsters said. </P>
<P> ``They really haven't done a lot, so they haven't had a chance to drop in the opinion polls,'' said Jon Hughes, a pollster with Gallup Canada Inc. </P>
<P> Chretien's folksy style, which masks a shrewd political sense honed by almost 30 years in government, has gone down well with Canadians disillusioned by Mulroney's aggressive style. </P>
<P> Chretien's Liberals have also benefited from an inexperienced and mostly ineffective opposition in Parliament. </P>
<P> The election brought two new regional parties to the federal Parliament in force -- the right-wing Reform Party from the western provinces with 52 seats and the separatist Quebec-based Bloc Quebecois with 53 seats. </P>
<P> Neither was able to put the experienced Liberals on the defensive consistently. </P>
<P> But of late the Quebec separatists have begun to score points against Chretien. </P>
<P> ``They now have a government in Quebec plotting all these traps and they will have to deal with that,'' said Wiseman of the University of Toronto. </P>
