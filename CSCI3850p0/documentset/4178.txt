<P>  Burmese forces have stepped up an artillery barrage against the last major Karen guerrilla border base, forcing Thai civilians living in the area to take refuge deeper in Thailand, Thai officials said on Tuesday. </P>
<P> Burmese forces, who have been shelling the Karen's Kawmoora base at regular intervals around the clock for the past two weeks, launched a sustained artillery attack late Monday and the barrage continued more than 12 hours later. </P>
<P> Kawmoora, the last major Karen guerrilla border base after the fall of their Manerplaw headquarters on Jan. 27, is located in a Burmese loop of the Moei river which forms the border with Thailand. </P>
<P> Several Burmese shells and mortar bombs have fallen on the Thai side of the border in the latest attack forcing about 70 Thai civilians who live near the frontier out of their homes to a school deeper in Thai territory, Thai officials said. </P>
<P> Burmese forces had begun using air-burst rounds which explode above the ground, showering shrapnel down on the guerrillas in their bunkers, a Thai army officer said. </P>
<P> While Karen guerrillas still operate in several areas on the Burmese side of the Thai-Burmese frontier Kawmoora is the last of what until only a few years ago was a string of well-fortified bases along the border. </P>
<P> The Karen National Union guerrilla group has been fighting for greater autonomy since 1949, one year after Burma gained independence from Britain. </P>
