<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Just when it seemed the Spurs would never lose another game, the Trail Blazers brought them down to earth with a humbling 91-71 rout. </P>
<P> Clifford Robinson scored 23 points and Otis Thorpe scored six of his 16 points in a key 16-2 third-quarter run as Portland halted San Antonio's club-record 15-game win streak. </P>
<P> David Robinson had 21 points and 12 rebounds and Sean Elliott added 15 for the Spurs, who were held to their lowest point total in team history. The Spurs also shot a franchise-low 31 per cent (23-of-75) from the field. </P>
<P> Thorpe, who also had 10 rebounds, helped the Blazers turn a 48-46 lead with 6:48 remaining in the third quarter into a 64-48 bulge heading into the final period. </P>
<P> The Spurs would get no closer than 15 points thereafter. </P>
<P> ``We were bad tonight,'' said Robinson. ``Nothing went right. We did a lot of dumb things. Offensively we didn't do anything we wanted to do. It was bad all the way around.'' </P>
<P> In Houston, the Dallas Mavericks and Rockets combined for over 300 points in a double overtime thriller. </P>
