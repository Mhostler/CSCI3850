<P>  The Security Council Monday stressed the importance of free and fair elections in Haiti and urged the government to take steps to ensure their success. </P>
<P> Parliamentary and local elections are scheduled for June 25, with a second round of balloting July 16. </P>
<P> A statement read at a brief council meeting, prompted by a recent report by Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, welcomed the transfer of responsibilities in Haiti March 31 from a United States-led multinational force to a U.N. peacekeeping force. </P>
<P> The council said it shared the secretary-general's view that this was a milestone in efforts by the international community to bring peace and stability to the Caribbean nation whose president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, was restored to office last October three years after being overthrown in a military coup. </P>
<P> But the council said much remained to be done to institutionalize democracy in Haiti and that the government and people bore primary responsibility for the country's political, economic and social reconstruction. </P>
<P> Underlining the ``crucial importance of free, fair and secure elections for the democratic future of Haiti,'' it stressed the necessity of a secure environment and the importance of a functioning police force and an established judicial system. </P>
<P> The Security Council urged the Haitian government to ``take all necessary steps to ensure the success of the elections, and in particular to register as many voters as possible'' and to assure, in cooperation with the international community, that political campaigning occurs in an environment free from partisan intimidation. </P>
<P> The statement welcomed meetings which Aristide has held with leaders of political parties and members of a provisional electoral council and stressed the importance of dialogue aimed at achieving the political consensus needed to enhance the benefits and credibility of the electoral process. </P>
