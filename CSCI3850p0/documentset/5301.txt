<P>  The estate of tobacco heiress Doris Duke, who became one of the richest women in the world after an inheritance from her father, gave its first donation since her death to Duke University Wednesday. </P>
<P> The school founded by her father James Duke received $10.5 million, university officials said. They said the bequest would support interdisciplinary research and teaching. </P>
<P> Doris Duke's estate was valued at $1.2 billion when she died Oct. 28, 1993 at age 80. </P>
<P> ``This bequest will help support scientists at Duke who are working to solve some of the most intractable problems that plague humanity,'' Duke University President Nannerl Keohane said in a statement. </P>
<P> ``They are trying to open new doors in human understanding -- from finding the keys to possible cures for AIDS, Alzheimer's disease and cancer, to developing elegant computer models that will help advance our knowledge of the environment,'' she added. </P>
<P> Duke University was founded in 1924 with a $40 million gift from James Duke, who was president of the American Tobacco Co and had extensive other business interests. The multimillionaire died the next year and his only child, Doris, then 12, inherited half of his $100 million estate. </P>
<P> Under the terms of Duke's will, which as had been hotly contested, more than $1 billion would be used to establish the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation. </P>
<P> The foundation provides funds for environmental and ecological causes, education, medical research, the prevention of cruelty to children and animals and the performing arts. Those were causes Duke supported in her lifetime. She had given Duke University a gift of $2 million for AIDS research a few weeks before her death. </P>
