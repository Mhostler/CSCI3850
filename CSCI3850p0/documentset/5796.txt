<P>  Following are the main points of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which came into force in March 1970 for 25 years. Below also are the known positions of some of the 176 states attending a three-week review conference beginning on Monday. </P>
<P> -- The five nuclear powers -- the United States, the Soviet Union (now Russia), Britain, France and China -- pledge not to transfer atomic weapons ``to any recipient whatsoever.'' </P>
<P> -- The five promise to ``pursue negotiations in good faith'' toward stopping the nuclear arms race and achieving complete disarmament. </P>
<P> -- Non-nuclear states agree not to receive the transfer of any nuclear weapons and to accept monitoring and safeguards by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) of all nuclear facilities. </P>
<P> -- Treaty members have the ``inalienable right'' to develop, research and have access to nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. </P>
<P> -- Signatories to the treaty are to decide by majority vote whether to extend the treaty indefinitely, extend it for a fixed period of time or for several renewable fixed periods. </P>
<P> But the treaty cannot be cancelled. If no agreement is reached, which is unlikely, they could adjourn for what diplomats call a ``coffee break'' and continue negotiations at a later date. </P>
<P></P>
<P> -- For indefinite extension: about 79 countries, including the United States, Russia, Canada, the European Community, the South Pacific Forum, the Central American group, Argentina, South Korea and others. The position of China is not known. </P>
<P> -- Against indefinite extension but favoring varying lengths of time: about 20 nations, including Indonesia, Colombia, Mexico, Egypt, Nigeria, Burma, Algeria, North Korea, Venezuela, South Africa, Uganda and Ecuador. </P>
