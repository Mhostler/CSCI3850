<P>  A new wave of labor unrest swept France Wednesday as workers frustrated by wage freezes, high unemployment and broken political promises maneuvered to take advantage of coming presidential elections to win concessions. </P>
<P> ``In this campaign, the candidates are saying whatever they want so long as they can seduce a few voters,'' Nicole Notat, head of France's largest union, the pro-Socialist CFDT, told the French daily Liberation. </P>
<P> Analysts see the strikes as most damaging to conservative Prime Minister Edouard Balladur ahead of the two-stage April 23-May 7 election. As prime minister for the past two years, he has become the primary focus of worker anger. </P>
<P> But for Balladur's conservative rival, frontrunner and Paris mayor Jacques Chirac, the unrest has become an opportunity to drive home his message that pay raises are not the enemy of jobs. </P>
<P> Balladur defended his support for creating jobs and cutting state deficits over across-the-board public sector pay hikes. He advocates only selective pay rises, negotiated case-by-case. </P>
<P> ``I find it understandable that economic growth has returned and people want to share in this, but if we destroy the growth there will be nothing to share,'' he told France-2 television. </P>
<P> Balladur later lashed out at Socialist contender Lionel Jospin, questioning whether even Socialist voters wanted another Socialist at the Elysee Palace after 14 years of Francois Mitterrand, who steps down in May. </P>
<P> ``This is a page that is already being turned and no one wants to go back to it,'' the premier said at a rally in the northwestern town of Chateau-Gontier. </P>
<P> Jospin, campaigning in the southern city of Toulouse, struck back by accusing his conservative rivals of trying to keep him on the campaign sidelines. </P>
<P> A SOFRES survey published Wednesday by the weekly Nouvel Observateur confirmed other recent polls showing Chirac strengthening his lead over Jospin and Balladur in the final days ahead of the April 23 first-round ballot. </P>
<P> The poll conducted Saturday through Monday showed Balladur in third place with 19 percent of the vote behind Chirac on 26 percent and Jospin on 21 percent, pointing to a Chirac-Jospin run-off in the May 7 final ballot. </P>
<P> Among Wednesday's labor targets were Michelin, the tire-maker, which was hit by protests after reporting a return to profitability Tuesday, automaker Renault and the oil giant Elf Aquitaine, which has announced plans to let go 300 workers and shut down unprofitable gas stations. </P>
