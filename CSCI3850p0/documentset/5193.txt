<P>  Hillary Rodham Clinton arrived in Pakistan early Sunday on the first leg of a 12-day goodwill trip to South Asia, focusing on efforts to improve the lives of women and children in five of the world's poorest countries. </P>
<P> Mrs. Clinton, accompanied by her and President Clinton's 15-year-old daughter Chelsea, was greeted by Pakistani and U.S. Embassy officials at a brief, rain-soaked, plane-side welcoming ceremony at Islamabad airport just after midnight local time. </P>
<P> ``Our nations have enjoyed a long history of friendship and shared interests, and for that reason I am especially pleased to begin my visit to South Asia here in Pakistan,'' the First Lady said in an arrival statement. </P>
<P> ``Two weeks is far too brief a time to absorb the full richness and vitality of this region of the world, but I hope my visit will help Americans and South Asians gain a greater appreciation of the opportunitiess and challenges that join us as a global family,'' Mrs. Clinton said. </P>
<P> During a refueling stop in Cairo on her 21-hour journey from Washington, Mrs. Clinton and Chelsea left the airport and spent nearly two hours touring the pyramids with Zahi Hawass, Egypt's Director of Antiquities, acting as guide. </P>
<P> The American visitors were especially impressed by an ancient boat used by one of Egypt's rulers about 4000 years ago which was unearthed in the mid-1950s and painstakingly restored. </P>
<P> It is now on display in a museum adjacent to the largest of the pyramids at Giza. </P>
<P> Mrs. Clinton was to begin her official schedule later Sunday at a luncheon hosted by Pakistani Prime Minister Benezir Bhutto.  Afterward, she was to pay homage to Pakistan's Islamic identity by visiting Faisal Mosque. </P>
<P> It was built in the 1970s as a showcase of the Muslim faith and is named for Saudi Arabia's late King Faisal, who financed the project. </P>
<P> Mrs. Clinton, who will also visit India, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka during her trip, said she looked forward to ''seeing new places and making new friends and also to learning about the rich dynamic history and traditions'' of the countries on her itinerary. </P>
<P> Humanitarian issues will be the primary focus of her two-day visit to Pakistan as it will be elsewhere. </P>
<P> The treatment of women is a serious human rights problem here, as is child labor and the lack of the availability of health care. </P>
<P> Mrs. Clinton will help lay the groundwork for a visit to the U.S. by Prime Minister Bhutto next month. </P>
<P> During Bhutto's talks in Washington, she is expected to seek U.S. help in fighting terrorism and the restoration of American aid programs, cut off in 1990 because of a dispute over Pakistan's nuclear weapons program. </P>
