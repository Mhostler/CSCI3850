<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  ``Sunset Boulevard,'' opened on Broadway, winning high praise Friday for its set and star but sparking a debate among critics over whether the musical deserves the popularity it is expected to win. </P>
<P> While the show was denounced as saccharine, tedious, overpublicized and overproduced, actress Glenn Close was hailed as giving a classic performance as aging film star Norma Desmond. </P>
<P> Close delivers ``one of those legendary performances people will be talking about years from now,'' wrote David Richards in The New York Times. She ``gives a smashing, daring, high-camp performance,'' wrote Linda Winer in New York Newsday. </P>
<P> The majestic set by designer John Napier is breathtaking, reviewers agreed. </P>
<P> But there the raves ended. </P>
<P> ``Andrew Lloyd Webber's music is sheer drivel,'' said Dennis Cunningham on WCBS television. </P>
<P> ``It's depressing to think of all the Broadway shows over the years which closed quickly because they just weren't good enough,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``Yet here we have this one, not nearly good enough, which might, I fear, run for years out of the sheer force of publicity and a large audience that prefers the glow of publicity to actual reality.'' </P>
<P> Webber's version of ``Sunset Boulevard,'' based on Billy Wilder's 1950 film, debuted with the largest advance sales in Broadway history -- to the tune of $37.5 million. </P>
<P> The original movie starred Gloria Swanson as Desmond, the fading movie star trying to make a comeback, and William Holden as Joe Gillis, the handsome out-of-work young screenwriter whom she keeps. </P>
<P> This $14 million version of ``Sunset'' has had its share of drama even getting to Broadway. In highly publicized moves, Webber bought out the contract of Patti LuPone, who starred in the London production, and fired Faye Dunaway from the Los Angeles version. </P>
<P> ``Now this show was a flop in L.A.,'' said WCBS-TV's Cunningham. ``What sort of world do we live in when L.A. seems more discerning about the theater than New York. </P>
<P> ``Well, I can do nothing about the $37 million advance sale -- except hope Faye Dunaway wins her lawsuit,'' he said. Dunaway is seeking $6 million in damages from Webber over her dismissal. </P>
<P> Howard Kissell of New York's Daily News wrote, ``The music is recitative, repetitive singsong ... and the musical numbers themselves bloated.'' </P>
<P> Webber reuses many of the musical effects of ``Phantom of the Opera,'' Kissel wrote. ``Almost everything seems calculated and mechanical.'' </P>
<P> Apart from Close's performance and the set, ``we are left with little to distract us from the senseless cloying of the songs and the handsome, highly professional vacuity onstage,'' Winer wrote. </P>
<P> But, Clive Barnes noted in the New York Post, ``Music, shmusic! Who goes to a musical to hear music anymore. This is the 1990s, and we've gotten over all that. </P>
<P> ``Go and enjoy,'' Barnes wrote. ``It's extravagant. It's spectacular. And it's expensive.'' </P>
