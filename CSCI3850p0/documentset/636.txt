<P>  Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother has set up a trust fund estimated at up to $29.2 million for her great-grandchildren, a British newspaper said Sunday. </P>
<P> The Observer, quoting sources close to Buckingham Palace, said the sons of Prince Charles and his estranged wife Princess Diana will share $7.5 million on their 21st birthdays. </P>
<P> ``More than half -- 2.9 million pounds ($4.5 million) -- will go to Prince Harry, because the Queen Mother fears his chances of securing personal wealth may be limited,'' the newspaper said. </P>
<P> Prince Harry, 9, is the younger of the couple's two sons. His older brother, Prince William, will inherit the throne from his father. </P>
<P> The princes will also share $12.3 million on their 40th birthdays and the remainder is in trust for the Queen Mother's other four great-granchildren. </P>
<P> ``Whatever provisions she may have made are between her family and her bank manager,'' a spokeswoman for the Queen Mother, who turned 94 this week, said. </P>
<P> Business Age magazine estimated that her personal fortune is worth $40 million. </P>
