<P>  A Frenchman swimming the Atlantic is set to complete his marathon in Barbados Thursday but is worried about rejoining the human race after almost two months at sea. </P>
<P> ``The return to humanity risks being a bit tough,'' Guy Delage, 42, said from the raft accompanying him since he set out on an apparently suicidal trip from Cape Verde islands off Africa on December 16. </P>
<P> ``I'm coming back from a virgin, uncorrupted place...where I have found serenity,'' he said in a radio interview Wednesday off the coast of Barbados in the eastern Caribbean after a 2,420- mile crossing plagued by mishaps. </P>
<P> He said his arrival would silence critics who predicted he would drown. </P>
<P> ``If I make it I'll say: 'That's it, fine. I'm not completely mad,'' he told a French television crew which filmed him, looking tanned and relaxed. </P>
<P> Delage spends about six to eight hours in the water a day and the rest on the 13 ft long raft, where he rests and sleeps while prevailing winds and currents carry him west. </P>
<P> He admits he has swum well under half the distance and normally travels slower when swimming than resting -- most days he has to put out sea anchors on the raft to stop winds from blowing it too fast when he swims. </P>
<P> As he neared his goal, Delage was not out of danger -- he had to scramble aboard his raft after a 10 ft grey shark swam up unnoticed Tuesday. </P>
<P> The boat of a French television crew that came out to film him banged into his raft, without causing any damage and he has lost a float he normally holds when swimming, which contained shark repellent and emergency supplies. </P>
<P> A flying instructor and adventurer, Delage sees his trip both as a feat of endurance and as helping scientific research -- he takes notes on everything from the performance of his flippers to observing shoals of fish that often swim with him. </P>
<P> Bernard Seret, a scientist at the Paris Museum of Natural History, spent a few minutes swimming alongside Delage off Barbados. ``His observations will help us better understand the behavior of fish under a floating object,'' Seret said. </P>
<P> The venture costs six million francs ($1.1 million) and is mostly funded by the makers of his swimming gear, food supplies, watch and other equipment. </P>
