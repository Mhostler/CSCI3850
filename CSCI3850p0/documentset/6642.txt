<P>  Sri Lankan troops and tanks, backed by artillery, have thrust into the northern Tamil guerrilla stronghold of Jaffna to expand the perimeter of Palaly air base, a military spokesman said on Thursday. </P>
<P> He said 13 soldiers, including two officers, suffered minor wounds in the operation by two infantry battalions pushed out the camp perimeter by at least three kilometres (two miles) so that approaching aircraft would be beyond the range of rebel anti-aircraft weapons. </P>
<P> He said troops met fierce resistance from Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam rebels during the first hour of fighting. </P>
<P> ``At the start of the operation there was a lot of resistance,'' he said. ``There was a lot of mortar fire but then they vacated the area. </P>
<P> ``The operation was over by afternoon,'' he added. ``We expanded our defences by three km to the east. LTTE casualties are not reported yet. The LTTE radio too has not said anything.'' </P>
<P> He said no aircraft were used in the thrust because of the threat from rebel anti-aircraft missiles used to shoot down two air force transport planes at Palaly last month. </P>
<P> The missiles, used for the first time in a 12-year war in which more than 30,000 people have died, threatened to cut off the air supplies on which camps in the north depend. </P>
<P> The spokesman said the operation against the Tigers, fighting for a separate homeland in the north and east, might continue. </P>
<P> Navy officials said patrol boats were on standby off the northern coast of the Jaffna peninsula during the operation but were not used. </P>
<P> ``Our boats brought back some of the army casualties in the operation,'' a navy officer told Reuters. </P>
