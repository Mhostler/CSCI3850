<P>  The judge supervising a lawsuit alleging keyboards made by two major computer companies caused repetitive stress injuries said Wednesday that defendant IBM could be ordered to pay punitive damages if it loses. </P>
<P> Dakota County District Court Judge Richard Spicer ruled IBM is eligible for punitive damages but Apple Computer Inc. is not after lawyers for the plaintiff, former secretary Nancy Urbanski, finished presenting their case that she suffered permanent arm and hand injuries from the companies' computer keyboards. </P>
<P> Urbanski and her husband Gary initially asked for $50,000 in compensatory damages in the potentially precedent-setting suit, but amended it to demand punitive damages. </P>
<P> Spicer said he granted the amended complaint against Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM because the plaintiff's evidence traces a longer history for that company than for the Cuppertino, Calif.-based Apple. </P>
<P> ``Information related to Apple's conduct came in 1990-91, whereas the information on IBM's conduct goes back to the 1970s and includes what IBM did in Germany, Japan and Australia with its own employees,'' Spicer told Reuters. </P>
<P> Unspecified punitive damages would be awarded only if the nine-person jury finds for the Urbanskis and against IBM and Apple. </P>
<P> The trial, which began Jan. 3, is believed to be the first involving the two computer giants and repetitive stress injuries to be argued before a jury. </P>
<P> An increasing number of the hundreds of thousands of new trauma cases each year are believed to be among white collar workers in the service sector, where the computer keyboard is widely used. </P>
