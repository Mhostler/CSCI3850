<DATELINE>BANJUL, Gambia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Gambia's 29-year-old military leader said Monday he would return the tiny West African tourist paradise to democratic rule by December 1998. </P>
<P> Lt. Yahya Jammeh, who toppled veteran president Sir Dawda Jawara in July, made the pledge to a crowd of 30,000 people in his country's national stadium in the capital Banjul. </P>
<P> ``I would like Gambians to forget their political differences and ambitions and come together to work in the interest of development of our country during the transition period, thereby ensuring a smooth and expeditious return to democratic constitutional rule by December 1998,'' he said. </P>
<P> Jammeh took power in the former British colony of about one million people in a bloodless coup on July 22. He accused the Jawara administration of corruption and pledged to return to barracks once it had been rooted out. </P>
<P> Jammeh Monday promised a new constitution, electoral reform, a restructured security service, honored international commitments, corruption probes, an open, free-market economy and a crackdown on crime, particulary drug-related crime. </P>
<P> After the coup Washington's USAID aid agency announced plans to close its office next year. </P>
