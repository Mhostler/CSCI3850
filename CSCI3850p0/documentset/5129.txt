<P>  Monday's disastrous nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway appears to be the latest in a long line of violent incidents inspired by religious cults. Here are some of the most recent: </P>
<P> OCT. 1994 - Forty-eight members of a Canadian-based cult ``the Order of the Solar Temple'' died after mystery fires in two Swiss villages. </P>
<P> Many of the dead bodies were clad in black and red cloaks and had bullet wounds to the head. </P>
<P> The cult, led by a charismatic doctor who was said to have portrayed himself as a new Christ, had stockpiled weapons to prepare for the end of the world. The cult leaders were among the dead. </P>
<P> FEB. 1994 - South Korean Tahk Myong-hwan was bludgeoned and stabbed to death just two doors from his home after appearing on a television program in which he strongly criticised the Everlasting Life Church. </P>
<P> Police believe Tahk was a victim of one of the dozens of secretive Christian sects in South Korea he had devoted his life to investigating, and had attacked as dangerous and heretical. </P>
<P> NOV. 1993 - Ukrainian police rounded up over 800 members of a doomsday cult that had twice predicted the imminent end of the world. </P>
<P> Distraught relatives scoured Kiev on the day designated for the apocalypse seeking young people they said had been enticed by the White Brotherhood. </P>
<P> The cult's two leaders, self-styled ``living god'' Marina Tsvygun, and her husband, ``prophet'' Yuri Krivonogov, were detained on charges of fraud, embezzlement and corrupting minors. </P>
<P> OCT. 1993 - Fifty-three hill tribe villagers in a remote Vietnamese hamlet committed mass suicide with flintlock guns and other primitive weapons in the shared belief they would go straight to heaven. </P>
<P> Officials said they were the victims of a scam devised by a blind local man Ca Van Liem, who received big cash donations in return for promising a speedy road to paradise. </P>
<P> MARCH 1993 - At least 70 Branch Davidian cult members died after a shoot-out with police and fire ended a 51-day siege of their compound in Waco, Texas, by federal authorities. </P>
<P> David Koresh, leader of the Waco community, died of a gunshot wound to the head sometime during the blaze. </P>
<P> A baby-faced rock guitarist from Dallas, Koresh had preached a messianic gospel of sex, freedom and revolution and told his followers he was Jesus Christ. </P>
<P> DEC. 1991 - Mexican police blamed a minister's fervent belief in God for the death of himself and 29 followers who suffocated when he told them to keep praying and ignore toxic fumes filling their church. </P>
<P> Ramon Morales Almazan shouted at his followers to remain calm as they began to choke, vomit and faint. </P>
<P> NOV. 1978 - American Rev. Jim Jones led some 900 followers to their deaths at Jonestown Guyana by drinking a cyanide-laced fruit drink. </P>
<P> Cult members who refused to swallow the liquid were shot. </P>
<P> Jones had carved a sign over his altar at Jonestown, reading ``Those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it.'' </P>
