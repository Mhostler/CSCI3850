<P>  Russian President Boris Yeltsin will propose new ways of stopping the spread of nuclear arms and germ and chemical warfare weapons when he addresses the U.N. General Assembly Monday, the Itar-Tass news agency said. </P>
<P> It quoted Yuri Baturin, presidential national security adviser, as saying there was concern in Russia that regional conflicts and ethnic and religious disputes could lead to the use of ``weapons of mass destruction.'' </P>
<P> Baturin gave no further details but said Yeltsin's initiatives would be aimed at tying a greater number of countries into a commitment on non-proliferation of such weapons. </P>
<P> The 63-year-old Kremlin chief will address the assembly before flying to Washington for a two-day summit with President Clinton Sept. 27 and 28. </P>
<P> Yeltsin flies to New York Sunday after talks in Britain with Prime Minister John Major to prepare the way for a visit to Russia next month by Queen Elizabeth II. </P>
<P> He is scheduled to meet Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and business leaders in the United States before making his speech to the General Assembly. </P>
