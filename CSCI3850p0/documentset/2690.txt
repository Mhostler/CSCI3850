<DATELINE>PRETORIA, South Africa (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  U.S. authorities have arrested an Oregon man and his wife in connection with an illegal shipment of firearms discovered in South Africa last month, South African police said Friday. </P>
<P> Capt. Evan Johnson said Robert Evans Mahler and his wife Nancy were taken into custody in Salem, Ore., Thursday for contravening U.S. arms, ammunition, export and import regulations. </P>
<P> South African police found more than 220 firearms and 20,000 rounds of ammunition of varying calibers in a shipping container on a property south of Pretoria on Oct. 30. </P>
<P> ``At this stage it does not appear as if there was any political motive behind the import of the guns. We believe it was more for self-enrichment,'' Johnson said when asked if the arms were destined for use by white right-wingers. </P>
<P> He said Mahler, a former gunshop owner, arrived in South Africa in March 1992 after fleeing the United States to avoid prosecution for violating arms regulations. </P>
<P> ``Mahler followed his wife back to the United States on February 27, 1994,'' Johnson said. </P>
