<P>  One of the main prosecutors in the O.J. Simpson double murder trial bowed out of the much-televised courtroom scene Thursday and said he would be taking a backroom role. </P>
<P> Deputy District Attorney Bill Hodgman said he was fully recovered from the chest pains that caused him to be rushed to hospital more than two weeks ago while attending a top-level evening meeting of prosecutors in the case. </P>
<P> Hodgman was hospitalized for about a week and rested at home for 10 days before returning to work. </P>
<P> He said hospital tests had revealed, ``I have a health concern. I'm not going into it because it's personal. </P>
<P> ``I'm fine but I'm going to have to make a few adjustments. I've learned about something that two weeks ago I didn't realize I had,'' Hodgman told reporters. </P>
<P> He said that before his sudden illness he had asked District Attorney Gil Garcetti to be relieved of his courtroom duties because he saw a need for case management in the so-called ''trial of the century.'' </P>
<P> Simpson, a football legend who became an actor, sportscaster and TV pitchman, has pleaded not guilty to murdering his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman on the night of June 12, 1993. </P>
<P> Before taking on the case, Hodgman had been director of Central Operations in Garcetti's office, one of the top jobs in the department. He said he would resume his old position but would concentrate entirely on the Simpson case. </P>
<P> ``I'm fine, I'm in a position to take over that particular role. Bill Hodgman's back, I'm basically doing fine, I'm going to have a new role that I'm looking forward to,'' he said. </P>
<P> Hodgman's reputation has always been that of a backroom wizard who can take the threads of a complicated case and weave them into a compelling tapestry that the jury is able to understand. </P>
<P> He was instrumental in the successful prosecution of Charles Keating, the savings and loan king convicted in 1992 of fraud in connection with the collapse of the Lincoln Savings and Loan thrift corporation. </P>
