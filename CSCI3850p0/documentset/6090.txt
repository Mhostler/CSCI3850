<DATELINE>OKLAHOMA CITY (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Prosecutors Thursday were to tell some of the reasons federal investigators believe Timothy McVeigh should be held as a suspect in the deadliest civilian bombing in U.S. history. </P>
<P> So far little of the evidence against McVeigh has been revealed, but the government must disclose enough Thursday to convince U.S. Magistrate Roland Howland that the 27-year-old Gulf War veteran should be held without bail.  He is the only suspect thus far directly linked with a huge truck bomb that virtually demolished an Oklahoma City federal building last week, killing at least 98 people. </P>
<P> The revelations were expected to come during a hearing at the El Reno maximum security prison where McVeigh, reviled as a ``baby killer,'' has been held since he was linked to the bombing after his arrest on a traffic violation in a small town north of Oklahoma City. </P>
<P> Jailers there said the tall, thin McVeigh was quiet and polite, but watched everything with ``eyes of steel.'' </P>
<P> Investigators are said to have tried every trick -- even showing him heartbreaking pictures of dead and dying children caught in the blast -- but have been unable to crack McVeigh's stony silence. </P>
<P> The Federal Bureau of Investigation wants McVeigh to help them find another man they say helped set off the two-ton truck bomb. </P>
<P> But there was little incentive they could offer McVeigh since officials from President Clinton on down have said they will seek the death penalty for anyone convicted of ``this evil act''. </P>
<P> So far 98 bodies, including those of 15 children, have been dug out of the rubble of the April 19 blast that wounded more than 400 people and damaged 225 buildings. Some 100 people were still missing, including four children. </P>
<P> The intensive combing of McVeigh's background has portrayed him as an angry young man who criminal psychologists say is exhibiting classic signs of someone who feels extremely important, hurt because others don't feel that way, and is proud of what he has done. </P>
<P> ``One of the elements of his anger toward the United States is the failure to be recognized,'' Dr. N.G. Berrill, a professor of forensic psychology at the John Jay School of Criminal Justice, told the Dallas Morning News. </P>
<P> ``It's a narcissistic injury, a feeling that 'they don't know how truly exceptional I am,''' Berrill said. </P>
<P> In letters and in reported conversations with friends, McVeigh blamed politicians for America's ills. </P>
<P> Prosecutors in Wichita, Kan., said that McVeigh told his friend Terry Nichols three days before the blast that ''something big will happen.'' </P>
<P> The disclosure came in a hearing for Nichols, who has been charged of conspiring with his brother James and McVeigh to build bombs on their Michigan farm. The three men have been linked to right-wing paramilitary militia groups in Michigan. </P>
<P> Two letters that McVeigh sent to a Buffalo, N.Y., newspaper in 1992 could provide investigators a crucial look into his mind. </P>
<P> A second suspect in the crime remained a mystery. </P>
<P> A week after the bombing, investigators had only a pencil sketch of a bushy-eyebrowed man wearing a baseball cap who is being called ``John Doe 2.'' </P>
<P> Several people have been detained across the United States and questioned simply because they bear some resemblance to the face in the drawing, but all have been released. </P>
<P> The FBI said it has pursued some 6,000 leads to the second suspect's identity. One theory investigators have considered is that the accomplice died in the blast. </P>
<P> FBI Director Louis Freeh, who visited Oklahoma City Wednesday, pledged in a statement to find those responsible. </P>
<P> ``There is no place on earth where you will be safe from the most powerful forces of justice,'' he said. </P>
