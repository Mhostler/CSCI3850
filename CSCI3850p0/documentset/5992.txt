<DATELINE>PARIS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  This was the election Jacques Chirac could not lose. </P>
<P> After two failed presidential bids and a lonely period in the political wilderness, the conservative Paris mayor was at last the hot favorite in Sunday's first round of voting for the presidency. </P>
<P> All opinion polls from early March right up to polling day gave Chirac, 62, a wide lead over Socialist candidate Lionel Jospin, with fellow-Gaullist, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, trailing third. </P>
<P> Yet Chirac nearly threw away his chance with an ill-judged attack on the governor of France's independent central bank that revived old questions about his judgement and consistency. </P>
<P> ``Chirac ric-rac'' (Chirac by the skin of his teeth) was the headline of the left-of-center daily Liberation. </P>
<P> Taking second place with a mere 20.8 percent of the vote, the Gaullist leader added less than one percentage point to his first round score in the 1988 election against President Francois Mitterrand, despite a five-month campaign in which he travelled 15,000 miles and shook countless hands. </P>
<P> The energetic Chirac's ability to win the decisive second round against Jospin in two weeks' time may depend crucially on his ability to keep his foot out of his mouth. </P>
<P> ``The French people do not like my husband,'' his wife Bernadette commented after the 1988 defeat. </P>
<P> This time, it appeared the French people were reconciled, or perhaps resigned, to the idea that Chirac's time had come. </P>
<P> His catchy slogan ``France for all'' and his apple-tree logo had won wide popularity. </P>
<P> A calmer, less impulsive, more socially conscious Chirac had attracted more than a third of young voters, a quarter of the working class as well as his traditional rural, middle class and small business clienteles to make him the people's candidate. </P>
<P> But he blew it 10 days before the election by assailing Bank of France Governor Jean-Claude Trichet for advocating wage restraint, then back-stepping and waving a letter from Trichet on television praising his support for the franc even as the French currency slumped because of his comments. </P>
<P> Opinion surveys showed the dispute, skilfully exploited by Balladur and his followers, frightened small savers and some businessmen, who switched to the less volatile prime minister. </P>
<P> At the same time, Chirac's left-of-center call for a more energetic assault on unemployment and poverty, and his pro-European message, drove some rightist voters into the arms of extreme-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen. </P>
<P> After a series of brilliantly choreographed speeches, including an impressive youth rally in Paris, the frontrunner appeared to mark time, trying to say as little as possible and avoid blunders. </P>
<P> Voters began to see his ideas as hollow one-line slogans rather than policies. </P>
<P> Among the sound-bites were ``Politics is the art of making the necessary possible,'' ``Too much tax kills taxation,'' and ``The pay packet is not the enemy of employment.'' </P>
<P> Placed on the fast track to high office by President Charles de Gaulle and his prime minister, Georges Pompidou, in the 1960s, Chirac has long been a man in a hurry, blundering into action sometimes before measuring the consequences. </P>
<P> In 1974, he led a revolt against official Gaullist Jacques Chaban-Delmas in favor of center-right candidate Valery Giscard d'Estaing who rewarded him with the premiership when he won. </P>
<P> Then in 1976, Chirac rebelled against the man he had helped to the presidency. He resigned after accusing Giscard d'Estaing of refusing to let him govern and defying the president to win election as Paris mayor the following year. </P>
<P> Chirac denounced Giscard d'Estaing's followers as ``the foreign party'' and stood against him in the 1981 election. His half-hearted endorsement contributed to Giscard's defeat. </P>
