<P>  The Chinese government has ordered a nationwide drive against theft of copyrights and other intellectual property, with a focus on rampant piracy of music, movies and computer software. </P>
<P> State Councillor Song Jian said the crackdown was needed as part of China's high-stakes bid to re-enter to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, state media said Saturday. </P>
<P> Widespread theft of intellectual property in China is a key trade complaint of the United States and other developed countries, whose companies claim to lose billions of dollars to Chinese violators. </P>
<P> Piracy is one of the reasons Washington continues to block Beijing's return to GATT, which China left after the communist takeover in 1949. </P>
<P> China maintains it has done more to protect intellectual property in recent years than many countries have done in a century, but Song indicated Beijing was ready to do more. </P>
<P> Song attacked government agencies that he said paid little attention to intellectual-property violations or allowed theft of copyrights, patents and trademarks to go unpunished. </P>
<P> ``The sense of protecting copyrights is far from strong in public circles and serious infringements of copyrights have repeatedly occurred,'' Song told officials in a nationwide telephone conference. </P>
<P> He said China needed to set up courts specializing in intellectual-property protection. Only a few now exist. </P>
<P> ``Without a legal system protecting intellectual-property rights, there would exist no fair, open and just market order,'' Song said. </P>
<P> ``However, if we only formulate laws and regulations but do not enforce them, the aim will be vacant,'' Song said. </P>
<P> Officials should also crack down on fraudulent patents and trademarks, he said. </P>
<P> He said China would vigorously hunt businesses that illegally copy and sell musical recordings, films and computer software, the cause of the angriest U.S. complaints. </P>
<P> Song called on customs officials to work harder to curb the export of counterfeit or pirated goods. </P>
<P> U.S. officials have urged China, so far in vain, to close 26 plants that make compact discs, saying all were suspected of exporting bootleg compact discs to Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. </P>
<P> Song said the State Council, China's cabinet, should do more to educate government officials and the public about the value of intellectual property and the seriousness of piracy. </P>
<P> Song said the cabinet soon would ``map out a plan to intensify the management of copyright work'' now that it had resolved to hold regular meetings on the problem. </P>
<P> The cabinent also will compile guidelines for training experts and a guidebook on China's copyright laws to clarify to Chinese and foreigners how its safeguards work. </P>
