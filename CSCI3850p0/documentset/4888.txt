<DATELINE>LAGOS, Nigeria (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, the only Nigerian military ruler to have voluntarily handed over power to elected civilians, was arrested Monday, his aide said. </P>
<P> ``Gen. Obasanjo was picked up this morning by security men,'' his personal assistant Ayo Aderewale told Reuters. </P>
<P> Obasanjo's arrest followed a coup plot the military government of Gen. Sani Abacha said was hatched by civilians and officers. </P>
<P> Asked if the arrest of his boss was in connection with the uncovered plot, Aderewale said: ``They say the arrest is political and they have taken him to Alagbon (police center).'' </P>
<P> He said Obasanjo's passport was seized Sunday night by security men when he arrived home from a foreign trip that took him to Britain and Denmark. They arrested him Monday. </P>
<P> Friday, chief of defense staff Maj.-Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar told a news conference that 29 people had been arrested in connection with a plot to topple Abacha's government March 1. </P>
<P> Abubakar said more arrests would be made as warranted. </P>
<P> Last Thursday, retired Gen. Shehu Musa Yar'Adua, Obasanjo's number two in the military government that ruled Nigeria from 1976 until it restored democracy in 1979, was arrested in Abuja. </P>
<P> Yar'Adua is a member of a government-organized constitutional conference, where he championed a motion that Abacha should hand over to elected civilians by Jan. 1, 1996. </P>
<P> Military officials said Yar'Adua's arrest was in connection with the foiled coup. </P>
<P> Yar'Adua and Obasanjo have been formidable supporters of a quick return to civil rule in Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, which has been governed by soldiers for 25 out of its 35 years of independence. </P>
<P> The recent coup plot brings to nine the number of successful and failed military attempts to take power. </P>
<P> Sunday, Nigerian Roman Catholic bishops ended their annual conference in Lagos and declared that the country would have been better off without military involvement in politics. </P>
<P> ``With the benefit of hindsight it can now be said that Nigeria would have been better off if the military had never intervened in her political life,'' they said in a communique. </P>
<P> According to local press reports, several other leading Nigerians including politicians were being held over the recent coup plot. </P>
<P> One magazine said it expected all those involved to be shot, as has been the practice in Nigeria after failed coups. </P>
<P> During the government of Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, who plunged Nigeria into crisis when he annulled a presidential election in 1993, more than 50 people were executed for trying to overthrow the government in two separate failed coups. </P>
<P> The 1993 election was believed to have been won by businessman Moshood Abiola, one of Africa's richest men. </P>
<P> Abacha seized power several months later, in November 1993, in the chaos that erupted after the annulment. </P>
<P> But the problem did not die and in June 1994, Abiola proclaimed himself president. He was arrested and has since been detained pending trial for treason. </P>
<P> Strikes and riots which erupted last summer died down after a tough clampdown on the opposition. </P>
