<P>  A cougar or mountain lion is on the loose in Philadelphia and the suburb of Yeadon, and police warned residents Thursday to beware. </P>
<P> ``The lion is still on the loose,'' said Robert Usey, an emergency dispatch supervisor in Delaware County. Police searched Cobbs Creek Park on the border with the Philadelphia but found no sign of the animal. </P>
<P> Usey said it was last sighted in nearby Mount Moriah Cemetery. </P>
<P> Yeadon Police Chief Robert Molyneaux said the animal had the tawny coat of a cougar and a chain around its neck. ``It looks like it was somebody's pet that got away,'' he said. </P>
<P> Aside from a startled Yeadon woman who found herself face to muzzle with the big cat Wednesday, no contact has been closer than a quick sighting or the sound of a growl, police said. </P>
