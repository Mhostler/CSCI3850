<P>  A British U.N. convoy came under fire Wednesday as it traveled down a road outside Sarajevo, wounding two people, a U.N. source said. </P>
<P> Two U.N. vehicles were in flames and the U.N. source said it was more than likely the attack came from Bosnian Serb forces who have stepped up pressure on the United Nations after rejecting the latest peace plan. </P>
<P> The U.N. convoy was hit as it traveled down a road on Mount Igman, overlooking the Bosnian capital. The road, on Bosnian government-controlled territory, is within range of Serb guns. </P>
<P> The military resupply convoy was carrying fuel for U.N. peacekeeping troops, U.N. spokeswoman Claire Grimes said. The two injured U.N. personnel were taken to a local hospital for treatment, U.N. sources said. </P>
<P> The incident coincided with deteriorating relations between the United Nations and the Serbs and measures to reassert the Bosnian Serbs stranglehold over Sarajevo. </P>
<P> The Bosnian Serbs, testing the world's resolve after effectively rejecting the peace plan drawn up by major powers, earlier in the day cut off a key route that carries commercial traffic in and out of Sarajevo. </P>
