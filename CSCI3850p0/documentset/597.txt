<DATELINE>GOMA, Zaire (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The catastrophe for more than a million Rwandan refugees in eastern Zaire is far from over as a dysentery epidemic is rising despite cholera passing its peak around the border town of Goma, aid officials said Thursday. </P>
<P> They warned a huge international effort would have to help camps for one million in the Goma area for months and much more was needed to head off a new disaster brewing in southwestern Rwanda. </P>
<P> Ray Wilkinson, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), said a UNHCR health coordination committee reported cholera cases and the death rate from the disease were now falling. </P>
<P> ``We appear to have reached the top of the (cholera) curve and it is now on a downward slope ... Dysentery however is continuing to rise,'' he told reporters, adding some 24,000 refugees had died since flooding into Zaire three weeks ago. </P>
<P> ``In the camps two cases of dysentery are being reported for every case of cholera,'' he said. Epidemiologists expect the dysentery epidemic to kill another 20,000 refugees in the next month or two. </P>
<P> Wilkinson said the estimated death rate, before dysentery reached full force, was continuing to fall with 500 people now dying each day in the Goma camps compared with 2,000 last week. </P>
<P> U.S. water purification plants had treated 660,000 gallons Thursday and 44 tankers were now delivering round the clock to the worst camp, Kibumba, he added. </P>
<P> Clean water is the key factor in fighting cholera and dysentery. The bare minimum to provide for all the refugees is one million gallons and the U.N. says they should get 6.6 million gallons in the best conditions. </P>
<P> A total of 90,000 refugees are estimated to have returned into Rwanda from Zaire but large numbers are expected to remain for months as exiled officials of the ousted former Rwandan government and army are intimidating them against going home. </P>
<P> The former officials of Rwanda's Hutu majority want the refugees to stay in the misery of the Zaire camps to leave the new government, approved by the victorious Tutsi-dominated Rwanda Patriotic Front, with a virtually deserted country. </P>
<P> The new government says it will prosecute them for leading a three-month campaign of massacres of more than 500,000 people, mostly Tutsis and opponents of the former government. </P>
<P> ``It is too soon to consider we are over the catastrophe,'' said Dr Philippe Biberson, president of the French section of Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF-Doctors Without Borders). </P>
<P> ``The situation will continue to deteriorate, although it will be less visible,'' he said, adding refugees had used up what reserves they brought with them and were more vulnerable to malnutrition and disease. </P>
<P> ``Now the cholera epidemic is over we will come to the next phase. It is too soon to give the impression things are getting better,'' he said. ``It will be very difficult in the days and weeks ahead.'' </P>
<P> In particular, food was a problem with refugees receiving much less than the minimum 2,000 calories each per day. </P>
<P> ``It is already visible the nutritional situation is deteriorating,'' said Biberson. appealing for governments and donors to concentrate their efforts on getting food immediately to refugees in the area around the Zairean town of Bukavu. </P>
<P> No food is reaching them regularly because the World Food Program, the U.N. food arm, is having severe problems finding enough for the refugees and reaching the area by truck convoys. </P>
