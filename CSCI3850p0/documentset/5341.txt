<P>  British astronomer Patrick Moore Thursday ruled out the possibility of ``bug-eyed monsters'' in outer space but said there must be life as we know it beyond the limits of the Solar System. </P>
<P> Moore, whose long-running television series ``The Sky at Night'' popularized astronomy for Britain's general public, gave the the opening lecture ``Alien Life Forms'' at the opening of the seventh Edinburgh International Science Festival. </P>
<P> ``Are we alone?'' he asked the audience in Edinburgh's Royal Scottish Museum. ``In the Solar System -- Yes. In the rest of the Universe - No.'' </P>
<P> The huge numbers of galaxies with stars like the sun meant the probability of life elsewhere was high, the astronomer said. </P>
<P> But the vastly different environments on other planets in the solar system ruled out the possibility of human life. </P>
<P> ``Life as we know it must have the same type of environment as we have. That rules out bug-eyed monsters entirely,'' he said. </P>
<P> Moore predicted that people would permanently occupy space stations on Mars within a few decades but that this would create at least one big problem -- the development of two different types of human being. </P>
<P> Gravity on Mars was only a third of that on Earth. This meant children born on these stations would not be able to withstand the extra gravity and a new type of human would evolve, he said. </P>
