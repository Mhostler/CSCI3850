<DATELINE>TOKYO, April 12 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Former South Korean opposition leader Kim Dae-jung said on Wednesday North Korea should accept a South Korean model reactor as part of a deal to resolve a nuclear row with its neighbours. </P>
<P> Kim arrived in Japan on Monday for the first official visit in 22 years since his abduction from a Tokyo hotel by suspected Seoul agents. </P>
<P> He blamed ``top South Korean authorities'' at the time for his abduction and said the case still remained open. </P>
<P> ``The United States has a right to pick the model of the plant under the terms of the Geneva agreement,'' said Kim, a top dissident who fought three presidential elections before retiring in 1992. </P>
<P> He ruled out chances that he would make a comeback to take part in the 1998 presidential elections. </P>
<P> ``I have not changed my stance on this since my retirement in 1992 and the circumstances around me have not changed either,'' Kim told a news conference. </P>
<P> The October 1994 agreement between reclusive North Korea and the United States temporarily resolved a heated row over the North's suspected nuclear ambitions. Pyongyang agreed to halt its reactors in exchange for a light-water reactor. </P>
<P> The United States had accused North Korea of secretly trying to build a nuclear arsenal using plutonium obtained from its graphite-based reactors. Light-water reactors do not produce plutonium. </P>
<P> But North Korea has rejected a South Korean model on technical and political grounds. North Korea and the United States have until April 21 to reach further agreement on details of the original Geneva pact. </P>
<P> ``South Korea must be careful not to hurt the political sensitivities of the North,'' Kim said. ``After that, I wish there would be North-South cooperation in this field.'' </P>
<P> He said Japan should also be careful not to isolate South Korea in Tokyo's efforts to normalise ties with Pyongyang. </P>
<P> ``The improvement of Japan's ties with North Korea must be accompanied by an improvement of North-South ties,'' he said. </P>
<P> Last month, Tokyo and Pyongyang agreed to resume normalisation talks after an abortive 1991-1992 attempt. </P>
<P> On his 1973 abduction, Kim said Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama assured him in a meeting earlier in the day that Japanese police have not closed the case and said South Korean President Kim Young-sam, once his close ally, had three more years left in his term to get to the bottom of the case. </P>
<P> The case soured Tokyo-Seoul ties for years and was never clearly resolved. Five days after his abduction, Kim was found on streets near his Seoul home and placed under house arrest. </P>
<P> ``I am sure that top South Korean authorities were the perpetrators,'' Kim said. </P>
<P> Japanese police identified a former South Korean embassy official as one of the kidnappers. </P>
<P> Kim said the late President Park Chun-hee himself acknowledged that the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA), carried out the kidnapping, although without the president's knowledge. </P>
