<P>  Republican Sen. William Roth announced Tuesday that a Senate committee will hold hearings June 29 on what he called ``outrageous and unacceptable'' Army behavior after a killing by friendly fire during the Gulf War. </P>
<P> Sgt. Douglas Fielder was killed by other American troops four years ago but his parents were told he was killed by Iraqi troops, Roth said. He relied on an investigation by the General Accounting Office released in April. </P>
<P> Some of those involved in the incident even received medals, the Delaware senator said. </P>
<P> ``The events that took place following the death of Sgt. Fielder were outrageous and unacceptable,'' said Roth. ``Above all else, this country owes the family of Sgt. Fielder, and all families who suffer the loss of a son or daughter in military service, the absolute truth.'' </P>
<P> The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Governmental Affairs Committee will conduct the hearings, which will be chaired by Roth and Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn. </P>
