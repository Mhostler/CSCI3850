<P> (Eds: adds comment from Sen. Edward Kennedy in paras 7-8)  President Clinton's national security adviser has invited Gerry Adams, leader of the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, to meet him next week at the White House, it was announced Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``National Security Adviser Anthony Lake has invited Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams to meet with him in the White House the week of December 5,'' a White House statement said. </P>
<P> Administration officials told Reuters the meeting would be next Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``Mr. Lake looks forward to hearing Mr. Adams' views on the current situation in Northern Ireland and to discussing ways in which the peace process can be further advanced and economic prosperity can be promoted,'' the statement said. </P>
<P> Adams was granted the visa on the condition he do no fund raising in the United States. The fund raising ban was almost certainly imposed as a condition of the visa because of British sensitivities. </P>
<P> Officials said Adams had indicated he would accept the visa on that condition. </P>
<P> Massachusetts Democrat Sen. Edward Kennedy criticized the administration's ban on fund raising, noting Adams had been allowed to raise funds when he visited London recently. </P>
<P> ``It is unfortunate that he does not have the same opportunity in this country,'' he said in a statement. ``Any funds raised in this country could be fenced in reasonable ways to guarantee they are spent solely for legitimate political activity.'' </P>
<P> Adams and Lake were expected to discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland, a process the Clinton administration has taken great pride in helping to nudge along. </P>
<P> Northern Ireland has enjoyed a fragile peace since the IRA cease-fire, which was followed six weeks later by a truce from their Protestant Loyalist foes fighting to preserve the province's British links. </P>
<P> Adams last visited the United States for two weeks in October, but he was not invited to the White House at that time despite pressure on the administration by prominent Irish-Americans for such a visit. </P>
<P> While Adams was in Washington the Clinton administration lifted the ban that had existed on contacts between the U.S. government and Sinn Fein while the IRA was waging armed attacks to end British rule in Northern Ireland. </P>
<P> Adams' visit to Washington was scheduled just as the British government decided to exclude Sinn Fein from an international investment conference planned for Belfast next month. </P>
<P> Britain's Northern Ireland Office said Tuesday Sinn Fein was being excluded from the Dec. 13-14 conference, which Prime Minister John Major and U.S. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown will address in Belfast. </P>
