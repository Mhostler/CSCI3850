<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Californians got a break Sunday from the storms which caused severe flooding across the state, allowing swollen rivers to recede and flood victims to get on with cleaning their mud-caked homes. </P>
<P> The sun broke through the clouds for the first time in days over northern California's wine country, where homeowners are picking up the pieces after floods that submerged the small town of Guerneville, 50 miles north of San Francisco. </P>
<P> Showers were forecast for the area Sunday, but they were not expected to drop more than a half-inch of rain. </P>
<P> It was also generally dry Sunday in southern California, hit by destructive storms and mudslides last week. </P>
<P> Last week's powerful storms took 11 lives, inflicted $300 million of damage and caused floods which forced thousands of people to evacuate their homes. </P>
<P> President Clinton, who has declared a major disaster in the state, is to visit California Monday and Tuesday and he will review flood relief efforts. </P>
<P> His visit was previously scheduled to coincide with Tuesday's first anniversary of the last big natural disaster to hit the state -- the Los Angeles earthquake, which killed 61 people and caused $20 billion of damage. </P>
<P> Clinton has approved federal disaster relief and pledged to do everything possible to help flood victims. </P>
<P> In Malibu in southern California, residents worked into the night shoring up sandbags around their homes in case saturated hillsides collapsed. But there were no reports of further damage. </P>
<P> Searchers Sunday found a light aircraft which went down in rain and fog in mountains northeast of Los Angeles Saturday, officials said. The Cessna 182 crashed while taking part in a Civil Air Patrol search for another missing aircraft. </P>
<P> All three crew members were found dead, a Civil Air Patrol spokesman said. They were named as Capt. Robert Leman, 48, Lt. Brian Perkin, 39, and Lt. James Spadafore, 62, all of San Jose, California. </P>
<P> James Bailey, assistant director of the State-Federal Flood Center in Sacramento, said rivers across northern California were receding. </P>
<P> The Russian River, which burst its banks for a second time Saturday causing minor flooding in low-lying areas around Guerneville, remained slightly above flood level, but Bailey said it was expected to fall below flood level later Sunday. </P>
<P> Bailey said he believed the worst of the flooding was over, although he said there was still a threat to levees in some areas of the Sacramento River in central California. </P>
<P> But volunteers in the Emergency Operations Center in flood-ravaged Sonoma County, where Guerneville is located, were not yet ready to say the disaster was over, even though Monday is forecast to see the start of a few dry days. </P>
<P> ``I don't think anyone is predicting the future. We're going day by day,'' one volunteer said. </P>
<P> Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) teams were setting up offices in Sonoma County Sunday to help flood victims register for federal disaster assistance. </P>
<P> California Sen. Barbara Boxer, a Democrat, criticized FEMA Saturday for not having already set up aid centers. </P>
<P> Thousands of Californians have applied for federal aid using a toll-free telephone number, but critics say this method is impersonal and callers are made to wait. </P>
<P> Guerneville residents cleaning up after the floods were helped by about 70 supervised county jail inmates, who volunteered for the job. </P>
<P> Residents of Chowchilla, 130 miles southeast of San Francisco, were also cleaning up Sunday after several tornadoes touched down in the town Saturday, tearing off roofs, uprooting trees and downing power lines. No one was injured. </P>
<P> In San Francisco, the weather stayed dry for Sunday's NFC Championship Game between the San Francisco 49ers and the Dallas Cowboys. Staff at Candlestick Park had worked hard all week to dry out the field after torrential rain, using special turf vacuums to suck up the water. </P>
