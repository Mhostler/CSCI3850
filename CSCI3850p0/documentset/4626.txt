<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A top air traffic official said Tuesday his control center was not aware of any icing problem the night an American Eagle plane crashed in Indiana last October, killing 68 people. </P>
<P> But the official said it would have been unacceptable to keep the Eagle flight in a holding pattern as long as it was if it had been known that the plane was having problems with icing. </P>
<P> Richard Riegler, who was acting as national operations manager at the Federal Aviation Administration control center in Virginia the night of the crash, said it appeared the Chicago-bound Eagle flight was held on the ground in Indianapolis before departure long enough that a lengthy holding period in the air should have been avoided. </P>
<P> ``It looked like it was a sufficient delay,'' based on a review of the records, he told a National Transportation Safety Board hearing into the accident. </P>
<P> But deteriorating conditions along a rain-swept Halloween night storm front apparently caused a longer in-air hold than anticipated when the flight was allowed to depart. </P>
<P> ``We weren't aware of any icing that night ... in any area around Chicago,'' Riegler said. </P>
<P> Asked if it would have been acceptable to ``hold an aircraft in known icing conditions'' for 34 minutes he said, ``No.'' The Eagle flight was in a holding pattern for a little more than a half hour. </P>
<P> Another witness, Matthew Dunne, a traffic management coordinator at a Chicago control center, said the fact that the Eagle flight was placed in a holding pattern for so long was simply a matter of ``first come, first served'' at O'Hare International Airpport, the world's busiest. </P>
<P> He also said he was not aware of any icing problems. </P>
<P> Icing has been suspected as the cause of the Oct. 31 crash of the French-built ATR-72 which plunged 9,000 feet without warning into a farm field in northwest Indiana, about 40 miles short of its destination. There were no survivors. </P>
<P> The center at which Riegler works in Chantilly, Va., decides, among other things, the flow of air traffic into airports, depending on volume and weather, and what sorts of ground delays are necessary before flights take off. </P>
<P> He said that on the night of the crash he received normal support from forecasters and there was no mention of icing. He said he did not receive reports from other pilots in the area of possible icing. </P>
<P> Weather experts who testified on Monday said an unusual and little-studied icing phenomenon -- supercooled drizzle drops -- might have suddenly coated the wings of the plane, causing a loss of control. </P>
<P> They described the drizzle as droplets high in the atmosphere with temperatures below freezing which collect around microscopic dust particles and cling suddenly and heavily to any surface with which they come into contact. </P>
<P> The Air Line Pilots Association issued a statement Tuesday saying it had concluded the crash was caused by a ``catastrophic loss of controllability.'' </P>
<P> ``That happened because a design characteristic of the aircraft made it very vulnerable to a certain type of ice accumulation on the upper part of its wings, behind the de- icing boot and forward of the ailerons,'' the statement said. </P>
<P> The ``boot'' on the twin-engine turboprop is an inflatable area on the front of the wing which expands and contracts, breaking any ice accumulation on that part of the wing. </P>
<P> The government has advised airlines to give pilots speical instruction in flying the plane in icing conditions. </P>
