<P>  The rise and fall of the Gucci fashion dynasty, synonymous with riches and luxury, is a modern-day Medici tale complete with family squabbles, intrigue and now the assassination of the founder's grandson. </P>
<P> Maurizio Gucci, gunned down outside his Milan office on Monday, had been the last Gucci to run the business, whose stylish leather loafers and fancy handbags adorned with the intertwined ``GG'' logo were status symbols around the world. </P>
<P> From the beginning feuds marked the company's growth from a Florentine saddle shop to a multi-million-dollar fashion empire. </P>
<P> The Gucci family's internal feuds earned it comparisons with the medieval Medici dynasty which lived in the same city in the 14th and 15th centuries. </P>
<P> ``Grandfather would play his sons off against each other whenever he could to show they had blood in their veins,'' Maurizio's cousin and chief rival, Paolo Gucci, once said. </P>
<P> The grandfather, Guccio Gucci, founded the company in Florence in 1906 after working as a waiter at the London Savoy Hotel. There he studied the tastes of the rich and famous and returned to Italy to make leather goods of fine craftsmanship that he sold to the local aristocracy. </P>
<P> The company expanded to Rome and Milan and then went international after World War Two, opening shops in the fashion centers of Paris, New York and London. </P>
<P> Upon Guccio's death in 1953 the running of the business went to one of his three sons, Aldo, who was chairman until 1984. Another son, Rodolfo, entered the family business in the 1970s after he gave up attempts to be an actor in Hollywood. </P>
<P> The Gucci name became synonymous with style in the 1950s and 1960s when such film stars as Grace Kelly, the late Princesss Grace of Monaco, and Elizabeth Taylor discovered the simple elegance of Gucci shoes, handbags and luggage. </P>
<P> As the company continued to grow in size and stature in the 1970s tensions heightened between Rodolfo, who held 50 percent of the stake, and his brother Aldo and his three sons, who held the other half. </P>
<P> When the company took off in the consumer-mad 1980s, franchising its trademark on thousand of products, so too did the feud between the two branches of the Gucci family. </P>
<P> Lawsuits seeking control of various parts of the dynasty were filed back and forth, escalating when Maurizio Gucci inherited his father Rodolfo's half share in the company on the latter's death in 1983. </P>
<P> One battle was between Paolo Gucci and the rest of the family when he tried to form his own company using the Gucci name. </P>
<P> Then Maurizio Gucci was accused by his relatives of forging his father's signature to evade inheritance tax. This led to a criminal prosecution in which Maurizio was convicted of attempted fraud but the conviction was later overturned. </P>
<P> Faced with the mounting losses and huge debts that accompanied expansion, Aldo and his sons sold off their half of the family business in 1987 to the Arab investment bank Investcorp, whose other holdings included the famous jewellers Tiffany of New York and Chaumet of Paris. </P>
<P> The deal was reported to have cost Investcorp $160 million. </P>
<P> Maurizio Guccio held on to his stake for another six years, bringing in top fashion names to try to streamline the business -- the whole time at odds with his Arab partners. </P>
<P> ``I feel like Rocky Marciano,'' he was quoted as saying in 1993. ``Each time he fought with his face covered with blood. But he always won.'' </P>
<P> But just a month later, he too sold out to Investcorp, giving up the family's last seat on the board. </P>
