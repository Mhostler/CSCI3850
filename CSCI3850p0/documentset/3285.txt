<P>  The United Nations expected to resume military flights Saturday at Sarajevo airport after Bosnian Serbs offered security guarantees, a peacekeeping spokesman said. </P>
<P> ``All indications are that the airport will be open today,'' Alexander Ivanko, civilian spokesman for the U.N. Protection Force, said. ``We have four flights planned for today,'' he added. </P>
<P> The U.N. flights would be primarily used for rotation of peacekeeping troops, he said. </P>
<P> The Bosnian Serbs have forced the closure of the U.N.- operated airport for more than three weeks as part of a campaign of retaliation against the peacekeeping mission for NATO air strikes on Serb targets last month. </P>
<P> The humanitarian airlift, which provides vital food and relief supplies to the city, has yet to resume, and donor countries are waiting to see if the Serb security guarantees hold, U.N. officials said earlier. </P>
<P> Ivanko also said the Bosnian Serbs had eased restrictions on the movement of U.N. military observers on Serb-held territory and had given clearance Friday for several fuel convoys for U.N. peacekeeping troops. But he said it was too early to conclude whether the Bosnian Serb authorities had granted full cooperation to the U.N. Protection Force. </P>
