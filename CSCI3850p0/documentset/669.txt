<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Secretary of State Warren Christopher left the Middle East Tuesday, saying he had accomplished his purpose on a four-day mission to promote Israeli-Syrian peace. </P>
<P> ``He is going back to the United States,'' Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said hours before Christopher flew home. </P>
<P> ``There are things which must be digested. It takes time to digest ideas, to check them, to compare them,'' Peres said. </P>
<P> Christopher held a five-hour meeting in Damascus with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad Sunday. He met Israeli leaders both before and after meeting Assad and took part in a ceremony opening the first Israeli-Jordanian border crossing. </P>
<P> The mediation efforts, said by some analysts to be crucial to Christopher's keeping his job, have been shrouded in secrecy. Israeli-Syrian peace talks are stuck over the future of the Golan Heights captured by Israel in 1967. </P>
<P> ``We've accomplished all that we wanted to accomplish here,'' Christopher told Reuters Monday. Officials said Christopher was expected back in September or October. </P>
<P> Despite the upbeat assessments, neither Christopher nor Peres offered evidence the gap between Israel and Syria had been narrowed. Both stressed that much hard work was needed. </P>
<P> U.S. officials had left open the possibility that Christopher might return to Damascus Tuesday for more talks with Assad, but Christopher apparently decided against it. </P>
<P> Syria demands a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights. Israel has agreed to at least a partial pullback but refuses to discuss its extent until Damascus commits itself to full peace, including diplomatic relations, open borders and trade. </P>
<P> Asked what were the main obstacles to peace with Syria, Peres told Israel Radio: ``It's not a matter of an obstacle. It's simply a matter of checking, seeing what's the next step ... and it takes time.'' </P>
<P> Christopher, on his second Middle East peace mission in less than three weeks, hoped to build on the momentum of a White House pact signed by Israel and Jordan on July 25 formally ending 46 years of conflict. </P>
<P> He arrived in the region against a background of clashes between Israel and pro-Iranian Hizbollah guerrillas in southern Lebanon. Peres Monday credited Syria, the main powerbroker in Lebanon, with curbing Hizbollah. But Hizbollah denied it. </P>
<P> On the Israeli side of the Dead Sea, Israeli and Jordanian negotiators held talks Tuesday to hammer out issues with a goal of signing a full peace treaty by year's end. </P>
