<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Pope John Paul Thursday said the Vatican wanted international guarantees to protect Jerusalem as the common patrimony of the world's major religions. </P>
<P> In a speech accepting the credentials of Israel's first ambassdor to the Vatican, the pope also renewed a Roman Catholic commitment to fight anti-Semitism. </P>
<P> Envoy Shmuel Hadas renewed a standing invitation for the pope to visit Israel. </P>
<P> The ceremony at the papal summer retreat south of Rome was the last formal phase of an historic process of reconciliation between the Holy See and Jewish state. </P>
<P> ``One hopes that the unique and sacred character of this city (Jerusalem) will be the object of international guarantees assuring its access to all believers,'' the pope told Hadas. </P>
<P> ``I dream of the day when Jews, Christians and Muslims will greet each other in Jerusalem with the sign of peace.'' </P>
<P> Israel declared Jerusalem its ``united and eternal'' capital in 1980, 13 years after its forces captured the city's eastern sector from Jordan in the Six-Day War. </P>
<P> The city is sacred to Muslims, Jews and Christians. </P>
<P> ``The leaders of the great monotheistic religions look towards the holy city of Jerusalem, which we know is still today a theater of divisions and conflict, as a sacred patrimony for all those who believe in God,'' the pope said. </P>
<P> Most countries have not officially recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital and keep their embassies in or near Tel Aviv. </P>
<P> Israel has resisted any suggestions that the city should be put under international control and says all of Jerusalem's holy sites are open to believers of all religions. </P>
<P> Israel and the Vatican established full diplomatic ties last June, sealing an historic accord on mutual recognition and reconciliation after centuries of bitterness between Christians and Jews. </P>
<P> The diplomatic relations will make it easier for the pope to realize a dream to visit Jerusalem and the Holy Land. </P>
<P> ``We reiterate here to Your Holiness, on behalf of all the Israelis -- Jew, Christian and Muslim -- the centuries-old Hebrew greeting-wish: Next Year in Jerusalem,'' Hadas said. </P>
<P> Hadas later told Reuters that in private talks, the pope expressed his ``great desire'' to make such a trip but the two did not discuss when it might take place. </P>
