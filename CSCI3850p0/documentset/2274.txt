<P>  Vermont Sen. James Jeffords' lead over Jan Backus, a three-term state senator, has dramatically dropped to within striking distance of the Democratic challenger, an opinion poll said Thursday. </P>
<P> Support for the 20-year Congressional veteran has fallen to 45 percent to 38 percent for Backus, according to a poll by Political/Media Research of Washington, D.C. </P>
<P> In June, the polling group found Jeffords ahead 64 percent to 15 percent for the Backus, 47, a strong supporter of single-payer healthcare. By September the gap narrowed to 51 percent to 32 percent. </P>
<P> Jeffords, now, ``is clearly vulnerable,'' Del Ali, vice president of Political/Media Research, told Reuters. ``He's vulnerable because he's an incumbent under the 50 percent threshold against the challenger, and undecideds usually go for the challenger.'' </P>
<P> The poll was based on phone interviews conducted Oct. 18 to Oct. 20 among 618 registered Vermont voters asked whom they would vote for if the election were held now. The poll has a four percent margin of error. </P>
<P> Thirteen percent of the respondents were undecided. </P>
<P> In the race for Vermont's only U.S. House seat, the polling agency found Rep. Bernard Sanders' lead over Republican challenger John Carroll had slipped to 49 percent to 35 percent. Last month Sanders was ahead 52 percent to 30 percent. </P>
