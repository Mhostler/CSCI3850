<P>  The White House does not expect the United Nations to move its peacekeepers from Bosnia now, White House chief of staff Leon Panetta said Thursday. </P>
<P> ``We at this point do not expect the U.N. to remove the peacekeepers,'' Panetta told reporters. ``There's been no decision to move the peacekeepers.'' </P>
<P> Panetta was explaining to reporters why President Clinton Thursday offered U.S. troops to help protect any withdrawal of U.N. peacekeepers from Bosnia. U.S. defense officials said earlier that Washington would provide about half of a NATO cover force of up to 25,000 troops. </P>
<P> ``Our hope is that there will be a negotiated settlement to the Bosnian situation,'' Panetta said. ``But because the peacekeepers are there, and that kind of contingency could arise, the question was would the U.S. participate with our allies in that effort, and the answer to that was it would.'' </P>
<P> Panetta said the United States had ``basically followed past precedent in this kind of situation with regards to our NATO allies, a precedent that was established, I understand, in the Bush administration.'' </P>
<P> He said the U.S. commitment made in the past was that ``if we had to go in on an emergency basis, to be able to remove the U.N. peacekeepers for any emergency reason, that we would participate in that effort.'' </P>
