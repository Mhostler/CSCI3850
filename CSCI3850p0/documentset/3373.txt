<P>  The U.S. economy grew a little more strongly than previously thought during the third quarter, the Commerce Department said Thursday. </P>
<P> The nation's gross domestic product expanded at a 4.0 percennt annual rate in the three months from July through September rather than 3.9 percent as estimated a month ago, the government said in a final revision of the quarterly GDP figure. </P>
<P> It was the second upward revision in third-quarter GDP. It first was reported growing at a 3.4 percent annual rate before being revised up to 3.9 percent and finally to 4.0 percent. </P>
<P> GDP measures the value of all goods and services produced by workers and capital within U.S. borders. It is the broadest measure of national economic activity. </P>
<P> With consumer spending strong and manufacturing industries booming, analysts say the economy kept growing robustly in the closing quarter of the year, likely at a rate of 4.0 percent or more. </P>
<P> Even with the strong tempo of economic activity, there was little or no sign of emerging inflationary pressures in the third-quarter GDP report. </P>
<P> But pressure for higher prices, which eventually will hit consumers, is considered to be just below the surface in stiffer costs for commodities and raw materials. Auto giant General Motors Corp. announced Thursday that it was boosting prices for its cars because its costs for steel and plastics used in manufacturing were rising. </P>
<P> The Federal Reserve boosted short-term interest rates six times this year in a bid to tamp down inflation pressures by curbing the annual rate of economic growth. Its policy setting committee met again on Tuesday to consider monetary policy but did not raise rates again. </P>
<P> More interest-rate rises are considered a virtual certainty early next year, however, because GDP clearly is growing well above the central bank's target rate of about 2.5 percent a year -- a level that policymakers believe could be sustained without fueling inflationary price rises. </P>
<P> The finally revised third-quarter GDP report contained no real surprises. </P>
<P> ``The general picture of economic activity is little changed from last month: Consumer, investment and government spending more than accounted for the increase in real GDP, with one-half of the increase attributable to consumer spending,'' the department said. </P>
<P> Businesses built up inventories during the third quarter at an annual rate of $57.1 billion, even stronger than the estimate a month ago of $56.1 billion. </P>
<P> That followed second-quarter stock-building at a rate of $59.2 billion and showed how optimistic corporations were about a brisk shopping season in the holiday period leading up to Christmas. </P>
<P> Consumer spending, which fuels two-thirds of national economic activity, went up at a $26.9 billion annual rate instead of $28.6 billion, the department said, still more than double the second-quarter's $11.5-billion second-quarter growth. </P>
<P> Business investment increased at a rate of $22.1 billion instead of $22.5 billion after second-quarter growth at a rate of $14.3 billion a year. </P>
<P> The department said it revised up its estimate of exports during the third quarter after deciding that spending by foreign visitors to the United States on hotels, transportation, meals and other services was stronger than it thought earlier. </P>
