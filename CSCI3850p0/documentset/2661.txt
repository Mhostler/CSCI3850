<DATELINE>KIEV, Ukraine (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma leaves for the United States this weekend much strengthened after a string of political victories at home, including parliamentary approval of a major arms treaty. </P>
<P> Since his election in July Kuchma has won Western approval for the first comprehensive reform program since Ukraine's independence in 1991 and has pushed it through a reluctant parliament. </P>
<P> He introduced steep price hikes required by budget constraints with little more than a murmur from impoverished Ukrainians earning average monthly wages of about $15. </P>
<P> And Wednesday he scored a huge diplomatic success when parliamentary deputies overwhelmingly approved Ukraine's membership in the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) -- the former Soviet republic's sole outstanding difference with the West. </P>
<P> It attached conditions to the measure, mainly demands for security guarantees, but diplomats said these were technical and relatively easily resolved. </P>
<P> Kuchma was helped by a last-minute grant of $234 million in aid from 14 Western countries and the European Union to cover mammoth disarmament costs. </P>
<P> Approval of the NPT will shift the focal point of relations between Kiev and Washington which have been largely governed by the varying extent of Ukraine's commitment to disarm since the end of the Soviet era . </P>
<P> Ukraine has moved up the U.S. foreign policy agenda quickly since emerging from months of international isolation in February, when parliament ratified the START-1 disarmament pact. </P>
<P> During a visit to Washington earlier this year by Kuchma's predecessor, Leonid Kravchuk, President Clinton announced a doubling of aid, making Ukraine the world's fourth largest recipient after Israel, Egypt and Russia. </P>
<P> Kuchma praised Washington for its role in securing aid for Ukraine at last July's G7 summit in Naples and at an aid conference last month in Canada, and said increased U.S. investment will encourage others. </P>
<P> Ukrainian and U.S. officials intend to sign about 12 agreements during a state visit which will include talks with the IMF, World Bank, the NASA space agency, Jewish groups and members of the two-million-strong ethnic Ukrainian community. </P>
<P> He will also address the United Nations General Assembly and meet U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. </P>
