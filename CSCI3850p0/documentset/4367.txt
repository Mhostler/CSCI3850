<DATELINE>HOUSTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Dow Chemical Co. was found liable Wednesday for the first time for injuries alleged to have been caused by silicone breast implants made by its Dow Corning Corp. affiliate. </P>
<P> A Houston jury found Dow Chemical liable for 20 percent of the $5.2 million in damages it awarded to a woman and her husband for injuries to the woman they said were caused by silicone breast implants. </P>
<P> The verdict capped the first-ever silicone implant trial in which the Midland, Mich.-based chemical giant was a defendant. </P>
<P> The jury ordered Dow Corning, a joint venture of Dow Chemical and Corning Corp., to pay 80 percent of the damages awarded to Gladys Laas and her husband Robert. </P>
<P> The couple had sought $11 million in damages. </P>
<P> Dow Corning lawyers said they will appeal the verdict. </P>
<P> The jury awarded no damages to the other female plaintiff, Jenny Ladner. Ladner, a cardiologist, had sought $18 million. </P>
<P> Jurors also found there was no gross negligence by the defendants, which defense lawyers said makes punitive damages unlikely. </P>
<P> State Court Judge Michael Schneider said he will review the jury's finding on Dow Chemical's liability and issue a ruling in about two weeks. </P>
<P> He agreed to the review at the request of Dow Chemical lawyers, who cited inconsistencies in the verdict. </P>
<P> Dow Chemical, which is not a participant in a $4.3 billion global settlement of implant cases, contended in the 10-week trial that it was not responsible for the actions of Dow Corning. </P>
<P> Dow Chemical spokesman Dan Fellner said the company will appeal the verdict if the judge accepts that it is liable. </P>
<P> ``We firmly believe that there is no legal basis for liability and that the Texas courts of appeals will ultimately support our appeals,'' Fellner said. </P>
<P> Dow Chemical lawyer Richard Josephson added that the company will not join the global settlement. </P>
<P> Laas, a registered nurse who now walks with a cane, said afterward: ``I'm very relieved it's over with. </P>
<P> ``And I'm very pleased that 12 people I never saw in my life could get together and decide that we're all not crazy. That we really are sick and that these corporations should pay for what they did to us.'' </P>
<P> Laas' lawyer, John O'Quinn, told reporters: ``It's very significant that the jury found that Dow Chemical aided and abetted Dow Corning. They've got the money and they better come forward and pay the bill and take care of these women.'' </P>
<P> Dow Chemical lawyers said the verdict was inconsistent because jurors found in one question on the verdict form that there was no marketing, manufacturing or design flaw in the implants. </P>
<P> But jurors also found that Dow Corning marketed the implants without adequate testing and that Dow Chemical knew of the practice. </P>
<P> Juror Monica Rey said the jury did not award damages to Ladner because it believed there were adequate warnings available when she received her implants in the late 1980s, a decade after Laas. </P>
