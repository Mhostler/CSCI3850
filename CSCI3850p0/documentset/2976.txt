<P>  National Hockey League superstar Wayne Gretzky said Friday he believed there was still a chance there would be an NHL season this year. </P>
<P> Gretzky, in Helsinki to begin a six-city tour of the Nordic countries with other NHL stars, will play against clubs in Finland, Norway and Sweden. </P>
<P> ``I think there is still a chance, but it's 50-50 right now (that there will be a NHL season),'' Gretzky said at a news conference. </P>
<P> Gretzky also said he would play in the world championships in Sweden next year if there is no NHL season. </P>
<P> In Chicago Friday, talks between the NHL and players were adjourned after just two hours with no sign of progress toward rescuing the season, which was to have begun Oct. 1. </P>
<P> Both sides said they would probably meet again Monday in an attempt to end the owners' 63-day-old lockout of the players. </P>
<P> After arriving in Finland, the squad of NHL stars being billed as ``Wayne Gretzky and Friends'' had a short practice session in Helsinki's ice hockey stadium attended by several hundred Finnish fans. </P>
<P> ``Many of us didn't realise how much we really missed the game,'' said St Louis Blues scoring star Brett Hull. </P>
<P> The team plays reigning Finnish club champion Jokerit on Saturday and Tampere team Ilves Sunday before going to Norway and then on to Sweden. </P>
