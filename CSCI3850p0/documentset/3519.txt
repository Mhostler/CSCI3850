<P>  South Korean President Kim Young-sam on Sunday called for an end to ``tragic mistrust and confrontation'' between the divided halves of the Korean peninsula . </P>
<P> In a New Year's Day message, Kim said 1995 is'' replete with particular significance because it marks the first half century of Korea's national liberation.'' </P>
<P> ``Our hearts ache over the fact that although 50 years have passed since our land was divided, we have yet to resolve this tragedy,'' Kim said. </P>
<P> ``Just as we have built a democratic and prosperous nation amid the debris of war, so must we consolidate our gains and further develop capabilities if we are to attain our long-cherished goal of unification.'' </P>
<P> Korea, a unified nation since the seventh century, was divided into capitalist South and communist North in 1945 when Japan's harsh colonial rule was ended with its defeat in World War II. The two Koreas have remained technically at war since their 1950-53 war. </P>
<P> ``The tragic mistrust and confrontation between our compatriots must now be ended,' Kim said. </P>
<P> ``In step with the historical global trends,we must usher in an era of South-North reconciliation and cooperation.' Kim said. </P>
<P> Following last October's nuclear deal between the United States and North Korea, the South has sought to improve ties with the communist neighbor. </P>
<P> In the accord, North Korea agreed to freeze and its nuclear program for economic aid, including replacement of its reactors with modern and less threatening nuclear facilities and improved ties with Washington. </P>
<P> Kim said his administration would actively push ahead with its latest drive to ``globalize'' the the country. </P>
<P> The president said the birth of the World Trade Organisation ``signals the arrival of an era of unbounded competition between nations and regions.'' </P>
<P> ``Only through globalization will our nation be able to extend its sphere of activity throughout the world and play a pivotal international role.'' he said. </P>
