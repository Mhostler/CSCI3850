<P> A ministry statement said the car was later recovered elsewhere in the demilitarized zone along the desert border. </P>
<P> The ministry said the incident on a Kuwaiti farm in the Abdali area of the demilitarized zone would prompt Kuwaiti authorities to take further border security precautions. </P>
<P> The reported shooting is the latest in a series of security incidents involving Iraqi infiltrators since the 1991 Gulf War ended a seven-month Iraqi occupation of the emirate. </P>
