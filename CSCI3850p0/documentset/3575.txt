<DATELINE>BEIT LIQIA, West Bank (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Israeli undercover forces shot dead four Palestinians in the West Bank village of Beit Liqia near Ramallah Wednesday after gunmen fired on them, wounding one soldier, Israeli security sources said. </P>
<P> The army made no mention of an undercover unit, but said soldiers operating in the area were shot at from a vehicle and one soldier was lightly wounded. The Israeli forces returned fire and killed all four Palestinians in the car. </P>
<P> At the scene four bodies covered with jackets lay in pools of blood beside a white Subaru car riddled with bullet holes. The Subaru's interior was soaked in blood. </P>
<P> Brains spattered the driver's seat of the car which had crashed into a van and come to rest beside a wall bearing a poster of Yasser Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization. </P>
<P> Dozens of Israeli soldiers in full-battle gear scoured darkened Beit Liqia. </P>
<P> Israel Radio said the four dead were militants of George Habash's Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), which opposes the Israel-PLO peace deal. </P>
<P> The army confirmed one of the dead men was a PFLP activist, but said that the other three had yet to be identified. </P>
<P> The Israeli army commander of the Ramallah district, identified only as Col. Nimrod, told Israel Radio, ``Not all of them have been identified, there were wanted men among them ... they were suspected of attacks on (Palestinian) collaborators (with Israel).'' </P>
<P> The killings brought to seven the number of Palestinians slain by Israeli soldiers in the West Bank this week. </P>
<P> On Monday, soldiers killed three Palestinians in two separate incidents. In each case the army said Israeli troops were fired on first by guerrillas. </P>
<P> Elsewhere in the West Bank Wednesday, hospital officials in Hebron said a Jewish settler whose car was being stoned shot and wounded a Palestinian man in the shoulder, and then fled. </P>
<P> The army said it had no report of a settler opening fire, but confirmed a Palestinian was wounded by gunfire. </P>
<P> In the Gaza Strip Wednesday, two Palestinian civilians were wounded when Israeli soldiers and Palestinian police exchanged fire as tensions rose on both sides of the Israeli-PLO peace deal. </P>
<P> As on Monday when Israeli soldiers shot dead three Palestinian policemen in Gaza, it was disputed Wednesday who fired the first shots. </P>
<P> Late Wednesday the army said shots were fired at an Israeli bus going to the Jewish settlement of Morag in Gaza, but that no one was hurt. </P>
<P> Israel and the PLO signed an interim peace deal in September 1993 which so far has resulted in Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho. </P>
<P> The violence and a growing controversy over expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip have strained relations between the sides and complicated negotiations on implementing further stages of the peace deal. </P>
