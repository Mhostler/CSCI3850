<P>  The Guatemalan government Wednesday said it was taking legal action against an American woman who recently staged a 32-day hunger strike to demand the return -- dead or alive -- of her leftist rebel husband. </P>
<P> Attorney General Asisclo Valladares said he was charging Harvard-educated lawyer Jennifer Harbury with ``making accusations without evidence'' against the Guatemalan army. </P>
<P> Harbury says the army captured her husband Efrain Bamaca Velasquez after a battle with rebels in March 1992. She has also named eight army officers who allegedly tortured her husband after his disappearance. </P>
<P> Valladares said Harbury has 15 days to present evidence to support her allegations against the army which insists Bamaca died in battle or killed himself to avoid capture. </P>
<P> He did not say what would happen if Harbury fails to present the evidence. </P>
<P> ``I will not allow any foreigner to mess with the state of Guatemala,'' Valladares told reporters. </P>
<P> The U.S. government, through its intelligence sources here, has said there is evidence that Bamaca, a top guerrilla commander, was captured alive. </P>
<P> Harbury fasted for over a month outside Guatemala City's National Palace to urge the government to find her husband. </P>
<P> Under pressure from Washington, President Ramiro de Leon ordered an investigation into Bamaca's disappearance. </P>
<P> Members of a U.N. mission set up to monitor human rights in Guatemala accompanied government investigators into army bases around the country this week to search for Bamaca. </P>
<P> The U.N. mission -- known by its acronym MINUGUA -- was set up through a March human rights agreement signed by the government and rebels as part of peace accords aimed at ending 34 years of civil war. </P>
<P> It will assist the government to investigate human rights cases and receive allegations of abuses. </P>
