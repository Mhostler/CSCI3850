<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A car bomb exploded Monday, killing up to 80 people and injuring dozens more in a busy marketplace in the northern Iraqi city of Zakho, an Iraqi Kurdish group said Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``Initial reports from Zakho indicate that as many as 80 people were killed and dozens wounded,'' said a statement from the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) faxed to Reuters. </P>
<P> Western and Turkish officials said earlier that at least 54 people had been killed but the death toll could rise. </P>
<P> Three Turkish truck drivers wounded in the blast and later brought to a Turkish hospital for treatment said there could be 100 dead. </P>
<P> It was not immediately clear who was behind the blast, which follows renewed tensions between the PUK and the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP), the area's dominant factions. </P>
<P> PUK pointed at Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, whose forces have been shut out of the region by Western air power. </P>
<P> ``Those powers seeking to perpetuate the infighting among the Kurds, and in particular the Saddam Hussein regime, are prime suspects behind this atrocity,'' it said. </P>
<P> Northern Iraq has been locked in factional fighting since mid-December between the forces of the KDP, led by Masoud Barzani, and the PUK of Jalal Talabani. </P>
<P> Zakho, 12 miles from the Turkish border, and the towns of Dohuk and Salahuddin are controlled by the KDP. Talabani's forces hold Arbil and Suleimaniyah further south. </P>
<P> Abdulbaki Algan, one of the Turkish drivers injured in the blast, said the incident happened in a busy section of the marketplace where foreign currency exchange kiosks operate. </P>
<P> ``There was a huge blast when we were exchanging money in the morning. It was followed by several more. It was very crowded there,'' Algan told Turkey's Anatolian news agency from a hospital bed in the southeastern city of Diyarbakir. </P>
<P> ``The square was filled with dead and wounded who were moaning in pain. We were taken to (a) hospital in Zakho which was also full of dead and injured,'' he said. </P>
<P> Reports that two Turkish truck drivers were among the dead had not yet been confirmed, Turkish officials said. </P>
<P> U.S. officials at the Incirlik airbase in southern Turkey, home to the Western allied force protecting Kurds in northern Iraq from possible attack by Baghdad, said Monday they were able to confirm 54 dead and up to 80 wounded. </P>
<P> Turkey and the United States have warned the PUK and KDP leaders that their fratricidal fight could endanger the flow of aid to the region, kept alive by a lifeline through the Turkish border crossing at Habur. </P>
<P> Turkey supports the truck trade into Iraq to boost its regional economy, withering under the 1990 U.N. embargo punishing Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. </P>
<P> Turkish trucks haul food and medicine, exempted from the embargo, and bring back diesel fuel. </P>
