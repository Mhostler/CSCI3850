<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Rescuers battling through twisted wreckage have found over 100 bodies and say more could be inside the mangled cars of two trains which crashed head-on in northern Bangladesh Friday evening. </P>
<P> Railroad workers, volunteers, police and troops launched a massive search in the crash site at Hilly, 295 miles from the capital Dhaka, early Saturday. </P>
<P> ``I know more than 100 bodies had been plucked from the rubble by daybreak,'' said a government rescuer Saturday. </P>
<P> ``The number of injuries is no less than 500, maybe more, and dozens among them are simply fighting for their lives,'' he told a reporter at the nearby town of Joypurhat. </P>
<P> The accident happened at 9:30 p.m. local time Friday when a passenger train slammed at high speed into another standing at the Hilly station in Dinajpur district. </P>
<P> People in nearby villages were alerted by a loud bang and rushed to help, one railroad official said. But rescue efforts were hampered by heavy fog and darkness. </P>
<P> Motiur Rahman, editor of the local daily Uttar Bangla, told Reuters by telephone: ``The local hospitals do not have enough ambulances to remove the injured or provide the necessary medical help.'' </P>
<P> Witnesses said many of the injured were sent to Indian hospitals because the crash site was only 100 yards from the northern border with India's West Bengal state. </P>
<P> ``Saving lives is the first priority. So India was the natural choice,'' a reporter in Joypurhat quoted an official as saying. </P>
<P> Police in Dinajpur said two relief trains had reached Hilly and begun rescue operations Saturday morning. </P>
<P> ``The area has been like hell with thousands of people crying and looking for their relatives. A father fainting on his son's body or a woman refusing to believe her husband is dead are part of the tragedy,'' one police officer told Reuters by telephone. </P>
<P> He said the final death toll could be nearly 150. </P>
<P> It was the worst train crash in Bangladesh since January 1989 when 135 people were killed and over 1,000 injured as two packed trains collided at Pubail 15 miles from Dhaka. </P>
<P> Dinajpur officials said they believed the accident was caused by faulty signalling but railway officials refused to confirm the report. </P>
<P> Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia, accompanied by Communication Minister Oli Ahmed, was expected to fly to Hilly Saturday. She had already ordered compensation for survivors and the relatives of victims, her aides said. </P>
<P> ``This is not an unbelievable figure given the size of the accident, which totally destroyed five cars of the two trains and partly damaged the engines,'' said one police officer. </P>
