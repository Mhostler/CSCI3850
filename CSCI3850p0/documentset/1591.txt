<P>  Russia's parliament is to take a new look at how to rehabilitate Tsar Nicholas II, shot dead in 1918 by gunmen acting on the orders of Soviet state founder Vladimir Lenin, a top parliamentary official said Sunday. </P>
<P> A press statement from the State Duma lower house of parliament said parliamentary chairman Ivan Rybkin made his promise after meeting Grand Duchess Leonida Georgievna, a relative of the late tsar by marriage. </P>
<P> The grand duchess was in Russia to attend a reburial ceremony for the bones of Grand Duke Georgy, the tsar's younger brother who died of tuberculosis in 1898. </P>
<P> ``During the meeting (with Rybkin) she requested that the remains of former emperor Nicholas II, his wife and children and those who died with him be reburied according to Orthodox church traditions,'' the statement said. </P>
<P> ``Rybkin listened to the request with understanding and told her that Duma deputies intended to consider the question of rehabilitating ... the Romanov family and those who died with them.'' </P>
<P> The tsar, his wife Alexandra and three of their five children were shot in the cellar of a house in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg and their bodies dumped in a forest pit 20 miles away. </P>
<P> Their remains are to be given a solemn burial in the old imperial capital of St Petersburg, a ceremony provisionally set for March 5 next year -- Absolution Sunday in the Orthodox calendar. </P>
<P> A government commission is already looking into the reburial ceremony. It is headed by Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Yarov. </P>
<P> Scientists had exhumed Georgy's bones and skull in July as part of a scientific probe to allow Russian experts to establish conclusively Nicholas' remains. </P>
<P> But scientists said the bones were in such poor condition, because the coffin was partly water-logged, that it had been impossible to draw clear conclusions from samples taken. </P>
<P> The bones were reburied in a new tomb and coffin in St Petersburg's Peter and Paul Cathedral last Friday. </P>
