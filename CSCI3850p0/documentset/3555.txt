<P>  A Frenchman swimming the Atlantic Ocean said Tuesday he was getting fed up after more than two weeks of 10-hour days in the water and was finding it hard to sleep. </P>
<P> ``There's a certain disappointment, even suffering,'' Guy Delage, 42, said in a radio interview from the open sea. </P>
<P> He is about 700 miles into his planned trip from the Cape Verde Islands off Africa to the Caribbean island of Martinique. </P>
<P> ``My dream has lasted eight years and now it's gradually being replaced by a reality which isn't exactly what I had dreamt of,'' he told France-Info radio. </P>
<P> Delage has spent 18 days at sea in his bid for the first trans-Atlantic swim and has about 1,750 miles to go, braving sharks, storms and loneliness. </P>
<P> He spends about 10 hours a day in the water and the rest drifting westwards on ocean currents on a small wind-powered raft. While he is swimming, the raft follows him by a satellite tracking device. </P>
<P> But Delage said the noise of the small windmills aboard the vessel bothered him. </P>
<P> ``I find it very difficult to sleep at night,'' he said. ``The raft is so uncomfortable that it's a sort of relief to get into the water.'' </P>
<P> In the past, Delage has raced sailing yachts and piloted ultra-light solo aircraft. In 1991 he flew an ultra-light plane of his own design across the Atlantic in 26 hours. </P>
<P> Last week, French swimmer Stefan Caron, who won a bronze medal in freestyle swimming during the 1992 Olympics, criticized Delage by saying he was merely ``bathing.'' Caron said Delage covered most of the distance by drifting. </P>
