<DATELINE>INDIAN WELLS, Calif.(Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Eighth-seeded American Mary Joe Fernandez saw her hard work pay off when she beat fourth seed Natasha Zvereva of Belarus 6-4, 6-3 in the final of the $430,000 Evert Cup on Monday. </P>
<P> The final was originally scheduled for Sunday but persistent light rain forced it to be postponed a day. </P>
<P> Fernandez, ranked 19th in the world, beat the ninth-ranked Zvereva for the fifth time in as many career meetings and recaptured the title she won here in 1993. </P>
<P> She called her win in the 84-minute match the payoff for all the time she has put in on the practice court recently. </P>
<P> ``I have been working very hard and it paid off today because I was able to dictate play,'' Fernandez said. ``My serve got me a few free points at important times and I took advantage of some of her errors. Mentally, I think I was perfect and I'm certainly pleased with the outcome.'' </P>
<P> Zvereva, who upset top seed and world No. 1 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain in the semifinals, had patches of brilliant play against Fernandez but could not sustain them. </P>
<P> Zvereva opened a 3-1 lead in the first set with some tricky net play, but she outsmarted herself on a break point, hitting an easy drop volley wide to lose her serve in the sixth game, which allowed Fernandez to pull even at 3-3. </P>
<P> Fernandez broke Zvereva again in the ninth game on a backhand passing shot and consolidated that break to win the first set. </P>
<P> Fernandez took a 3-0 second-set lead with one break of serve in hand and never lost it, as Zvereva wavered between hitting winners and making errors throughout the set. Fernandez sealed the victory by breaking again in the final game of the match. </P>
<P> Zvereva said she employed the same strategy -- attacking all shot balls -- that worked in her upset of Sanchez Vicario on Saturday, but admitted she was slightly overwhelmed by the occasion. </P>
<P> ``She played very well the entire match,'' Zvereva said. ''My tactics were the same (as against Sanchez Vicario) but I made many mistakes at the net because I was so excited to be in the final. But I don't want to take credit from her.'' </P>
<P> Fernandez collected $79,000, while Zvereva earned $39,500. </P>
