<DATELINE>BOMBAY, India (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  In its first decision since sweeping to power in India's richest state, the right-wing alliance of the Shiv Sena and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has resolved to change the name of Bombay to Mumbai. </P>
<P> Announcing the decision, the new chief minister of Maharashtra, Manohar Joshi, said his cabinet had unanimously decided to change the name of India's commercial capital to the local version that predates the Anglicized form. </P>
<P> ``Mumbai is derived from Mumbadevi, the deity worshipped by the city's original inhabitants, the Koli fisherfolk,'' Culture Minister Pramod Navalkar said Tuesday. ``So it is only right that we should rename the city.'' </P>
<P> Shiv Sena, the aggressive regional political force and its electoral partner the BJP, have vowed to put their stamp on the state, and raise their Hindu saffron banner atop Mantralaya, the state secretariat. </P>
<P> Bombay, the most cosmopolitan Indian city, was called Mumbai by the native people before the Portuguese gave it away in dowry 400 years ago to the British King Charles II when he married Catherina Braganza. </P>
<P> When the Shiv Sena came to power in the Bombay Municipal Corporation a decade ago, the first thing the party did was to change Bombay's name to Mumbai and plant a plaque in front of the Gateway of India. The dispute has raged for years. </P>
<P> While changing the name of a city needs the formal approval of the central government, some states have acted unilaterally to make such changes after New Delhi balked. </P>
