<P>  Most French people are hostile to the aims of a controversial law adopted last year shielding their language from an invasion of foreign, mainly English, words, a survey released Thursday found. </P>
<P> Seventy-one percent of adults believe that ``a language must be open to foreign words to enrich itself and develop'' while just 23 percent support a ban on foreign words, according to the SOFRES poll for the French daily Le Figaro. </P>
<P> Six percent had no opinion in the poll, to be published in Friday's editions. </P>
<P> The 1994 Toubon law, named after its author, Culture and Francophone Affairs Minister Jacques Toubon, required that all signs in public places must be in French or carry a translation. </P>
<P> It also restricted use of foreign words in advertising slogans, broadcasting, work contracts, company regulations, scientific congresses and meetings. </P>
<P> Individual offenders face fines of up to $1,000 while companies may be fined 5,000. </P>
