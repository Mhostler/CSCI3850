<DATELINE>TUNIS, Tunisia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Palestinian leaders angrily debating the future of the peace process with Israel may decide to continue talks with the Jewish state but replace PLO leader Yasser Arafat's main negotiator, Palestinian sources said Friday. </P>
<P> Arafat's close aide, Nabil Shaath, may be replaced by Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), the man who negotiated and signed the 1993 accord with Israel, the sources told Reuters. </P>
<P> Since 1993, however, Abbas has remained in the PLO's official headquarters in Tunis and called for a ``pause'' in the talks because he says the PLO is conceding too much. </P>
<P> Arafat, who last year based himself in the Gaza Strip self-rule area, ran into stiff opposition at this week's meeting of his mainstream Fatah movement in Tunis when leading members demanded a halt to talks with Israel, the sources said. </P>
<P> The plan to name Abbas as main negotiator is a compromise and is to be formally approved Saturday. </P>
<P> Shaath's role in talks with Israel was seen as ``weak'' and his future work would be ``limited,'' one source added. </P>
<P> ``The tendency is that we will continue negotiations but that they will be directed by a committee to be chaired by Mahmoud Abbas,'' a senior Palestinian official who asked not to be named told Reuters. </P>
<P> Contacted by Reuters, Abbas confirmed there were such ideas but that the decision was still to be made Saturday. </P>
<P> ``This means that Arafat will keep his leadership but that the decision-making process in negotiations will be shared with exiled leaders,'' a Palestinian source said. </P>
<P> The sources said at least seven of the 18 members of the Fatah Central Council meeting in Tunis this week favored a halt or at least a pause in negotiations with Israel. </P>
<P> Under the 1993 accord the Palestinians have gained self-rule in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank enclave of Jericho, but an Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank and Palestinian elections are far behind schedule. </P>
<P> Fatah is the biggest movement in Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization, but the Central Council does not have the authority to force him to stop the negotiations. </P>
