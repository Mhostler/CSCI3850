<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A jury Monday began deliberating whether Eli lilly & Co is liable for $50 million in damages from the fatal shooting rampage of a factory worker who was taking the controversial drug, Prozac. </P>
<P> The Jefferson County panel was given the case late Friday afternoon following more than two months of testimony. Judge John Potter agreed to let the jurors wait until Monday morning to begin deliberations. </P>
<P> The case was brought by family members of the eight victims in the September 1989 killings, who claim that Lilly's drug is dangerous and causes violent behavior among some patients. </P>
<P> Lawyers for Lilly maintain that Prozac has been used to successfully treat depression for more than 15 million patients. </P>
<P> The Jefferson County jury will first decide who is at fault for the killings -- gunman Joseph Wesbecker, who fatally shot eight co-workers; his employer for failing to protect the workplace despite Wesbecker's repeated threats; or Lilly, the manufacturer of Prozac. </P>
