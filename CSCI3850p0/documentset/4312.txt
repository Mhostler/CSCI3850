<P>  Iran has attacked House Speaker Newt Gingrich, saying comments he made about Iran ``betrayed lack of mental equilibrium.'' </P>
<P> The official news agency IRNA reported that Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi Sunday attacked comments reportedly made by Gingrich Feb. 8 that Washington should try to change what he called the ``Islamic authoritarianism'' in Iran by planning a long-term struggle. </P>
<P> Mohammadi said Gingrich's comments ``betrayed lack of mental equilibrium and old and illusive imagination,'' IRNA reported. </P>
<P> It said Mohammadi ``advised the U.S. official to keep pace with the times'' and see television footage of rallies in Iran Saturday, where Iran says millions of people took to the streets to mark the 16th anniversary of the Islamic revolution. </P>
<P> He said the rallies were ``a clear manifestation of the support of the Iranian nation for the system chosen by themselves.'' </P>
<P> ``Mohammadi said certainly there has been no government in the history of the U.S., whether Democrat or Republican, with such a popular acceptance, support and legitimacy as that enjoyed by the Islamic government in Iran,'' IRNA said. </P>
<P> IRNA also quoted an editorial due to appear Monday in the English-language Tehran Times as saying Gingrich was ``engaging in a diabolical diatribe against Iran.'' </P>
<P> ``Gingrich, in his unfair attacks on Iran, is every bit as venomous and vindictive as Democrat (U.S. Secretary of State) Warren Christopher,'' IRNA quoted the paper as saying. </P>
<P> The paper advised Gingrich to study Iran's record since its revolution in 1979, and said Iran ``has been a victim of American-sponsored terrorism for the past 16 years,'' IRNA added. </P>
