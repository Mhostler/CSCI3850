<P>  Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev met Kuwait's leaders Saturday on the second day of his mission to try to end a crisis between the emirate and former occupier Iraq, officials and diplomats said. </P>
<P> Kozyrev met the emir, Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah, Prime Minister Sheikh Saad al-Abdulla al-Sabah and Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah and then went into a separate one-to-one meeting with Sheikh Sabah. </P>
<P> Kozyrev, who also held an earlier round of talks with Sheikh Sabah Friday, was later due to head to the airport. </P>
<P> He will visit the United Arab Emirates before heading to New York. Diplomats said Kozyrev was expected in New York Sunday or Monday to present the results of his mission to the U.N. Security Council. </P>
<P> Kuwait, the United States and Britain have expressed opposition to his proposal that Iraq issue formal recognition of Kuwait and the border in return for progress on lifting crippling U.N. economic sanctions against Baghdad. </P>
<P> Iraq invaded the emirate in August 1990 and claimed it as its 19th province. A U.S.-led coalition including Russia ousted Iraqi troops in February 1991. </P>
<P> Diplomats say Iraqi recognition of Kuwait would be a crucial step toward restoring stability in the Gulf, but it was not immediately clear if Baghdad's offer will stand without the prospect of a relatively quick lifting of sanctions. </P>
