<P>  Winston Churchill was a sickly and lonely child who craved affection from his parents but won it only from a doting nanny, his granddaughter said Monday. </P>
<P> Delving into family archives for a new look at Britain's World War II leader, Celia Sandys painted a picture at a literary conference of an impetuous romantic bruised by the rigors of harsh boarding school life. </P>
<P> Churchill's American mother Jennie kept all his schoolboy scrawls and these form the basis of Sandys' book on the man who was twice British prime minister, the author of 40 books and winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature. </P>
<P> ``We feel so destitute,'' the 13-year-old Winston wrote from school in 1887 on hearing that his parents would be away in Russia for his school holidays. </P>
<P> To his father, the prominent politician Lord Randolph Churchill whom he hero-worshipped, he wrote: ``Please do do do do come and see your loving son.'' </P>
<P> At death's door with pneumonia for five days, he wrote to his nanny Mrs. Everest: ``I am feeling very weak. I feel I could cry at everything.'' </P>
<P> Churchill confessed later: ``It was to her that I poured out my troubles. For my mother seemed to me like a fairy princess and I loved her dearly -- but at a distance.'' </P>
<P> President John F. Kennedy said of Churchill: ``He mobilized the English language and sent it into battle.'' </P>
<P> But at Harrow School, Latin and mathematics bored Churchill. His housemaster wrote in exasperation: ``He is so regular in his irregularity that I don't know what to do.'' </P>
<P> Speaking at the conference in the western city of Bath, Sandys said of her grandfather: ``His academic ineptitude is a great comfort to the parents of late developers.'' </P>
<P> Describing research for her book, ``From Winston With Love And Kisses,'' she said: ``It became a passion as I delved into the family archives. It was a great emotion holding those first smudgy letters in my hand.'' </P>
<P> ``His early years were a battle for the attention of his parents and against bad health,'' she went on. ``He didn't get on well with his own age group. He was too intellectually precocious.'' </P>
<P> But perhaps the most poignant epitaph to his childhood was written by his beloved nanny Mrs. Everest who died when he was a 20-year-old soldier: ``My sweet old darling how I do love you -- so be good for my sake.'' </P>
