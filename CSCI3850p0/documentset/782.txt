<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic has rejected a plan to station international monitors on borders to verify Belgrade's trade blockade against Bosnia's Serbs, Western diplomats said Monday. </P>
<P> ``The Serbian government is not prepared to accept international monitors at this point,'' said one well-placed Western diplomat. ``They cite the negative political impact of foreign observers on their soil as the reason.'' </P>
<P> But the diplomat said the rejection of the plan was unlikely to trigger the new sanctions against Yugoslavia that Milosevic's blockade hoped to avert. </P>
<P> ``Given the steps already taken to cut off the Bosnian Serbs it would be awkward, to say the least, to impose further sanctions,'' said the diplomat, who asked not to be identified. </P>
<P> The idea of stationing monitors along the Bosnian-Yugoslav border did not even get beyond the discussion stage to a formal proposal, Western diplomats said. </P>
<P> Milosevic announced a blockade of his former proteges in Bosnia 11 days ago following their rejection of an international peace plan to end 28 months of war. </P>
<P> The plan, devised by officials of a ``contact group'' of major powers, was backed by a range of inducements and penalties to encourage acceptance, including tougher sanctions on Yugoslavia that could threaten Milosevic's political survival. </P>
<P> Milosevic's failure to stand by a blockade he imposed in May 1993 had made Western governments sceptical of his resolve, leading to the calls for impartial observers, but diplomats say so far there is no evidence the present blockade is a facade. </P>
