<P>  A panel of scientists and science educators recommended the first national standards for the teaching of science and criticized schools for killing students' curiosity, the Washington Post reported Friday. </P>
<P> It said the standards urged educators to emphasize the subject much more in elementary grades and to revise how it is taught to middle and high school students. </P>
<P> The standards also broadly defnie what ``scientific literacy''should be for studnets by the time they reach the 4th, 8th and 12th grades, urging schools to use more hands-on teaching methods and rely less on memorization of scientific theories and terms, the paper said. </P>
<P> ``This will take a long time and tremendous commitment,'' it quoted Richard Klausner, chairman of the project and chief of cell biology at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, as saying. </P>
<P> ``We need to set a vision far from where we are now,'' he added. </P>
