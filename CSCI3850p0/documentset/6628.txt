<P>  Tens of thousands of South Africans marked a national day of mourning Wednesday for the 104 men who plunged to their deaths a week ago in one of the country's worst mining disasters. </P>
<P> The main ceremony, led by Nobel peace prize winner Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, took place at this dusty gold mine 95 miles southwest of Johannesburg, where a runaway train crashed into an elevator carrying the men. The elevator car then plummeted 1,300 feet down the shaft. </P>
<P></P>
<P> ``I want us to remember that when South Africa becomes a prosperous country, it is prosperous because of them.'' </P>
<P> At the end of the service he led the 35,000-strong audience at a sports stadium named after mining magnate Harry Oppenheimer, in chants of: ``We are Free, all of us, black and white together, the rainbow people of God.'' </P>
<P> Sitting under sunny skies, the crowds had listened at mine officials, politicians and trades unionists expressing grief and dismay at the tragedy. </P>
<P> The mine, South Africa's second largest in terms of production, closed for the day, as had many others throughout South Africa. </P>
<P> Mine officials said repair work started last night on the Number Two shaft where the miners plunged to their deaths last Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``It is a matter which has touched the whole country...it is a unique disaster,'' said President Nelson Mandela, speaking in Cape Town before the services. </P>
<P> More than $2.7 million, has so far been donated to a fund for the victims' families, scattered throughout South Africa, Swaziland, Mozambique and Lesotho. </P>
<P> Zacharia Tlolo, acting premier of Northwest province where the mine is located, said 3,000 miners had died over the past five years in South Africa. </P>
<P> ``Clearly no civilized country can allow such a situation to prevail. We strongly believe the workers themselves should take the lead in occupational safety.'' </P>
<P> Molatsi blamed racial discrimination for the disaster. </P>
<P> ``A black man's life is considered very cheap. If a black man's life was not considered cheap this could not have happened,'' he said to loud applause. </P>
<P> Among dignitaries at the stadium were Mines Minister Pik Botha, Anglo American chairman Julian Ogilvie Thompson and ANC Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa. </P>
