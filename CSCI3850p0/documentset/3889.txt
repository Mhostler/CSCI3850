<P>  Forty percent of young Beijing mothers would hope for a second child were it not for China's ``one couple, one child'' population controls, an unusual new survey shows, Xinhua news agency reported Monday. </P>
<P> A Beijing Institute of Economics survey of 2,162 married women between 20 and 54 years of age in the Chinese capital found that ``very few'' would want three or more children if the one-child policy were lifted, Xinhua said. </P>
<P> Most women said they would prefer a daughter over a son, Xinhua said without giving a percentage figure. </P>
<P> The unusual survey was conducted on the supposition that the one-child policy was not in force. </P>
<P> It showed that 40.3 percent of Beijing women under age 25 who already have one child would ``hope to have a second child'' if no restrictions were in place. </P>
<P> The survey found younger women to be less inclined to have big traditional families, and that the overwhelming sentiment among Beijing people of all ages is for smaller families. </P>
<P> ``More married women born after the 1960s want to have one child or two than those born in the 1950s or earlier,'' Xinhua said. </P>
<P> Of Beijing's married women under 25 who still have no offspring, 43.2 percent said they wanted only one child and 28.4 percent said they wanted to stay childless. Only 24.7 percent in this group said they wanted two children. </P>
<P> ``Analysts...attributed the changes in view of child-bearing to China's fast economic growth, modernization and improvement of living standards,'' Xinhua said. </P>
<P> ``They found that education and profession of women is also closely related to view changes on child-bearing,'' it said. </P>
