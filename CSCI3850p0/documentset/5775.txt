<DATELINE>MIAMI (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Glen Rice boiled steaming hot Saturday, scoring 56 points to set an NBA season high and lift the Miami Heat past the slumping Orlando Magic, 123-117. </P>
<P> Rice, who got 19 of his points in the fourth quarter, shot 20-of-27 from the field, including 7-of-8 from 3-point range. ''I wasn't that hot,'' Rice joked. ``I shouldn't have missed those seven shots.'' </P>
<P> Rice surpassed the 55 points Chicago's Michael Jordan got in New York on March 28, and bested his own Heat franchise record of 46 against Orlando in 1992. </P>
<P> ``He was just in the zone,'' said Magic guard Anfernee Hardaway, who had 28 points and 18 assists. ``We had guys on him, hands in his face. But when you're that far in a zone nothing is going to stop you.'' </P>
<P> ``I was very focused,'' Rice said. ``I was tired of them kicking our butts. I wasn't going to be denied today. We sensed they were going to try to come in and embarrass us.'' </P>
<P> Shaquille O'Neal had 38 points and 16 rebounds for the Magic, who have lost four of their last five games, and 14 of their last 18 on the road. Orlando now leads the second-place Knicks by just 2 3/8 games in the Eastern Conference. </P>
<P> Miami trailed 93-87 after three periods but rallied on the shooting of Rice and rookie guard Khalid Reeves, who tied the game at 101-101 on a 3-pointer with 5:31 left. </P>
<P> Reeves had 20 points and 14 assists for the Heat (31-47), who have won two in a row and kept their slim playoff hopes alive. Miami trails eighth-place Boston by three games in the race for the final playoff berth in the East. </P>
<P> Horace Grant scored 21 points and Nick Anderson added 20 for the Magic. Anderson was playing for the first time since suffering a concussion against Detroit on April 5. </P>
<P> In Hartford, Dominique Wilkins scored 26 points as the Boston Celtics moved closer to the final playoff berth in the East with a 129-104 rout of the Detroit Pistons. </P>
<P> The win was the seventh in eight games for Boston. </P>
<P> Grant Hill scored 31 points to lead Detroit, which lost its fifth straight and was without second-leading scorer Joe Dumars, who has tendinitis in both knees. </P>
<P> At Washington, Juwan Howard scored 12 of his season-high 31 points in the fourth quarter as the Bullets held off the Milwaukee Bucks 114-110 to snap a franchise record-tying 13-game losing streak. </P>
<P> Chris Webber added 29 points and 10 rebounds. </P>
<P> Vin Baker had 30 points and 17 rebounds to lead the Bucks, who dropped into a tie with Miami three games behind Boston. </P>
<P> In Phoenix, Dan Majerle scored 18 of his 28 points in the fourth quarter as the Suns overcame the absence of Charles Barkley and rallied to beat the Los Angeles Lakers 119-114. </P>
<P> Barkley received a flagrant foul in Friday's loss at Denver which put him over the limit of five flagrant fouls in a season, resulting in a one-game suspension. </P>
<P> Former Sun Cedric Ceballos scored 40 for the Lakers, who have lost four straight and have a one-game lead over Houston in the battle for fifth place in the Western Conference. </P>
<P> In Houston, Kenny Smith scored 18 points and Hakeem Olajuwon added 15 as the Rockets beat Sacramento 98-84, dampening the Kings' playoff hopes. </P>
<P> Walt Williams and Mitch Richmond scored 19 each for the Kings, who fell 1 3/8 games behind Denver in the race for the Western Conference's final playoff berth. </P>
<P> At Golden State, Gary Payton, playing with a broken ring finger on his non-shooting hand, had 24 points and 10 assists to lead the Seattle SuperSonics past the Warriors, 115-99. </P>
<P> Seattle (56-22) is percentage points ahead of Phoenix (56-23) for first place in the Pacific Division. </P>
<P> In Portland, Jamal Mashburn scored 29 points and Roy Tarpley added 20 points and 10 rebounds to help the Dallas Mavericks keep their slim playoff hopes alive with a 102-90 victory over the Trail Blazers. </P>
<P> Dallas moved to within three games of Denver. </P>
<P> Clifford Robinson scored 25 for the Blazers, who have lost three of their last four games. </P>
<P> At Utah, Karl Malone had 21 points, 17 rebounds and seven assists as the Jazz routed the Los Angeles Clippers 105-83 for their franchise-record 56th win of the season. </P>
<P> Utah extended its winning streak to three games and moved to within 1 3/8 games of San Antonio for the top spot in the Western Conference and the best record in the league. </P>
<P> Utah's Tom Chambers had 15 points and became the 20th player in NBA history to reach the 20,000-point mark. </P>
<P> At New Jersey, Jeff Grayer led six players in double figures with 21 points as the Philadelphia 76ers snapped a seven-game road losing streak with a 97-87 win over the Nets, eliminating them from playoff contention. </P>
<P> Armon Gilliam scored 29 points for the Nets, who have lost three straight and 13 of 15. </P>
