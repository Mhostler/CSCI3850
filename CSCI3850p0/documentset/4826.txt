<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A fierce winter storm pounded northern California Thursday, causing flooding, forcing road closures and leaving 140,000 residents without electricity, officials said. </P>
<P> The storm, which moved in from the Pacific Wednesday night, dropped up to eight inches of rain in some areas and brought winds of up to 90 mph. </P>
<P> More storms were reported to be lining up offshore. </P>
<P> The Russian and Napa rivers, in the California wine country north of San Francisco, broke their banks in some places Thursday, raising fears of a repetition of the severe flooding which hit the area in January. </P>
<P> President Clinton declared a major disaster area in much of California in January after torrential downpours caused severe flooding. Damage was in the hundreds of millions of dollars. </P>
<P> A spokeswoman for Pacific Gas & Electric Co said 140,000 of the utility company's customers were without power in northern California Thursday because high winds had brought down power lines. </P>
<P> She said about 450,000 customers had been without power at some stage since the storm began, but PG&E crews had reconnected most of them. </P>
<P> Guerneville, a picturesque wine country town which was among those hardest hit by the January floods, was bracing for new flooding. </P>
<P> The Russian River, which runs through the town, had risen almost 3 feet above flood stage by Thursday afternoon and was forecast to peak at 12 feet above flood level by Thursday night, said Mark Walsh, a spokesman for the Sonoma County Office of Emergency Services. </P>
<P> Walsh said the county was recommending that Guerneville residents in lower-lying areas evacuate their homes. Shelters have been set up for evacuees in two nearby towns, he said. </P>
<P> The National Guard was sending in trucks and helicopters to help with evacuations. </P>
<P> Residents of Guerneville, 50 miles north of San Francisco, were only just recovering from the January storms when many returned to find their furniture destroyed and homes filled with mud. </P>
<P> Flooding was also reported along the Napa River, forcing the evacuation of a mobile home park and apartment complex in the town of Saint Helena. </P>
<P> Many roads throughout northern California were closed due to mudslides, flooding and fallen trees. </P>
<P> The entrance to San Francisco Bay was closed to commercial shipping due to dangerous weather conditions, the U.S. Coast Guard said, and high winds caused delays at San Francisco International Airport. </P>
<P> The National Weather Service forecast the wet and windy weather would continue through the weekend in northern California, which has had one of its wettest on record. </P>
