<P>  It was musical chairs at the White House Saturday as press secretary Dee Dee Myers moved into a larger office. </P>
<P> Myers moved into the office traditionally held by the press secretary but which had been occupied by White House communications director Mark Gearan and his predecessor, George Stephanopoulos. </P>
<P> Gearan, who becomes director of strategic and long-term planning under chief of staff Leon Panetta's reorganization of the communications department, moved into the basement office of Harold Ickes, a deputy chief of staff. </P>
