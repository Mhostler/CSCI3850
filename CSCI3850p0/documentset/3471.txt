<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Lebanon said Wednesday a Beirut bomb attack that killed the brother of this country's most wanted kidnapper was carried out by a local agent of the Israeli Mossad intelligence service who is still at large. </P>
<P> An army statement said Ahmad Hallaq had orders from Mossad to assassinate Fuad Moughniyyeh, brother of the 1980s hodstage-taker Imad Moughniyyeh, by a bomb planted near his shop. </P>
<P> The Dec. 21 explosion killed Fuad, who is a member of Lebanon's pro-Iranian Hizbollah (Party of God), another Hizbollah member and a civilian. Eleven people were wounded. </P>
<P> The statement said Hallaq had set off the bomb by remote control in a southern Beirut suburb, a bastion of Hizbollah whose fighters are fighting Israeli troops in south Lebanon. </P>
<P> ``Hallaq and his wife Hanan (Yassin) parked their car near Fuad Moughniyyeh's shop. Hallaq then went inside the shop to make sure Moughniyyeh was there, shook hands with him, walked quickly back to the car ... then set off the bomb,'' it said. </P>
<P> The Hallaqs fled to their home southeast of Beirut. </P>
<P> Imad Moughniyyeh is believed to have masterminded hostage takings that made Beirut the kidnap capital of the world. </P>
<P> Imad, who left Lebanon years ago and now lives in Iran, is suspected of abducting Westerners including Associated Press correspondent Terry Anderson, British Anglican envoy Terry Waite and Thomas Sutherland, dean of agriculture at the American University of Beirut. </P>
<P> The statement said Hallaq remained at large but his wife and three accomplices had been arrested and had acted out the crime to interrogators. </P>
<P> Hallaq was recruited in July 1993 by a Mossad officer named Dani ``who is active in Cyprus,'' it said. On Dec. 7 he went to Israel where he received explosives training for 12 days. </P>
<P> Mossad supplied Hallaq with the explosives for the bombing and part of the detonation device was found at a beach south of Beirut where Hallaq had thrown it, the statement said. </P>
<P> Lebanese officials have accused Israel of being behind the blast but Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said the answer to who was behind the bomb rested not with him but in Lebanon. </P>
<P> The blast followed Israeli threats against Hizbollah, whose Muslim militant fighters killed two Israeli soldiers in south Lebanon two days before the explosion in Beirut. </P>
<P> The car bomb ended 10 month of calm -- the longest period of peace that areas outside of south Lebanon had enjoyed since the the 1975-90 civil war. </P>
