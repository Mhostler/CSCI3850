<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Apple Computer Inc. has reached a settlement with a woman claiming she suffered repetitive strain injuries from using the company's computer keyboards, lawyers and the company said Monday. </P>
<P> The lawsuit was filed by former high school secretary Nancy Urbanski, of Eagan, Minn., and her family, alleging she suffered repetitive strain injuries using keyboards made by Apple and by International Business Machines Corp., the other defendant in the case. </P>
<P> Apple said the settlement was prompted by discovery errors by Apple's outside counsel. Discovery is a pretrial stage in which both sides of a case are required to provide pertinent factual information. </P>
<P> The company said during the seventh week of trial lawyers realized that Apple's national counsel in Buffalo, N.Y., had failed to provide a document that should have been made available to Urbanski's counsel during the discovery proceedings. </P>
<P> Apple did not say what the document was but said they had decided to settle because they faced the risk of a default judgment or a mistrial. </P>
<P> The Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple said the amount of the settlement was confidential. </P>
<P> ``It is unfortunate that these discovery errors necessitated settlement,'' Michael Assad, Apple's senior attorney, said in a statement. </P>
<P> He said the case ``had been progressing favorably from our standpoint'' and the alternative to settling was ``court-imposed sanctions for attorney error.'' </P>
<P> Michael Siebans, the Urbanskis' attorney, told a local radio station the case against IBM was continuing and he expected the trial to conclude next week. The case went before the state court jury in Hastings, Minn., in early January. </P>
<P> IBM is potentially liable for punitive as well as compensatory damages, while Apple had been declared not liable for extra damages. </P>
<P> The case is believed to be the first involving the two computer giants and repetitive strain injuries to be argued before a jury. The lawsuit accused Apple and IBM of knowingly making a dangerous product. </P>
<P> Urbanksi claims she was injured as a result of using the keyboards for typing and data entry while working almost three years at a local high school. </P>
<P> Her injuries included inflammation of the tendons and their sheaths in her lower arms and hands, her lawyers said. </P>
<P> Her husband Gary joined the suit, claiming he and their two young children suffered because of her diminished abilities as a wife and mother. </P>
<P> Apple's attorney said in the statement that the company would ``continue to vigorously defend lawsuits related to repetitive stress injuries.'' </P>
