<P>  A California man died after reaching the top of Mount McKinley and his expedition partner, suffering from rib injuries and shock, was being cared for by other climbers as high winds whipped the peak, the National Park Service said Friday. </P>
<P> Brian McKinley, 37, a U.S. Navy diver from San Diego, died Thursday, the Park Service said. It was the first death reported on the mountain, the tallest in North America, this year, the Park Service said. </P>
<P> McKinley and his partner had reached the summit of the 20,320-foot peak earlier in the evening but fell at 18,200-foot during their descent, the Park Service said. </P>
<P> The partner, Michael Angove, 31, reported that he fell into a crevasse, the Park Service said. It took Angove over an hour to climb out, Park Service spokesman John Quinley said. </P>
<P> ``When he found his partner, his partner was dead,'' Quinley said. </P>
<P> Angove, who is stationed with the Navy in Guam, reported the accident when he met up with another climbing party from Oregon Friday morning at the peak's 17,200-foot level, the Park Service said. </P>
<P> Bad weather, with winds forecast to reach 70 mph , has precluded a rescue flight, the Park Service said. But the climbers have found an emergency cache left by park rangers, and have enough food and fuel to last several days, the Park Service said. </P>
<P> Mountaineering rangers were communicating with the group by cellular telephone and radio and were preparing a rescue, the Park Service said. </P>
