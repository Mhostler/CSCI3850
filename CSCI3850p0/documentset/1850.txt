<P>  A gunman who held customers and staff hostage in an all-night siege at a German bank reportedly killed himself Friday after the last of his prisoners walked free. </P>
<P> A police spokesman declined to say exactly how the gunman died at the end of the 14-hour siege in the small town of Herzogenrath on the Dutch border. But regional WDR radio said he had killed himself by detonating a grenade. </P>
<P> Reporters said they heard an explosion and shots soon after the last hostages came out of the bank. </P>
<P> The raider, armed with guns and grenades, stormed into the bank in a town-center shopping area just before closing time Thursday. He took nine customers and seven employees hostage, demanding a ransom of $1.3 million. </P>
<P> Earlier police said he had taken 17 hostages. </P>
<P> Police said all the hostages were unharmed. Nine of them left the bank soon after the gunman entered it. They brought out his demand for the ransom and a getaway car. </P>
<P> Three more hostages were freed in the early hours of Friday. </P>
<P> The last four hostages left the bank shortly after 7 a.m. (2 a.m. EDT). It was not immediately clear if they had escaped or been freed. </P>
<P> Soon afterwards, reporters heard an explosion and at least seven shots. </P>
<P> ``The police forced their way into the building to see what the situation was after the explosion,'' said Joachim Schuelcke, police spokesman in the nearby city of Aachen. </P>
<P> He said the police had shot their way through windows to get into the bank from the rear. </P>
<P> ``There they found the perpetrator,'' he said, adding that the man appeared to be a German aged between 45 and 50, but had not been identified. </P>
<P> The spokesman declined to say whether the man had been alive or dead when police found him. </P>
