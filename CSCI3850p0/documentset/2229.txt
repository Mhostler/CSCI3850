<P>  The top U.S. military officer in Asia and the Pacific flew to two northern Vietnamese provinces Wednesday to see excavations of sites where U.S. warplanes crashed during the Vietnam War. </P>
<P> Three U.S. servicemen were killed in the incidents in Quang Ninh and Hoa Binh, U.S. officials said. </P>
<P> Adm. Richard C. Macke, commander in chief of the U.S. Pacific Command, flew by helicopter to the sites, one a crashed B-52 bomber, on the second day of a weeklong visit to Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Thailand. </P>
<P> He was accompanied by Vietnamese and U.S. officers involved in efforts to determine the fate of 2,214 U.S. airmen and soldiers listed as missing in action in Indochina in the war, which ended in 1975. </P>
<P> Macke is visiting units of the Hawaii-based U.S. Joint Task Force Full Accounting, which runs the search and has detachments in Hanoi, Vientiane, Phnom Penh and Bangkok. </P>
<P> The United States regards a full accounting for the MIAs as a national priority and says this will determine the pace at which it normalizes relations with Hanoi. </P>
<P> In talks with government officials Tuesday, Macke praised Vietnamese cooperation on the issue. He was due to give a news conference in Hanoi later Wednesday before leaving for Laos. </P>
<P> Eight U.S.-Vietnamese teams hunting for wreckage and remains are investigating 40 MIA cases and excavating 18 sites on the 32nd joint field search in Vietnam, which ends Nov. 15. </P>
