<P>  Germany's leading Catholic bishop urged the Vatican Sunday to listen to the views of critical church members when it issues theological rulings on controversial issues like divorce. </P>
<P> Karl Lehmann, the chairman of the national Catholic Bishops Conference, said the Vatican should pay more attention in its arguments to Germans and believers from other countries where Catholics are not a majority. </P>
<P> ``Our wish and our appeal for countries with a lot of Protestant Christians, where the climate facing the Catholic church is more critical, remains that sensitive documents like the recent one on divorcees who remarry....should be drafted with greater care about the argumentation,'' Lehmann told the weekly newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung. </P>
<P> Many German Catholics criticized the Vatican in October for upholding a ban on communion for believers who divorced and remarried. </P>
<P> Lehmann said controversial issues including divorce, birth control and a ban on women as priests were being constantly discussed by individual Catholics in Germany. </P>
<P> ``The church cannot really afford to have itself identified in public almost entirely with just these problems,'' he said in another interview with German radio. </P>
<P> The Bishop of Mainz said he upheld the Vatican's role as the central arbitrator on difficult theological questions, but added that the Pope must make sure decisions were practicable. </P>
<P> ``Clarity of principles is vitally important today, but it is not enough,'' Lehmann said on the radio. </P>
<P> ``We have to say honestly how the church can still offer a home to those people who cannot fulfill its ideals.'' </P>
