<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Mexican officials said Tuesday the car wreck that seriously injured the leading opposition candidate for governor in the southern state of Chiapas was an accident, but his followers still suspect he was deliberately targeted. </P>
<P> Amado Avendano, the leftist Democratic Revolution Party (PRD) candidate for governor in August 21 elections, was still in critical condition in a Mexico City hospital with trauma injuries to the brain, broken ribs and damaged lungs. </P>
<P> He was flown to the capital for emergency treatment after a truck plowed into his car on a highway in western Chiapas early Monday. </P>
<P> Three people traveling with Avendano were killed in the crash. </P>
<P> The government, under pressure to hold clean elections and clear up the case, ordered an immediate inquiry and Chiapas state governor Javier Lopez Moreno said Tuesday that all the information indicated that ``it was a true accident.'' </P>
<P> The state news agency Notimex reported that Transport Minister Emilio Gamboa also said it was an accident and that the police were close to capturing the truck driver, who fled the scene of the crash. </P>
<P> But Avendano's wife alleged he had been deliberately targeted to prevent him from winning the governorship vote August 21, the same day presidential and national legislative elections are to be held. </P>
<P> PRD leaders also demanded an exhaustive investigation. </P>
<P> The incident further raised tensions in Chiapas, where Maya Indian rebels of the Zapatista National Liberaton Army launched a rebellion on New Year's Day by seizing several cities. </P>
<P> Avendano owns the El Tiempo newspaper in San Cristobal de Las Casas and is widely seen as being close to the Zapatista rebels. Unconfirmed reports said the Zapatistas had declared a red alert following the crash. </P>
<P> At least 145 people were killed in the first 10 days of the Zapatista rebellion but a cease-fire was quickly agreed. The rebels are holed up in mountain and jungle strongholds but analysts predict fresh fighting if the August 21 elections are marred by fraud. </P>
