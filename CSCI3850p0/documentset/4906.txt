<DATELINE>DAMASCUS, Syria (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Secretary of State Warren Christopher Tuesday held his second meeting in 24 hours with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad amid speculation Syria and Israel may agree to resume direct talks over the Golan Heights. </P>
<P> Christopher flew back to Damascus after an overnight stop in Jerusalem and talks early Tuesday morning with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin to bring latest Israeli thinking on how to push forward the stalled peace process. </P>
<P> He was to return to Washington later Tuesday after a six-day, five-country Middle Eastern tour. </P>
<P> A five-hour session with Assad Monday left Christopher reassured that Syria and Israel were back in the serious business of negotiation although U.S. officials said the main issues were still to be resolved. </P>
<P> Israeli officials in Jerusalem said Christopher had gone back to Damascus hoping to elicit Syrian agreement to resume direct talks with Israel, which were broken off in December. </P>
<P> ``The indirect message is one of continuing work, and hope and expectation of the renewal of talks,'' Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's chief negotiator with Syria, told reporters. Syria has so far given no public hint it will agree to this. </P>
<P> The Israeli-Syrian peace talks were launched in 1991 but have stalled over the fate of the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war. </P>
<P> Direct talks between Israeli and Syrian ambassadors to the United States and their army chiefs ground to a halt after Israel laid down what Syria called impossible demands for its security needs in case its troops withdrew from the Golan. </P>
<P> Rabinovich, Israel's ambassador in Washington, said negotiations were much more serious and broader in scope than ever before. </P>
<P> He said Christopher's mediation shuttle had yielded ``significant talks on security arrangements, and there are those who are encouraged by the fact that talks on that level of seriousness and detail took place.'' </P>
<P> Rabin has refused to say how far he is willing to pull back from the strategic plateau, demanding that Assad first agree to an exchange of ambassadors and other aspects of normal ties. Syria demands full Israeli withdrawal as soon as possible. </P>
<P> Israeli leaders, as their 1996 national elections loom closer, insist time is running out. </P>
<P> But the state-run Syria Times said Tuesday Rabin was simply trying to improve his electoral chances with a combination of pro-peace rhetoric and refusal to make the necessary concessions. </P>
<P> ``His hint that he gave Mr. Christopher the 'start of the string' for making peace, coupled with (Deputy Foreign Minister) Yossi Beilin's warning message that time is running fast before the general elections in Israel, is actually the beginning of Act Two, Scene One in Rabin's performance,'' it said. </P>
<P> U.S. officials said Christopher's talks with Assad Monday centered on security arrangements between the sides, deliberately avoiding the thorny issue of how quickly and how far Israeli troops would pull back. </P>
<P> The officials disclosed that the security arrangements being discussed were demilitarized zones on either side of a new dividing line, limited deployment zones flanking those zones, early warning systems and verification measures. </P>
