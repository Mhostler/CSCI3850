<P>  Life suspensions have been slapped on two Chinese weightlifting world champions in the latest sporting disgrace to hit the country. </P>
<P> ``A total of two lifters were found to have taken drugs in Istanbul,'' said International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) chief Tamas Ajan Friday. ``Both were women and were Chinese. We banned both girls from weightlifting for life.'' </P>
<P> Ajan did not name them but a Chinese sports official confirmed earlier that Li Dan and Wang Sheng had used performance-enhancing substances at the Turkey-hosted championships in November. </P>
<P> Ajan said both lifters used the anabolic steroid dehydrotestosterone -- the drug found in all 11 Chinese competitors stripped of Asian Games medals in December. </P>
<P> Ajan said he had met members of the Chinese Olympic Committee and China's Weightlifting Federation in Atlanta, Georgia, on Dec. 17 where he informed them of the IWF decsion. They accepted the ``severe punishment,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``They assured me that they give maximum support to the IWF's anti-drug policies,'' Ajan added. </P>
<P> ``It was particularly painful because this was the first case that women weightlifters were tested positive,'' Ajan said. </P>
<P> Li set a world record and won the snatch gold medal in the over 83 kg (183-pound) class in Istanbul. Wang shared the 54 kg (119 pound) crown. </P>
<P> Seven swimmers and four other Chinese were suspended by their national and international federations for drug use at October's Asian Games in Hiroshima. </P>
<P> Chinese officials maintain that any misdemeanors are the acts of individuals and have denied Western accusations of a state-sponsored doping program. </P>
<P> He Zhenliang, China's Olympic chief and a vice-president of the International Olympic Committee, last month said the government was considering laws to permit criminal prosecution of anyone providing banned drugs to athletes. </P>
