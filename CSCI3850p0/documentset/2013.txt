<P>  The Islamic Hamas movement warned PLO leader Yasser Arafat Friday to stop arresting its members in the hunt for a kidnapped Israeli soldier or face the consequences. </P>
<P> ``I am telling Yasser Arafat, do not repeat the experience of the (Israeli) occupation ... If you want to continue this path, you will have to suffer the consequences,'' Mahmoud al-Zahar, a senior Hamas figure in Gaza told a news conference. </P>
<P> The military wing of Hamas snatched soldier Nachshon Waxman, 20, in Israel Sunday and has threatened to kill him unless Israel frees Hamas founder Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and 200 other prisoners by Friday night. </P>
<P> Israel said Waxman was being held in the Palestinian-ruled Gaza Strip and charged Arafat with responsibility for his safe return. Arafat denied Waxman was being held in Gaza, but has launched a round-up of Hamas activists. </P>
<P> ``We demand from the authorities to stop arresting our people and to stop allowing the Israeli army to wander in the Gaza Strip to arrest our people,'' Zahar said. </P>
<P> Another Hamas leader, Ismail Hanieh, said: ``We should stress to the Palestinian Authority that preserving Palestinian peace is better than preserving the peace with Israel.'' </P>
