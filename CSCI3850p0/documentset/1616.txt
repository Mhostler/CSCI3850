<P>  Canadian Defense Minister David Collenette arrived in Jeddah Monday night for a visit to Saudi Arabia, the official Saudi Press Agency reported. </P>
<P> A Canadian embassy official said Collenette would discuss the possible sale of Canadian commuter aircraft to Saudi Airlines (Saudia). </P>
<P> Saudia is spending up to $7 billion on new aircraft for its fleet, mostly from Boeing Co and McDonnell Douglas. </P>
<P> ``Saudia hasn't made a decision on a smaller commuter plane and the Regional Jet will be one of the things the minister will discuss,'' Canadian vice-consul Vicken Koundakjian told Reuters by telephone from Riyadh. </P>
<P> The 50-seater jet is made by Bombardier Incorporated's Canadair division. </P>
<P> Koundakjian said Collenette would discuss a wide range of other issues with the Saudi authorities, including the Middle East peace process and U.N. peacekeeping operations in the region. </P>
