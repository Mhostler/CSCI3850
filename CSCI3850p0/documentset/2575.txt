<DATELINE>KATHMANDU, Nepal (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Following are key facts about Nepal, which holds general elections Tuesday. </P>
<P> POPULATION - About 20.4 million, growing at about 2.5 percent a year (Population Reference Bureau estimate, 1993). Registered voters 11.1 million (1991 estimate). </P>
<P> Religions - Hindu (89.5 percent), Buddhist (5.3 percent), Muslim (2.6 percent), others, including Christian, (2.6 percent). Nepal is the world's only officially Hindu nation. </P>
<P> Official language: Nepali in the Devanagri script. Hindi and Bihari widely spoken. English used in official and commercial circles. Twelve major dialects are spoken. </P>
<P> Literacy: officially estimated in 1991 at 39.6 percent. </P>
<P> AREA: 54,510 square miles of plains, Himalayan foothills and the Himalayan range. Mount Everest and seven more of the world's top 10 highest mountains line Nepal's northern border with the Tibetan autonomous region of China. Landlocked Nepal is bordered to the west, south and east by India. </P>
<P> ARMED FORCES: (Source: International Institute for Strategic Studies, 1994-95 survey). Total strength 35,000, plus 28,000 paramilitary police. No tanks, 25 armored vehicles, some artillery and anti-aircraft guns. No navy. No combat aircraft, four transport planes, eight helicopters. Forces with U.N. missions: Croatia (900), Lebanon (722), Somalia (314). </P>
<P> ECONOMY: (Source: World Bank study, 1993). Nepal, which maintained self-imposed isolation until the middle of this century, is one of the world's 10 poorest countries. Annual income averages $180 a head. Life expectancy 54 years. Infant mortality 107 deaths per 1,000 live births. One physician per 20,356 people. </P>
<P> Natural resources are water, timber, hydroelectric potential, scenic beauty, limited but fertile agricultural land, with about 17 percent of its area arable. </P>
<P> Some 59 percent of the population works on farmland that will not support the rapidly growing population. Main products are rice, wheat, jute, millet, corn, sugarcane, oilseed. </P>
<P> Industries include cigarettes, garments, soap, matches, sugar, lumber, jute, cement, wool carpets, gems, leather. </P>
<P> GDP: $3.1 billion in 1992. GDP growth 3.0 percent in 1993. Nepal's limited development potential lies in water resources and tourism. It produces less than 250 megawatts out of potential 83,000 megawatts. Landlocked, it imports nearly three times the value of its exports with foreign assistance. Geography ties Nepal into the economy of India, where hundreds of thousands of Nepalis work. </P>
<P> Total external debt: $1.8 billion in 1991. (Source: official 1993 estimate) Foreign exchange reserves: $515.6 million, equal to nine month's import requirements. Inflation rate: 8.1 percent in 1993. (Source: World Bank) Foreign aid receipts: $453 million in 1991, or 13.8 percent of GNP. </P>
<P> Trade deficit in 1993: $388 million. Major exports: carpets, garments, hide and skins, pulses, jute, timber. Major export markets: India, Germany, United States. Major imports: textiles, other manufactured goods. Major supplier: India. </P>
<P> MODERN HISTORY: The Shah dynasty extended its rule from its central Gurkha state over other principalities in the late 18th century to form the Hindu Kingdom of Nepal, which remained independent throughout European colonisation of south Asia. </P>
<P> From 1846 the Rana clan took over as hereditary prime ministers, closing Nepal to foreigners until the monarchy, backed by commoners, reasserted its power in 1951. </P>
<P> The late King Mahendra allowed multi-party elections in February and March 1959. The liberal Nepali Congress party won a landslide victory but its leaders were jailed in a palace coup in December 1960. Later King Mahendra banned political parties in favor of non-party councils or panchayats. </P>
<P> His son succeeded him as King Birendra in 1972. After street protests in 1979, he reformed the panchayat system and held elections for a national, partyless assembly subject to the crown in 1981 and 1986. </P>
<P> Early in 1990 the Nepali Congress and communist factions rallied in mass protests. On April 6, security forces shot dead at least 50 people to stop tens of thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators from marching on the royal palace in Kathmandu. </P>
<P> King Birendra agreed to scrap the panchayat system and let the Nepali Congress form an interim government with communists. </P>
<P> On Nov. 9, 1990, the king made himself a British-style constitutional monarch. The constitution retains Nepal's Hindu status and many Nepalis still revere the king as an incarnation of the Hindu diety Vishnu. </P>
<P> The Nepali Congress won a majority in the new 205-seat parliament in a general election on May 12, 1991. Two rival monarchist parties, both called the National Democratic Party, were routed. The United Marxist-Leninist party and its potential leftist allies won two-fifths of the seats to form a formidable opposition. </P>
<P> Last July, Koirala ordered elections for Nov. 15, 18 months ahead of schedule, after 36 Congress members abstained from a key parliamentary vote. </P>
<P> King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev was born on Dec. 28, 1945. His consort is Queen Aishwarya, born on November 7, 1949. They have three children, Crown Prince Dipendra, born on June 27, 1971, Princess Sruti and Prince Nirajan. </P>
<P> Nepal accepts foreign aid from all quarters. It belongs to the United Nations, is one of the Non-Aligned Movement's most genuinely non-aligned countries and an enthusiastic member of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), which is based in Kathmandu. </P>
