<P>  Morten Boje Jensen, sole Danish survivor of the Baltic ferry disaster, said Friday it was luck, determination and sheer egoism which got him through his ordeal. </P>
<P> Jensen spent five hours hanging onto a safety raft, treading water and trying to keep himself active after he leapt from the sinking ferry, the Estonia, and waited for the helicopters that eventually came to his rescue. </P>
<P> ``I looked back and saw the ferry go down in real Titanic style. The weather was stormy, with lashing rain and huge waves,'' Jensen told a news conference in Copenhagen. </P>
<P> Jensen, a 28-year-old Copenhagen student, had been attending a Nordic-Baltic peace and cooperation conference in Tallinn, the Estonian capital. </P>
<P> He said he had gone to bed around 11:00 p.m. Tuesday night but could not sleep because of the violent rocking of the ship. He heard a crashing noise about an hour later and scrambled and crawled his way up out of the ship. </P>
<P> ``I heard the most massive thump and a heavy noise which sounded like all the trucks on the ship were being swept over on to one side of the vessel.'' </P>
<P> ``The ship began to dramatically tilt over and we all knew something was up. Out in the gangway people and inventory were quite literally flying around all over the place,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``As if by instinct I clawed my way three floors up in the ship, which was listing at over 45 degrees,'' an emotional Jensen said, breaking off periodically to wipe tears from his face. </P>
<P> ``All of a sudden I saw a great hole up top ... it was the side of the ship ... I clambered up into the fresh air by gripping door hinges,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``I could see the funnel of the ferry lying flat on the sea. Some six of us put on life jackets and got into a dinghy floating just near the doomed ferry,'' he said. The life raft was punctured and floating upside down but still operational. </P>
<P> ``We did not speak to each other. It was now a case of survival of the fittest and it was my ungentlemanly, egoistic behavior which saved me, `` he said. </P>
<P> To keep himself alive he occasionally warmed himself by hugging floating corpses around him, he said. </P>
<P> ``I was sure though of one thing ... I was going to survive. For not one second did I think I would perish. At the height of my crisis I did not pray to God for help, I just screamed 'I love you, Frederikke, I love you' at the top of my voice.'' </P>
<P> Frederikke, his tall, blond Danish girl friend, hung on Jensen's every word at the packed news conference. </P>
<P> Six of the 16 people on the lifeboat survived with the others dying of cold and exposure before they could be rescued. </P>
<P> Some 140 people survived the Baltic ferry tragedy, with 85 bodies recovered so far. More than 800 people are still missing, presumed dead, including four other Danes on the passenger list. </P>
