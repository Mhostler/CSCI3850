<P>  Unbowed in the face of the mighty Russian army in his fight for independence, Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev, an ex-karate champion, says his fighters may seek revenge in Russia's cities for its bloody Chechnya campaign. </P>
<P> The former Soviet bomber pilot's mostly Muslim region has been attacked by Russian planes since President Boris Yeltsin's forces went in Dec. 11 to restore Kremlin rule after three years of self-declared independence. </P>
<P> Now the leader of resistance so stubborn that Russia has yet to capture the Chechen capital of Grozny says his fighters may attack Russian cities if the campaign in his tiny north Caucasus region does not stop within a month. </P>
<P> ``No tanks will save Moscow,'' he said. </P>
<P> Dudayev's warning, reported by Interfax news agency Saturday, sent a shiver of fear through Russia, whose people have watched in confusion as its forces bomb and shell Grozny -- the name means ``terrible'' in Russian -- into an urban graveyard. </P>
<P> A dapper figure with a mustache perfectly trimmed, Dudayev spent his first 13 years in Kazakhstan. He graduated from Moscow's elite Yuri Gagarin air force academy as a pilot and rose to become a general in the Soviet armed forces. </P>
<P> But he has now turned his back on Moscow, and dropped dark hints about urban guerrilla-style attacks on Russia's heartland. </P>
<P> Sunday, Chechen information minister Movladi Udugov seemed to tone down his president's words, saying Chechen leaders were worried about the war spreading and that field commanders could take action behind Dudayev's back. </P>
<P> The Chechen leader has said he does not want to be ``held responsible for World War Three.'' </P>
<P> Dudayev was born on a winter day 50 years ago when Soviet dictator Josef Stalin began deporting the entire population of the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous District to Kazakhstan, fearing they would collaborate with the Nazis. </P>
<P> Out of 800,000 people packed into cattle cars, 239,000 died en route from disease, cold and malnutrition. </P>
<P> Despite his early suffering under Stalinist rule, Dudayev appealed last year to all parties to step back from the brink of war, even as Russian forces began their Chechnya campaign. </P>
<P> ``We still have a chance to prevent a bloody disaster,'' he said. Since then an unknown number of civilians, soldiers and rag-tag Chechen fighters have been killed, but hundreds, or even thousands, have almost certainly perished. </P>
<P> Dudayev's defiance has apparently retained its passion. </P>
<P> When his only son Avlur was reported on Jan. 15 to have been killed in Grozny, Dudayev said, ``I have other worries apart from Avlur ... I have 30,000 innocent civilian victims.'' </P>
<P> It is still unclear if his son was killed. Dudayev said he had been seriously wounded and suffered for six hours in the snow. </P>
<P> Chechnya, a once-quiet backwater 1,000 miles from Moscow, won notoriety after a series of hijacks by Chechens in south Russia last year. </P>
<P> Yeltsin has made television appearances to explain military action in Chechnya, saying it had become a haven for ``bandit groups'' which had to be wiped out. </P>
<P> Dudayev declared his oil-refining mountainous region of one million people independent in mid-1991. It is only one of 89 regions that has repeatedly rejected a place in the federation. </P>
<P> Dudayev is married to a Russian and they have had three daughters and Avlur. </P>
