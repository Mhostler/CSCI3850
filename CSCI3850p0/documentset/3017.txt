<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Ireland's Labor Party leader Dick Spring Tuesday dramatically pulled out of talks to form a new coalition government, just hours before parliament was due to pick a new prime minister. </P>
<P> Spring withdrew from negotiations with Fianna Fail, Ireland's largest political party, under its new leader, Finance Minister Bertie Ahern. </P>
<P> Last month Spring led his party out of a coalition headed by Ahern's predecessor Albert Reynolds, now caretaker prime minister after being forced to resign. </P>
<P> The dramatic turn of events plunged Ireland deeper into political crisis at a highly sensitive stage in the Northern Ireland peace process. </P>
<P> Britain is due to hold talks with the Irish Republican Army's political wing later this week. </P>
<P> Opinion polls show the Irish are overwhelmingly opposed to the calling of a general election in the republic before Christmas. </P>
<P> Spring's next option could be to open talks with John Bruton, leader of the main opposition party Fine Gael. </P>
<P> Northern Ireland politicians hope the British-ruled province could be on the brink of peace after both IRA and Protestant guerrillas declared cease-fires. </P>
<P> But they fear uncertainty in Dublin could stall the momentum. The London government is to stage landmark talks in Belfast Friday with Sinn Fein, political wing of the IRA that fought for 25 years to oust Britain from the province. </P>
<P> Spring, the kingmaker in any future government as his party holds the balance of power in parliament, said in a statement there was no basis for continuing talks with Ahern. </P>
<P> The stumbling block appeared to be new revelations about how Fianna Fail handled the controversial appointment of former attorney general Harry Whelehan as Ireland's new High Court president. </P>
<P> Spring originally pulled out of the 2-year-old coalition with Reynolds to protest over Whelehan's delay in handling the extradition case from Northern Ireland of a Roman Catholic priest since convicted of child sex abuse. </P>
<P> After seeking clarification from the new Attorney General Eoghan Fitzsimons, Spring said in his statement that ``serious questions'' still persisted over the lingering controversy. </P>
<P> He promised a full statement when parliament reconvenes Tuesday. </P>
<P> Ahern was apparently reluctant to provide Spring with Fitzsimons' statement in full until Reynolds returned from the European security conference in Budapest. </P>
<P> The chances of Labor and Fianna Fail clinching an agreement seemed remote after allegations that Fianna Fail had tried to cover up some of the background in the child sex abuse case. </P>
<P> The controversy was stirred by a report in the Irish Times which suggested Reynolds and his Fianna Fail party had misled parliament over the conduct of Whelehan. </P>
<P> It implied that Reynolds and his cabinet colleagues had tried to cover up the fact that Whelehan's office had bungled the affair. </P>
