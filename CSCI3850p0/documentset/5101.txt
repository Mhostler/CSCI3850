<P>  Iraq Wednesday denounced the Turkish attack on Kurdish guerrilla bases in northern Iraq, saying the raid violated its sovereignty. </P>
<P> A Foreign Ministry spokesman demanded the withdrawal of the troops and an end to ``American interference'' in the area. </P>
<P> ``Iraq considers this operation on Turkey's part as a violation of its sovereignty,'' the spokesman said. </P>
<P> He added: ``The reason for the problems threatening the security of Turkey and Iraq ... is the American interference in the affairs of the region.'' </P>
<P> U.S., French and British warplanes guard a no-fly zone in northern Iraq to protect rebel Iraqi Kurds from possible attacks by Iraqi troops. </P>
<P> The spokesman said the United States was helping ``in the creation of unnatural conditions leading to...the suffering of our Kurdish people and the threatening of security and stability of the two countries.'' </P>
<P> The statement was the first official comment on the attack by Turkish troops on bases of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in northern Iraq, now in its third day. </P>
<P> The United Nations said it was worried about Kurdish refugees of Turkish origin resettled in northern Iraq. </P>
<P> ``We are very much concerned because the troops are definitely in areas where we have resettled the refugees,'' Viktor Wahlroos, the deputy U.N. coordinator in Iraq, told Reuters. </P>
<P> He said the attack was hampering the distribution of relief aid to needy Iraqi Kurds there. </P>
<P> ``Refugees and villagers are not to be touched, are not to be harassed,'' Wahlroos said. </P>
<P> He said the United Nations feared for the safety of about 4,500 refugees who were now caught up in the fighting. </P>
<P> Baghdad-based diplomats said the Turkish raid was proof that the power vacuum in northern Iraq was widening despite Western protection of Kurds. </P>
<P> ``The area is now something like no-man's land. Kurds fight each other, Turks and Iranians play havoc,'' said one diplomat. </P>
<P> Iranian gunners and warplanes have in the past struck at rebel targets in the Iraqi Kurdish north. </P>
