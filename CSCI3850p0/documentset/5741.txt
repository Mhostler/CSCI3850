<P>  Two South Korean religous leaders face arrest when they return home on Sunday from an illegal trip to the communist North, a Unification Ministry official said on Friday. </P>
<P> Ahn Ho-sang, 93, head of the Daejonggyo faith which reveres Korea's mythical founder Tangun, and its chief administrator, Kim Son-jok, entered the North via China on Tuesday without permission from the Seoul government. </P>
<P> ``I understand they will cross the border this Sunday. If they pass through (the border village of) Panmunjom, they will be almost certain to be arrested,'' the ministry official said. </P>
<P> In South Korea, still technically at war with the Stalinist North since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce, unauthorised contacts with North Korea can be punished by up to three years in jail. </P>
<P> Ahn and Kim had rejected a government request to delay their trip until after May because rising tensions on the Korean Peninsula, government officials say. </P>
<P> Ahn served as South Korea's first education minister from 1948 to 1950. In 1992, he was elected head of Daejonggyo which has about 500,000 members. </P>
<P> Pyongyang's offical news agency carried a report on Thursday about the two visiting what the North says is the newly discovered 4,000-year-old tomb of Tangun. </P>
<P> According to legend, Tangun's father was the Son of Heaven and his mother a woman transformed from a bear. He establised the first Korean Kingdom of Chosun, the legend says. </P>
<P> Last year, North Korea reported the completion of restoration work on the tomb. South Korean officials have said the body of North Korea's ``Great Leader'' Kim Il-sung who died in July last year might be buried in or near the tomb. </P>
<P> Before his death, Kim Il-sung had ordered it rebuit and preserved as a way of boosting national pride and patriotism. </P>
