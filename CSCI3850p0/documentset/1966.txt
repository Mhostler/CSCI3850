<P> N' Chad's government, seeking reconciliation with its foes ahead of elections next year, signed a peace accord Wednesday with rebels of the Chadian National Front (FNT). </P>
<P> State radio said the accord signed in the eastern town of Abeche provided for FNT forces to be encamped and integrated into the national army, and for civilian members to join the Chadian civil service. </P>
<P> Chad set up a committee in June to make contact with various rebel groups fighting the government of President Idriss Deby in the south, east and west of the central African country. </P>
<P> Interior Minister Abderrahmane Izzo Miskine told the radio a delegation was in the southern town of Moundou seeking talks with the Armed Forces for a Federal Republic (FARF), who broke away from the main southern rebel group the Committee for National Action for Peace and Democracy (CSNPD). </P>
<P> The CSNPD, led by Moise Kette, signed a peace deal in August pledging to campaign peacefully for an autonomous Christian region in the south of the mainly-Muslim country. </P>
<P> The CSNPD is now recognized as a political party and its fighters will be absorbed into the national army, which is undergoing restructuring with French help to reduce its numbers and create ethnically-mixed battalions. </P>
<P> Last month, the former head of the Chadian armed forces, Lieutenant-Colonel Mahamat Garfa fled N'Djamena with a force of loyalist soldiers which military sources put at 600 men. </P>
<P> Multi-party parliamentary elections are supposed to be held in January and presidential polls in March but work is advancing slowly on the process, which has already been put back a year. </P>
