<P>  Two prominent U.S. human rights groups slammed the Clinton administration Saturday for its feeble response to the large increase in reports of politically motivated rapes, calling it inadequate in every respect. </P>
<P> ``A disturbing aspect of U.S. policy has been the consistent dowplaying by U.S. officials of the human rights crisis in Haiti,'' said a report by the the Washington-based Human Rights Watch and the New York-based National Coalition for Haitian Refugees. </P>
<P> ``We urge the administration specifically to recognize and denounce rape as a tool of political persecution in Haiti,'' they added in a report made available in Port-au-Prince. </P>
<P> Women's groups and human rights organizations have reported an alarming jump in the number of rapes carried out by the Haitian military and its civilian allies in recent months. Most of the assaults target supporters of Haiti's ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide or pro-democracy activists. </P>
<P> The joint U.N.//Organization of American States human rights observer mission said it received 74 reports of rape in the last five months of 1994, compared to three in the whole of last year. The mission said 52 of the alleged rapes were of a ''political nature'' and added that more than 350 people have died in political attacks in the first six months of the year. </P>
<P> Other human rights workers said that was just the tip of the iceberg and that the real figures were even higher. </P>
<P> One American working in the area of human rights said he was receiving between 10 and 20 reports of politically motivated rapes a week, while other rights activists described horrific cases in which sons were forced to rape their mothers as soldiers watched. </P>
<P> The joint report, which details individual cases of sexual assault and highlights the impunity under which most are committed, put the blame for most of the cases on Haiti's ruling military and their civilian allies. </P>
<P> ``Documented accounts of rape by uniformed military personnel and their allies are on the rise,'' the report said. ''Our findings ... all point to a disturbing pattern of rape by police and attaches (plain clothes police auxiliaries) acting with impunity. Rape functions as a punishment for the political beliefs and activities of the victims' male relatives.'' </P>
<P> The two organizations also asked Clinton to repudiate earlier statements from the embassy in Port-au-Prince which minimized the veracity and extent of rape as a political tool. </P>
<P> The statements, made in a confidential cable that was later leaked to the media, accused leftists of fabricating human rights abuses and said that because of unexplained cultural reasons rape has never been a problem in Haiti. </P>
<P> Ambassador William Swing defended the cable as ``a snapshot of the moment'' but later told human rights activists he regretted some of the ``injudicious'' language used in the dispatch. </P>
<P> The criticism is the latest in an increasing crescendo of opposition to Clinton's overall Haiti policy which had been variously described in recent weeks as ``anarchic,'' ``sloppy'' and ``a disaster.'' </P>
