<P>  The federal judge presiding over the global settlement of breast implant claims ruled that Dow Chemical Co. can be sued in some circumstances, a Houston lawyer involved in the litigation said Tuesday. </P>
<P> Richard Laminack said U.S. District Judge Sam Pointer ruled in Birmingham, Ala., that Dow was not liable for the acts of its 50-percent-owned Dow Corning Corp. but can be sued over issues such as its involvement in silicone testing. </P>
<P> ``This is huge,'' said Laminack, who represents plaintiffs in implant cases. </P>
<P> Dow Corning, which made silicone breast implants, is a joint venture of Dow Chemical of Midland, Mich., and Corning Inc. of Corning, N.Y. </P>
<P> Plaintiffs' lawyers have been seeking to have Dow included in the $4.25 billion class action settlement involving almost 60 silicone implant makers, including Dow Corning. </P>
<P> The plaintiffs claim the implants caused a variety of medical problems. </P>
<P> Dow Chemical has said it will not join the global settlement being negotiated. </P>
<P> ``Judge Pointer's ruling only means that he found that issues exist which he believes should be heard by a jury,'' Dow Chemical's general counsel, John Scriven, said in a statement. ``If there are trials on these issues, we remain confident that we will ultimately prevail.''  A Houston jury in February found Dow Chemical liable for injuries allegedly caused by silicone implants made by its Dow Corning affiliate. </P>
<P> But the verdict was overturned in March by Texas State Court Judge Michael Schneider, who presided over the trial. </P>
<P> Pointer's ruling applies only to those federal cases in which plaintiffs opted not to participate in the global settlement. It has no impact on that settlement. </P>
