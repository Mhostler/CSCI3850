<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A six-year-old Argentine boy and his four-year-old sister who were lost for three weeks in mountains roamed by pumas, deadly snakes and wild boar have been found alive after surviving by eating apples and drinking stream water, police said Monday. </P>
<P> Daniel and Romina Quispe got lost in the province of Jujuy in Argentina's far north after going out to look for their parents, who by nightfall had failed to return from tending their flocks. </P>
<P> The children wandered 60 miles through Jujuy's subtropical mountains inhabited by wild animals and snakes before taking shelter in a ruined hut, where they were found Sunday so dehydrated and hungry that Romina could not walk. </P>
<P> ``Apples were the only tasty food there was, so we ate them all day,'' Daniel told his rescuers. </P>
<P> ``Sometimes we were still hungry, but there wasn't much to eat among all the plants.'' </P>
<P> Police in the regional capital San Salvador de Jujuy told Reuters the two children were treated at a remote rural health center, then faced a gruelling mule-ride out of the mountains and were being driven to a children's hospital in the city. </P>
<P> ``But their health is fine now, thank God,'' a Jujuy police spokesman said. The children were expected to reach the city by nightfall, he said. </P>
<P> Assistant police chief Ral Aizama told reporters in Jujuy that the members of the 50-man search party had refused to be relieved until they found the children. </P>
<P> ``Finding them was the only thing that mattered. We didn't care about the pumas, the wild animals -- nothing,'' he said. </P>
