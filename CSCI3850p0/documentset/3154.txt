<P>  A judge Monday dismissed a case against actor Mickey Rourke in which he had been charged with beating his wife, actress-model Carre Otis. </P>
<P> Rourke, an occasional amateur boxer, faced a single count of misdemeanor spousal abuse stemming from a July 18 incident at a Hollywood publicist's office. </P>
<P> He was alleged to have slapped Otis, knocked her down and then kicked her. </P>
<P> But when Otis failed to show up in court Monday for the start of Rourke's trial, Deputy City Attorney William Sterling told Municipal Court Judge Robert Sandoval that prosecutors were ``unable to proceed.'' </P>
<P> Otis had originally cooperated with investigators, but Sterling said they had been unable to contact her in recent weeks. Rourke's attorney, David Wood, said the two probably decided to settle the matter out of court. </P>
<P> ``Apparently these two wonderful people have been able to work things out between them without it becoming a public spectacle,'' he said. </P>
<P> If he had been convicted, Rourke could have faced up to a year in jail. </P>
<P> Rourke has starred in such films as ``Angel Heart,'' ''Diner,'' ``9 3/8 Weeks'' and the ``Pope of Greenwich Village.'' Otis co-starred with him in ``Wild Orchid.'' </P>
