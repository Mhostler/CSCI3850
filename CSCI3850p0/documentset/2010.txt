<P>  U.S. forces flying to the Gulf to bolster Kuwait's defenses against a new threat from Iraq have been relying heavily on the mid-Atlantic Azores islands as a refueling point, a U.S. official said Friday. </P>
<P> He said the U.S. Air Force had stationed a fleet of tanker aircraft at Lajes air base on Terceira island, 800 miles west of the Portuguese mainland and 2,100 miles east of New York, to refuel military planes in the air. </P>
<P> Other aircraft were actually landing at Lajes, a Portuguese air base where the United States has stationed air force units since World War II, he added. ``It is what the military likes to call a surge. It's big,'' the official told Reuters. </P>
<P> The Portuguese news agency Lusa reported that 12 in-flight refueling planes had been stationed at Lajes since Wednesday and dozens of military transport planes and combat aircraft had landed there this week during the Gulf build-up. </P>
<P> Lajes, with its long runway and huge underground fuel storage tanks, was once a key base for anti-submarine patrols in the North Atlantic and a stepping stone for reinforcing NATO forces in Western Europe. </P>
<P> Following the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe and the end of the Cold War, it has remained strategically important as a refueling point for U.S. rapid intervention forces crossing the Atlantic. </P>
<P> ``You can pretty much assume that anything that happens to Africa or farther to the east will at least partially involve Lajes,'' the U.S. official said. </P>
<P> The air base was a vital refueling post before and during the 1991 Gulf War, when U.S.-led forces drove the Iraqi army out of Iraq. It was also used during the U.S. intervention in Somalia as part of the United Nations' failed peacekeeping effort there last year. </P>
