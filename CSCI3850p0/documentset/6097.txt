<P>  Croatian anti-fascist activists commemorating the end of World War II said Thursday that the victims of 50 years ago must not become a cause for fresh hatred and suffering in the Balkans. </P>
<P> ``Second World War concentration camps should remain a warning and their victims should not become a cause for fresh divisions among people and the source of new hatred,'' said Ivan Fumic, president of Croatia's Anti-Fascist Alliance. </P>
<P> Fumic said the barbaric impact of World War II in the Balkans should give pause to combatants in ethnic conflicts plaguing the region today. </P>
<P> He spoke at a ceremony in Zagreb's main art gallery, one of dozens in Europe this spring marking the end of World War II and the fall of Nazi Germany and puppet regimes in Europe, including the fascist Ustasha in Croatia which murdered tens of thousands of minority Serbs and Jews. </P>
<P> Croatian Jews last weekend observed the 50th anniversary of the liberation of the Ustasha's Jasenovac death camp where most of their forebears as well as Serbs, Gypsies and Croatian opposition fighters were executed. </P>
<P> Fumic said the reappearance of concentration camps in ethnic wars that broke out in old Yugoslavia in 1991-92 showed its peoples had not learned the lessons of World War II. </P>
<P> War crimes investigators say many thousands of Muslims and Croats were interned in camps set up by Bosnian Serbs as they overran much of Bosnia in 1992. The camps were later shut down and their inmates expelled or fled abroad. </P>
<P> Croatian state radio referred to Thursday as the ``day for 6 million victims of the (Nazi) Holocaust marked all over the world.'' Six million Jews were killed in the war. </P>
<P> Croatia's 1941-45 collaboration with the Nazis became a political tool for Yugoslav Communists who restrained Croatian nationalism inside the Balkan federation for decades after. </P>
<P> When a newly elected nationalist government in Zagreb declared Croatia's independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, minority Serbs, backed by nationalists in Belgrade, cited the Ustasha past, revolted and seized part of the country which they still hold. </P>
<P> Jews, Serbs and Western human rights groups have accused contemporary Croatia of minimizing Ustasha crimes and even rehabilitating some of its symbols. </P>
