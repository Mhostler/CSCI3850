<DATELINE>WINDHOEK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Namibia's ruling SWAPO party won the country's first post-independence elections with an increased majority, the head of the electoral commission said on Tuesday. </P>
<P> Judge Johan Strydom said on television that President Sam Nujoma's SWAPO won 53 of the 72 seats in parliament, 11 more than it had in the previous house. </P>
<P> He said the main opposition Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA) had won 15 seats, six less than before. The other seats were shared among minor parties. </P>
<P> The judge announced the election outcome despite having reported Monday that voting in four northern constituencies was being investigated because of possible irregularities. </P>
<P> Strydom said Tuesday his commission members felt they owed it to the Namibian public to announce the election result without waiting for the outcome of the inquiry. </P>
<P> The DTA applied in vain earlier Tuesday for a court order preventing the announcement of further election results pending an inquiry into voting in all constituencies. </P>
<P> Namibia is divided into 95 constituencies, from which 72 members of parliament are elected. </P>
