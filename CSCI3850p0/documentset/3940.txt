<P> The last person I want to introduce is Jack Lucas from Hattiesburg, Mississippi. Jack, would you stand up? </P>
<P> Fifty years ago in the sands of Iwo Jima, Jack Lucas taught and learned the lessons of citizenship. On February 20, 1945, he and three of his buddies encountered the enemy and two grenades at their feet. Jack Lucas threw himself on both of them. In that moment he saved the lives of his companions and miraculously in the next instant a medic saved his life. He gained a foothold for freedom, and at the age of 17, just a year older than his grandson, who is up there with him today, and his son, who is a West Point graduate and a veteran. At 17 Jack Lucas became the youngest Marine in history and the youngest soldier in this century to win the Congressional Medal of Honor. </P>
<P> All these years later, yesterday, here is what he said about that day. ``Didn't matter where you were from or who you were, you relied on one another. You did it for your country.'' We all gain when we give and we reap what we sow. That's at the heart of this New Covenant, responsibility, opportunity and citizenship, more than stale chapters in some remote civics book, they are still the virtue by which we can fulfill ourselves and reach our God-given potential and be like them, and also to fulfill the eternal promise of this country, the enduring dream from that first and most sacred covenant. I believe every person in this country still believes that we are created equal, and given by our Creator the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. </P>
<P> This is a very, very great country and our best days are still to come. </P>
<P> Thank you and God bless you all. </P>
