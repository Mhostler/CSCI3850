<P>  The United States and North Korea, setting aside four decades of bitter hostility, said Tuesday they were convinced a hard-won nuclear deal they shaped in Geneva would bring an era of peace to East Asia. </P>
<P> Chief negotiators for the two countries made clear that although the agreement had to be approved by their governments they were confident it would get the green light and be signed Friday as scheduled. </P>
<P> Reporting the accord at a midnight news conference, U.S. ambassador-at-large Robert Gallucci said it was ``a very positive document'' in the interests of countries in the region including South Korea and Japan and would reinforce world security. </P>
<P> U.S. officials said the accord -- a breakthrough after a month of tough negotiations -- was seen in Washington as ``a great triumph'' and that senior figures in the administration and Congress might come to Geneva for the signing ceremony. </P>
<P> Communist North Korea's First Deputy Foreign Minister Kang Sok-ju, speaking 10 hours later, said the deal ``will certainly make a significant contribution to greater peace and security in Asia and the rest of the world.'' </P>
<P> Echoing Gallucci, the affable and smiling Kang said he thought it was a good agreement and that he hoped his government would approve it. Diplomats said his phrasing left little doubt he was sure Pyongyang would say yes. </P>
<P> The accord, under which North Korea would cancel its present nuclear energy program suspected of having a secret weapons component and replace it with new safer technology, was hailed by South Korea and Japan and other key countries. </P>
<P> Only the United Nations' watchdog International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna -- charged with ensuring North Korea has not made nuclear arms -- reserved judgment, saying it preferred to see the final text. </P>
<P> Gallucci, who like Kang declined to give immediate details of the accord, said it dealt with the question of IAEA inspection of two sites near Pyongyang where there could be evidence of a nuclear weaponry effort. </P>
<P> North Korea has insisted that it has no atomic arms program -- fears of which have sent tension in the region spiralling twice over the past two years -- but has until now flatly refused to open the sites. </P>
<P> Kang said a key outcome of the negotiations, which were aimed at finalizing an outline deal reached in August, should be an end to mutual mistrust between his country and the United States -- on opposite sides in the 1950-53 Korean War. </P>
<P> The agreement would ``completely eliminate and dispel the so-called suspicion about our nuclear program,'' he declared, speaking to reporters in the courtyard of the North Korean mission in Geneva. </P>
<P> Gallucci said the ``framework accord'' also dealt with the future relationship between Pyongyang and Washington, who had already agreed to exchange representational offices once a settlement to the nuclear dispute was reached. </P>
<P> North Korean officials have made clear that they are keen for full diplomatic relations, which they see as opening the gates for large-scale Western investment to revitalize their troubled, state-run economy. </P>
<P> Under the deal, the United States will put together an international consortium including China, Russia, Germany, Japan and South Korea to finance provision of two light-water reactors to replace the North's current graphite nuclear technology. </P>
<P> Light-water reactors produce little of the plutonium Pyongyang has been accused of diverting from its present graphite reactor to make nuclear arms. </P>
<P> In itself, this operation will bring much-needed capital and advanced industrial know-how to Pyongyang, diplomats say. </P>
<P> Gallucci flew to Washington Tuesday to confer with senior administration officials and key members of congress whose support will be needed for its final implementation. </P>
<P> In South Korea, the accord was welcomed by President Kim Young-sam, who only last week had urged the Americans not to rush into a hasty deal. </P>
<P> Kim said Pyongyang had promised to resume the North-South dialogue, abruptly halted after the death in July of North Korean ``Great Leader'' Kim Il-sung -- whose son, Kim Jong-il, is expected to be confirmed in his father's main posts shortly. </P>
<P> ``A turning point has been created for South and North Korea to seek reconciliation and cooperation,'' said South Korea's Kim in a speech read to parliament by his prime minister, Lee Yung-dug. </P>
<P> In Japan, Foreign Minister Yohei Kono said Tokyo had been informed of the deal and would recommend Washington sign it. In Moscow, a foreign ministry spokesman said Russia was ready to help its implementation. </P>
