<P>  A federal judge ruled Tuesday that Paul Hill, a former minister accused of killing an abortion doctor, could not use justifiable homicide as a defense against charges he violated a law guaranteeing access to abortion clinics. </P>
<P> In making the ruling on the opening day of testimony in Hill's trial, U.S. Judge Roger Vinson said the murder of an abortion doctor does not include such legal strategies. </P>
<P> Hill said by attacking the doctor and his escort he was preventing abortions. </P>
<P> Hill, a former Presbyterian minister, has long advocated the murder of abortion providers, which he has described as justifiable homicide. </P>
<P> Hill, 40, will also go on trial in state court early next year on murder charges for the shooting deaths of Dr. John Britton, 69, of Fernandina Beach, Fla., and clinic escort James Barrett, 74, of Pensacola. </P>
<P> Both were shot outside The Ladies Center in Pensacola on July 29, in the second fatal shooting at Penscola's abortion clinics in 18 months. </P>
<P> In his federal trial, Hill is accused of violating a federal law that prohibits blocking entrances and exits to abortion clinics. The law was enacted earlier this year, and is bitterly opposed by anti-abortion activists. </P>
<P> Jurors heard testimony Tuesday from a Pensacola gun shop owner, who said he sold Hill a 12-gauge shotgun two days before the murders occurred. Also testifying was a firing range employee who said he watched Hill practice his marksmanship in the days prior to the murders. </P>
<P> If convicted of the federal charges, Hill could face up to life in prison. </P>
<P> Abortion rights activists are closely watching the Hill trial, and have demanded that the U.S. Justice Department investigate activities of strident anti-abortion protesters for indications of a possible nationwide conspiracy. </P>
