<P>  A 23-year-old American set a new record for swimming the English Channel Tuesday. </P>
<P> Chad Hunderby of California cut 23 minutes off the previous mark when he swam the 21-mile crossing from England to France in seven hours 17 minutes on his first solo Channel swim. </P>
<P> ``The English Channel is the most widely known marathon swim. It is special even for Americans,'' Hunderby told The Times. </P>
<P> ``However, I decided to take it as it came, because the Channel is a strange beast and you never quite know how the weather, water and tides will work out. I did not expect to do it, I just wanted to get across.'' </P>
<P> American Penny Lee Dean set the previous record in 1978. </P>
