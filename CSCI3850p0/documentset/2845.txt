<DATELINE>MOUNT HEBRON, West Bank (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A rabbi was killed and an Israeli policeman wounded Sunday in an attack near a Jewish settlement which Israel blamed on Islamic militants. </P>
<P> ``It is another detestable murder,'' Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin told reporters in southern Israel. ``I have no doubt the radical Islamic element, Hamas or Islamic Jihad, carried it out.'' </P>
<P> Military sources said a car driven in the occupied West Bank by Rabbi Ami Ulami, 33, head of a religious seminary in the settlement of Utniel, overturned after it was fired on. </P>
<P> It was not clear whether Ulami, found dead in the vehicle, had been killed by the gunfire or the crash. The policeman, a passenger in the car, suffered gunshot wounds. </P>
<P> Settlers said unidentified gunmen fired AK-47 rifles at the car which was headed for the settlement in the southern West Bank around midday. </P>
<P> Israel Radio said the military arm of the Muslim Hamas group, main opponent of the Israeli-PLO peace deal, claimed responsibility for the attack in a phone call to the radio. </P>
<P> Government ministers quoted army chief Ehud Barak as having told a weekly meeting of the cabinet that guerrilla attacks on Israelis were expected to increase. </P>
<P> Settler leaders charged authorities had done nothing to bolster security in the area since two Israelis were killed in a guerrilla attack earlier this year about a half mile from the site of Sunday's incident. </P>
<P> ``There are dangerous killers in this area,'' Roni Shechner, head of a regional council of settlements in the Mount Hebron area, told Israel Radio. ``But the army is thinning its forces, here, not reinforcing them.'' </P>
<P> The policeman returned fire at the attackers, the settlers said. A doctor at Jerusalem's Hadassah hospital said he was in good condition, grazed by two bullets. </P>
<P> Soldiers and secret police launched a massive manhunt for the attackers and detained a number of Arabs for questioning. </P>
<P> There were several bullet holes in the car, which lay upside down, its top crushed, by the side of the road. </P>
<P> Working in the mud near the car, ambulance attendants mopped up and collected bloody tissue to be buried with the rabbi's body. A group of settlers, some of them crying, prayed next to the ambulance that held the body. </P>
