<P>  The United States plans to nearly double the number of its warplanes stationed in the Gulf, with U.S. planes to be based in Kuwait for the first time, the Washington Post reported in its Friday editions. </P>
<P> The newspaper quoted Pentagon officials as saying the planned increase in air power would help the Clinton Administration enforce its warning to Iraq to stay away from Kuwait. </P>
<P> President Clinton is due to visit U.S. troops in Kuwait Friday. </P>
<P> Pentagon officials told the paper a squadron of 24 U.S. A-10 ``Warthog'' attack jets, which specialize in destroying other jets, would be stationed indefinitely in Kuwait. </P>
<P> Defense Secretary William Perry earlier this week indicated that Washington would station some planes in Kuwait, but this is the first time any details of that arrangement have emerged. </P>
<P> He said it would be necessary to increase U.S. forces in the region to enforce the United States' recent warning to Iraq to keep its ground forces out of a so-called exclusion zone south of the 32nd Parallel, which has already been declared a ''no-fly'' zone. </P>
<P> The newspaper quoted defense officials as saying the total number of U.S. aircraft stationed for long-term duty in the area would rise to 130 from around 70 now. </P>
<P> They said the administration hoped to have prepositioned enough equipment in the area to supply three armored brigades, one in Saudi Arabia, one in Kuwait and one in Qatar, the newspaper reported. </P>
<P> No comment was immediately available from the Pentagon. </P>
