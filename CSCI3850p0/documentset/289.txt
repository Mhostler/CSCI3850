<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  At least 26 people were killed and 127 injured Monday when an explosion ripped through the headquarters of Argentina's main Jewish organization, nearly leveling the seven-story building. </P>
<P> Deputy Interior Minister Alberto Iribarne told a news conference that no group had claimed responsibility for the attack and it was unclear whether it had been caused by a car bomb or other explosive device. </P>
<P> President Carlos Menem said late Monday that an Iraqi man had been detained in northern Argentina in connection with the blast. </P>
<P> ``Just moments ago, an Iraqi citizen was detained at Paso de los Libres. He had no documents except for an expired Brazilian passport,'' Menem told a television interviewer, adding that Israeli and Spanish secret agents would help investigate the blast. </P>
<P> ``There's no reason for this. These monsters don't deserve to live in a community like ours,'' Menem told the Telefe television channel. </P>
<P> Argentina sealed its borders earlier Monday to try to stop possible bombers from fleeing the country and in New York, the World Jewish Congress called on all Jewish organizations to take immediate security precautions. </P>
<P> Ealier, Iribarne said a German and an Iranian had been detained at Ezeiza international airport outside Buenos Aires, but Argentine television said a German woman was later released. </P>
<P> Israeli Ambassador Yitzhak Aviran blamed Islamic fundamentalists, but named no group. </P>
<P> ``Knowing the political map, this can only come from these fundamentalist groups ... It's a very hard blow for Argentina,'' he said, adding that Argentina's Jewish community had been targeted because of its size and because of Argentina's close links with Israel. </P>
<P> There are between 250,000 and 300,000 Jews in Argentina, the biggest Jewish community in Latin America. </P>
<P> President Clinton called the attack ``cowardly'' and vowed the United States would redouble its efforts to bring peace to the Middle East and elsewhere. </P>
<P> ``This terrible loss of innocent life must not deter civilised society from opposing the enemies of peace,'' Clinton said in a written statement. </P>
<P> A group calling itself Islamic Command called a local radio station to take responsibility, but officials said nothing was known about such a group and the call could have been a hoax. </P>
<P> Thirty people were killed two years ago in a bomb attack by suspected Muslim fundamentalists on the Israeli Embassy here. </P>
<P> Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin described the explosion as the work of ``satanic terror.'' </P>
<P> ``Satanic terror has once again hit a civilian target -- this time the offices of the Jewish community in Buenos Aires, which has yet to recover from the deadly terrorist attack on the Israeli Embassy,'' he said in a statement. </P>
<P> He called the explosion a ``cowardly, evil and heinous'' act. ``Israel will continue to hunt down the perpetrators of terror until their annihilation,'' he said. </P>
<P> The blast coincided with the start of peace talks between Israel and Jordan on their desert border. </P>
<P> Menem later Monday telephoned Rabin to express his sadness, and Israel said it would send an air force plane to Buenos Aires with rescue workers, dogs trained to find people trapped under rubble and medical supplies. </P>
<P> As night fell in Buenos Aires, rescue workers brought in high-powered lights to continue digging through the pile of rubble, all that was left of the DAIA Jewish center. </P>
<P> A child and a young man were brought out of the ruins alive more than eight hours after the blast, which struck just before 10 a.m. </P>
<P> In the evening, as rescue attempts continued, eight workers were injured when huge pieces of wall crashed onto them while they searched for victims. </P>
<P> The search was temporarily held up as workers turned their attention to the eight injured men, some of whom were buried in the new pile of rubble, witnesses said. </P>
<P> Earlier, there was chaos as hundreds of volunteers helped rescue workers sift through the rubble and bring out blood-soaked victims. </P>
<P> ``These animals should be hanged,'' an elderly woman screamed at a police officer who was cordoning off the area. </P>
<P> ``They always slaughter the innocent. Why should we show any mercy for such horror?'' she cried. </P>
<P> An estimated 100 people were inside the building at the time of the blast, Jewish groups said. It was not known how many were still trapped. </P>
