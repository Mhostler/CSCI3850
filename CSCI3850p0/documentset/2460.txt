<DATELINE>SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Muslim-led Bosnian army and its Croat allies, pressing on with increasingly bold offensives against rebel Serbs, launched a blistering bombardment near the central town of Kupres on Monday. </P>
<P> Muslim and Croat guns pounded Serb army units blocking a push by government forces toward the town of Donji Vakuf. </P>
<P> A Reuter correspondent at the scene said they hit the Serbs with up to 400 shells in 90 minutes north of Kupres, which Muslim troops captured from the Bosnian Serb army last week under cover of Croat artillery. </P>
<P> Correspondent Kurt Schork said Muslim and Croat forces opened up with howitzers, mortars, tanks and multiple rocket launchers in the attack three miles north of Kupres. </P>
<P> Serb units were defending access to Donji Vakuf, which United Nations peacekeepers expected to be one of the next targets for government troops waging an autumn offensive in northwest and central Bosnia and around Sarajevo. </P>
<P> Serb military sources confirmed Monday that government forces had launched an all-out offensive on Donji Vakuf and said their probable objective was to take Jajce to the north. </P>
<P> The Kupres offensive came as government forces were reported to have taken ground from the Serbs north of Sarajevo. </P>
<P> Serb forces have threatened to remove heavy weapons from U.N. control and deploy them against the Muslims unless they stop their offensives around the capital. </P>
<P> The U.N. special envoy to former Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi, said the Muslim offensive might change the military balance in the region and persuade the Bosnian Serbs to reconsider their rejection of a peace plan proposed by an international contact group. </P>
<P> Akashi met with U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali on Monday to discuss the U.N. response to the recent escalation of the conflict. </P>
<P> ``At the moment, as you know, the Bosnian Serb attitude is 'no' to the contact group (peace) proposal,'' Akashi told Reuters Television. ``But with the change of situation, they may become more amenable to talking with the contact group.'' </P>
<P> The Serbs have repeatedly rejected the plan, which would leave them with 49 percent of Bosnian territory instead of the 70 percent they now control. </P>
<P> Boutros-Ghali said the officials had discussed the United Nations' various options if the fighting continued to escalate -- including the possible withdrawal of the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) from Bosnia. </P>
<P> ``We are entering the winter and we face a very grave situation,'' Boutros-Ghali told reporters. </P>
<P> Better armed and more tactically effective than ever in 31 months of war, the Bosnians have attacked on several fronts, tying down Serb forces which are short of men and fuel. </P>
<P> The Muslims took large amounts of ground in a surprise breakout from the Bihac pocket in the northwest, captured the central Bosnian town of Kupres and are pressing the Serbs around the town of Trnovo, which lies south of Sarajevo. </P>
<P> The United States on Monday denied it was supplying arms to the government side. </P>
<P> State Department spokeswoman Christine Shelly said there was an ``indication of some increased arms flow'' to Muslim forces, in violation of a U.N. weapons embargo on ex-Yugoslavia. </P>
<P> But she added: ``We're certainly not contributing to it and we certainly are not turning a blind eye.'' </P>
