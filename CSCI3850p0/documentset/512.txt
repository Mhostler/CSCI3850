<P>  Haiti's de facto president slammed the international community Monday, accusing foreign governments of ganging up on the Caribbean nation and looking to start a war. </P>
<P> ``The whole world has declared war on Haiti,'' military-backed provisional President Emile Jonassaint said in a speech broadcast on state television. </P>
<P> The announcement came just hours after the U.N. Security Council voted 12-0 to approve a resolution allowing the United States to invade Haiti, should it choose, to remove the country's military leaders who took power in a September 1991 coup. </P>
<P> President Clinton has refused to rule out military action to oust the coup leaders but officials have repeatedly said an invasion is not ``imminent.'' </P>
<P> The 81-year-old Jonassaint, in an early morning address to the Caribbean nation, blasted ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and said he could not believe the international community was treating Haiti in such a way. </P>
<P> There was no official response to the U.N. vote from Haiti's ruling military, but Jonassaint and members of his government met with commander-in-chief Lieutenant General Raoul Cedras before the de facto president gave his address. </P>
