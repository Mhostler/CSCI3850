<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Republicans marked the one-year anniversary of President Clinton's health plan Wednesday by savoring its defeat, and promising they would work for their version of acceptable reforms next year. </P>
<P> Clinton's universal coverage goals gave way months ago to less sweeping initiatives in Congress. Now, most lawmakers believe it is virtually impossible for Congress to pass even a minor insurance market reform bill before adjourning in early October. </P>
<P> At a rally outside the Capitol for Republican senatorial candidates, a revved-up Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas vowed that if Republicans gained control of the Senate after the November elections, they would introduce market-based health reforms next year. </P>
<P> Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, a Maine Democrat, consulted with his colleagues Wednesday about prospects of passing a compromise bill drafted by a bipartisan group known as the ``Mainstream Coalition.'' But Mitchell himself is still negotiating with the mainstream and has not yet resolved some key differences. </P>
<P> Mitchell is reluctant to abandon all efforts at health care reform this year, but admitted this week that his task is formidable. </P>
<P> In a letter to Republican leaders and candidates, party Chairman Haley Barbour noted that Thursday is the one-year anniversary of Clinton's national address outlining his health program. </P>
<P> ``The verdict is in,'' Barbour wrote. ``Health care reform is just about dead for this session of Congress.'' </P>
<P> He said the public rejected the plan because it was bad policy, not because of politics and public relations. </P>
<P> ``The Clintons failed to recognize that rejection of their plan was based on the policy, not public relations,'' he said, adding that voters spurned the plan because it was a ''government-run health care system.'' </P>
<P> The House has not attempted any progress on health care for weeks, letting the process play out in the Senate. </P>
<P> Speaker Thomas Foley, a Washington state Democrat, said the House was waiting to see if Mitchell could broker an agreement but added that it was doubtful that he would succeed. </P>
<P> ``I'm not at all sure that is going to happen. Obviously, if legislation can't be enacted in the Senate, it can't be enacted,'' Foley said. </P>
