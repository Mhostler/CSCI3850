<P>  Russia has received CIS approval to keep its peacekeeping troops in Tajikistan and on the Tajik-Afghan border well into 1995, a Russian foreign ministry spokesman said Tuesday. </P>
<P> Grigori Karasin told a news conference that the decision, taken at a summit meeting of former Soviet republics last week, was designed to promote stability in Tajikistan, a conflict-torn Central Asian republic. </P>
<P> Karasin said that following a request by Tajik head of state Imamali Rakhmonov, troops had approval to stay in Tajikistan until June 30 next year under the auspices of the Commonwealth of Independent States. </P>
<P> Russia has complained more than once that other post-Soviet states have failed to send soldiers to the troubled country, as was agreed in early 1993. Most peacekeeping forces in Tajikistan are Russian. </P>
<P> A deal was also signed under which guards will remain on the Tajik-Afghan border at least until the end of 1995, Karasin said. The original agreement had envisaged troops being sent from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan, he said. </P>
<P> Fighters for Islamist and liberal opposition groups have been waging a guerrilla war from Afghanistan since they fled there after losing a bloody clan war in 1992 to the country's ex-communist rulers. </P>
<P> The government and the rebels began a cease-fire on Oct. 20 to last until Nov. 6, when presidential elections and a constitutional referendum are due to take place. </P>
