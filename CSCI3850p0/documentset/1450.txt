<P>  Deposed First Lady Susana Higuchi on Saturday night claimed Peru's intelligence service plotted to kidnap her three weeks ago and now has her under surveillance. </P>
<P> Higuchi, who plans to run against her husband, President Alberto Fujimori, in next April's election, said National Intelligence Service (SIN) agents tried to take her to a former guerrilla safe house to ``disappear'' her. </P>
<P> A call on her cellular phone to a journalist saved her, she said in a television interview. </P>
<P> She said she was on the way to a friend's house when the her driver, assigned to her by the government, started going in the wrong direction. </P>
<P> ``It looks like the intention was to take me to an MRTA safe house and stick me in the basement, cover it with cement and good bye Susana,'' she told the program Fuego Cruzado. </P>
<P> Higuchi, who has pubicly feuded with her husband for six weeks, also sharply criticized Fujimori's chief adviser on intelligence matters, Vladimiro Montesinos, who she said tainted by past links to drug-traffickers. </P>
<P> ``I didn't have a good feeling about him from the start,'' she said. ``Morally, he is not a positive man.'' </P>
<P> In a wide-ranging interview, Higuchi said her husband's government was as corrupt as past regimes. </P>
<P> She said her political movement, Harmony 21st Century, was working against time to raise the 100,000 signatures necessary to register October 9 for the elections. </P>
<P> There are other problems. An electoral law passed in July bars presidential family members from running for president, vice president or Congress. </P>
<P> She said she will appeal the electoral law to the National Elections Jury, adding an ``international scandal'' would erupt if she is rejected. </P>
<P> Higuchi denied ``conjugal discord'' is behind the feud with her husband, claiming it stems from ``differences over principles and values.'' </P>
<P> In a break from past conciliatory statements, she said she now had no interest in speaking with her husband until after second-round voting next year. Under Peruvian law, if a candidate does not get better than 50 percent of the popular vote April 9, a run-off round is held. </P>
<P> Higuchi said she was still ``cooking up'' a ticket and that her government would be similar to Fujimori's. ``It would be Fujimorismo without Montesinos.'' </P>
<P> ``You can't say I'm against Alberto Fujimori,'' she said. ''I'm against his circle of advisors. It is a corrupt circle.'' </P>
<P> Higuchi, a 44-year-old civil engineer, prompted the public falling out with Fujimori when she openly protested the electoral law. </P>
<P> She moved out of Government Palace, criticized Fujimori's rule, praised his likely opponent -- former U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar -- and accused officials of corruption. In response, Fujimori stripped her of official duties, called her ``unstable'' in a television address and welded shut the doors to her palace offices. </P>
<P> She filed a ``psychological violence'' complaint against him September 2; Monday she announced the formation of Harmony 21st Century and declared herself a candidate and Wednesday her complaint was dismissed. </P>
