<P>  A man whose wife and two children died in a car crash is to receive an official apology after the dead woman was sent a bill for repairs to a road barrier damaged in the fatal accident. </P>
<P> Britain's transport minister, Brian Mawhinney, has also demanded a report on the case, a spokesman for the Highways Agency responsible for the letter said Sunday. </P>
<P> The spokesman said letters demanding payment for damage were normal practice for the agency, but it had been a mistake to send one to someone who had died in a crash. </P>
<P> Banker Ian Wace, 31, received the letter days after last month's inquest into the crash which killed his wife Joanne, 34, and his children, Guy, four, and 11-month-old Alicia. </P>
<P> Wace, who three months ago watched in the mirror as his wife crashed as he drove ahead of them, told the agency saying he had no intention of paying. </P>
<P> ``The Highways Agency chief executive, Lawrie Haynes, has written to the husband to apologize,'' the spokesman said. </P>
