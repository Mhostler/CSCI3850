<P>  Lebanon is seeking an international investigation into the deaths of prisoners in an Israeli-controlled jail in south Lebanon, the official National News Agency said Wednesday. </P>
<P> It is part of a diplomatic campaign launched by the foreign ministry to make Israel ``stop its savage acts against Lebanese detainees and respect human rights,'' the news agency said. </P>
<P> It said the ministry was seeking the release of hundreds of Lebanese prisoners held by Israel, compensation for them under international law and visits to them while in jail by the Red Cross and other agencies. </P>
<P> All Lebanese embassies have been ordered to urge the governments to whom they are accredited to make ``intensive contacts with Israel and international institutions'' on these issues. </P>
<P> Embassies have been told to urge ``investigations authorized by international agreements on matters related to the deaths of prisoners in jail, especially since many are held for years illegally, without trial or legal defense, contrary to the Geneva Convention on prisoners,'' the agency said. </P>
<P> Israel and its client militia, the South Lebanon Army (SLA), hold 260 prisoners in a hilltop jail at Khiam in Israel's south Lebanon occupation zone, which has never been visited by outside agencies, and about 60 in Israel. </P>
<P> Some 14 Khiam prisoners have died since 1985 and others are in danger of death through torture and medical neglect, according to a Beirut-based prisoners' support group. Some prisoners have been held for 10 years without trial, it says. </P>
<P> Mohammed Safa, head of the group, handed the ministry a report Tuesday saying that according to 32 prisoners recently released from Khiam some inmates have ``lifetime disabilities'' as a result of their treatment. </P>
<P> Fifteen of the 32 had to go to hospitals after their release, the report added. </P>
<P> Safa told Reuters he welcomed the diplomatic campaign, but he said Israel's treatment of the prisoners should be raised at the International Court of Justice at The Hague and Lebanon should complain about it to the U.N. Security Council. </P>
