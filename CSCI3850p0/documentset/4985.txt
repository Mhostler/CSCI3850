<P>  Marianne Gingrich, wife of House Speaker Newt Gingrich, is among several congressional wives who want a review of House ethics standards that concern their own employment, the Atlanta Constitution reported Friday. </P>
<P> Among the proposals the women want considered is a measure that would allow them to serve on their husbands' payrolls. The newspaper said their request, submitted Thursday to House Ethics Committee Chairwoman Nancy Johnson, R-Conn, was prompted by the frustration some women experience when they move to Washington and discover a city full of employers worried about conflicts of interest. </P>
<P> Marianne Gingrich has been criticized for taking a job recruiting U.S. companies for tax-free zones in Israel even though the ethics panel has approved her position. </P>
<P> On the same day that the women's request was submitted to Johnson's panel, lawyers for Newt Gingrich said in response to House ethics complaints that the speaker's $4.5 million book contract with a company owned by Rupert Murdoch was proper and did not violate congressional ethics rules. HarperCollins won the right to publish Gingrich's book about his political philosophy, ``To Renew America,'' last December in an auction with other publishing companies. </P>
<P> Democrats have filed a complaint with the House Ethics Committee alleging that Gingrich's deal violated rules limiting outside income. They also charge that Gingrich, a Georgia Republican, was improperly influenced by Murdoch in return for the contract. </P>
