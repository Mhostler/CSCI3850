<P>  Former California State Sen. Paul Carpenter was extradited from Costa Rica Friday to face sentencing on a corruption conviction in his home state. </P>
<P> Costa Rican authorities delivered Carpenter, 66, to U.S. law enforcement officials after Costa Rica's Supreme Court rejected a last-minute appeal filed by his lawyers, court spokewoman Maria Isabel Hernandez said. </P>
<P> Carpenter had been hospitalized for treatment for prostate cancer, his lawyer Bernardo Soto said. </P>
<P> ``Apparently his doctors determined that he was well enough to travel,'' said Hernandez. ``They took him out of the hospital and took him away.'' </P>
<P> He was taken from San Juan de Dios Hospital directly to Juan Santamaria International Airport, turned over to U.S. Marshals and placed aboard a flight for Miami, said airport immigration department chief Jose Luis Solano. </P>
<P> According to court records, Carpenter was convicted last December on charges of conspiracy to launder money, mail fraud and obstruction of justice for illegally funneling funds from his re-election campaign to that of fellow, now former, State Sen. Alan Robbins. </P>
<P> Carpenter fled in February before sentencing, and blended into the local U.S. expatriate community until his arrest at the request of the U.S. Embassy in April. </P>
<P> Carpenter claimed his innocence, saying he fled because he suffers from terminal prostate cancer and did not want to die in prison while he appealed his sentence. </P>
<P> In a jailhouse interview, Carpenter said he came to Costa Rica because of the absence of an extradition treaty between the two countries. </P>
<P> ``The case against me was completely political, made by an ambitious U.S. attorney who wants to advance his career,'' he said. </P>
