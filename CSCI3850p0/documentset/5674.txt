<P>  The players who carried Vancouver all the way to the Stanley Cup Finals last year returned to 1994 form Tuesday to lead the Canucks to a convincing victory. </P>
<P> Kirk McLean stopped 25 shots to record his first shutout of the season and ``Russian Rocket'' Pavel Bure scored three goals for his sixth career hat trick in a 5-0 thumping of the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. </P>
<P> McLean made 22 saves in the first two periods en route to his 17th career shutout and Russ Courtnall, who was acquired from Dallas Friday for Greg Adams, had three assists for the Canucks, who reached the .500 mark (14-14-9). </P>
<P> ``It's an easy game to get points in when all you do is just pass it to Bure,'' said Courtnall. </P>
<P> ``Bure finally looked comfortable -- maybe he's back in the groove,'' said Vancouver coach Rick Ley of the Russian sniper who led the NHL with 60 goals last season. </P>
<P> Bure picked up his 14th, 15th and 16th goals Tuesday. </P>
<P> Sergio Momesso and Roman Oksiuta also scored for the Canucks, who are 5-1-1 in their last seven games. </P>
<P> Guy Hebert made 32 saves for the Ducks, who have dropped 10 of their last 11 road games. </P>
<P> In Dallas, Steve Yzerman set up a pair of scores during a four-goal second-period outburst and Chris Osgood made 24 saves to lift the Detroit Red Wings to a 4-1 victory over the Stars that ran their unbeaten streak to nine games. </P>
<P> The red-hot Red Wings are 14-1-2 in their last 17 games, 8-0-1 in the last nine. </P>
<P> Greg Adams, who was acquired from the Vancouver Canucks last Friday, scored his first goal in a Dallas uniform 22 seconds into the third period to foil Osgood's shutout bid. </P>
<P> In Pittsburgh, Jaromir Jagr had a hand in all three Penguins goals with a goal and two assists to lead his team to a 3-1 victory over the Washington Capitals. </P>
<P> Wendell Young made 29 saves for the Pens but lost his bid for Pittsburgh's first shutout of the season when Peter Bondra scored his 23rd goal midway through the final period. </P>
<P> Jagr scored his 27th of the season 6:01 into the second period when he came from behind the net and flipped the puck off Washington goalie Jim Carey's shoulder and into the net. </P>
<P> Luc Robitaille made it 2-0 in the final minute of the second period and Kevin Stevens completed the scoring just 42 seconds after Bondra's goal. </P>
<P> At Tampa Bay, J.C. Bergeron made 29 saves and Rob Zamuner scored a pair of goals in the second period to lead the Lightning to a 5-2 victory over the New York Islanders. </P>
<P> Bergeron, who blanked Hartford Sunday, had his shutout streak ended at 116 minutes, 20 seconds when Zigmund Palffy scored on a breakaway 6:38 into the third to make it 4-1. </P>
<P> Roman Hamrlik had a pair of assists for the Lightning, who moved into a 10th-place tie with the New York Rangers and Florida Panthers, two points out of the final Eastern Conference playoff spot. </P>
<P> In St Louis, Brendan Shanahan, Greg Gilbert and Glenn Anderson scored in the final two minutes and 12 seconds to rally the Blues to a 7-5 victory over the Winnipeg Jets. </P>
<P> Shanahan scored his 15th goal on a powerplay to tie the score at 5-5 and Gilbert gave the Blues the lead just 13 seconds later. Anderson sealed the victory with his second goal of the game, an empty netter with 44 seconds left. </P>
<P> The Jets trailed 4-2 before storming back to take a 5-4 lead. </P>
<P> Randy Gilhen scored with 3:06 left in the second period to cut the deficit to one, Alexei Zhamnov tied the game at 4-4 on his 26th goal just 49 seconds into the third period and Mike Eastwood's first goal as a Jet gave Winnipeg a short-lived 5-4 advantage. </P>
