<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  An explosion at a refinery south of Los Angeles injured four employees critically and at least 14 others who were working at the plant suffered less serious burn and smoke inhalation injuries, Mobil Corp. said Thursday. </P>
<P> The blast was caused when liquid petroleum gas at Mobil's Torrance, Calif. plant leaked from a broken pipeline valve and ignited Wednesday afternoon. </P>
<P> Mobil said approximately 20 injuries resulted, but there were other reports that six additional workers had walked into local hospitals with minor injuries. </P>
<P> Fire department officials said the leak was relatively minor but caused so many injuries because of a concentration of workers near the line. The line had been down for repairs and was being put back into operation at the time of the blast. </P>
<P> ``As far as I know it was only a moderate problem but because of the number of people in the area, it caused a lot of injuries,'' said Rick Bongard, battalion chief at the Torrance Fire Department. </P>
<P> Bongard said there have been bigger explosions at area refineries in recent years, but that the number of injuries in Wednesday's blast was the largest he recalled. </P>
<P> The blast occurred shortly after 3 p.m. PDT (6 p.m. EDT) and caused a three-alarm fire, which was brought under control within half an hour, Mobil said. </P>
<P> Mobil said the site of the blast was secure and that there was no toxic release or other impact to the area surrounding the refinery. </P>
<P> There is an ongoing investigation to determine the precise cause of the blast and the extent of damage to the refinery. </P>
<P> The plant's alkylation unit which is involved in the production of gasoline was closed because of the damage to the connecting pipeline, but Mobil said there was no damage to the unit itself. No other parts of the refinery were shut as a result of the blast. </P>
<P> A Mobil spokeswoman said Wednesday evening the closure of the alkylation unit might reduce the plant's gasoline production, but that no significant drop was expected. </P>
