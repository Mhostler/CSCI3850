<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A 20-year-old illegal immigrant on a $100,000 scholarship to the University of Chicago won the right to stay in the United States on Thursday after a hearing in Immigration Court. </P>
<P> Instead of being deported, Rafael Ibarra, a former San Diego high school valedictorian, will return to classes on Friday and continue studies toward a medical career. </P>
<P> ``To tell you the truth, I feel like crying,'' Ibarra said after the hearing. </P>
<P> The Immigration and Naturalization Service said it will not appeal the decision, which means Ibarra can now apply for U.S. citizenship. </P>
<P> Ibarra's bid and the judge's decision came against a background of increasing resentment against illegal immigrants throughout California. </P>
<P> Proposition 187 on the November ballot, which seeks to deny public services to illegal immigrants, including education, is receiving growing support. </P>
<P> In announcing his decision to grant Ibarra's application to suspend deportation, Immigration Judge Kenneth Bagley said, ''This is not the case of a young man living on the fringes of society by taking more from the system than he gave back.'' </P>
<P> Bagley called the student ``a contributing member of the community,'' and said his contributions ``outweigh anything he may have taken from the United States at this point.'' </P>
<P> A recent Los Angeles Times poll showed that 62 percent of likely voters favor Proposition 187, which would also deny illegal immigrants welfare and non-emergency medical aid, while only 29 percent oppose it. </P>
<P> ``I never wished to be dependent on government subsidies,'' Ibarra said. In 14 years here, he said he and his mother never tried to collect welfare or other benefits, even though at one point they were homeless and had to live in a car. </P>
<P> The only benefit he got was a public education, he said. </P>
<P> Ibarra's mother smuggled him from Mexico in 1980, a year after she had come to the San Diego area to marry an American, who later abandoned them. Ibarra said he tried to apply for legal residency in 1988, but was turned away by INS officials. </P>
<P> When university officials asked him to clarify his status after receiving his scholarship, he decided in June of last year to turn himself in. </P>
<P> During the hearing, Bagley said Ibarra had demonstrated ''good moral character'' and to return him to Mexico would constitute hardship since he no longer has relatives there. </P>
