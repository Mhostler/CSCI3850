<P>  The Security Council, for the second time in three days, expressed concern Tuesday over continued fighting around the U.N.-designated safe area of Bihac and demanded all parties cooperate with Secretary -General Boutros Boutros-Ghali during his Bosnia visit. </P>
<P> In a statement designed to support the secretary-general due in Sarajevo Wednesday, the council said all parties should cooperate fully with his efforts ``to stabilize the situation in and around the safe area of Bihac'' and throughout Bosnia. </P>
<P> Boutros-Ghali will attempt to move the Bosnian Serbs toward a cease-fire around Bihac and throughout the country. He is also expected to present combatants with conditions for maintaining U.N. peacekeeping forces in Bosnia. </P>
<P> The council statement also welcomed the acceptance of the Bosnian government for a cease-fire and called on Bosnian Serbs to accept it also. </P>
<P> Bosnia's ambassador Muhamed Sacirbey said the dire situation in his country ``was not reflected by statements coming out of the Security Council.'' </P>
<P> He also drew attention to a resolution proposed by non-aligned countries that would plug a loophole in fuel going from Serbia to Croatian Serbs in the Krajina, and then presumably returning to Serb forces in Bosnia. </P>
<P> He blamed Russia, Britain and France for delaying this resolution, saying it was an implicit effort on their part to provide fuel to the Serbs. </P>
<P> But diplomats from these countries said the council, including the United States, had set up a working group to check language on the resolution, which was complicated because of a sanctions regime already in place. </P>
<P> They said it would probably be adopted later in the week. </P>
