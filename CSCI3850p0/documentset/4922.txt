<P>  Israeli officials said Tuesday they were checking whether the authors of a new book praising a Jewish settler who massacred 29 Palestinian worshipers in a Hebron mosque last year violated Israeli law. </P>
<P> Settlers sold the book lauding Baruch Goldstein, titled ``Baruch the Man,'' on street corners throughout Israel Tuesday. Israel Television said the 400 copies printed had already sold out. </P>
<P> ``The ability of people to depict a man who murdered worshipers in the holiest site, to depict him as anything other than a murderer and a criminal..., I think this is very severe and requires our investigation,'' Justice Minister David Libai told Israel Television. </P>
<P> Goldstein, a Brooklyn-born resident of the Kiryat Arba settlement near Hebron, sprayed kneeling Arabs with gunfire a year ago before survivors beat him to death. </P>
