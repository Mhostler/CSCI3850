<P>  Jordan's King Hussein telephoned Yasser Arafat Sunday to discuss a visit by the PLO leader to Jordan ``very soon,'' Arafat's press adviser said. </P>
<P> The conversation, described by press aide Nabil Abu Rudeineh as ``brotherly and friendly,'' was seen as an indication of a warming in relations between the two, who have quarreled over claims to Jerusalem's Muslim holy sites. </P>
<P> ``They discussed a visit by Arafat to Jordan very soon,'' Abu Rudeineh said. He gave no date. </P>
<P> Palestinians were angered by the October Jordanian-Israeli peace treaty, which recognized Amman's responsibility for sites including al-Aqsa and Dome of the Rock mosques, Islam's holiest shrines after Mecca and Medina. </P>
<P> Jordan's clarification in November that it would hand control of Jerusalem's Islamic sites to Palestinians once they completed peace talks with Israel on the final status of the city helped ease months of tension over the claims. </P>
<P> Palestinians see Arab East Jerusalem, captured by Israel from Jordan in 1967, as the capital of a future state. Israel maintains Jerusalem will remain its undivided capital forever. </P>
