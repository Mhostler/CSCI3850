<P>  The U.N. refugee agency said Thursday it would resume relief flights Friday to the Bosnian capital Sarajevo, suspended for two weeks after planes came under fire at the airport. </P>
<P> Ron Redmond, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), told Reuters no passengers would be carried in the first few days while assurances from Bosnian Serb and government forces that relief planes would not be targets were put to the proof. </P>
<P> Redmond said the flights, coordinated by a team based at the UNHCR headquarters in Geneva, would continue Saturday and Sunday. In the past, they have been suspended at weekends. </P>
<P> ``We now only have supplies for a week in Sarajevo and we need to build up stocks,'' said Redmond. Bakeries in the city, hit by a Bosnian Serb ban on civilian transport in and out, had closed down for lack of flour. </P>
<P> The UNHCR airlifts, started in July 1992, were the main source of supply for the city of 380,000 people until the Serbs gave in to international pressure and warnings of air strikes and lifted their blockade in February. </P>
