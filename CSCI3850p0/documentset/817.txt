<DATELINE>SARAJEVO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Sarajevans scurried from bursts of sniper fire as a U.N. anti-sniping accord faltered and the Muslim-led Bosnian army commander warned the city that war and suffering would continue. </P>
<P> General Rasim Delic warned people their relatively sheltered existence, under Serb siege but protected by the umbrella of a NATO-enforced cease-fire, would cease as the Bosnian army took to the offensive. </P>
<P> ``I want everyone to understand that the war is continuing, that cafes and trams and some kind of access corridor do not mean freedom or a return to normal life,'' Delic told Bosnian government television. </P>
<P> Although U.N. officials said a groundbreaking two-day-old anti-sniping accord in Sarajevo was generally being respected Tuesday, bursts of gunfire in the city center sent citizens scurrying for cover. </P>
<P> Listing recent successful assaults by his lightly-armed but motivated soldiers, Delic said the Bosnian army was ready to fight a war of liberation to recapture territory won by better equipped Serbs in the early days of the war. </P>
<P> ``We are like a snowball getting bigger as it rolls down from the top of a hill. If things continue as they are the process of liberation will accelerate.'' </P>
<P> The Bosnian government is banking on moves by the United States to secure the lifting of the U.N. arms embargo, which prevents it from receiving the weaponry it needs, if Bosnia's Serbs do not agree to an international peace deal by mid-October. </P>
<P> U.N. mediator Thorvald Stoltenberg said Tuesday that lifting the arms embargo against the Bosnian Muslims ``could be helpful'' to the peace process provided it was not done unilaterally. </P>
<P> The United States has threatened to ignore the embargo if the U.N. fails to approve its removal when asked. </P>
<P> Stoltenberg's comments contrast with stark warnings from U.N. military sources in Sarajevo that lifting the ban will lead to further fighting and a collapse of the U.N. mission as contributing nations pull out their troops. </P>
<P> The sources say it could be a disaster for the Bosnian government with preemptive Serb artillery bombardments against crowded Muslim enclaves in eastern Bosnia and besieged Sarajevo, left unprotected once peacekeepers pull out. </P>
<P> Stoltenberg, who has just returned from a visit to Belgrade and Bosnia, was speaking after reporting on his mission to the Security Council in New York. He failed to get Bosnia's Serbs to alter their rejection of an international peace plan. </P>
<P> The mediator told reporters he believed a blockade imposed on the Bosnian Serbs by the Belgrade authorities to punish their resistance to the peace deal, would be effective in securing its eventual acceptance. </P>
<P> In Sarajevo, U.N. special envoy Yasushi Akashi held talks with Bosnian government leaders aimed at slowing down fighting and opening up commercial routes into Sarajevo closed by Serb forces around the city. </P>
<P> After four hours of talks with Bosnian vice-president Ejup Ganic, Akashi said negotiations were progressing slowly. </P>
<P> ``We must be realistic. (Although) we'd like to have rapid, radical progress ... we expect progress step by step.'' </P>
