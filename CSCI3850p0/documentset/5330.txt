<DATELINE>NAIROBI (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Sudan's largest southern rebel group declared a two-month cease-fire Thursday after the same step by Khartoum and called for international observers to be sent to monitor it. </P>
<P> But a breakaway rebel group said government forces attacked one of its positions in the south Thursday, proving that Khartoum never intended to respect its cease-fire from Tuesday. </P>
<P> The mainstream South Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) said it was declaring its own two-month cease-fire in response to calls from former president Jimmy Carter who persuaded the Islamic-backed government Monday to make the first move. </P>
<P> Carter was in Sudan to promote a campaign to eradicate the parasitic guinea worm and river blindess endemic in the south. </P>
<P> SPLA chief John Garang said the cease-fire supported Carter's initiative to distribute water filters to stop the guinea worm parasite, medicine for river blindness and vaccinations against polio and measles for children for two months. </P>
<P> ``In response to President Carter's call for a cease-fire, we have declared a unilateral cease-fire from today for the next two months,'' Garang told a news conference in Nairobi. </P>
<P> He said it would take effect at 3 p.m. (8 a.m. EST). He called for the deployment of international observers arguing that Khartoum had violated several previous cease-fire accords. </P>
<P> ``Several cease-fires have been declared by both the government in Khartoum and the SPLA but each one of them have been violated by the government as soon as they have been announced,'' he said. ``We want international monitors so that cease-fire is not abused by Khartoum.'' </P>
<P> In a statement issued in Nairobi later Thursday, the South Sudan Independence Movement led by Riak Machar said Khartoum's forces attacked its position at Maiwut in the south Thursday and its fighters were stiffly resisting the assault. </P>
<P> It urged the international community to condemn the ``belligerent act'' by Khartoum and said it proved Sudanese President Lt.-Gen. Omar Hassan al-Bashir never wanted peace. </P>
