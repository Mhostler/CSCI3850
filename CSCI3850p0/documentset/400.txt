<P>  The United Arab Emirates has joined four other Gulf Arab oil states in concluding a military pact with the United States, which rushed to the defense of Kuwait after Iraq's 1990 invasion. </P>
<P> A low-key three-paragraph announcement of the signing through the official news agency WAM late Monday gave no details of what it described as a ``joint military cooperation protocol.'' It did not say when exactly it was signed or where. </P>
<P> Diplomats in the region said the pact apparently does no more than formalize long-standing defense cooperation between the UAE and Washington, including joint maneuvers with a small U.S. naval task force permanently stationed in the Gulf. </P>
<P> It came after a visit to Abu Dhabi by General Joseph Hoar, the head of the Florida-based U.S. Central Command responsible for American military operations in the region that sits on two-thirds of the world's oil reserves. </P>
<P> The diplomats said cooperation had remained low-key so far mainly to avoid provoking hostility from anti-Western Iran across the Gulf that has reacted angrily to similar pacts already signed since 1991 with Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman and Qatar. </P>
<P> But the UAE's relations with Iran, which had been among the friendliest in the region until two years ago, have failed to recover since a row erupted over three disputed Gulf islands. </P>
<P> Iran accuses Washington of stirring up trouble between it and the UAE and of aiming to build permanent military bases in the emirates, accusations repeatedly denied by U.S. officials. </P>
<P> The diplomats said the pacts also reflected the continued feeling of vulnerability by the wealthy but thinly-populated Gulf Arab states, surrounded by what they see as cash-starved and covetous larger neighbors. </P>
<P> They were worried not only that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was still going strong despite his Gulf war defeat, but also about Iran's re-armament program and the failure of its President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani to deliver on promises of greater moderation. </P>
<P> ``The lessons of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait are still very fresh in most minds,'' one Western diplomat said. </P>
<P> ``One thing that was proved then was that the United States is the only power able to come to their rescue in time of need,'' he added. </P>
<P> Saudi Arabia, Washington's closest ally in the region and its biggest arms customer, is the only one of the six Gulf Cooperation Council states that has yet to sign a formal agreement despite a substantial U.S. military presence there. </P>
<P> The diplomats said the U.S. military presence in the kingdom remains controversial, although it was minute compared with the half-a-million troops that were based there in 1990 and 1991 to help liberate Kuwait from its Iraqi occupiers. </P>
