<P>  Greg Louganis, the Olympic champion diver who recently disclosed he has AIDS, struggled with the pain of adoption and homosexuality as a child, so much so that he later accepted being raped, he said on Oprah Winfrey's talk show Monday. </P>
<P> Answering questions about his newly published autobiography, ``Breaking the Surface,'' Louganis, 35, spoke of an anonymous male lover who raped him at knifepoint in a jealous rage. </P>
<P> ``I thought it was the best I deserved because of those feelings of being retarded and inadequate,'' Louganis said on ''Oprah'' of the rape by a man he lived with for 6 3/8 years. </P>
<P> Louganis won gold medals at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles and duplicated the feat in 1988 in Seoul. He took a silver on platform at the 1976 Games at age 16. </P>
<P> Louganis is now openly talking about his illness since he publicly announced Friday night he has AIDS and was HIV-positive when he won two gold medals in 1988. </P>
<P> ``It's been so difficult with the secrets and asking people to keep those secrets. If I was out in public I had to edit myself,'' Louganis said. ``I was feeling like a fake.'' </P>
<P> Louganis said as a child and teenager he felt unloved because of his adoption, and was troubled by poor grades in school due to dyslexia, confusion about his sexuality, and drug use. </P>
<P> During a period when he took amphetamines, Louganis kicked his mother and spent time in a juvenile home. He also consumed morphine pills originally intended to dull his late father's pain from cancer. </P>
<P> He said he attempted suicide three times, once shortly after winning his first Olympic medal in 1976. </P>
<P> ``I was battling clinical depression and didn't realize it. I understood how someone could die of sadness,'' he said. </P>
<P> Admitting his homosexuality was also problematic, he said. </P>
<P> ``Agents and managers are encouraging you to stay in the closet about (being gay). I would always have to censor myself, which was stressful and not good for my condition,'' Louganis said. </P>
<P> Louganis has embarked on a 13-city book tour, making appearances on national television talk shows and book stores promoting his autobiography. </P>
