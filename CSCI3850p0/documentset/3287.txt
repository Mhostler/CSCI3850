<P>  Princess Diana has declined down an invitation to Christmas lunch with the royal family and her estranged husband Prince Charles, British newspapers reported Saturday. </P>
<P> Instead, she will leave Queen Elizabeth's Sandringham Estate in eastern England and drive back to her Kensington Palace home in London to eat alone, according to the newspaper reports. </P>
<P> Queen Elizabeth II invited Diana to stay at Sandringham, traditional venue for the royal family at Christmas. She has accepted but said she would only stay from Christmas Eve until Christmas morning. </P>
<P> This means she will be leaving her sons, 12-year-old Prince William and 10-year-old Harry, to celebrate the rest of Christmas Day with their father and grandparents. </P>
<P> Buckingham Palace refused to comment on what it called ``private arrangements'' for Diana. </P>
<P> Charles and Diana separated two years ago but have shown no signs of wanting to get a divorce -- even though they can now do so in a mutually agreed settlement that need not go to court. </P>
