<P>  A Cuban exile now living in in Florida, will be part of an inauguration ceremony in Tampa Friday that he claims will make him the president of Cuba. </P>
<P> According to an article in Thursday's Tampa Tribune, Jose Morell Romero, who says he is the last surviving Supreme Court justice of Cuba and his Tampa-based backers claim the presidency based on Cuba's 1940 constitution. </P>
<P> In the constitution, the senior Supreme Court justice is to be named president until a new president can be elected. </P>
<P> Morell told the newspaper his first order of business will be to receive official recognition from the United States as the only legitimate Cuban government. He also plans to establish diplomatic ties to all the Latin American countries, naming ambassadors to each. </P>
<P> Morell left Cuba in 1960, after denouncing the regime of Fidel Castro. The nation's Supreme Court collapsed after his departure. </P>
<P> The ceremony is to take place at noon Friday in a Tampa park named after the Cuban patriot Jose Marti. </P>
<P> Although Morell told the newspaper he hoped to represent all Cubans, several Florida Cuban-American organizations said they were unaware of his plans. </P>
