<DATELINE>SEOUL, May 5 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC) said on Friday they would continue monitoring the Korean armistice despite Pyongyang's announcement that the group would be banned. </P>
<P> The NNSC made the announcement a day after senior officers from Sweden, Switzerland and Poland held an emergency meeting in Seoul to discuss steps to counter a North Korean ban preventing them from entering communist territory. </P>
<P> ``The Swedish and Swiss members will continue to hold weekly meetings at the headquarters of the NNSC in Panmunjom,'' the statement said. </P>
<P> North Korea said on Wednesday that NNSC members, who had always been allowed to move freely around the tiny artificial village of Panmunjom, would be prohibited from crossing the border to the North without permission. </P>
<P> It said NNSC facilities in Panmunjom under North Korean control ``shall be sealed completely.'' </P>
<P> Panmunjom is the sole crossing point in the Demilitarised Zone, a four-km (2.5 mile) wide strip of no man's land that divides the two Koreas locked in Cold War confrontation. </P>
<P> This move is Pyongyang's latest effort to dismantle the intricate armistice mechanism consisting of the Military Armistice Commission (MAC), involving nations that fought the war, and the four-nation NNSC that polices truce violations. </P>
<P> In February, North Korea expelled Polish members of the NNSC after refusing in 1993 to allow a delegation from the newly-declared Czech Republic to take over border duties from former Czechoslovakia. </P>
<P> The former communist Poland and Czechoslovakia were selected by North Korea for NNSC duties. The United Nations, representing the 16 nations which fought alongside the South in the Korean War, chose Switzerland and Sweden. </P>
<P> The Swedes and the Swiss still maintain an NNSC presence. </P>
<P> The NNSC said on Friday that North Korea's action against the Poles had no legal effect, since any changes in the armistice agreement must be agree by all three signatories. </P>
<P> ``Despite the forced departure of the Polish Delegation from Panmunjom at the end of February 1995, the Polish Delegation remains with the NNSC,'' the NNSC statement said. </P>
<P> ``The Polish Delegation of the NNSC will operate temporarily from Warsaw until either the Korean People's Army (KPA) reinstalls the Delegation it has nominated under the Armistice Agreement (AA) or the signatories of the AA agree upon a replacement of theh Polish Delegation,'' it said. </P>
<P> ``At least each three months or when it deems necessary, the Polish Member will join the Swedish and Swiss Members for a meeting of te NNSC.'' </P>
<P> Last year Pyongyang withdrew from the Military Armistice Commission overseeing the truce and persuaded wartime ally China to withdraw its monitors from the intra-Korean border. </P>
<P> Seoul says North Korea's announcement on Wednesday was aimed at setting up a new peace arrangement with the United States, excluding South Korea. </P>
<P> But Washington, reflecting South Korea's view, has said a peace treaty should chiefly be an inter-Korean affair, with only supporting roles for China and the United States, the two major outside forces that took part in the war. </P>
