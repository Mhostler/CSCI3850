<DATELINE>LAGOS, Nigeria (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  At least 20 people were killed Monday in pro-democracy demonstrations in Lagos, the biggest city in strike-bound Nigeria, the leader of a political pressure group said. </P>
<P> ``At least 20 people were killed during protests in different locations in Lagos today,'' Beko Ransome-Kuti, president of the Campaign for Democracy told Reuters. </P>
<P> There was no official confirmation of the deaths. </P>
<P> Other independent eyewitnesses said they had seen bodies along Western Avenue, a busy road in the city. </P>
<P> Nigeria has been virtually brought to a halt by striking oil unions pressing for the release of opposition politician Moshood Abiola, the apparent winner of last year's annulled presidential elections. </P>
<P> He is detained and charged with treason after proclaiming himself president. </P>
<P> Riots flared early in the day in several parts of the sprawling city of six million people and police fired tear gas to disperse crowds calling for an immediate return to democracy. </P>
<P> Demonstrations also broke out in the western Nigerian city of Ibadan, where police fought running battles with students and protesters calling for Abiola's release, residents there said. </P>
<P> In Lagos, clashes took place in several places, including Ikorodu Road, Ketu and Mushin, witnesses said. </P>
<P> Ransome-Kuti said about eight people were killed in Fadeyi, a main stopping point for buses along Ikorodu Road in mainland Lagos. One independent eyewitness said he saw the body of one man in Ipaja district, northern Lagos. </P>
<P> ``We condemn the killings in the strongest terms. This is a rehash of what happened last year,'' Ransome-Kuti said, referring to the 1993 protest against the election annulment in which nearly 190 people were killed. </P>
<P> The strikes by oil unions seeking Abiola's release as well as an immediate return to democracy entered the third week on Monday. Their leaders vowed to go on with the stoppage despite a government pledge to consider freeing political detainees. </P>
<P> ``Nothing has changed,'' Bola Owudunni, president of one oil union, PENGASSAN, told Reuters. </P>
<P> But the chairman of PENGASSAN in state-owned Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation said on state radio Monday the union had called off the strike. </P>
<P> He urged its members to resume work immediately. </P>
<P> The decision would affect the corporation's staff but not those in other companies involved in production of crude and fuel marketing. </P>
<P> The strike has choked off fuel supplies to domestic consumers, forcing many businesses to close in Africa's most populous nation. </P>
<P> But the impact on exports of crude, Nigeria's main source of foreign exchange, was minimal. Oil industry sources estimated Monday there had been a five percent output cutback because of skeletal staffing. </P>
<P> In a letter to Shell, which pumps more than half Nigeria's crude, another oil union said Monday it would start mass action against the company by its Wednesday if its staff did not stop work to make the strike more effective. </P>
<P> The unions blame expatriate staff of the oil companies for taking over jobs normally done by their members to maintain Nigeria's oil output. </P>
