<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Top-ranked UCLA and defending champion Arkansas were both less than five seconds from elimination from the NCAA Basketball Tournament before fantastic finishes rescued them Sunday. </P>
<P> Tyus Edney drove the length of the court and made a tough layup at the buzzer to lift the top-seeded Bruins to a thrilling 75-74 victory over Missouri in the second round of the West Regional in Boise. </P>
<P> ``It's the biggest shot of my basketball career so far,'' Edney said. </P>
<P> The ending to the matchup of Arkansas and Syracuse in the Midwest Regionals at Austin, Texas, was even wilder. </P>
<P> A technical foul with 4.3 seconds to go in regulation -- assessed because of a timeout called by Syracuse's Lucious Jackson when the Orangemen had no timeouts left -- allowed Arkansas to tie the game and send it into overtime. </P>
<P> Then Scotty Thurman -- who made one of the technical foul shots to tie the game but not both to win in regulation -- scored six points in the final 2:09 of the extra session to lead the second-seeded Razorbacks to a 96-94 victory. </P>
<P> The two games capped a day that saw two other games end in the final seconds, the Big Ten Conference eliminated, the Atlantic Coast Conference remain unbeaten and no seed lower than sixth remaining among the final 16 teams. </P>
<P> Jackson's timeout call was reminiscent of a play by Michigan's Chris Webber in the 1993 championship game against North Carolina. </P>
<P> Edney's full-court sprint recalled a dash by Brigham Young's Danny Ainge against Notre Dame exactly 14 years ago. </P>
<P> Edney took the inbounds pass at the foul line, dribbled up the right side with a defender at his side, made a behind-the-back change-of-direction dribble and went in for the flying bank shot and the play of the tourney. </P>
<P> Julian Winfield's inside basket with 4.8 seconds left had given Missouri a 74-73 lead. The Tigers led by nine points early in the second half but neither team led by more than three in the final 10 minutes. </P>
<P> Ed O'Bannon scored 24 points for the Bruins, who were bounced in the first round of last year's tournament. UCLA advanced to the round of 16 for the first time since 1992. </P>
<P> The Bruins will head for Oakland, Calif., where they meet Mississippi State. Darryl Wilson scored 32 points to lead the fifth seed Bulldogs (22-7) to a 78-64 victory over Utah at Boise and the school's first trip to the round of 16. </P>
<P> Against Arkansas, a layup by John Wallace had given Syracuse an 82-81 lead with 27 seconds left in regulation. Jackson dove near the baseline and intercepted an inbounds pass, then called timeout before anyone could tie him up. But the Orangemen would have gotten possession anyway if a jump ball were called since the arrow pointed in their direction. </P>
<P> ``The ball looked like it was tied up, it was tied up right away after Lucious dove for the ball,'' Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim said. ``We had the possession if it was called that way.'' </P>
<P> After Thurman then took charge in overtime, Syracuse's Greg Lloyd and Jackson missed potential game-winning 3-pointers in the final six seconds. </P>
<P> Arkansas (29-6) moves on to the regionals in Kansas City, where it will face Memphis on Friday. </P>
<P> Memphis used a buzzer-beater to move into the round of 16 for the first time in three years. David Vaughn's follow shot with 1.1 seconds remaining lifted the Tigers to a 75-73 victory over third seed Purdue in the Midwest Regional. </P>
<P> Purdue was the last of six Big Ten teams in the tourney, marking the first time the conference failed to have a school in the round of 16 since 1943, when only eight teams made the NCAA Tournament. </P>
<P> Georgetown also used a last-second shot to reach the Sweet 16, for the first time in six years. Don Reid put in Allen Iverson's airball 3-pointer at the buzzer to give the Hoyas a 53-51 victory over Weber State in the Southeast Regional at Tallahassee, Fla. </P>
<P> Georgetown has a Thursday showdown in Birmingham, Ala., with second-seeded North Carolina, which blew past Iowa State 73-51 in Tallahassee. </P>
<P> Donald Williams scored 13 of his 15 points in the second half as the Tar Heels took their customary place in the round of 16 and extended the perfect record of the ACC to 8-0 in the tourney. Carolina has reached the final 16 in 14 of the last 15 years. </P>
<P> Massachusetts moved into the East Regional semifinals with a 75-53 thrashing of Stanford in Albany, N.Y. Lou Roe scored 16 points for the second-seeded Minutemen (28-4), who face Tulsa Friday in East Rutherford, N.J. </P>
<P> Shea Seals scored 31 points and Alvin Williamson added 19 as Tulsa eliminated Old Dominion 64-52 at Albany. Tulsa is in the round of 16 for the second consecutive year. </P>
<P> Tulsa, Memphis and Georgetown are all seeded sixth, the lowest remaining seeds in the tournament. </P>
<P> The other eight spots in the third round were determined on Saturday, among them top seeds Wake Forest, Kentucky and Kansas. </P>
