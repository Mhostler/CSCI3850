<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates Wednesday for the seventh time in a year as it tries to engineer a soft landing for the high-flying economy without plunging it into recession, analysts said. </P>
<P> Most are betting that the central bank will raise short-term rates by a half percentage point in a move that will tighten credit for a host of borrowers -- from credit card users to small and medium-sized companies. </P>
<P> The Fed, which began its deliberations Tuesday, resumed meeting on Wednesday at 9 a.m. EST. If it follows past practice, the Fed will announce its expected decision on interest rates sometime shortly after 2 p.m. </P>
<P> ``There is little evidence that growth has slowed materially,'' said James Glassman, of Chemical Securities of New York. ``The Fed will announce a half-point rate increase.'' </P>
<P> Such a move would bring the key federal funds rate -- the rate commercial banks charge each other for overnight money -- to 6 percent, double the level it was a year ago when the Fed began tightening the monetary screws. </P>
<P> The economy since then has steamed ahead and looks set to continue to expand this year, although at a slower pace. </P>
<P> That was the message contained in Wednesday's release of leading economic indicators, which rose 0.1 percent in December after a 0.3 percent increase the previous month. </P>
<P> The strong growth has fanned fears at the Fed that inflation may be about to heat up. So far, though, that has not happened, causing some lawmakers, businesspeople and union leaders to voice concern that the Fed has been over-zealous. </P>
<P> ``We want the Fed to give recent rate increases more time to work,'' said Rep. George Miller, D-Calif. ``Another increase could send our economy into a tailspin rather than the soft landing intended by the Fed.'' </P>
<P> Fed officials admit that it's a difficult time to plot monetary strategy. Economic growth is expected to slow this year -- to about 2 3/8 percent from 4 percent last year -- as higher rates begin to bite on consumers and companies. </P>
<P> But so far, there are only scant signs of that happening. Retail sales eased unexpectedly in December, while car dealers report that demand for their products ebbed last month. </P>
<P> At the same time the economy has entered what one Fed official dubbed a ``danger zone'' with a risk of higher inflation. Many factories are operating flat out and are looking to raise prices. </P>
