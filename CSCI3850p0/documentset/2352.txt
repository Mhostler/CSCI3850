<P>  The United States Wednesday condemned the murder of three Western hostages by their Khmer Rouge captors in Cambodia as a ``vicious crime.'' </P>
<P> ``The United States government condemns the brutal murder by the Khmer Rouge of three innocent tourists from Australia, France and the U.K.,'' said a statement from its embassy. </P>
<P> Second Prime Minister Hun Sen said Tuesday that Briton Mark Slater, 28, Jean-Michel-Braquet, 27, from France, and Australian David Wilson, 29, had been murdered by the Khmer Rouge at Vine Mountain, a former Khmer Rouge base in the southern province of Kampot. </P>
<P> The trio had been taken hostage July 26 along with three ethnic Vietnamese and an unknown number of Cambodians after a train ambush in which 13 people were killed. </P>
<P> The statement said the U.S. government extended its sympathy to the families and governments of the three hostages and urged the Cambodian government to ``make every effort to bring to justice those responsible for this vicious crime.'' </P>
<P> ``We deplore all the senseless killings, not only of Westerners but also of ethnic Vietnamese and ordinary Cambodians, for which the Khmer Rouge have been responsible,'' the statement said. </P>
<P> The U.S. statement also condemned a reported Khmer Rouge atrocity last week in the northwest province of Battambang in which up to 50 Cambodians were massacred. </P>
