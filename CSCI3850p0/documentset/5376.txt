<P>  People are highly consistent in what they find disgusting, although men and women occasionally differ in response, British psychologists reported Saturday. </P>
<P> Graham Davey, of the University of Sussex, and Karen Barker, from London's City University, set out to identify whether there were groups of things that people found disgusting, and whether there were sex differences. </P>
<P> They found many of the cliches were true -- the woman who blithely ignores baby vomit on her skirt while her husband gags will herself flinch at the sight of a squirming earth-worm. </P>
<P> They told a conference of the British Psychological Society that they interviewed 300 people, half of them university students, to find out what they found disgusting. </P>
<P> They found five basic areas: offal and other animal products, the dirty human body such as greasy hair, insects such as maggots, gastro-enteric products such as vomit, and sexual activities such as incest. </P>
<P> ``Females exhibited significantly higher scores on all categories except gastro-enteric products,'' they said. </P>
<P> Their findings, they said, fit in with earlier studies that showed people tended to be disgusted by things that could be dangerous, such as animals known to spread disease like rats, infectious waste products, or incest and pedophilia. </P>
