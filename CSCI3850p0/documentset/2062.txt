<DATELINE>BAGHDAD (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Iraq said Monday it found positive elements in the U.N. Security Council's resolution demanding that its troops stop approaching Kuwait. </P>
<P> ``It (resolution) contains relatively obvious positive aspects,'' the government newspaper al-Jumhouriya said in a front-page editorial signed by editor-in-chief Salah al-Mukhtar. </P>
<P> The Security Council passed a unanimous resolution late Saturday demanding that troops of Baghdad's Republican Guard stop approaching Kuwait or making threatening moves towards the emirate Iraq invaded in 1990. </P>
<P> The council vote followed a week of renewed tension in the Gulf marked by the massing of U.S. and allied troops in Kuwait in response to a buildup of Iraqi forces towards the Kuwaiti border. </P>
<P> Jumhouriya's was the first official Iraqi reaction to the resolution. </P>
<P> Iraq's official press has depicted the resolution as a defeat for the United States which it said deleted several paragraphs under pressure from other council members, particularly Russia. </P>
<P> There were no hard feelings in the press about the resolution and Jumhouriya said the terms set in it do not hinder ``the Iraqi government's capability to move its troops within the required speed under certain circumstances.'' </P>
<P> The ruling Baath party newspaper al-Thawra printed comments by other Security Counicl members who it said were all on Iraq's side. </P>
<P> Iraq, under renewed pressure from the United Nations to comply with Gulf War ceasefire terms, has called an extraordinary session of parliament for Monday. </P>
<P> Baghdad Radio, reporting the development on Sunday, did not specify the subject to be debated. But the session would come two days after the Security Council said any Iraqi recognition of the newly demarcated border with Kuwait would have to be with ``full and formal constitutional procedures.'' </P>
<P> Recognition of Kuwait, which Iraqi forces invaded in August 1990 and were driven from by a multinational force seven months later, is a key demand in U.N.-imposed ceasefire terms. </P>
