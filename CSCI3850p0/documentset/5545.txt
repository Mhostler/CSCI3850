<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  House Speaker Newt Gingrich has said he will oust the Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee who publicized the role of a Guatemalan CIA agent in two murders in the early 1990s, The Washington Post reported in its Friday editions. </P>
<P> Gingrich told House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., to remove Rep. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., from the panel by Friday or Gingrich would oust him, the newspaper said, quoting Gephardt's office. </P>
<P> Gingrich earlier this week called for Torricelli's resignation, saying the lawmaker had violated his oath not to reveal classified information. </P>
<P> Torricelli says he obtained information linking Guatemalan Colonel Julio Roberto Alpirez to the CIA from government sources outside the committee, and did not even attend hearings in which Guatemala was discussed. </P>
<P> The newspaper said Torricelli offered to resign from the committee in a letter to Gephardt two weeks ago, but Gephardt declined the offer. </P>
<P> Sources in Gephardt's office said he would refuse to name a replacement if Gingrich fulfilled his vow to oust Torricelli. </P>
<P> Torricelli, in an interview with the Post, said Gingrich was carrying out the CIA's wishes. </P>
<P> The New Jersey Democrat created a furor last month when he alleged that Alpirez, a paid informant of the CIA, ordered the murders of American innkeeper Michael DeVine in 1990 and guerrilla leader Efrain Bamaca Velasquez in 1992 after he was captured in a clash with government forces. </P>
<P> Torricelli also said the CIA had covered up knowledge of the murders, promoting a series of government investigations. </P>
