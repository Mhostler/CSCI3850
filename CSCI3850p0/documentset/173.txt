<P>  National Security Adviser Anthony Lake said Monday the Clinton administration hoped other nations would tighten sanctions against Haiti after its decision to oust a group of international human rights observers. </P>
<P> ``What I hope it does is provoke other nations into tightening sanctions the way we have,'' Lake told reporters aboard Air Force One on a flight with Clinton to Berlin. </P>
<P> ``I think this is an outrageous action,'' Lake said of the Haitian military government's decision to oust about 100 human rights observers from the United Nations and the Organization of American States. </P>
<P> ``It emphasizes the deteriorating human rights situation in Haiti and the responsibility of the military leaders for the growing tragedy,'' he said. </P>
<P> A senior U.S. official who did not want to be identified said the expulsion was a sign the Haitian government did not want scrutiny of its human rights record. Other countries could move to freeze Haiti's assets as the United States had done. </P>
<P> Officials would not say if the development increased the likelihood Washington would decide to intervene militarily in Haiti. </P>
<P> ``We have tightened the screws just about as far as we can'' on economic sanctions, the senior official said, adding: ``I will not speculate on military action..'' </P>
