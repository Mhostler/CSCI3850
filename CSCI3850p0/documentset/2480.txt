<P>  Comedian and television actress Roseanne Arnold said Tuesday she and her estranged husband Tom have decided to get divorced as soon as possible. </P>
<P> ``I am happy to finally put this chapter of my life behind me,'' Roseanne said in a statement. </P>
<P> The statement, released by her publicist, PMK Public Relations, said the divorce was expected to be final by Dec. 9 and that all property issues would be resolved either by settlement or trial at a future date. </P>
<P> Tom Arnold filed court papers in July asking for $100,000 a month from his wife. </P>
<P> Roseanne, the star of the ABC television show of the same name, is believed to have amassed millions of dollars from the show and other entertainment business ventures. </P>
<P> The couple's stormy, five-year marriage was marked by public outbursts and reconciliations. </P>
<P> Roseanne first filed for divorce in April but dropped the suit a week later after her tearful husband had appeared on a number of television talk shows appealing for her to give him another chance. </P>
<P> She then went to Europe but when she returned she did not go back to her husband, instead filing for divorce a second time. </P>
<P> In her renewed petition filed in Los Angeles Superior Court in July, Roseanne said she only withdrew her first divorce petition out of fear for her life. </P>
<P> ``I was extremely fearful that if I told him I was absolutely positive that I did not want to remain married to him, his threats to kill me would become real,'' Roseanne said in her renewed petition. </P>
<P> ``In order to keep the peace...and to protect myself, I acquiesced to his demands, knowing that I would shortly be able to escape from him,'' the document said. </P>
<P> Arnold, whose own show, ``Tom,'' was dropped earlier this year by CBS, stated in his July court filing that he was out of work and was under no contract for which he anticipated receiving any income in the near future. </P>
