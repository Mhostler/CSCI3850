<P>  U.S. companies and Russia are discussing working together to develop anti-tank missile systems, a Russian defense official said Thursday. </P>
<P> ``U.S. companies are eager to cooperate with us on anti-tank missile systems,'' said Gennady Janpolsky, deputy chairman of Russia's State Committee of Defense Branches of Industry. </P>
<P> ``It's at a very early stage. We're only developing contacts but the interest is keen on our side as well,'' Janpolsky told Reuters through a translator at Abu Dhabi's IDEX 95 defense exhibition which ended late Thursday. </P>
<P> He said Russian and U.S. companies were looking at cooperation in producing other areas of military equipment but declined to name the U.S. firms or give more specific details. </P>
<P> ``We've already had several American delegations which visited Russian military complexes and our scientists have exchanged information,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``Everything will depend on politics. As for scientists, they could design such anti-tank systems very soon.'' </P>
<P> Janpolsky said Russia had sold 12 Tunguska anti-aircraft systems -- missiles and guns mounted on an armored vehicle -- during the five-day arms fair but declined to comment on press reports that the customer was India. </P>
<P> Russia showed off a wide range of military equipment at IDEX, one of the world's biggest arms fairs, ranging from tanks to submachineguns which fire underwater. Janpolsky declined to say if any other contracts had been signed. </P>
