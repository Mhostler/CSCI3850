<DATELINE>PALMA DE MALLORCA, Spain (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Three hijackers of an Algerian airliner diverted to Majorca Sunday surrendered to Spanish police minutes after freeing all the passengers and crew, an airport spokeswoman said. </P>
<P> The hijackers, all Algerians, were now talking to security officers. There was no immediate word on whether Spanish authorities had offered them any assurances that they would not be repatriated to Algeria. </P>
<P> The hijackers seized the Fokker 27 aircraft with 38 passengers and four crew during a domestic flight from Algiers to Ouargla, in the Sahara desert, and forced it to fly to Palma, where it landed at 4:50 a.m. EST. </P>
<P> Calling themselves members of the ``Union of Peaceful Citizens of Algeria,'' they originally demanded the release of political prisoners in Algeria and wanted to fly on to Marseille. </P>
<P> But they later said they wanted political asylum in Spain and the hijack ended an hour or two later after talks in the airport control tower between one of the hijackers and Spanish officials on the scene. </P>
