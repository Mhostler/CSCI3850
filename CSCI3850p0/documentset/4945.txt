<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A lawyer for O.J. Simpson suggested Wednesday that a police detective secretly picked up a bloody glove at the crime scene, concealed it in one of his socks and later planted it at Simpson's estate to frame the football legend for the murder of his ex-wife and her friend. </P>
<P> Outlining his theory with the jury absent from the courtroom, trial lawyer F. Lee Bailey contended that Detective Mark Fuhrman had the ``motive and the opportunity'' to tamper with evidence to implicate Simpson in the slayings of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. </P>
<P> Simpson has pleaded not guilty to killing the two. </P>
<P> Pointing out that Fuhrman is an ex-Marine, Bailey said, ''Marines tend to carry things in their socks the same way some detectives carry an ankle holster for a backup weapon.'' </P>
<P> Bailey suggested that Fuhrman -- a key prosecution witness -- picked up a glove at the murder scene while no one was watching, put it in a small plastic bag and then hid it in one of his socks. </P>
<P> When Fuhrman went to Simpson's estate two miles away, he would have had the opportunity to drop the glove on a walkway behind a guest house and later claim that he had found it there. </P>
<P> The defense has suggested Fuhrman is a racist rogue cop who hated blacks, particularly those who associate with white women. Simpson, a former football star, is black. His late wife and Goldman were white. </P>
<P> Bailey said that Fuhrman had two motives for planting the glove: ``No. 1. It would keep him inexorably in the lawsuit and No. 2, it would punish a black man who had the temerity to associate with a white woman in a romantic way.'' </P>
<P> Bailey made the accusations while trying to persuade Judge Lance Ito to allow him to introduce a glove and a plastic bag he purchased to illustrate his points while cross-examining Fuhrman, who the defense says is a racist who framed Simpson. </P>
<P> Prosecutor Marcia Clark strongly objected, saying Bailey intended to launch into another ``inflammatory argument'' with no basis whatsoever ``in an attempt to confuse, mislead and deceive this jury.'' </P>
<P> The idea that Fuhrman planted the glove, she said, was ``a fantasy woven by the defense'' with no evidence to back it up. </P>
<P> Ito ruled that Bailey could not use the glove during cross-examination but that the plastic bag could be introduced if Fuhrman testified that he carried a similar one in his police kit. </P>
<P> Fuhrman returned to the stand for Day Three of his cross-examination, testifying in answer to Bailey's questions that since 1985 he had never referred to an African-American as ``nigger.'' </P>
<P> He also reiterated his denial that he told real estate agent Kathleen Bell that all ``niggers'' should be killed. </P>
<P> Earlier, during a heated debate between Clark and Bailey, Clark accused the defense attorney of deliberately lying about a conversation he had with a Marine recruiting sergeant. </P>
<P> Clark said Bailey had ``lied to the court'' and had sought to ``misinform and mislead'' it over his contact with Marine Sgt. Max Cordoba. </P>
<P> Clark asked Ito to punish Bailey by citing him for contempt of court, imposing a heavy fine, and barring Cordoba as a defense witness. </P>
<P> Bailey, obviously angered by the attack, retorted, ``I do not appreciate being called a liar in any court.'' </P>
<P> Bailey said Tuesday that he had spoken to Cordoba and that Cordoba said Fuhrman had called him a ``nigger.'' </P>
<P> But in an interview with the ``Dateline NBC'' television show, portions of which were broadcast Tuesday night, Cordoba said he had never spoken to Bailey. </P>
<P> Bailey explained Wednesday he had spoken briefly on the telephone with Cordoba while the Marine was being interviewed by a defense team investigator and that the investigator had spoken to Cordoba again Tuesday night and he now remembered Bailey saying hello to him. </P>
<P> Clark said Bailey was splitting hairs, adding, ``This is the kind of nonsense that gives lawyers a bad name. ... He was intending to convey to the court (Tuesday) that he had personal knowledge of what that man said.'' </P>
<P> Ito, who had said Tuesday he would allow Bailey to bring up the subject of Cordoba during his questioning of Fuhrman once the witness had been interviewed by prosecutors, reversed himself and said Cordoba's name could not be raised in front of the jury until the defense presents its case. </P>
<P> The judge dealt the defense another reversal when he said Bailey could not question Fuhrman about Alwyn Martin, a white woman with a black British boyfriend whom the detective met while investigating a carjacking in which she was the victim. </P>
<P> The defense had sought to show that Fuhrman made racial remarks to Martin at a hospital where she was being treated for injuries sustained in the attack after meeting her boyfriend. </P>
<P> But prosecutors said Martin told them Fuhrman had acted in a professional manner and had not mentioned the subject of race. </P>
