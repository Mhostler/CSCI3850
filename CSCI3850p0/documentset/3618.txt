<P>  A small bronze statue that anyone with deep pockets can buy next week got a big boost Friday when a leading art expert said it was a long lost work by the Renaissance sculptor Benvenuto Cellini. </P>
<P> Cellinis are among the world's rarest sculptures -- less than 15 are known to exist -- and a change in attribution of the bronze statue of a reclining Cleopatra could add hundreds of thousands of dollars to its price when it goes on sale at Sotheby's Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``I would say it is a Cellini both from its style and from the inventory found in his home when he died in 1571,'' said University of California at Santa Barbara art historian Peter Meller, who is considered one of the world's leading Cellini experts. </P>
<P> The inventory made reference to a wax model of a Cleopatra and to another sculpture of her that was not described. </P>
<P> Meller spent Friday examining the 10 5/8 inch bronze reclining nude holding an asp to her neck. </P>
<P> Afterwards, he said it bore remarkable similiarities to figures on a saltcellar done by Cellini that is now part of the collection at Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna and showed a clear debt by the sculptor to Michaelangelo. </P>
<P> The statue, part of the collection of Cyril Humphris, a well known British art dealer and collector, had acquired the piece from Prince Nicholas of Romania, whose mother, Queen Marie, had bought it at the turn of the century. </P>
<P> In the catalogue for the sale it is attributed to an unknown French sculptor of the mid-16th century from the school of Fontainebleau. </P>
<P> But Sotheby's said it would now describe the work as ''attributed to Cellini'' and add a reference to Meller's findings. </P>
<P> The work had been expected to sell for between $25,000 and $35,000 but now Sotheby's said it was raising its estimate to between $250,000 and $350,000. </P>
<P> Humphris said, ``It took me two years to decide whether or not to sell my collection and ever since I have had some extraordinary experiences, this foremost among them.'' </P>
<P> He said he believed Meller and that other art experts over the years had wondered if the work was a Cellini, although none had known about the inventory reference. </P>
<P> The Sotheby's catalogue even makes a reference to Cellini, saying the strikingly mannered pose of the female nude ``bears a close resemblance to the figures around the base of the Cellini saltcellar.'' </P>
