<P>  The National Collegiate Athletic Association has slapped new sanctions on the University of Washington football program but stopped short of ordering a ban on televised games, university officials said Tuesday. </P>
<P> The NCAA upheld a two-year ban on postseason play imposed earlier by the PAC-10 conference to which the univeristy belongs, and kept the university on probation through the 1995 season for recruiting violations and illicit violations. </P>
<P> But the NCAA, which earlier had proposed banning the Huskies football team from television for a year, reversed itself and merely limited the team to four television appearances in the 1995 seasons. </P>
<P> University sports information director Jim Daves said the ruling was considered a victory because the team normally appears on television only five or six times a season on average. Television appearances are crucial for the program's revenue as well as exposure that can lead to national rankings and bowl bids. </P>
<P> Among the most severe rule violations found by the NCAA was a pattern under which some players were paid for work they never performed in summer jobs programs arranged by team boosters from 1980 to 1989, Daves said. </P>
<P> During the same time period there were ``less than a dozen'' incidents in which players falsified restaurant receipts so they could keep cash intended to pay for entertaining recruits considering playing for the university's football team, Daves said. </P>
<P> The university, located in Seattle, is considered unlikely to appeal the NCAA action. </P>
