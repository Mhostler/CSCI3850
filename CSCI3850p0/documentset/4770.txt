<P>  Studies published Tuesday left unclear whether putting babies to sleep on their backs or sides lowers the risk of crib death but said exposure to cigarette smoke is clearly a culprit in the fatalities. </P>
<P> A researcher at the National Institutes of Health counseled parents they should follow the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation that healthy infants be placed on their sides or backs instead of their stomachs. </P>
<P> Doctors should use their judgment for individual cases in which non-prone sleeping may cause problems but ``in all cases advice should be given not to place soft bedding, such as pillows, blankets, quilts and comforters, under the infant,'' wrote Marian Willinger of the NIH's Pregnancy and Perinatology Branch in Bethesda, Md. </P>
<P> Willinger made the comment in an editorial in this week's Journal of the American Medical Association in which conflicting sleeping studies were published. </P>
<P> Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, or SIDS, is a medical mystery which experts believe does not have a single source. It is the leading cause of death between one-month and one-year of age in the Western world, responsible for between 5,000 and 6,000 fatalities a year in the United States alone. </P>
<P> A University of California at San Diego study published Tuesday found that ``routine prone sleep position was not associated with an increased risk of SIDS.'' </P>
<P> The California study involved 400 sets of parents, half of whom had lost infants to SIDS. It found that the prone sleeping position was routine in 66 percent of those deaths and in 64 percent of the 200 babies not affected. </P>
<P> California researchers Hillary Klonoff-Cohen and Sharon Edelstein advocated additional studies while questioning previous research which they said was largely conducted in countries where infant care practices and other SIDS risk factors differ from those in the United States. </P>
<P> But in another study published in the same journal, researchers at the University of Tasmania, Australia, said there was a direct link between sleeping position and a state-wide decline in the rate of SIDS to 1.4 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1992 from 3.8 deaths per 1,000 births from 1975 to 1990. </P>
<P> Terence Dwyer of the school's Menzines Center for Population Health Research attributed 70 percent of the decline in SIDS deaths to shifting the common sleeping position of babies off of their stomachs. </P>
<P> In a separate report from the California study, also published in the journal Tuesday, Klonoff-Cohen and Edelstein said babies exposed to cigarette smoke are as much as 23 more times as likely to die of SIDS than those in smoke-free environments. </P>
<P> An infant breast-fed by a non-smoker had one-third the risk of crib death than those not breast-fed, but that benefit disappeared when the infant was breast-fed by a smoker, the report said. </P>
