<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Democrats filed a new ethics complaint against Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich Thursday, charging that he accepted up to $200,000 worth of free television time for his college history lectures. </P>
<P> The charge came several hours before the House Ethics Committee went into a closed-door session to probe earlier complaints that include a Gingrich book deal and claims he used government resources for a college course he teaches. </P>
<P> Committee chairwoman Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., told reporters during a break after two hours of the meeting that the committee went over the complaints and would continue to examine them in future meetings. </P>
<P> She said it would at least five weeks before the bipartisan committee decides what to do after the review, including whether to appoint an outside counsel to further conduct the investigation. </P>
<P> ``That would be, I would say, at least five weeks down the road,'' she replied to a question on an outside investigator being demanded by Democrats. </P>
<P> Gingrich dismissed all charges as politically motivated. </P>
<P> In the new complaint, Democratic Reps. Patricia Schroeder of Colorado, Cynthia McKinney of Georgia and Harry Johnston of Florida asked the committee by letter for a preliminary inquiry into their charge a cable TV operator gave Gingrich valuable free time to air lectures he gives at Reinhardt College in Georgia. </P>
<P> They said the cable network owner stands to benefit from legislation before Congress and so Gingrich may have violated conflict-of-interest rules in accepting the gift of air time. </P>
<P> The Democrats cited news reports Gingrich accepted some 20 hours of cable television time worth from $150,000 to $200,000 to broadcast his lectures over a subsidiary of Colorado-based cable network, Jones Intercable Inc., owned by Glenn R. Jones. </P>
<P> The complaint alleged that the arrangement for air time over Jones's ``Mind Extension University'' program series was made in January by a mutual friend of Jones and Gingrich. </P>
<P> The Democrats alleged that Jones has ``substantial interests'' in legislation and reportedly is interested in buying the Public Broadcasting Service, the government-funded TV network. Gingrich wants to end funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting which helps fund PBS. </P>
<P> ``He is, therefore, in violation of the House Ethics Rules and the Ethics in Government Act of 1989,'' they wrote. </P>
<P> Gingrich, according to the new complaint, thanked cable network owner Jones personally for ``agreeing'' to air his lectures on history, politics and democracy. </P>
<P> In a January press release, Jones said that his ``Mind Extension University'' educational program is available to 26 million households in 8,600 communities. </P>
<P> The ethics panel was scheduled to begin investigation Thursday afternoon of charges that include improper use of House office equipment and staff to help on the college course, solicitations to help finance the course, a book deal with a New York publisher and allegations of improper intervention with federal agencies on behalf of financial contributors. </P>
<P> The book deal caused a furor in December when Gingrich was offered a $4.5 million advance for two books. He rejected the advance only after the public uproar ensued. </P>
<P> Most of the earlier charges were filed by former Democratic Rep. Ben Jones of Georgia, whom Gingrich defeated in last November's election. </P>
<P> At his regular daily news conference Thursday, Gingrich dismissed all the complaints against him as inspired by partisan Democrats and said those who file complaints that are subsequently dismissed should be forced to pay for the costs of defending against such allegations. </P>
<P> The ethics committee has a number of options before it in examining the Gingrich charges, ranging from dismissal of the allegations or punishments such as a reprimand or censure. </P>
