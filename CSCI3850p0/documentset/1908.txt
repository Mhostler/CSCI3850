<P>  Joseph Di Mambro, a leader of the ``Order of the Solar Temple,'' was definitely among 48 sect members who died last week, police said Monday. </P>
<P> They said Di Mambro's body was among 25 found at the village of Granges sur Salvan last Wednesday. Police had issued an international arrest warrant in his name. </P>
<P> Autopsies on 23 bodies found in the village of Cheiry near Fribourg were completed last weekend, allowing pathologists in Lausanne to begin examining corpses from Salvan, in the Canton of Valais, Monday. A statement by Valais police and the Lausanne Medical-Legal Institute said four corpses were identified and one of them was ``a French citizen, Joseph Di Mambro, aged 70, subject of an international arrest warrant.'' </P>
<P> The statement gave no news on the founder of the sect, Luc Jouret, whose fate is not yet known. But it said Valais police had found a 0.22 calibre long-barelled pistol fitted with a silencer that was being examined by police in Fribourg. The judge leading the Fribourg inquiry has said such a weapon was used on 20 of the 23 victims in Cheiry. </P>
