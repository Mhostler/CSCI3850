<P>  NATO governments will ask the United Nations for clear guidelines on when to use air strikes in response to ``Bosnian Serb provocation,'' U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry said Monday. </P>
<P> ``NATO governments will ask the U.N. to clarify the circumstances which will be considered provocation by the Bosnian Serbs and therefore subject to air strikes,'' he told a news conference in Stuttgart. </P>
<P> ``They will also ask to make it clear that NATO pilots should be authorized to seek multiple targets as part of a firm and timely response to Bosnian Serb provocation,'' he told a news conference. </P>
<P> Perry was speaking at the U.S. army's European Command headquarters in Stuttgart after flying to Germany from Split, Croatia, where he met Yasushi Akashi, the senior U.N. official in former Yugoslavia and top NATO and U.N. military commanders. </P>
<P> Perry said the meeting agreed that the current peace plan ``should be the basis on which all discussions proceed.'' </P>
<P> Perry, who was due to visit American soldiers Tuesday before returning to Washington, said the meeting agreed there should be ``additional pressure'' on the Bosnian Serbs. </P>
<P> ``We agreed that NATO air strikes were an important part of that pressure,'' he said. </P>
<P> Perry also reiterated concern that the Serbian government was not fully enforcing its embargo against the Bosnian Serbs. It was very difficult to shut off the flow of materials over a very long and in some places uncontrolled border, he said. </P>
<P></P>
<P> ``I don't believe that we can depend on that happening, therefore it's equally important to maintain pressure on the Bosnian Serbs ... (through) a robust program of air strikes. </P>
<P> The United Nations has been unwilling to call in anything more than token NATO air strikes because it fears Bosnian Serb reprisals against its lightly armed and dangerously exposed peacekeeping troops. </P>
