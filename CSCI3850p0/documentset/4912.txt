<P>  The exiled Greek Catholic Bishop of Jerusalem challenged Arabs to action Tuesday, telling a meeting on the future of the holy city it was time to stop talking and put their fine words into practice. </P>
<P> ``This statement includes fine, fine words that reflect all our aspirations and desires but what I would like to know is how will this seminar on Jerusalem apply these recommendations?'' Bishop Hilarion Cappucci told the participants at the end of a three-day meeting in Cairo. </P>
<P> ``How will you turn these words into deeds?'' Cappucci added angrily. </P>
<P> Israel arrested Cappucci in 1974 and sentenced him to 12 years in jail for smuggling weapons. He was released and sent to exile in 1977 at the Vatican's intervention. Since then, he has been living in Rome awaiting permission to return. </P>
<P> The final resolutions on the meeting, entitled ``Jerusalem, City of Peace'' and held under the auspices of the Arab League and the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), were long on condemning Israel and asserting Palestinian rights but short on plans of action. </P>
<P> They urged the world to press Israel to stop confiscating Arab land and building settlements on Palestinian land and demanded that Israel give back Arab East Jerusalem, the city holy to Muslims, Christians and Jews. </P>
<P> The meeting was attended by league officials, top Egyptian Christian and Muslim clerics and a representative of King Hassan of Morocco, who chairs the OIC's Qods (Jerusalem) committee. </P>
<P> The Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state but Israel, which captured the eastern half in the Middle East war of 1967, says the whole city is its own eternal and indivisible capital. </P>
