<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, March 28 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Winnie Mandela, sacked as a deputy minister by South African President Nelson Mandela, will travel to her Soweto home, her lawyer said on Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``I have spoken to her and her family is expecting her back in Johannesburg,'' lawyer Templeton Mageza told Reuters, referring to Mrs Mandela's home in the Soweto township. </P>
<P> Mageza would not say if he had advised Mrs Mandela, the president's estranged wife, not to comment on her sacking as deputy minister for arts, culture, science and technology. </P>
<P> Mandela ended weeks of speculation when he dismissed her on Monday in a curt letter delivered to her parliamentary office while he simultaneously announced the decision in Cape Town. </P>
<P> Mandela, who formally separated from his wife in 1992, gave no reason for the dismissal. </P>
<P> African National Congress (ANC) sources said Mrs Mandela had repeatedly defied government discipline and had become an outspoken critic of the president's efforts to keep South Africa's main political streams within a fragile transitional government of national unity. </P>
<P> She is also under police investigation for fraud and misuse of her government office. </P>
<P> Alan Reynolds, spokesman for Mrs Mandela, said she would not address a planned news conference on Tuesday. </P>
<P> Government officials had said earlier that Mrs Mandela, 61, would not have to leave her offices immediately. Presidential spokesman Joel Netshitenze told Reuters she would be given time to vacate the building. </P>
<P> ``There are some conventions applying... There is some period of grace in terms of her office and car, things like that,'' Netshitenze said. </P>
<P> The South African president sacked Mrs Mandela with immediate effect but said it would not affect her positions as an ANC member of parliament or as president of the influential ANC Womens' League. </P>
