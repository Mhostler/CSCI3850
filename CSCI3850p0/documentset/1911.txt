<P>  Testing of a long-term U.N. monitoring program of Iraq's weapons potential has now begun but the United Nations has not set a time limit for the initial surveillance period, according to a report Monday. </P>
<P> The program to make sure Iraq does not reacquire weapons of mass destruction is the last major disarmament project before the Security Council can consider removing sanctions on Iraqi oil exports. </P>
<P> But the report by Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the U.N. Special Commission in charge of dismantling Iraq's dangerous weapons, does not give a time period for testing the program, although Ekeus had once estimated six months. </P>
<P> ``The commission's ongoing monitoring and verification system is provisionally operational,'' the report said. ``The commission believes that the basic elements for a thorough system are now in place.'' </P>
<P> ``The testing of the thoroughness and efficacy of the system has begun,'' the report added.'' </P>
<P> The lack of a time period angered Iraq and was partly behind the troop movements near the Kuwaiti border over the weekend. Iraq's Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf demanded Thursday that Ekeus set a limit of six months to test the program after which sanctions could be eased. </P>
<P> The monitoring is to remain in place even after any sanctions are lifted and also provide data on any weapons programs the commission might not have accounted for in uncovering and destroying Iraq's nuclear, chemical, biological and ballistic weapons. </P>
<P> The report said Iraq had yielded a wealth of data on its past weapons programs. </P>
<P> ``As a result the commission is approaching a full understanding of these past programs,'' the report said. </P>
<P> But Ekeus said some data was still lacking on past programs and that ``great difficulties were faced in obtaining the necessary data'' particularly on biological weapons. </P>
<P> Ekeus, in Baghdad last week, had announced the main contents of the report, which is expected to be formally presented to the Security Council Tuesday but not discussed until later in the week. </P>
<P> The council has not scheduled any debate on its contents. Nor will it formally review sanctions until mid-November. But no member expects a serious consideration of lifting the arms embargo until 1995, after the monitoring program has run for about six months. </P>
<P> Gulf War cease-fire resolution 687 links weapons demands to lifting of Iraqi oil exports. Other demands, such as data on all Kuwaiti prisoners and stolen property, are linked to sanctions on goods imported to Iraq. </P>
<P> But the United States, as opposed to France, Russia, China and Brazil, insisted Iraq has to honor more than the strict legal requirements of the resolution and fulfill all demands. </P>
<P> ``We want to get the attention focused on the lifting of the sanctions that have been biting on the Iraqi people for quite some time,'' Iraqi Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon said, announcing Baghdad would move troops from Kuwait's border. </P>
<P> In turn, U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright was clear that the United States was not tying the oil embargo to weapons demands. ``Our position is the same in that the Iraqis have to abide by all the Security Council resolutions. They cannot decide to honor one and not the other.'' </P>
