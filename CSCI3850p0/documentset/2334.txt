<DATELINE>QUEBEC CITY, Quebec (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Nathalie Tauziat of France beat compatriot Karine Quentrec 7-6 (7-2), 6-2 Monday to win her first-round match at the $150,000 Bell Challenge tournament. </P>
<P> Seeded fourth, Tauziat is trying to repeat her success of a year ago when she won the inaugural edition of this WTA Tour Tier III event by beating Katerina Maleeva of Bulgaria in the final. </P>
<P> The only other seeded players in action on the opening day, seventh-seeded Patricia Hy of Canada and eighth-seeded Elna Reinach of South Africa, both advanced to the second round. Hy beat Angelica Gavaldon of Mexico 6-4, 6-4, while Reinach outlasted Canadian Jana Nejedly 4-6, 6-2, 6-3. </P>
<P> Sonya Jeyaseelan, a Canadian wild-card entry, moved on to a second-round meeting with Reinach when her American opponent, Stephanie Reece, had to retire due to a strained abdominal muscle. </P>
<P> The 18-year-old Jeyaseelan, runner-up to Swiss Martina Hingis in the final of this year's French Open junior event, was ahead 7-5, 1-0 when Reece retired. </P>
<P> The top seed at the Bell Challenge is 15th-ranked Amanda Coetzer of South Africa. Brenda Schultz of the Netherlands, ranked 22nd, is seeded second. </P>
<P> Tauziat, now ranked No. 30, has slipped 12 spots since her victory here last year and plans to take some time off in the new year to try to regain her old form. ``I haven't played well at all this year, starting at the Australian Open,'' said the 27-year-old from Bayonne. </P>
<P> ``I'm going to skip the Australian next year so I can spend a lot of time working on the technical aspects of my game.'' </P>
<P> The 57th-ranked Hy was wary of Gavaldon, ranked 102nd. </P>
<P> ``Angelica is a very aggressive player and so I tried not to give her a chance to get going,'' said Canada's top player. ''Luckily, I served really well in the first set.'' </P>
