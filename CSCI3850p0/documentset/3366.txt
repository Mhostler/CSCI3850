<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Venezuelan government will send the military into some of the nation's most violent prisons to stem the kind of bloodshed that has killed hundreds of inmates in recent months, authorities said Wednesday. </P>
<P> Justice Minister Ruben Creixems told reporters that the National Guard will be dispatched to seven jails throughout Venezuela from Thursday until at least Jan. 31. </P>
<P> ``The object of the militarization is to protect the life of the inmates and to return order to the penal system,'' he said. </P>
<P> The announcement came hours after fresh violence struck the Reten de Catia in Caracas where two inmates died in fighting with other prisoners. </P>
<P> On Monday, 41 inmates stabbed themselves with knives at Tocuyito jail, just west of the capital, to protest conditions in their cells. They were seriously injured with stomach wounds and cuts to their wrists and necks. </P>
<P> The injured prisoners, who spoke to reporters from cells covered in blood, said they were living in inhuman conditions with no water or light. Eight inmates were crammed into cells measuring two square yards, they claimed. </P>
<P> Earlier this month, the nation's leading human rights group, Provea, reported that at least 498 prisoners were killed and 1,127 injured in the year through September. </P>
<P> ``The levels of prison violence continue rising,'' Provea said in its annual report. ``The prison crisis is now of an historic and chronic nature ... Jail riots take place virtually daily.'' </P>
<P> The death toll is due to both the fighting between rival gangs of inmates and killings by security forces, Provea said. </P>
<P> Officials acknowledge that about 25,000 prisoners are crammed into space fit for only 15,000 in Venezuela's 31 penitentiaries. </P>
<P> More than 3,000 inmates were housed in Sabaneta jail, built for just 800 in Venezuela's second city of Maracaibo, at the time of the Jan. 3 riot which killed more than 100 prisoners who were burned or hacked to death with machetes. </P>
<P> Government officials promise improvements by building new jails and rooting out corrupt guards. </P>
