<P>  United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Jose Ayala-Lasso will next week become the first U.N. human rights official to visit Cuba since 1988, sources at the U.NN said. </P>
<P> He will make a four-day official visit to the island, starting Tuesday, a U.N. spokeswoman said Friday. </P>
<P> It comes ahead of the annual meeting in January of the U.N. Human Rights Commission, a 53-member body which has had a special rapporteur (investigator) for Cuba since 1991. It has often been critical of Havana's record. </P>
<P> Ayala-Lasso, a former Ecuadoran diplomat, will meet several ministers as well as representatives of ``all segments of Cuban society,'' according to a brief U.N. statement. </P>
<P> ``The High Commissioner, in keeping with his mandate, will discuss with the Cuban authorities issues related to the promotion and protection of all human rights, including the right to development,'' it added. </P>
<P> In March of this year the Geneva-based Commission approved a United States-sponsored resolution condemning a defiant Cuba for human rights violations. </P>
<P> U.S. delegation chief Geraldine Ferraro portrayed Cuba as a police state barring freedom of religion, assembly and the press. </P>
<P> Since then Peter Paul van Wulfften Palthe, the Dutch chairman of the Commission, told a news conference in September that Cuba and Iran had blocked a widespread move to reform the body and make it more effective. </P>
<P> Cuba's diplomatic mission in Geneva issued a letter sent to the Commission chairman in October which denied responsibility for a lack of results at the reform session. </P>
<P> The last U.N. human rights team to visit Cuba was in 1988 when the government invited a six-member delegation. </P>
<P> Ayala-Lasso, who was named to the new high-profile post last February, will then travel to New York where he is to present his first annual report to the General Assembly on Nov. 21. </P>
