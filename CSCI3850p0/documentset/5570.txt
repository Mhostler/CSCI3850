<P>  Chile and Cuba re-established full diplomatic relations Friday after a 22-year break, officials from the two countries said. </P>
<P> The countries, which have had lower-level consular ties since 1990, will set up embassies in each other's capitals and ''develop ties of friendship,'' a brief Chilean Foreign Ministry statement said. </P>
<P> The move, expected for months, was announced after a meeting between Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza and the Cuban consul in Santiago, Humberto Hernandez, ministry officials said. </P>
<P> In Havana, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina said the move opened new channels and would inspire confidence among business people. </P>
<P> He said it was the result of ``a long, complex process, one that was not tense but was difficult because Chile had to evaulate its internal reality.'' </P>
<P> Chile's Insulza said normal diplomatic ties would ``always be more favorable for the development of democracy and the re-incorporation of Cuba into the Latin American system.'' </P>
<P> He declined to comment directly on whether the move might hurt Chile's relations with the United States, which has kept an economic embargo on Cuba since the early 1960s. </P>
<P> ``The issue here is relations with Cuba, and this country's tradition is that bilateral relations stay always on a bilateral level. So I would rather not comment on relations with third countries,'' Insulza told reporters. </P>
<P> Chile broke off all diplomatic ties with the communist-ruled island on the day a rightist military coup overthrew Marxist president Salvador Allende's elected government in 1973. </P>
<P> Consular ties were not re-established until after Chile returned to civilian rule in 1990. </P>
<P> Chile was one of the few Latin American nations not to have full ties with Cuba, although Chilean businessmen have about $40 million worth of investments on the island. </P>
<P> Economic relations between the two countries include a joint venture between a Chilean firm and the Cuban state citrus enterprise for production of fruit juices in Cuba. </P>
<P> Cuba has also become a popular vacation spot for middle-class Chileans. </P>
