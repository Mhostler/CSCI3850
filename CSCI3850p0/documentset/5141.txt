<P>  Three Mexican police officers tried to mug the eldest son of Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo last week, but were themselves arrested by the young man's bodyguards, officials said on Thursday. </P>
<P> The gun-wielding state policemen surrounded a car carrying Ernesto Zedillo Velasco, 19, and his driver in a wealthy Mexico City suburb last Friday, officials said. </P>
<P> The policemen, unaware of another nearby car carrying presidential bodyguards, tried to hold up Zedillo and his driver before being overpowered and arrested by the bodyguards. </P>
<P> Mexican officials downplayed the incident. </P>
<P> ``It was a simple and unfortunate robbery attempt,'' a spokeswoman at the president's office told Reuters. ``They had no idea who they were sticking up.'' </P>
<P> The three police officers were being held in custody. </P>
