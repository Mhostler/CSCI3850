<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A former army colonel has been arrested and charged with kidnapping four leftist political activists in 1974 under Chile's then-military regime, government sources said Sunday. </P>
<P> Judge Dobra Luksic ordered police Saturday to arrest retired Colonel Marcelo Moren Brito, who at the time of the abductions led a task force at the now-disbanded secret police known as DINA, the sources said. </P>
<P> After questioning him for five hours, Luksic charged Moren Brito with kidnapping and conspiracy and placed him under preventive arrest, said the sources. </P>
<P> It was the first major arrest in a case involving human rights abuses since civilian President Eduardo Frei took office in March. </P>
<P> Such cases often sparked tension between the military and Frei's elected predecessor Patricio Aylwin after he took office in 1990 at the end of 17 years of military rule. </P>
<P> The four leftists, three men and a woman, were kidnapped in Santiago not long after the September 1973 military coup in which General Augusto Pinochet took power. None of them were ever seen alive again. </P>
<P> Most military officers accused of rights abuses were cleared by an amnesty decreed by Pinochet in 1978. </P>
<P> But some judges have interpreted the amnesty as not covering kidnappings in which the victims were never found. </P>
