<P>  Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle predicted Monday that he had the votes to save President Clinton's order strengthening strikes against federal contractors from a Republican effort to overturn it. </P>
<P> ``We had 42 votes last week and I don't know of any votes that have changed,'' Daschle told reporters when asked if he had the votes. </P>
<P> Democrats need only 41 votes to block the Republican effort to overturn Clinton's order because they have launched a filibuster. Republicans need 60 votes to cut if off and force a vote on Clinton's order itself. </P>
<P> The vote was scheduled for 5:30 p.m. EST. </P>
<P> Although Democrats also blocked a Republican attempt two weeks ago to win two-thirds approval of an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to reguire balanced budgets, Daschle said Democrats are not simply trying to block Republican proposals. </P>
<P> ``It's a vote that we hope will be very significant,'' he said. ``Working people are going to be watching this afternoon whether or not the Senate will ... stand up for a 60-year-old principle that there ought to be the right to strike.'' </P>
<P> But Republicans said Clinton's order to deny federal contracts to companies that replace strikers with permanent employes will upset the balance between management and labor and give strikers the power to close companies down. </P>
<P> The Republicans won a test vote 57-42 last week on their proposal to deny Clinton any money to carry out the order, enough to easily win the fund cut-off but not the 60 needed to cut off the Democrats' filibuster. </P>
<P> Filibusters are a Senate parliamentary protection that allows a minority to block a vote unless the majority can muster at least 60 votes to end the filibuster. </P>
<P> Republicans and Democrats both argued the dispute has wider implications. </P>
<P> Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, a Republican presidential candidate, called Clinton's action ``a political power grab and pay off'' to labor unions for supporting Clinton. </P>
<P> But Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., called the Republican proposal an attack on strikers and part of a ``Republican reign of terror against working men and women, against the elderly and against the children in need.'' </P>
