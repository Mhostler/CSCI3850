<P>  Indonesian soldiers have captured a member of East Timor's anti-annexation Fretilin group during a gunfight west of Dili, a military spokesman said Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``Mario Jose was arrested Tuesday afternoon in Ainaro Regency along with a gun, several bullets, two grenades and 300,000 rupiah ($135),'' spokesman Major Laedan Simbolon told Reuters by telephone from Dili, East Timor's capital. </P>
<P> Simbolon said Jose was arrested 65 miles west of Dili. He said Jose was the third Fretilin member held in the past week. </P>
<P> Two members of Fretilin, a ragged band of rebels who have long fought for independence from Indonesia, surrendered May 10 after a gunfight in which two other separatists were killed. </P>
<P> East Timor's military commander, Col. Kiki Syahnakri, said 176 Fretilin members still operated in the territory. </P>
<P> Indonesian forces invaded East Timor in 1975 after Portuguese colonialists left and annexed the territory a year later. Indonesia's rule over the territory is not recognized by the United Nations. </P>
