<P>  Jimmy Garcia of Colombia, badly beaten in a losing challenge for the World Boxing Council super featherweight title Saturday, was listed in critical condition after surgery to remove a blood clot in his brain, a hospital spokeswoman said. </P>
<P> Garcia was taken to intensive care following the two-hour operation, the spokeswoman for University Hospital Medical Center said. </P>
<P> Referee Mitch Halpern stopped his fight against champion Gabriel Ruelas less than 30 seconds into the 11th round and Garcia passed out in his corner immediately afterwards. </P>
<P> He had oxygen administered to him and was conscious when he was taken from the ring on a stretcher and driven to the hospital. </P>
<P> It was the second serious head injury suffered by a boxer in the last three months. </P>
<P> In February, American Gerald McClellan nearly died after collapsing following a loss to Nigel Benn in Britain. He also underwent surgery for removal of a blood clot in his brain. </P>
