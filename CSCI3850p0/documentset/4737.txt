<DATELINE>TALLINN, Estonia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Votes were still being counted early Monday after Estonia's general election, but opposition centrist leader Tiit Vaehi was already talking about opening negotiations on forming a new government for the Baltic state. </P>
<P> Officials said Vaehi's Coalition Party and Rural Peoples' Union (KMU) would be the largest coalition in the new parliament but would not have a majority on its own. </P>
<P> ``We should wait for the final results and then we have to talk with possible coalition partners on policy, then we have to start to talk about government,'' Vaehi told Reuters early Monday. </P>
<P> With about two-thirds of the vote counted, officials said, the KMU had won 32.6 percent, which would give it an estimated 42 seats in the 101-member parliament. Turnout in Sunday's election was put at about 70 percent. </P>
<P> Vaehi, satisfied but stony-faced, said he was ready to start discussions with three other parties but declined to say which of them he favored. ``We will sit down later this morning, then we will decide,'' he said. </P>
<P> The right-leaning Reform Party/Liberals led by Central Bank Governor Siim Kallas was running second with 16.4 percent of the vote and an estimated 19 seats. </P>
<P> Kallas, who traded insults and allegations with Vaehi during the closing stages of the campaign, said it remained possible that he could join his rival in a coalition. ``It's complicated, but it is possible,'' he told Reuters. </P>
<P> The Centrists led by Edgar Savisaar, like Vaehi a former prime minister now in opposition, stood third with 14.2 percent of the votes and a probable 16 seats. </P>
<P> As predicted by opinion polls, the Fatherland party which had dominated the government since the last elections in 1992 fared badly. It was likely to get only seven seats. </P>
<P> Fatherland leader Mart Laar, who quit as prime minister when his party and the ruling coalition split, predicted that Vaehi would have to bridge pre-election divides to form a workable coalition. </P>
<P> Ethnic Russians and Russian-speakers, who form a sizeable minority of about one-third, were allowed to vote for the first time since Estonia's independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. </P>
