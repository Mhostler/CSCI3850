<P> SARAJEVO - Serb troops crossed the boundary of the U.N.-designated safe area around the Bosnian town of Bihac and were threatening to capture the last remaining high ground held by the Muslim-led government army, U.N. sources said. Serb forces appeared to be forcing a new front on the edge of town as the United Nations tried to broker a cease-fire. </P>
<P> Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic said Serb forces had captured a key hill south of the embattled safe area in a fierce attack. U.N. sources confirmed heavy fighting in the area of Bihac town but were unable to corroborate Silajdzic's report that Debeljaca hill had fallen. </P>
<P> BRUSSELS - With Serb forces closing in on Bihac, NATO backed away from endorsing a U.S. plan to save the Bosnian town by threatening air strikes and extending its so-called safe-haven status. NATO diplomatic sources said an outline agreement was falling apart over the question of which countries would provide matching ground support to ensure the plan's success. </P>
<P> SARAJEVO - U.NN officials said Bosnian Serbs had detained 55 Canadian U.N. soldiers outside Sarajevo and some 200 French, Russian and Ukrainian U.N. soldiers were trapped by a Serb blockade of weapons dumps. The detentions came after Bosnian Serbs threatened ``an all-out war'' in retaliation for NATO air raids Monday and Wednesday which hit an airfield and destroyed radars and anti-aircraft missiles in several Serb-held locations. </P>
<P> ZAGREB - An armored United Nations re-supply convoy made it safely through Serb territory in the Bihac pocket and was more than half way to its destination at a beleaguered U.N. peacekeeper base. U.N. sources said the convoy of mostly armoured personnel carriers, carrying emergency rations, food and fuel for 1,200 stranded Bangladeshi peacekeepers, had safely crossed territory held by rebel Croatian Serbs and was now inside the Muslim-controlled Bihac pocket. </P>
<P> MOSCOW - Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev accused Bosnian Muslims of provoking Bosnian and Kraijna Serbs and trying to draw NATO into fighting on their side. ``The Muslim side launched its latest offensive with the clear intention of involving NATO and other third forces in fighting on its side, achieving the lifting of the arms embargo and, of course, ensuring air strikes,'' he said at a meeting with a group of Russian journalists. ``Kraijna and Bosnian Serbs ... always respond without restraint,'' he said, according to Interfax news agency. </P>
<P> SARAJEVO - One person was killed and two others were wounded when a suspected Serb rocket propelled grenade hit a cafe in Sarajevo, witnesses said. The Holiday Inn hotel, home to the foreign media in the Bosnian capital, was also hit by a rocket, according to United Nations sources, and nearby buildings were hit. </P>
<P> OSLO - The United Nations may have to pull out of Bosnia if the situation deteriorates as a result of fighting around Bihac, U.N. mediator Thorvald Stoltenberg said. ``There is a risk that the U.N. may have to withdraw from Bosnia if the situation gets much worse,'' he told the Norwegian news agency NTB. </P>
