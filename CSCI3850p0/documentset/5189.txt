<P>  Following several incidents where journalists have complained of mistreatment by Haiti's government, officials say efforts are under way to balance the need for security with respect for free speech in this nascent democracy. </P>
<P> Journalists and government officials held a rare meeting at the National Palace on Friday to try to mediate tensions after palace security guards damaged a video camera and seized the cameraman's videotape because he recorded the beating of a man on palace grounds earlier in the week. </P>
<P> The incident is causing some journalists to question whether President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's government will be equipped to handle the deluge of journalists arriving to cover the March 31 visit of President Clinton and United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. They will participate in a ceremony to transfer command for some 7,000 multinational troops in Haiti to UN control. </P>
<P> Officials say an estimated 200 journalists are expected to arrive in the White House press pool alone. </P>
<P> ``It is extremely important that journalists know that in the current political reality, the security of the president and the palace staff requires special attention,'' said palace spokesman Yvon Neptune. ``We are creating this experience of democracy together. We have many things to learn together.'' </P>
<P> Five Haitian journalists leaving the palace grounds Wednesday watched as security guards shoved a visitor to the ground and began kicking him. </P>
<P> The unidentified man had come to the defense of another man who managed to penetrate the palace gates because he said he wanted to talk to Aristide. </P>
<P> Jean Claude Juste, a cameraman for the Miami-based Haitian Television Network, says he was first warned and then pushed by two palace security guards who threatened to arrest him for videotaping the scene. </P>
<P> Juste claims the guards forcibly yanked the cassette out of his video camera causing the device to break. </P>
<P> ``One cannot accept this,'' said HTN reporter Kiner Bousicout who witnessed the incident. ``With every government we are the victims. They must respect freedom of the press.'' </P>
<P> Aristide was restored to power by U.S.-led multinational troops nearly six months ago. </P>
