<P>  Hillary Rodham Clinton left no doubt Thursday that she remains committed to seeing that all Americans get the health care they need even if it takes longer than she had hoped to reach that goal. </P>
<P> In her first speech on the topic since Democratic congressional leaders formally announced the death of health reform efforts this year, the First Lady told a group of medical students that health reform is not a 15-round political ``boxing match'' but a long journey that is morally and economically important to the American people. </P>
<P> ``You know why it is so vital to achieve universal coverage,'' she told the George Washington University students. </P>
<P> She talked about some of the parents she has met in travels across the country who have voiced fears about not being able to take their children to a doctor and about health care workers she has met who have talked about their frustrations in trying to help the millions of uninsured Americans. </P>
<P> President Clinton made health care the domestic centerpiece of his administration and put his wife in charge of a high-profile health care task force. Its death in Congress was a major defeat. </P>
