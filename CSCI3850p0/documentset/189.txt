<P>  The chief human rights monitor in Haiti packed his bags Tuesday, accusing Haiti's military leaders of abusing their power and vowing that he and his 100-man mission will return. </P>
<P> ``We expect to be back here. When we left in October, everybody gave us up for dead and we came back,'' diplomat Colin Granderson said, referring to the team's temporary departure after a group of thugs prevented the USS Harlan County from docking in Port-au-Prince. </P>
<P> Granderson said the mission would leave Port-au-Prince late Wednesday afternoon aboard an Air France flight to the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe. </P>
<P> Haiti's military-backed government ordered the human rights observers to leave by Wednesday, saying their presence was destabilizing the country. </P>
<P> ``We find that a handful of individuals hungry for vain glory and for whom power is based only in the barrel of their guns have chosen to divert national sovereignty for their benefit to the detriment of the well-being of an entire people,'' Granderson said. </P>
<P> He paid tribute to the observers who have catalogued human rights abuses by the military, and called their work a tedious and thankless task. </P>
<P> ``It is with a heavy heart that we are leaving the country,'' Granderson said, but ``They leave with their heads held high.'' </P>
<P> U.N. workers planned to spend the rest of Tuesday packing up equipment from their headquarters in Montagne Noir. </P>
<P> ``It's very very sad. I'm very disappointed,'' said a mission member who has worked with the United Nations in more than a dozen countries. </P>
<P> ``This is the first time I've ever been kicked out. I've been led out of places at gunpoint before but never kicked out.'' </P>
