<DATELINE>CHICAGO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A fiery Thanksgiving Day crash that killed six people and injured nine involved a General Motors Corp. pickup truck equipped with controversial side-mounted fuel tanks, police said Friday. </P>
<P> The accident occurred Thursday night on Chicago's south side, when a 1985 Chevrolet C/K pickup truck veered across an expressway median into oncoming traffic. It crashed head-on into a Honda Accord sedan that was carrying four people. </P>
<P> After striking the first vehicle, the pickup truck went into a spin and burst into flames, slamming into a second car. </P>
<P> The resulting blaze sent flames shooting dozens of feet in the air above Interstate 57, police reported. </P>
<P> Killed were the driver of the pickup truck and his woman passenger, both in their 20s, along with a 57-year-old woman, a 64-year-old man, a baby boy about 18 months old, and another female passenger, 17. Nine people were injured, some seriously. </P>
<P> The crash immediately prompted critics of GM's full-size C/K pickup trucks to renew their demands that GM recall the vehicles. </P>
<P> The trucks are equipped with fuel tanks mounted outside their frame rails, a design that critics claim makes the vehicles especially dangerous in side-impact crashes. </P>
<P> The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has asked GM to recall the trucks, but GM has refused and maintains the trucks are safe and met federal safety standards at the time they were built. </P>
<P> ``After this latest, most terrible crash, we call on GM to stop the 20-year stonewall and recall its exploding firebombs before they kill again,'' said Clarence Ditlow, director of the Center for Auto Safety and the trucks' leading critic. </P>
<P> About six million of the trucks, made from 1973-1987, are still on the road, and Ditlow claims they are responsible for more than 300 deaths in fiery side-impact crashes. </P>
<P> The Chicago tragedy is likely to be discussed at a Dec. 6 public hearing that NHTSA plans to help determine whether it should try to force a recall. </P>
<P> GM has sued to stop the hearing, which it fears will result in negative publicity, including emotional testimony from families of accident victims. </P>
<P> GM spokesman Ed Lechtzin said available details were insufficient to judge the cause of the fire in the Chicago crash. </P>
<P> ``From the sketchy details now available, it appears to be a very high speed frontal impact between two vehicles with a resulting post-collision fire,'' Lechtzin said. </P>
