<DATELINE>LUSAKA, Zambia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Angola's civil war foes signed an agreement Sunday to end 19 years of fighting but diplomats said UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi's decision to delegate signing to a lower official diminished the accord. </P>
<P> The agreement was signed by Angolan Foreign Minister Venancio de Moura and UNITA secretary-general Eugenio Manuvakola in the Zambian capital Lusaka before hundreds of representatives from 29 countries. </P>
<P> Peacemakers, including U.N. chief negotiator Alioune Blondin Beye, could barely hide their anger at Savimbi for his last-minute decision to spurn an Angolan government guarantee of safe passage and send a subordinate to sign the accord. </P>
<P> Savimbi's failure to show up in Lusaka, despite pleas for him to sign from world leaders including President Clinton, was seen by Angolan and other African officials as a snub. </P>
<P> ``This protocol can't stop the fighting. It has no value because Savimbi has not signed it. There is a lot of distrust,'' one Angolan state negotiator said. </P>
<P> A senior Zimbabwean official added: ``This diminishes the whole peace process. There is no seriousness.'' </P>
<P> But a Zambian official told Reuters as ushers led diplomats and southern African leaders to seats at a large, round table in the whitewashed Mulungushi Center that the accord could still end Angola's war, which has been fought continuously since independence from Portugal in 1975. </P>
<P> ``This is surely history in the making for the long-suffering Angolan people, for southern Africa and the world. Hopefully after today there will be no more war, no more tears,'' the official said. </P>
<P> Beye, who negotiated the accord in Zambia over the past year, praised both Savimbi and Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos for their peace efforts. </P>
<P> ``Dos Santos put aside legitimate considerations which would have been difficult to reconcile in order to consolidate national reconciliation,'' Beye said. ``Savimbi contributed in a significant way to the completion of the peace process.'' </P>
<P> Sunday's accord is the climax to tortuous negotiations to stop a war that has killed hundreds of thousands of people, turned millions of others into refugees and brought the oil- and diamond-rich southern African country to its knees. </P>
<P> African heads of state led by Zimbabwean President Robert Mugae, head of southern Africa's Frontline states charged with ending regional conflicts, and Zambian President Frederick Chiluba, made no statement after meeting Saturday. They had been due to meet again Sunday prior to the signing. </P>
<P> Last week's signing ceremony was postponed after UNITA refused to sign because of a government military offensive against rebel strongholds. </P>
<P> UNITA's headquarters at Huambo, in central Angola, were overrun by government troops who later took over other rebel-controlled areas in the north. </P>
<P> UNITA charged that this was a violation of the accord, initialled by the two sides on Oct. 31, and a truce they declared on Nov. 15. The government said the war was not over until a cease-fire took effect -- two days after the pact's formal signing. </P>
<P> Zambian and U.N. sources said the United Nations had warned the Angolan government to stop its offensive once the peace agreement was signed Sunday. </P>
<P> ``The U.N. has made it clear they will deal with the Angolan government firmly should it continue fighting after tomorrow's signing,'' one Zambian official said. </P>
