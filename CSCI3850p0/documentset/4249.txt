<P>  Police shot and killed three Muslim militants in southern Egypt Thursday for resisting arrest, police sources said. </P>
<P> They said the militants opened fire at police who had surrounded a house where the gunmen were hiding in a village in Minya province, some 160 miles south of Cairo. Police in turn returned fire and killed them, they added. </P>
<P> Police have often accused militants of firing first, forcing them to respond, but human rights groups say the security forces were implementing a government shoot-to-kill policy. </P>
<P> The Egyptian Organization for Human Rights Wednesday condemned escalating violence between police and militants in the south of the country and warned it could result in Algerian-style civil conflict. </P>
<P> It said in a report security forces were hitting militants with operations which harmed innocent civilians ``by means of mass punishment, curfews, random arrests, detention and many inhumane and degrading practices.'' </P>
<P> The report was based on field work in Minya, the focus of militant-related violence in recent months. It said 64 people were killed in Minya in January alone, out of 87 in all Egypt. </P>
