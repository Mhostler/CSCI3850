<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The United States spoke out publicly Monday for the first time about Kurdish members of Turkey's parliament now on trial and expressed concern they had been criminally charged by Ankara for ``expressing their own thoughts.'' </P>
<P> But State Department deputy spokeswoman Christine Shelly steered clear of indicating how Washington might react if the parliamentarians, who face the death penalty, receive that sentence after an expected verdict Thursday. </P>
<P> ``We have repeatedly expressed to the Turkish government our deep concern over the trials and their implications for democracy and freedom of expression in Turkey,'' Shelly said. </P>
<P> ``It's difficult for most foreign observers to understand how MPs (members of parliament) could be stripped of their immunity and put on trial for expressing their thoughts, including in some instances, thoughts expressed before the Helsinki Commission of the U.S. Congress and the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace,'' a local think-tank, she told reporters. </P>
<P> Asked why the Clinton administration, which has at various times stressed the importance of human rights, had not made public its concerns over the case before this, Shelly said, ''... this issue (of the parliamentarians) has been one that we've discussed in diplomatic channels.'' </P>
<P> The administration hoped ``a quieter approach ... was most likely to result in what we hoped would be another look at the issue,'' she said. She declined to divulge Turkey's response. </P>
<P> The case was brought dramatically to public attention when one of the defendants, Leyla Zana, wrote a piece on the parliamentarians' plight in Monday's Washington Post. </P>
<P> Zana said she and seven other Kurdish members of Turkey's parliament were guilty of one thing -- ``bearing witness to the Kurdish people's immense tragedy in Turkey'' -- and warned that if Kurdish yearnings are not met, Islamic fundamentalism could overrun Turkey, a NATO member, just like it overran Iran. </P>
<P> Turkey's army has destroyed Kurdish villages and death squads have killed more than 2,000 political and human rights activists, Zana said. </P>
<P> In addition, some six million Kurds have been forced into western Turkey by ``state terror and economic collapse because of a war now in its 11th year,'' she said, referring to the conflict between the government in Ankara and the separatist insurgency of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). </P>
<P> ``Elected in 1991 by Kurds to represent and defend their interests and aspirations, we obviously could not remain silent,'' said Zana, the 33-year-old mother of two children. </P>
<P> ``Our duty as legislators was to speak out, explore all paths to end this frightful war which has torn our country asunder and seek a peaceful settlement for Turkey's 15 million Kurds in a framework of democracy and existing frontiers.'' </P>
<P> The United States has in the past criticized Turkey's human rights record. </P>
<P> Its most recent worldwide rights survey issued last February said ``incidents of torture and excessive use of force by security personnel persisted'' and also accused Turkey of ''mystery killings'' and restrictions on freedom of expression and association. </P>
<P> But the matter of Turkey's human rights record is a sensitive one for Washington as Turkey is a strategically important member of NATO at the crossroads of Europe and Asia. </P>
<P> Its support has also been important on a number of issues, including holding the line on sanctions imposed on Iraq after the Gulf War. </P>
