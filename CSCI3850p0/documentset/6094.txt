<DATELINE>MUNICH, Germany (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  One of Munich's most popular beer gardens will have to shut its taps and stop its oompah bands at 9.30 every evening because neighbors have complained about the noise. </P>
<P> The Bavarian Administrative Court ruled Thursday that the residents' right to peace and quiet took precedence over what it called the social function of beer gardens. </P>
<P> But the court rejected the neighbors' demands to limit the popular 4,000-seat Waldwirtschaft garden to only 500 seats and force it to stay closed every other Sunday. </P>
<P> Beer gardens were a traditional part of Bavarian culture and could not be forced to close on certain days, it said. </P>
<P> The court originally agreed to the closings two years ago but re-pened the case after prominent citizens protested that grumpy neighbors were ruining the 400-year-old beer garden. </P>
