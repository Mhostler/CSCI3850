<P>  Jordan's king Hussein on Thursday invited to Amman the sister of an American woman allegedly murdered by her Jordanian husband in New Jersey. </P>
<P> King Hussein made the offer during a meeting with five U.S. lawmakers seeking his help in the killing allegedly by Muhammad Ismail Abequa, Jordanian officials said. </P>
<P> Abequa, a naturalized U.S. citizen, is in a Jordanian jail. He is wanted by New Jersey authorities in connection with the killing of his Turkish-born wife, Nihal. </P>
<P> Nihal was found dead July 10 in the couple's Parsipanny-Troy Hills home. </P>
<P> ``His Majesty passed a personal invitation to (the sister Nesime Dekour) to come and visit her niece Lisa and nephew Sami, in Amman where they are staying with their father's family,'' one official said. </P>
<P> The official added that they will try to arrange for Dekour to arrive in Amman by Monday. </P>
<P> American officials want Jordan to hand Abequa, 45, over for trial in the United States, but Jordan and the United States do not have an extradition treaty.  On Wednesday, Jordan's prime minister promised Abequa would get a fair trial in Amman, Jordanian officials said. </P>
<P> Jordanian authorities arrested Abequa following requests by the United States. He has been charged with premeditated murder. </P>
