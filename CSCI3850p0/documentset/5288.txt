<P> Release at 10 a.m.  Religious news was depicted in more favorable light on television in 1994 than a year earlier, according to a study released Wednesday. </P>
<P> The Media Research Council, a conservative group that monitors news coverage, said network coverage of religious matters ``did improve somewhat on last year's recommendation not to sensationalize religion and did present more of the good news religion can bring ...'' </P>
<P> But it also called on television networks to still do more stories on the ``positive influence'' of religion. </P>
<P> This was the second religion study by the organization. Its new findings said in prime time programming religion was portrayed in a positive way over negative depictions by two to one -- 44 percent to 23 percent. </P>
<P> That was a reversal of 1993, the media group said, when negative stories outnumbered positive ones by 56 percent to 26 percent. </P>
<P> CBS was the only network, the organization said, where a majority -- 55 percent -- of the prime-time portrayals were positive. Fox followed with 46 percent, NBC with 38 percent and ABC with 36 percent. ABC led in 1993 with 37 percent. </P>
<P> In 1994, the number of network news stories about violence and harassment at abortion clinics increased to 245 stories compared to 150 in 1993. </P>
<P> The organization counted fewer stories about homosexuals in 1994 -- 105 -- than the 756 in 1993 when gays in the military was a top issue, the group said. </P>
<P> Stories about the Roman Catholic Church dominated news coverage, the organization said, with stories about Protestant denominations getting less coverage than ``New Age spirituality.'' </P>
