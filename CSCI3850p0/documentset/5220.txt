<DATELINE>PHNOM PENH, March 27 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Cambodian army units have clashed with Khmer Rouge guerrillas near the northwest rebel stronghold of Phnom Malai but a senior army commander on Monday denied the army intended to capture the base. </P>
<P> Deputy Chief of Staff of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF), Lieutenant-General Nhek Bun Chhay told Reuters that government forces were fighting with Khmer Rouge guerrillas south of the Cambodian border town of Poipet. </P>
<P> ``No, we don't have any plan to attack Phnom Malai. Three days ago Khmer Rouge came to an area called Klar Ngap south of Poipet but they were intercepted by the army,'' Bun Chhay said. </P>
<P> He declined to give more information about the fighting. </P>
<P> RCAF Commander-in-Chief Lieutenant-General Ke Kim Yan refused to deny or confirm the fighting claim. </P>
<P> ``Nobody ever tells you in advance about military plans -- wait and see,'' he told Reuters by telephone from his headquarters at the National Defence Ministry. </P>
<P> However, reliable defence sources told Reuters on Monday that the government was mobilising its forces close to Phnom Malai and had deployed four new T-55 medium tanks to northwest Sisophon. </P>
<P> A reliable government source said Thai military commanders on the border near Aranyaprathet told their Cambodian counterparts by telephone earlier on Monday that shells which landed in Thailand near the border town could have been fired from Khmer Rouge positions at Phnom Malai. </P>
<P> The Thais said the Khmer Rouge might have fired the shells to upset planned talks between Second Prime Minister Hun Sen and his Thai counterpart scheduled for Wednesday. </P>
