<P>  The deadly Unabomber sent letters to two Nobel Prize winning scientists living in Massachusetts warning them to give up their work into genetics and computers, FBI officials and newspapers reported. </P>
<P> In a statement late Monday, the FBI said Richard Roberts, who is head of research for New England Biolabs in Beverly, Mass., had received one of four letters apparently sent by the Unabomber April 20. </P>
<P> The Boston Globe in its Tuesday editions quoted unnamed sources as saying that another of those letters was sent to Phillip Sharp, 51, head of the biology department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. </P>
<P> Sharp and Roberts shared the Nobel Prize in 1993 for their separate work on DNA molecule structures. </P>
<P> The Herald said the letters to both men contained warnings to stop their genetic research or face consequences. </P>
<P> The one to Roberts, postmarked Oakland, Calif., was received on April 24, the day a package bomb from the Unabomber killed timber industry lobbyist Gilbert Murray in Sacramento, Calif., the FBI said. </P>
<P> Two women who answered the phone at Sharp's home in Newton, Mass., declined comment. </P>
<P> Sharp and Roberts had both been named in a letter authorities believe the Unabomber sent to the New York Times last month, the first time the mysterious bomber had issued such a warning. The Times witheld the names at the FBI's request, the Herald reported. </P>
<P> ``The people we are out to get are ... scientists and engineers, especially in critical fields like computers and genetics,'' said the letter published by the Times. </P>
<P> A fourth letter went to Yale University geneticist David Gelertner, who had been injured previously by a mail bomb. </P>
<P> Letter bombs from the Unabomber have killed two people and injured 23 since 1978. </P>
