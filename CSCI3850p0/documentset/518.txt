<DATELINE>WARSAW (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  More than 200,000 victims of the 1944 Warsaw Uprising against Nazi occupation were honored as national heroes Monday as Poland marked the 50th anniversary of one of World War Two's bloodiest battles. </P>
<P> President Lech Walesa joined hundreds of veterans of the uprising at an outdoor mass said by Poland's Roman Catholic primate, Cardinal Jozef Glemp, commemorating the 63-day struggle in which the Polish capital was almost completely destroyed. </P>
<P> Thousands of red-and-white Polish flags fluttered over the city as medal-wearing veterans took communion in the central Marshal Jozef Pilsudski Square. Many, including Glemp and Walesa, were sheltered from the blazing sun by umbrellas. </P>
<P> ``The Warsaw Uprising has a key importance to the Europe of the second half of the 20th century,'' Polish-born Pope John Paul said in a message read out by papal nuncio Jozef Kowalczyk, the Vatican's diplomatic envoy in Warsaw. </P>
<P> ``It was the beginning of the process of shaping independent states in central and eastern Europe which could be fully carried out only in 1989 after the collapse of the totalitarian systems,'' he said, referring to the end of communist rule. </P>
<P> Foreign leaders, including German President Roman Herzog, U.S. Vice President Al Gore and British Prime Minister John Major, were due to attend the main ceremonies at the city's huge Warsaw Uprising Monument Monday evening. </P>
<P> The outgunned insurgents, who began the uprising August 1, 1944, were forced to surrender by October 2 without achieving their aim of taking control of Warsaw before the Soviet army arrived and established communist rule. </P>
<P> Soviet troops stood immobile east of Warsaw as the Germans pummelled and starved the insurgents into capitulation, while armed assistance from the west was impossible. Mercy airlifts by the Western allies had only limited success. </P>
<P> Poles regard the uprising as a heroic struggle for their homeland and it helped shape their outlook on the modern world. </P>
