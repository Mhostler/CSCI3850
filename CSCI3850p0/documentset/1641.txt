<P>  Egyptian police rounded up some 35 suspected Muslim militants in the Red Sea tourist resort of Hurghada Wednesday after a German tourist and two Egyptians were shot and killed in its marketplace, security sources said. </P>
<P> Witnesses said a German man and an Egyptian woman were wounded Tuesday night's attack when two gunmen drew up in a small truck and sprayed automatic rifle fire at a group of German tourists from Berlin shopping in the bazaar. </P>
<P> An official at the German embassy said the wounded German, Markus Matsche, was flown to Cairo Wednesday and was in stable condition. </P>
<P> The official identified the dead German as Alexander Molks. German sources said he and the injured man were among a group of eight Berliners who had gone shopping together. </P>
<P> Witnesses said the gunmen fled into a nearby poor residential neighborhood. </P>
<P> The Interior Ministry said in a statement the identity of the gunmen was unknown. But security sources said police picked up 35 suspected militants following the attack. </P>
<P> Some security sources said they believed the militant Gama'a al-Islamiya (Islamic Group), which has been trying to undermine the government by damaging Egypt's lucrative tourist industry, was responsible for the attack. </P>
<P> The group, which aims to set up a strict Islamic state, has claimed responsibility for a number of attacks this year. </P>
<P> Tuesday's incident was the first such attack in the normally safe resort of Hurghada, 300 miles south of Cairo. </P>
<P> In another attack, Muslim militants struck at a train heading from Cairo to the southern tourist town of Aswan and wounded two Egyptians, security sources said. </P>
<P> No foreign tourists were on the train, the sources added. </P>
<P> More than 450 people have been killed since the militants began their violent campaign against the government in 1992. </P>
