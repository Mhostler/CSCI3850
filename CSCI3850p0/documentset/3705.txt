<DATELINE>LUANDA, Angola (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Angola's main Catumbela air base was rocked by explosions following a fire Tuesday night, a military source in the capital Luanda said Wednesday. </P>
<P> The source said Catumbela contained the majority of Angola's estimated 130 operational MiG and Sukhoi attack planes, as well as transport aircraft and attack and transport helicopters, but none was damaged. </P>
<P> There was no word on casualties or the cause of the fire and explosions. It was not clear what facilities were damaged. </P>
<P> A World Food Program spokesman said the U.N. organization's aid planes had landed normally at the base Wednesday. Runways were apparently undamaged. </P>
<P> A government source in the southern port of Benguela said the blasts could be heard from the city, 19 miles south of Catumbela. </P>
<P> ``The firemen were working all through the night and it seems to be under control now,'' he said Wednesday morning. </P>
<P> An Antonov transport aircraft landed at Catumbela Tuesday evening and the explosions started soon afterwards, he said. </P>
<P> Aircraft based in Catumbela were used in bombing raids against UNITA rebel positions before the signing of a cease-fire between the Angolan government and UNITA two months ago halting 19 years of civil war. </P>
