<P> Release at 6 p.m  Fish oil capsules, already touted as a way to keep heart disease at bay, may also be useful at warding off kidney failure in people suffering from the kidney disease known as IgA nephropathy. </P>
<P> Researchers from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., had 55 sufferers take 12 grams of fish oil or an olive oil placebo daily for two years. </P>
<P> After a four-year period, 40 percent of the placebo recipients had died or developed kidney failure, compared with only 10 percent of the people in the fish oil group, according to the study, published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine. </P>
<P> The researchers found no serious side effects to the treatment. ``The only complaint, by some patients in the fish oil group, was of a fishy aftertaste despite the addition of peppermint oil to the fish oil,'' said the research team, led by Dr James Donadio. </P>
<P> Kidney failure usually develops in roughly 30 percent of people with IgA nephropathy. Kidney failure typically occurs five to 25 years after the nephropathy is discovered by doctors. </P>
<P> Past studies of fish oil supplements, involving fewer volunteers, have produced inconsistent results, so further tests are needed, the Donadio group said. </P>
<P> In an editorial in the Journal, Dr Charles van Ypersele de Strihou of the University of Louvain Medical School in Brussels, said the approach by the Mayo team is ``promising'' because fish oil doesn't have the potential side effects associated with conventional drugs. </P>
<P> The drawback of a fishy taste is ``a very small price indeed if its promises are fulfilled in the long term,'' he said. </P>
