<P>  Miami's Cuban exile community Tuesday pressed the White House to allow Cuban refugees in U.S. detention to come to the United States. </P>
<P> The Cuban American National Foundation (CANF), a powerful anti-Castro lobbying group, has presented proposals to President Clinton suggesting that the more than 34,000 Cubans detained in Miami, Panama and the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay be released.. </P>
<P> ``We do have a number of proposals we have presented to the White House,'' said foundation spokesman Fernando Rojas. </P>
<P> CANF also held a news conference to present a proposal for resettlement in the United States of children held at Guantanamo. </P>
<P> CANF Chairman Jorge Mas Canosa met with Clinton in August when the administration was formulating a refugee policy barring Cuban boat people from the United States for the first time in 30 years. Since then, Cubans picked up at sea have been housed in refugee camps. </P>
<P> Exiles also have staged demonstrations to call for the release of detainees. On Saturday, more than 12,000 gathered in a park in a Miami suburb to demand the release of Cubans held in U.S. detention. </P>
<P> Last Wednesday, about 300 members of a group called Mothers and Women Against Repression in Cuba demonstrated in downtown Miami to demand the release of detained children. </P>
<P> The U.S. Justice Department has said repeatedly that Cubans at Guantanamo and in Panama will not be eligible for the 20,000 visas per year granted to Cubans unless they return to Cuba. </P>
<P> When the United States first announced the new refugee policy, many exile leaders applauded the change, saying Cuban President Fidel Castro should not dictate U.S. immigration policy. </P>
<P> But experts said the shift in attitude is not surprising. </P>
<P> ``There'll be increasing sympathy for the Cubans detained,'' said Thomas Boswell, a geography professor at the University of Miami, ``Most of the Cuban-Americans who are here now are immigrants themselves... They sympathize with people who left under conditions similar to the reasons they left.'' </P>
