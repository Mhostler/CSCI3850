<P>  France Thursday joined other major powers in pledging to help any country that comes under nuclear attack, providing that country has renounced nuclear weapons. </P>
<P> ``France has decided to give five security assurances and guarantees to non-nuclear states party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT),'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Richard Duque told reporters. </P>
<P> The world's nuclear powers are increasingly confident they can make the NPT, which is designed to prevent more states acquiring the bomb, into a permanent agreement when the pact comes up for renewal later this month. </P>
<P> In an effort to meet criticism from many developing countries that could still block indefinite extension of the NPT, the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France are offering security assurances. </P>
<P> The NPT, which came into force in 1970 for a period of 25 years, covers more than 170 states and is the only global agreement that helps prevent the spread of nuclear arms. </P>
<P> It commits the five declared nuclear states not to transfer nuclear weapons to others and non-nuclear states not to acquire them. </P>
<P> The ``Big Five'' argue that a vote for an extension at a four-week conference in New York beginning on April 17 is the only way to ensure rogue states do not get their hands on the bomb. </P>
