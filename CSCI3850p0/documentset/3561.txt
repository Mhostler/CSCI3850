<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Many Americans who could be saving money for retirement are unwilling to take that step and cut back on eating out, buying higher-priced groceries and seeing movies, according to a survey released Tuesday. </P>
<P> Of the 68 percent of respondents who said they could save money by eating out less often, only 18 percent said they were very likely to do so, said the yearlong study by the non-profit Public Agenda Foundation, a research group. </P>
<P> More than half, 55 percent, said there was room to cut back by grocery shopping more carefully, yet only 30 percent said they were very likely to do that. </P>
<P> ``The lure of the new essentials of middle-class life is preventing many Americans from amassing savings they will need to reach their retirement goals,'' said Public Agenda Executive Director Deborah Wadsworth. </P>
<P> ``We need to put savings in the same category as driving safely and watching what you eat,'' she added. </P>
<P> Certain personality types were more likely to save than others, the survey indicated. </P>
<P> About 20 percent are ``planners'' -- those who are in control of their financial affairs and most likely to have significant retirement savings. </P>
<P> About 20 percent are ``deniers'' -- those who just don't want to think about retirement. About 15 percent are impulse buyers who have a hard time saving for any reason, it said. </P>
<P> Some lack the income to save, while others were too overwhelmed by day-to-day issues to deal with retirement. </P>
<P> About 34 percent are convinced they cannot save more for retirement because they do not have the money. Of that group, 74 percent reported less than $40,000 in household income. </P>
<P> The survey also found most Americans don't know how much they need to save to maintain the lifestyle they hope to have in retirement. </P>
<P> ``We found that Americans say they are not counting on Social Security to see them through their retirement years,'' Wadsworth said. ``They acknowledge personal responsibility for providing for their own retirement. But there is a large gap between acknowledging responsibility and taking action.'' </P>
<P> Seventy-nine percent said the best way to save for retirement was to have money automatically deducted from their paychecks, but 45 percent said employers did not offer this. </P>
<P> The study, which polled 1,100 people, had a margin of error of 3 percentage points, meaning results could vary that much either way. It was funded by a grant from Fidelity Investments. </P>
