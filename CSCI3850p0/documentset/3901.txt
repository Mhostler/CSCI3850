<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  House Republicans said Monday they are ready to call on talk show hosts if necessary to help win passage of a balanced budget amendment to the Consitution this week. </P>
<P> House Rules Committee Chairman Gerald Solomon said they are ready to use the tactic in pressing the issue, one of the key provisions in the Republicans' Contract With America. </P>
<P> ``I would very much like to pass the balanced budget amendment,'' House Speaker Newt Gingrich told reporters. Debate begins Wednesday, with a final vote expected Thursday or Friday, the speaker said. </P>
<P> Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Tx., a long-time sponsor of a balanced budget amendment with Rep. Dan Schaefer, R-Colo., said he was ``cautiously optimistic'' he had the 290 votes necessary for passage if all 435 members of the House vote. Stenholm has lined up 69 Democrats for his amendment. </P>
<P> The Schaefer-Stenholm version, if it became part of the Constitution, would require a three-fifths vote of all members of each house to permit an annual deficit or to raise the country's credit line. </P>
<P> That is the same tough-to-achieve margin required to break a Senate filibuster, up from the current practice of requiring of a majority of those voting. </P>
<P> Republicans want an amendment that also makes it harder to raise taxes. </P>
<P> ``In terms of being satisfied, I would very much like us to pass a balanced budget amendment which has a three-fifths requirement for raising taxes,'' Gingrich said. </P>
<P> There are 230 Republicans, meaning support from 60 or more Democrats is necessary -- and not available for the version that discourages taxation. </P>
<P> ``On the Democratic side right now we only see 30 or 40 votes'' for that version, Gingrich said. </P>
<P> Nonetheless, House Rules Committee Chairman Solomon said the leadership will hold a vote on the Republican version of the amendment Wednesday. </P>
<P> And if matters improve and the Republicans come close -- perhaps 280 votes -- he said they are ready ``to go all out, then we'll unleash talk show hosts.'' </P>
<P> But he said if the Republicans do not come close, they'll think again and, he made clear, support the other version of the amendment with its guaranteed Democratic votes on Thursday. </P>
<P> ``I think the Schaeffer-Stenholm amendment is a good amendment,'' the New York Republican said. ``But I prefer not to cross that bridge until later this week.'' </P>
<P> Several other versions of the amendment, including one that protects Social Security, will also be considered on the floor, Solomon said. They are not expected to pass. </P>
