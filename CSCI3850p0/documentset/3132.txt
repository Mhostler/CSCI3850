<P>  A new political party was launched in Trinidad Sunday by an opposition activist who may make a bid to become the country's first woman prime minister. </P>
<P> The new party, the Movement for Unity and Progress (MUP), was put together by members of a breakaway faction of the opposition United National Congress (UNC). </P>
<P> The party is led by Hulsie Bhaggan, 38, a member of parliament for the central Trinidad constituency of Chaguanas, who was expelled from the UNC earlier this year following disagreements with the party's leadership. </P>
<P> Addressing thousands of supporters at a central Trinidad rally launching her party, Bhaggan said MUP intends to introduce ``a new political culture'' in the Caribbean nation. </P>
<P> Bhaggan has been quoted in the Trinidad press as saying her main ambition is to become the Caribbean nation's first woman premier. </P>
<P> In November of last year, she was jailed for a week after she pleaded guilty to squatting on a highway to protest the government's failure to deal with flooding problems in her constituency. She opted to go to prison instead of paying a fine. </P>
<P> General elections are not due until 1996. </P>
