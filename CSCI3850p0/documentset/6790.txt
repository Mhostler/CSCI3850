<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Kenya's chief magistrate granted bail Tuesday to a businessman accused of masterminding the Goldenberg scandal which allegedly cost the country millions of dollars. </P>
<P> Chief Magistrate Uniter Kidullah ordered the release of Kamlesh Pattni and a former senior treasury official, Charles Mbindyo, on $109,000 bail each with a surety of the same amount. </P>
<P> Pattni, of Asian ethnic origin, and Mbindyo were arrested Monday and appeared in court on the same day on charges of stealing $218,066,871 from the Treasury through the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK). </P>
<P> Pattni already faces three separate charges of stealing $380.54 million from the bank. He has been released on bail in those cases in one of which he is jointly charged with Wilfred Koinange, another former senior government official. </P>
<P> The Goldenberg scandal is estimated to have cost the country up to $450 million in the early 1990s. It allegedly involved the payment of export compensation with foreign exchange to Pattni's company Goldenberg for fictitious deals in gold and diamonds. </P>
<P> Bringing the alleged ringleaders of the alleged crime to justice has become a crusade for the political opposition in Kenya and a festering issue for overseas aid donors. </P>
<P> Deputy Director of the Public Prosecution Bernard Chunga did not oppose the release of the two accused on bail but demanded tougher conditions for their release. </P>
<P> ``We have not exhausted our investigations which must continue to cover all important areas,'' Chunga told the court. </P>
<P> ``This is only a holding charge and there is every likelihood of charging more prime suspects with the same effect,'' he said. </P>
<P> Opposition leaders have called for Vice-President George Saitoti and a former Central Bank governor to be charged along with Pattni. The proceedings were adjourned until June 6. </P>
