<P>  One of the two Arab gunmen who carried out a guerrilla attack in Jerusalem Sunday night was an Egyptian visiting Israel on a tourist visa issued by the Israeli embassy in Cairo, a copy of his passport showed. </P>
<P> Issam Mhana Ismail al-Johari, 24, was shot dead by Israeli security forces, along with a Palestinian from Gaza, Hassan Abbas, 21. </P>
<P> A 19-year-old Israeli woman soldier and an Arab from East Jerusalem were killed in the attack, which took place near a hotel housing Secretary of State Warren Christopher. </P>
<P> The Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas, which claimed responsibility for the shooting in a popular Jerusalem nightspot, said Johari joined its Qassam brigade after his arrival in Gaza. </P>
<P> It was the first time Hamas had used a non-Palestinian in a guerrilla operation against Israel, a Hamas official said. </P>
<P> ``He wanted to die for the cause. He told us: 'I came here to fight to the death. I want to be a martyr and a fighter,'' said the official. </P>
<P> A copy of Johari's passport obtained by Reuters contained an expired one-month Israeli tourist visa, number 788216/1994. It showed he entered Palestinian-ruled Gaza from Egypt on July 14 through the Rafah border crossing controlled by Israel. </P>
<P> The other guerrilla, Abbas, was released from an Israeli prison three months ago and lived in Gaza City. He had spent two years in jail on charges of anti-Israeli activity, Palestinian sources said. </P>
