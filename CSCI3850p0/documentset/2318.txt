<P>  Japan, one of the world's most technologically advanced nations, has a problem finding school teachers who can use a computer, a survey by the Education Ministry revealed Monday. </P>
<P> The survey found that two-thirds of Japan's 944,600 public school teachers could not operate computers installed at their schools. </P>
<P> Despite efforts to raise teachers' awareness of computers, the survey found there had only been a 4 percent rise over last year in the number of computer-literate teachers. </P>
<P> ``We are hoping the number of teachers who can operate computers at school will increase.'' a ministry spokesman said. </P>
