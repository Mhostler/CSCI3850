<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Pakistani opposition parties said Wednesday that police had detained hundreds of their members to stop planned protest marches across the country Thursday. </P>
<P> The Pakistan Muslim League (PML) of opposition leader Nawaz Sharif said at least 562 activists had been arrested in the southern province of Sind. </P>
<P> But authorities in the Sind provincial capital Karachi denied they had arrested any politicians. </P>
<P> No official comment about opposition reports of continuing arrests in the rest of the country was immediately available. </P>
<P> Fifty-two PML members were detained in the Punjab province town of Rawalpindi, near Islamabad, the PML said. </P>
<P> The PML and its smaller allied groups have planned the protest as part of their campaign against Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's government, which they accuse of corruption and inefficiency. </P>
<P> Bhutto and her allies, in turn, accuse opposition politicians of starting the agitation to save themselves from charges of financial corruption committed when Sharif was Prime Minister for 30 months until last July. </P>
<P> On Tuesday, authorities banned Sharif and five other politicians from entering Sindh province for 10 days until October 7. He vowed in a statement to defy the ban. </P>
<P> A PML statement said police surrounded the house of Sind PML president Ghaus Ali Shah in Karachi and were not allowing anyone to leave or enter the house. But a police officer at the site said Shah had not been arrested. </P>
<P> The opposition parties would not be daunted by government tactics, PML campaign coordinator Majid Malik said. ``We will take the campaign to its logical conclusion,'' he told a news conference in Islamabad. </P>
