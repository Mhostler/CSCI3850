<DATELINE>LIMERICK, Ireland (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A leader of the IRA's political wing Sinn Fein Sunday launched a bitter attack on the British government for its response to the guerrilla group's cease-fire. </P>
<P> In a speech in the Irish town of Limerick, Mitchel McLaughlin accused the government of making misleading, arrogant and offensive statements about the peace process and of not dealing with the issue of prisoners. </P>
<P> At an annual rally, McLaughlin said the London government had said after the Irish Republican Army (IRA) cease-fire Sept. 1 that it was not seeking surrender and that its response would be generous and imaginative. </P>
<P> But he said that after nearly five months, ``the British are seeking, cynically and disingenuously, to dilute and diminish the real achievements of the IRA's historic decision.'' </P>
<P> McLaughlin said Sinn Fein rejected assertions by ministers that the decommissioning of IRA weapons was central to moving the peace process forward and for their entry into full dialogue with the British government. </P>
<P> He urged the government to address the issue of republican prisoners. ``At present there are over 500 republican prisoners and none of these people would be in prison if it were not for the political conflict. </P>
<P> Britain began separate talks with the two sides after the IRA and their Protestant extremist foes declared cease-fires in the conflict, which has gone on for a quarter of a century. </P>
