<P>  Up to three million Rwandan refugees will starve next month if food lifelines from international aid agencies continue to dry up, two charities said Wednesday. </P>
<P> Oxfam and Save the Children told a news conference food supplies for 650,000 refugees in Tanzania would run out by the end of April and there were no assurances of more food aid. Rations to refugees in camps elsewhere, mainly Zaire and Burundi, have already been halved and if similar steps are not taken in Tanzania food will run out in two weeks, they said. </P>
<P> ``There is now a real fear that without a major injection of cash for the World Food Program and food for the refugees the crisis will affect every refugee and displaced person within the region,'' they said in a joint statement. </P>
<P> ``This crisis will lead to malnutrition and vitamin deficiency diseases. The poor and most vulnerable refugees will starve, especially women and children.'' </P>
<P> The United Nations WFP has said it needs $385 million to provide food and essential operational support to the Rwandan refugee program during 1995 but to date only $155 million has been pledged, the charities said. </P>
<P> There was ``growing evidence'' that refugees already saw the food crisis as a deliberate attempt to starve them into returning to their war-torn homeland and could lead to a complete breakdown of international relief, they said. This would compromise efforts to repatriate the refugees, rule out a return to stability and increase violence between refugees and home communities, they warned. </P>
<P> Reports from Zaire Wednesday said nearly one million Rwandan refugees there, mainly from the majority Hutu tribe, believed a recent 50 percent cut in their food rations was a Western attempt to starve them out of their camps. They are unwilling to return for fear they will be killed in retaliation for the genocide of between 500,000 and one million of the minority Tutsi tribe and their allies last year when the Hutus were in power. Many believe the aid agencies are conspiring with the new Tutsi leaders in Kigali. </P>
