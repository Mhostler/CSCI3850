<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn.(Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A bomb squad Friday blew up a small package that arrived at the Abraham Ribicoff federal building in downtown Hartford, police said. </P>
<P> WVIT-TV in West Hartford reported that the package was shoe-box sized and, when X-rayed, was found to contain two unidentified masses, wires and styrofoam. </P>
<P> ``Because it was detonated doesn't mean it was a bomb, it means it was suspicious enough they didn't want to fool around with it,'' police Lt. John Bowen said. ``They (bomb squad) give it a little charge and they poof it. After it's been rendered safe, they carry it out of there.'' </P>
<P> Employees of the building were evacuated and a two-block area surrounding the building was cordoned off. </P>
<P> The incident was one of many in which buildings have been evacuated because of bomb threats in the aftermath of the deadly explosion in Oklahoma City Wednesday. </P>
<P> In another such incident Friday, federal buildings in Cleveland were closed and employees told not to report to work after a bomb threat was received. </P>
<P> ``In light of the disaster at Oklahoma City, we felt it prudent to close the Federal Building and the United States Courthouse Building,'' the Federal Protective Service said in a statement in Cleveland. </P>
