<P>  French singer and actress Vanessa Paradis was carrying hashish in her purse when she tried to board a plane from Canada to Miami, U.S. customs officials said Friday. </P>
<P> Paradis, 22, was arrested at Montreal's Dorval airport on Thursday night and ordered to appear in court March 13 after paying a $500 Canadian ($356 U.S.) bond, a spokesman for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said. </P>
<P> The actress, who had an Air Canada ticket to the Caribbean island resort of Nassau via Miami, has now returned to Paris, news reports said. </P>
<P> The actress was in Canada to promote a new film, ``Elisa,'' with French actor Gerard Depardieu. </P>
<P> ``When she was being interviewed by a U.S. immigration officer, 3.2 grams (0.1 ounce) of hashish were found in her purse,'' a U.S. Customs spokeswoman told Reuters. </P>
<P> La Presse newspaper in Montreal said the drugs fell out of her purse while she was looking for her passport, but U.S. officials did not comment on this. </P>
<P> ``We detained her, issuing a US$500 mitigated penalty for importation of an illegal substance and we called in the RCMP who then arrested her,'' the customs spokeswoman said. </P>
<P> Paradis will not face any charges in the United States, she added. </P>
