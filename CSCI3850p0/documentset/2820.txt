<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Defense Secretary William Perry, in an attempt to alleviate the strain on active-duty troops, has approved a plan to use reservists in many peacetime roles now performed by regular forces, the New York Times said in its Friday editions. </P>
<P> The newspaper, quoting Pentagon officials, said the plan proposes that many of the 1 million members of the National Guard and Reserves of the various armed forces spend their annual training time performing real operations, including peacekeeping missions, overseas, rather than drilling at home. </P>
<P> The Times said that recent operations in Haiti, Rwanda, Cuba and the Gulf had exposed cracks in the combat readiness of the military. </P>
<P> It said that with the armed forces shrinking and military commitments likely to remain high in the future, the Defense Department's proposal to expand the reservists' role could be one way to approach the crisis. </P>
<P> Proponents say that, under the plan, America's weekend warriors would receive valuable experience while relieving overworked regular troops. </P>
<P> The Army is scheduled to send a battalion of 430 reservists and 110 active duty soldiers for a six-month rotation in a multinational observer force in the Sinai, the first time since the Army began sending troops to the Sinai in the early 1980s that it was planning to send reservists. </P>
<P> In addition, Maj. Gen. Donald Shepperd, the head of the Air National Guard, said the guard was examining how to train its ground-based air controllers to serve aboard Awacs radar planes, which have experienced severe crew shortages. </P>
<P> Gen. Shepperd told the Times that the guard could also increase its missions in Europe and in Bosnia. </P>
<P> The newspaper said that Reserve combat brigades could also be rotated a month at a time through overseas assignments such as protecting Kuwait, replacing some of the active duty combat troops now serving there. </P>
<P> It said that many of the details of the Pentagon plan still needed to be worked out, but that its outlines had the blessing of Perry, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and several influential lawmakers. </P>
<P> Pentagon officials say that there might be additional transportation costs to send reservists on overseas operations but that the benefit to regular forces would vastly outweigh any added expense. </P>
<P> Comment from Pentagon officials was not immediately available. </P>
