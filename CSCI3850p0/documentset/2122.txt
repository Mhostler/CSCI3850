<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Clinton Wednesday embarked on a daunting political rescue mission designed to help salvage the re-election of two tottering titans of the Democratic Party -- New York Gov. Mario Cuomo and Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy. </P>
<P> At an economic conference playing up Cuomo's 12-year record as governor of the country's second-biggest state, Clinton announced he was granting New York a waiver from federal welfare laws, letting it test reforms that could save New York taxpayers money. </P>
<P> He also affirmed his support for increasing the federal share for medical care costs for the poor in New York under the Medicaid program, a step that requires congressional approval. </P>
<P> Medicaid is a federal-state program that helps pay for health care for the needy, aged, blind and disabled and for low-income families with children. </P>
<P> Both initiatives could help Cuomo, who currently trails Republican challenger George Pataki in polls charting voter sentiment three weeks before the Nov. 8 congressional and gubernatorial elections. </P>
<P> Before unveiling his political plums, Clinton boasted of economic improvements accomplished under his administration, and credited Cuomo's ``good leadership'' for helping bring them about. </P>
<P> ``In the state of New York, the unemployment rate has dropped about one and one-half percent -- there are over 100,000 more jobs. Two million New Yorkers are eligible for lower interest, longer repayment terms on their college loans, (and) 3.1 million New Yorkers are protected by the family leave law,'' he said. </P>
<P> In addition, Clinton said, the newly enacted crime bill would put 6,100 more police officers on the streets in New York state alone. </P>
<P> Later, before going on to Boston to campaign for Kennedy Thursday, Clinton heaped more praise on Cuomo at a fundraising dinner that raised $2.5 million for the governor's re-election campaign. </P>
<P> ``I watched him tonight and I was thinking, 'Why is this a race, why is it even close?''' Clinton said. ``I think that he has given you strong and disciplined and responsible leadership, and he's still full of new ideas and energy.'' </P>
<P> Cuomo ``would walk through a wall to do the right thing, and you ought to do the right thing and re-elect him,'' he said. </P>
<P> The dinner was attended by a flock of celebrities, including pop music superstar Madonna, who appeared to nod off as the president spoke. </P>
<P> Clinton, a drag on Democratic candidates in other regions because of his relative unpopularity, has a 55 percent approval rating in New York, according to a New York Times/WCBS survey. Cuomo had only a 45 percent approval in the poll. </P>
<P> Thirty-six state governorships are on the line in the Nov. 8 elections, and the Republicans seem poised to take command of most of the big states. </P>
<P> They could also take control of the Senate by making a net gain of seven more seats among the 35 seats at stake in the voting, and could end four decades of Democratic dominance in the House with a net gain of 40 seats of the 435 at stake. </P>
<P> Kennedy, the standardbearer of one of America's most remarkable political dynasties, is fighting voter skepticism born of his past controversies and 32 years of incumbency as well as an anti-liberal tide in his contest with Republican challenger Mitt Romney. </P>
<P> The latest polls give Kennedy the edge in the race, but his lead is well within the margin of error. </P>
<P> Clinton, who credits his teen-age meeting with President John Kennedy with inspiring him to pursue a political career, will speak at a rally for the late president's brother after signing an education bill that could generate pro-Kennedy votes in Massachusetts. </P>
