<P>  With a threatened August 12 baseball strike deadline fast approaching, a small group of owners met with representatives of the Major League Players' Association Tuesday, but the key issues separating the two sides were not discussed. </P>
<P> ``We talked about licensing and then got into shutdown procedures,'' Steve Fehr, assistant executive director of Players Association and brother chief negotiator Donald Fehr, told reporters. </P>
<P> If a strike is to be averted, substantial progress must be made in a negotiating session scheduled for Wednesday. </P>
<P> The Players Association has said a strike will begin following completion of Thursday's scheduled games if a settlement can not be reached. </P>
<P> The major stumbling block in the negotiations is the owners' insistence on the creation of a salary cap for baseball. The players have steadfastly rejected the ideal of a salary cap. </P>
<P> The owners are also seeking to eliminate salary arbitration, while the union wants eligibility for arbitration reduced to two years of major league service. </P>
<P> The players union is also seeking to increase the minimum salary from $109,000 to $200,000. </P>
