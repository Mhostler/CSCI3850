<P>  Four prisoners on death row at the Indiana State Prison escaped from their cells Monday but were captured after exchanging shots with a guard, officials said. </P>
<P> A fifth condemned prisoner was stopped before he could leave his cell but police had to use tear gas to subdue him, and in the process one officer suffered a minor injury. </P>
<P> Pam Patterson, spokeswoman for the Indiana Department of Corrections, said the incident began at 1:50 a.m. local time at the prison in Michigan City when four men cut through bars and escaped through a window. </P>
<P> A tower guard saw them entering a recreation area and ordered them to stop, at which time one of the four fired three shots from a home-made zip gun, she said. The guard fired a warning shot and the four surrendered. </P>
<P> A fifth death row inmate who had not left his cell but who was armed with a knife refused to surrender and was tear-gassed. In the process he threw a jail bar he had sawed off, slightly injuring one of the guards. </P>
