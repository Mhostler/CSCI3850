<P>  Tens of thousands of Egyptians made homeless by torrential floods three weeks ago face hunger and disease as they prepare for winter in crowded camps or the shells of their devastated mud houses, aid workers said. </P>
<P> In interviews this week they said the flooding, the worst natural disaster to hit Egypt for decades, caught government and international aid agencies unprepared. Some areas were still in urgent need of blankets and tents. </P>
<P> ``Help is getting through, but it's patchy. Some areas had no sign of any aid more than a week after the rains,'' said a relief worker recently returned from Sohag, Assiut and Qena provinces, the worst-hit southern areas of the country. </P>
<P> Nearly 600 people were killed in the floods, most of them in the village of Dronka near Assiut where the storms damaged storage tanks and sent flaming fuel coursing through a poor and densely populated residential area. </P>
<P> Aid workers returning from the south showed pictures of village after village where houses have been reduced to a mishmash of mud and straw. </P>
<P> The government says more than 10,000 houses were destroyed, but estimates for the homeless are still sketchy. ``We're comfortable with a figure around 100,000 (people), but we've heard numbers as high as 180,000,'' said one aid worker who asked not to be named. </P>
<P> He said the army had pitched hundreds of tents to shelter people, but with extended families all crowding into single tents, without groundsheets, they would offer only the most basic refuge through the winter months. </P>
<P> Rotting animal carcasses still festered under collapsed buildings in devastated villages, raising fears of a cholera outbreak, and a freak cold snap threatened children and elderly victims of the flood. </P>
<P> Some people had decided to stay in the wrecks of their former homes, fearing looting of their remaining possessions if they left. ``They are very reluctant to move. Some of them are still digging up their personal effects,'' said Olivia Misan, of the development agency CARITAS. </P>
<P> Food distribution has also proved difficult. </P>
<P> ``In Sohag it was agreed the government would distribute free bread and fresh vegetables ... But middlemen have been taking it and selling it -- we saw families who had had no bread for days,'' she said. </P>
<P> ``The vast majority will spend the winter in tents. That is why the need for blankets is so dire. In some areas there are only two blankets per family,'' Misan said. </P>
<P> She said efforts were hampered by a lack of information about the area. ``There are no such things as statistics ... There are no plans of the villages and families often don't register their children so they can avoid military service.'' </P>
<P> More than 40 planeloads of foreign aid have been flown in to Egypt, 22 of them from Saudi Arabia, carrying food, blankets, tents and fresh water. The government said the initial emergency relief stage has now been completed. </P>
<P> It has brushed off claims by opposition newspapers that it was slow in distributing aid, accusing them of exploiting a natural disaster for political purposes. </P>
<P> But the aid workers said efforts had been slowed by the government's tight control of the relief. Some said not all of it was being sent to the affected areas. </P>
