<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  An unemployed man threatened to jump off the Parthenon unless compensated for flood damage to his Athens home, but climbed down Sunday after 24 hours atop scaffolding near the marble gates, police said. </P>
<P> Nikos Martinis, 35, called off a suicide threat that dashed tourists' hopes of a closer look at the ancient Athens monument, closed since Oct. 5 because of a guards' strike. </P>
<P> He scaled up a wall of the huge citadel on the hill of the Acropolis in the Greek capital Saturday and threatened to jump. </P>
<P> Tourists were angered by a police decision to seal off the site. </P>
<P> Greek culture ministry guards, who want higher pay, decided Friday to open the Acropolis, for three days after a court ruled their walkout was illegal. They plan to reconsider Monday whether to resume the strike. </P>
<P> Martinis told reporters he was cold and tired but said he would press ahead with his demands which include a pay-phone for his neighborhood and a water heater and cistern for his bathroom. </P>
<P> Yiannis Dimakakis, the chief guard, said Martinis climbed down after receiving verbal assurances from a magistrate that he would not be arrested or charged. </P>
<P> Martinis had been up and down the scaffolding twice since Thursday. </P>
<P> Police said he had been taken into custody early on Saturday and released after a psychiatric examination. But he went straight back to the Acropolis Saturday afternoon. </P>
