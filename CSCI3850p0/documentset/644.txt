<DATELINE>LONDON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Islamic activists addressing a rally of thousands of cheering British Muslims Sunday called for the destruction of the state of Israel and the establishment of an Islamic superpower. </P>
<P> Brandishing a raised fist Farid Kassim, spokesman for the militant Islamic group Hizb ut-Tahrir, told the International Muslim Khalifah Conference in London that all existing world organizations were unacceptable to Islam. </P>
<P> ``All negotiations between (Arab) regimes and Israel are illegal. There will be no peace with the state of Israel...until the state of Israel is demolished,'' he said from his wheelchair on the stage. </P>
<P> ``All international organizations such as the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund and the Arab League are in the hands of the imperialist superpowers ... They are unacceptable to Muslims and Islam.'' </P>
<P> As Kassim spoke the crowd of 7,000 which included women in headscarves among the bearded men stood and raised their fists shouting ``Allah u Akbar'' (God is Greater). </P>
<P> The conference, billed as the biggest gathering of Islamic fundamentalists outside the Middle East, had been seen as a flashpoint between radical young Muslims and the Jews after two bomb attacks against Israeli targets in London last month. </P>
<P> Earlier the conference organizer, Muslim Unity Organization, denied any anti-Jewish message but said they were opposed to the state of Israel which they accuse of waging war against Muslims. </P>
<P> Sympathizers said the conference was a ``family meeting'' to discuss political and cultural issues like human rights and the Islamic religious revival. Speakers include prominent fundamentalist dissidents from Saudi Arabia. </P>
<P> Dr Israr Ahmed, from Pakistan's Tanzeem al Islami group, said there could be no peace or security for Muslims without the creation of a ``true'' Islamic state. </P>
<P> ``The period of colonial rule may appear to have come to an end but actually it has not,'' he said. ``It is still continuing. Now we are being ruled and controlled indirectly...most Islamic rulers today are the viceroys of America.'' </P>
<P> Tight police security was imposed outside the site but the only disturbance at the conference was the arrest of two leading gay rights protesters. Police broke up a demonstration by the placard-waving gay rights campaigners. </P>
<P> ``Islamic bigots burn queers alive,'' one placard said. </P>
