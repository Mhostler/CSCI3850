<P>  United States forces based in Japan will take blankets to help earthquake survivors Thursday, in the U.S. military's first disaster relief operation in Japan since it set up bases here. </P>
<P> A military transporter was scheduled to take off in the afternoon from Yokota air base on the outskirts of Tokyo and fly to Osaka with 37,000 blankets. </P>
<P> Following the quake Tuesday, President Clinton offered the assistance of U.S. military forces in Japan, and Washington provided the Japanese government with a list of support it could provide. </P>
<P> ``We have received President Clinton's kind offer and plan to ask for supplies we are short of, particularly blankets,'' Chief Cabinet Secretary Kozo Igarashi told a news conference. ``If anything more is necessary we'll talk further.'' </P>
<P> Many people in Kobe and other badly-hit areas were afraid to go back to their damaged homes after the quake for fear they might collapse in aftershocks. </P>
<P> About 240,000 evacuees huddled in refugee centers set up in schools. The numbers overwhelmed relief workers, who said they were short of blankets and food. </P>
