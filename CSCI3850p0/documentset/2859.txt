<P>  Ownership of media organizations in Europe should be made more open to scrutiny by the public and by regulators, the 33-nation Council of Europe said Monday. </P>
<P> In a recommendation, the council's committee of ministers said member states should guarantee ``basic information on the owners of the media so that it can assess the value of the information and opinions disseminated.'' </P>
<P> Authorities should also be able to find out needed information about ownership while member states should exchange information ``bearing in mind the increasing internationalism of (media) activities,'' it said. </P>
<P> The Council is dedicated to promoting human rights and democracy in Europe. </P>
