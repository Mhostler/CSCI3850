<P>  Sen. Jesse Helms, the new Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, said Wednesday he had received Taiwan's representative before any other because ``I've always resented what was done to Taiwan.'' </P>
<P> Helms, who has criticized successive U.S. administrations' diplomatic and commercial contacts with the People's Republic of China, said he believed the Taiwan leadership, ousted from the mainland by the Chinese communists in 1949, was the legitimate government of the mainland. </P>
<P> ``This was symbolic as far as I was concerned,'' the North Carolina Republican said of his first contact with the Taiwanese representative. ``I insisted that of all the ambassadors seeking to come and visit, that Taiwan would be the first, because I've always resented what was done to Taiwan.'' </P>
<P> The powerful Republican, in an interview with a North Carolina Public Televison talk show host to air Friday, also said he was eager to eliminate foreign aid and demanded that loan recipients abroad provide collateral in the form of natural resources. </P>
<P> ``I don't think we ought to give one cent of the (U.S.) taxpayers' money to any foreign government. None,'' Helms said. </P>
<P> ``We could lend it to them with collateral, like in the case of Russia. They have every known mineral resource known to man, and they could collateralize any loan. And you say, 'Well, they ain't goin' to pay the loan.' But at least we'll have that paper there and wield some influence,'' Helms added. </P>
<P> Helms' philosophy on foreign aid resembled his and other conservatives' positions on welfare recipients. </P>
<P> America should ``spread the gospel, if you'll permit that word, of the free enterprise system,'' he said, adding that America's message to the world should be: ``We want to work with you, we want to help you, but we're not going to prop up dictatorships, and we're not going to prop up people who don't want to work for a living.'' </P>
