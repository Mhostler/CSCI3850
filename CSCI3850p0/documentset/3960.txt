<DATELINE>LONDON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Sudan's London embassy Wednesday rejected Amnesty International's allegations of widespread human rights abuses in the African country. </P>
<P> The human rights organization said in a report that Sudan was facing a humanitarian emergency in which thousands of people have been unlawfully detained and tens of thousands killed by the government and rebels locked in a 12-year war. </P>
<P> It called on the world community to push for change. </P>
<P> The Sudanese Embassy fiercely rejected the Amnesty report, calling it ``a third-rate information report motivated by hate.'' </P>
<P> ``Fixing a political fiction in the form of a report deserves to be totally rejected. Recycling old accusations in an annual ritual is a regretful matter,'' the embassy said. </P>
<P> Amnesty urged the United Nations to set up an international civilian monitoring team to help stop human rights abuses in Sudan. </P>
<P> Pierre Sane, secretary general of the London-based group, told a news conference in Nairobi Wednesday that he was afraid the world was ignoring the suffering in Sudan. </P>
<P> The Amnesty report accused both the military government of President Omar Hassan Ahmad al-Bashir and the two main armed opposition factions are guilty of abuses. </P>
<P> Rebels of the SPLA (Sudan Peoples' Liberation Army) and the breakaway SSIA (South Sudan Independence Army) are fighting against what they see as domination of the mainly black Christian and animist south by the Muslim and Arabized Khartoum government. </P>
<P> The southerners want a right to self-determination, which Khartoum rejects. </P>
