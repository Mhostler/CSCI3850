<P> Nagurka said Richardson arrived in Pyongyang Saturday evening local time and was informed of the helicopter incident by North Korean officials. ``Now this is at the top of his agenda,'' Nagurka said of Richardson, who had gone to the communist North to assess its relations with South Korea and to discuss a recent U.S.-North Korea nuclear pact. </P>
<P> North Korea has said it shot down the helicopter over its territory and the pilots were being questioned for intrusion, while the United States said they made an emergency landing. </P>
<P> Nagurka said Richardson, who was scheduled for a full day of meetings Sunday with North Korean officials before traveling to Seoul on Monday, had not seen the two pilots and could not confirm how their craft went down. </P>
<P> ``He's made a number of requests, including a request to visit the (crash) site,'' Nagurka said. He said Richardson had advised the North Koreans of ``the utmost seriousness of this'' and the need to return the pilots quickly. </P>
