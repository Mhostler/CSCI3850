<DATELINE>DILI, East Timor (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  East Timor's capital Dili was quiet but tense Wednesday after three days of unrest, with shops reopening, cars and buses back on the streets and student gangs prowling outside the closed university. </P>
<P> The unprecedented rioting over three days was whipped up by news that an immigrant killed an East Timorese trader in a market brawl. </P>
<P> While a semblance of normality reappeared Wednesday, residents said underlying problems remained. </P>
<P> ``The murder of the trader seemed to be a catalyst in bringing to the surface the underlying resentment of East Timorese,'' Helder da Costa, director of planning, development and external relations at the university, told Reuters. </P>
<P> The East Timor issue cast a shadow over Tuesday's Asia-Pacific summit at Bogor near Jakarta and a state visit Wednesday by President Clinton, who called on his hosts to give the territory greater autonomy. </P>
<P> A band of 29 Timorese students put the East Timor issue under the APEC spotlight when they began a sit-in, which is still continuing, in the U.S. Embassy car park in Jakarta Saturday. They demanded Clinton's help in securing freedom for jailed guerrilla leader Xanana Gusmao. </P>
<P> Sporadic protests -- part political, part racial -- broke out in Dili the following day. </P>
<P> The riots, during which protesters smashed windows, ransacked shops and overturned cars, were the worst in Dili since Nov. 12, 1991, when troops shot dead about 200 mourners at a funeral. </P>
<P> ``Things are beginning to settle down, but the university will be shut until next Monday,'' da Costa said. The campus was the scene of anti-government demonstrations Tuesday. </P>
<P> The embassy protest and the Dili unrest dominated news coverage as leaders from 18 regional economies of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum gathered to sign a landmark commitment to free trade by the year 2020. </P>
<P> Human Rights Watch/Asia, an international rights group, urged Indonesia Tuesday to release four East Timorese students allegedly arrested for planning to take part in the anti-government demonstrations. </P>
<P> In a prepared statement, the non-government watchdog group said it believed ``the students were exercising their legitimate right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly, and as such should face no punishment for their actions.'' </P>
<P> It urged that any people in military custody ``be immediately and unconditionally released.'' </P>
<P> Students said up to 120 people had been arrested since the Dili unrest began Sunday. In Jakarta, armed forces chief Gen. Feisal Tanjung said 27 people had been detained in the past few days and would be charged with criminal behavior. </P>
<P> Da Costa welcomed Clinton's promise to raise the issue of East Timor with President Suharto but said there was a greater need for freedom of speech and activity in East Timor. </P>
<P> He also warned that a growing influx of immigrants from nearby Indonesian islands was pushing aside the local population, which he said was not business-minded. </P>
<P> ``There should be a withdrawal of troops and also a check on immigrants. East Timorese are historically not good in commerce, so we have these immigrants come to Dili and take over the economy,'' he said. </P>
<P> Students outside the university gates in central Dili welcomed Clinton's remarks. They went further than diplomats had expected, but students felt he could have done more. </P>
<P> ``He should have emphasized human rights violations and the need for East Timorese to determine their own future,'' one student said. </P>
