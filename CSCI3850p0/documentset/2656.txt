<P>  Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams said Thursday his party was ``absolutely committed'' to the Northern Ireland peace process and pledged to deal with whatever Irish government emerged from the political crisis in Dublin. </P>
<P> But Adams, making his first visit to the British capital since an order banning him from the British mainland was lifted nearly a month ago, appealed for a quick return to stability. </P>
<P> ``Sinn Fein is absolutely committed to this (peace) process. We will deal with whoever happens to be in power (in Dublin), but we think stability should be restored as quickly as possible,'' he told reporters on arrival at London's City Airport. </P>
<P> Britain has said it would open exploratory talks on the peace process with Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), before the end of the year. Adams said he would not meet any British officials during his two-day stay. </P>
<P> In Dublin, Irish Premier Albert Reynolds was under pressure from his own Fianna Fail party to quit to try to save his government from collapse following the withdrawal of support from its coalition partner, Dick Spring's Labor Party. </P>
<P> Sinn Fein has worked closely with both Reynolds and Spring in efforts to push forward an Anglo-Irish peace plan to bring to an end 25 years of guerrilla violence in Northern Ireland. </P>
<P> The IRA, whose goal is to unite the province with the Irish republic to the south, and its foes, the Protestant guerrilla groups fiercely loyal to union with Britain, both ceased their military operations in September. </P>
<P> Adams was in London in part to publicize a book of his thoughts, ``Selected Writings,'' and will give a news conference later Thursday at which he is expected to set out his party's views on current Northern Ireland peace moves. </P>
<P> Earlier Thursday, Martin McGuinness, a Sinn Fein vice president, also said his party was committed to keeping the peace process in the British-ruled province on track. </P>
<P> McGuinness told BBC television that the imminent collapse of Reynolds's coalition government ``would affect the continuity, the momentum and the confidence building which have been central elements to the peace process.'' </P>
<P> ``But...if there is a change of (Irish) government...then Sinn Fein is committed to the success of the peace process and we will work with whatever party is in power,'' he added. </P>
