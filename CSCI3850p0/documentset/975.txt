<P>  Russia's Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev plans to go to Belgrade this weekend to persuade Yugoslav leaders to accept international monitoring of their border with Bosnia in exchange for easing some trade sanctions, diplomats said Wednesday. </P>
<P> The envoys, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Kozyrev would speak to Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic on accepting the monitors which Belgrade has so far rejected as intrusive and a violation of its sovereignty. </P>
<P> Kozyrev is expected to assure Milosevic that once monitors are in place some of the existing sanctions would be eased. These could include air traffic, cultural and other ties, the diplomats said. </P>
<P> Kozyrev's negotiations have been approved by members of the contact group negotiating a peace settlement on the former Yugoslavia, U.N. sources said. The members, in addition to Russia, include the United States, Britain, France and Germany. </P>
<P> Milosevic imposed a blockade on the Bosnian Serbs two weeks ago after their rejection of a peace plan proposed by the contact group. Serbia has turned away truck traffic and is cutting telephone lines. </P>
<P> The Security Council clamped a tight trade embargo on Belgrade in 1992 for Yugoslavia's help in fomenting the Bosnian war by supplying Serb forces there. </P>
<P> Should Milosevic reject the monitors, the council is expected to begin considering a further tightening of the existing embargo against Yugoslavia as well as the Serbs in Bosnia and Croatia. </P>
<P> Drafts of the resolution circulated at the United Nations for the past month include a freeze on all funds and property held abroad by Yugoslav authorities as well as by Yugoslav commerical industrial or public utility companies. </P>
<P> Tighter regulations would also apply to all commercial traffic coming into and leaving the country by river and rail. </P>
<P> Milosevic's official position is that monitors would be at odds with Yugoslavia's sovereignty. Privately, however, diplomats in Belgrade say Milosevic has argued that he would face a population nationalist backlash at home if he agreed to international control of the frontiers.  Koyzrev will attempt to persuade Milosevic that the monitors would not be controlling the border themselves but watching Yugoslav officials do their work. He would also stress that the international monitors will be civilians, and not military observers, the diplomats said. </P>
<P> The United States has set a mid-October deadline for Bosnian Serbs to agree to peace, after which Washington has said it will ask for a lifting of the arms embargo on Bosnia Muslim-led government. </P>
