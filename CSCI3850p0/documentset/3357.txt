<P>  Sperm are terrible swimmers and need to ``surf'' on muscle contractions made by the uterus to reach a woman's egg, Canadian scientists reported Wednesday. </P>
<P> A lack of such contractions or weak ones could account for nearly half of cases of infertile women, the New Scientist magazine reported. </P>
<P> The contractions, which are at their most intense in the most fertile period of of a woman's monthly cycle, create ``waves'' that move upward toward the fallopian tubes, down which the egg travels to be fertilized. </P>
<P> Conception usually takes place when an egg traveling from one of the ovaries meets sperm that swim up from the vagina to the uterus. </P>
<P> ``Sperm are not salmon -- they don't swim unaided upstream. They need these waves to ride on to get to the egg,'' said Edward Lyons of the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg. </P>
<P> A study found that in infertile women the waves were weak or infrequent or moved in the wrong direction toward the cervix, the opening of the uterus. </P>
