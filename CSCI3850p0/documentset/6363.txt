<P>  Italy's former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi suffered a fresh setback Monday when a rival center-left coalition virtually cleaned up in local elections. </P>
<P> The results of Sunday's second-round run-offs were another blow for media magnate Berlusconi, whose center-right Freedom Alliance had to drop demands for a June general election after a disappointing showing in regional elections two weeks ago. </P>
<P> By contrast, the center-left was buoyant, interpreting the outcome as proof it can triumph in a general election that is expected to be held in October. </P>
<P> Berlusconi, toppled last December when the federalist Northern League quit his coalition after seven stormy months of government, tried to put on a brave face, saying he hoped that the result would hasten an early general election. </P>
<P> ``Since there has been this result, let's hope the gentlemen of the left have finally convinced themselves it's time to go to the ballot box,'' Berlusconi told reporters. </P>
<P> ``I'm really charged up and ready to go on the attack, to demand general elections and win them,'' he added. </P>
<P> Italy moved a step closer to that general election Monday when the government and the country's main trades unions announced an accord to reform the costly state pensions system. </P>
<P> Prime Minister Lamberto Dini, who replaced Berlusconi at the head of a stop-gap ``government of experts'' in January, repeated he will offer to resign once the reform is approved or rejected in parliament, a move that could pave the way for an election. </P>
<P> In Sunday's vote, the center-left in combination with the federalist League won 48 of 54 provinces where voters elected new provincial presidents, including those covering Milan, Rome, Turin, Venice and Naples. </P>
<P> Its candidates also won in 21 of 24 main towns among 182 where elections took place for mayor. </P>
<P> Sunday's elections were straight races between the top two candidates in constituencies where no contender had won an outright majority in the first round April 23. </P>
<P> The ex-communist Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), biggest party in a center-left bloc that also includes environmentalist Greens and former Christian Democrats, said the result showed that most Italians did not want to be governed by the right. </P>
<P> ``Voters have disproved the fundamental argument of the Freedom Alliance, namely that the forces which oppose it cannot be brought together even though they are 56 percent of the country,'' PDS leader Massimo D'Alema said. </P>
