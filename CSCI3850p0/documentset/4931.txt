<P>  Representatives of Guatemala's government and leftist rebels met Tuesday in Mexico City and said they were a step closer to resuming peace talks to end Central America's longest-running civil war. </P>
<P> ``There was a step forward,'' a spokeswoman of the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Union (URNG) told Reuters. </P>
<P> Talks between both sides in the on-again, off-again negotiations broke off in December and sparked renewed tension in the 30-year civil war. </P>
<P> The United Nations has urged both sides to return to the negotiating table and sponsored Tuesday's meeting between rebels and Hector Rosada, president of the government's Peace Commission. </P>
<P> Both sides agreed during the meeting to ask the United Nations to draw up a preliminary accord to allow greater indigenous rights for the nation's large Indian population -- one of the key rebel demands for peace. </P>
<P> ``Once we get this document, we can set up a calendar for peace talks,'' said the URNG spokeswoman, who spoke under condition of anonymity. </P>
<P> The document on Indian rights will be drawn up by the U.N. representative to the talks, Jean Arnault, she said. </P>
<P> Despite the progress, tensions still run high on both sides. The URNG spokeswoman said the rebels have no plans to meet with Rosada Granados, Guatamalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio's peace envoy. </P>
<P> Granados said Monday in Mexico City that the rebels were delaying the peace talks. </P>
