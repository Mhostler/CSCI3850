<P>  The great Barings banking dynasty, whose coffers helped build the British Empire, has pulled back once more from the edge of disaster. </P>
<P> Britain's oldest merchant bank, ruined by $900 million in trading losses on Far East markets, announced Sunday it had accepted a rescue deal with the Dutch ING group that would give it a huge cash injection to keep on trading. </P>
<P> The crisis of the past week had echoes in the bank's 233-year-old history. </P>
<P> In 1890, Lord Revelstoke, then head of the Baring family, told his friend Everard Hambro that the bank faced collapse because of bad Argentine loans. </P>
<P> ``I shall be able to tell you Monday whether we can go on, or whether we have to stop,'' he said. </P>
<P> On that occasion the Bank of England, which failed to provide a safety net for Barings last weekend, put together a rescue package and Revelstoke had to sell houses, paintings and furniture to pay off his debts. His wife was said to have died of shame. </P>
<P> This time, Dutch financial services group ING came to the rescue with a massive cash injection to haul Barings out of trouble after the estimated $900 million it lost on Far East markets through a Singapore-based trader. </P>
<P> Founded in 1762, Barings survived the Big Bang deregulation of London's financial markets in 1986 and kept intact its reputation as an old-money pillar of the British establishment alongside such venerable names as Cazenove and Rothschild. </P>
<P> Barings' London offices, which have the atmosphere of a gentleman's club, are studded with ancestral portraits, crystal and ornate silver. </P>
<P> The bank's influence extended far beyond London's City financial district. </P>
<P> As Protestants of Dutch origin, the Baring family rose to power in a community dominated by big Jewish banking dynasties. </P>
<P> Johann Baring arrived in Britain in 1717 from Bremen in northern Germany and two of his sons, John and Francis, started the bank in London in 1762. Francis advised many politicians, including William Pitt. </P>
<P> In the 19th century, as financiers of the British Empire, the Barings won five noble titles -- more than any family since the Middle Ages. Their fortune filled Britain's war chest against Napoleon. </P>
<P> One Baring negotiated America's purchase of Louisiana from France in 1803 and issued bonds to finance railways in France, Russia, India and China. </P>
<P> By 1818, Barings was described by French soldier and statesmen Duc de Richelieu as the sixth great power in Europe, alongside England, France, Russia, Austria and Prussia. </P>
<P> ING may take heart because four years after its Argentine crisis Barings had paid off its debts and resumed its position as one of the most powerful banking houses in Europe. </P>
<P> Its clients have included the Imperial Russian government, Napoleon III and Prince de Taleyrand. </P>
<P> There are other ironies in the Barings saga. </P>
<P> In the early 1980s, Christopher Heath took Barings into Japanese stocks, securing through his bonuses the title of Britain's highest-paid man. </P>
<P> He fell out with the risk-averse board because he wanted to move more capital into ``derivatives.'' </P>
<P> The latest Barings' crisis was due to dealings in derivatives -- in this case futures on the Tokyo stock index -- by Nick Leeson, a trader at the bank's Singapore office. </P>
<P> With all the traits of old money, bankers said Barings had a virtual distaste for the dangerous greed associated with the high rollers of the financial markets. But it could not afford to be left off the bandwagon. </P>
<P> Its Baring Securites arm was known as ``Go-Go Barings.'' </P>
<P> Depositors at Barings were outraged by the way in which their money vanished, but charities across Britain stood to be big losers from the collapse of the bank, which donated $20.6 million last year. </P>
<P> Barings has always boasted that it has no room for slackers or people who turn their back on the firm. </P>
<P> When Lord Cromer, one of the titled Barings, left the family firm to become governor of the Bank of England in the 1960s, one of his uncles said: ``I don't know what young Rowley thinks he's doing. He needn't think there will be a job for him back here.'' </P>
