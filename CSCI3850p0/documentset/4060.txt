<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Hungary Tuesday sentenced two former members of a communist militia unit to five years in jail for firing on demonstrators during the 1956 uprising. </P>
<P> The landmark ruling is the first time Hungary has convicted citizens for suppressing their compatriots during the years of communist rule from 1948 to 1989. </P>
<P> A panel of judges at Budapest Municipal Court found Lajos Orosz and Ferenc Toldi guilty of crimes against humanity for firing on demonstrators on Dec. 8, 1956 in Salgotarjan, a small northern mining town, during the violent suppression of an anti-communist uprising. </P>
<P> Officially 47 people, including two children and a pregnant woman, were killed and between 86 and 89 people injured when Hungarian militiamen and soldiers of the Soviet Red Army opened fire on about 4,000 demonstrators. </P>
<P> The crowd was protesting the arrests on the previous day of two minor officials in the local worker's council, bodies formed to coordinate passive resistance to Soviet tanks and troops sent to crush the anti-communist uprising and the short-lived democratic government. </P>
<P> ``This court has found that (demonstrators) were shot while trying to escape or when lying on the ground wounded,'' leading judge Janos Strausz said in passing sentence. </P>
<P> ``While we cannot establish who killed exactly whom, under the law, whoever was shooting on that day, can be held responsible for the deaths.'' </P>
<P> Ten other members of the unit, who were also on trial, were acquitted because Strausz said it could no longer be established whether they were at the scene of the shooting. </P>
<P> Both the prosecution and the defense has the right to appeal. </P>
<P> Monday, most of the 12 elderly defendants listened to the verdict quietly and apparently without interest. But during the proceedings Toldi suddenly complained of feeling ill and was taken to hospital. </P>
<P> Strausz said the shooting in Salgotarjan was part of the communist authorities' wider campaign to use indiscriminate violence to subdue the population following the Soviet invasion. </P>
