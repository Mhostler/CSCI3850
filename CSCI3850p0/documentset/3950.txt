<P>  An Austrian woman who was an au pair in O.J. Simpson's Los Angeles home has described the former football star as ``a warm-hearted, loving, sensitive and considerate husband.'' </P>
<P> The Vienna Weekly News said Gabriela Steigberger, 35, from St. Poelten in central Austria, had written to Simpson's lawyers offering to testify on his behalf. </P>
<P> The paper, which was made available to Reuters ahead of publication Thursday, quoted Steigberger as saying she had worked as an au pair in the Simpson household for three months in 1987 looking after Sydney, his elder daughter. </P>
<P> ``O.J. never raised his voice at home. He adored his wife and showered her with presents,'' Steigberger said. </P>
<P> She said she was aware that she could not help solve the murder of Simpson's ex-wife Nicole and her friend Ron Goldman, as this happened long after she had returned to Austria, where she now works as a travel agent. </P>
<P> ``But the allegation that he had always tormented his wife just cannot remain unanswered. If they want me to testify, I'll do so,'' Steigberger said. </P>
<P> The former au pair said she had spent a vacation with the Simpsons during which, in her opinion, their marriage was harmonious. </P>
<P> She added she would have stayed longer in the household had the lady of the house been friendlier toward her. </P>
<P> ``Nicole went through three au pairs in just 15 months; that is worth thinking about,'' Steigberger said. ``She treated not only me badly, but also Betty, their housekeeper who had been with the family for a long time ... </P>
<P> ``I had the impression that Nicole was the boss in the house and that O.J. suffered very much under her arrogance.'' </P>
<P> ``O.J. Simpson is no animal but a sensitive person. If I can help him I most certainly will,'' Steigberger said. </P>
