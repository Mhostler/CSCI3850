<P>  Uzbekistan has backed President Clinton's decision to impose a trade embargo on Iran but other Central Asian leaders appear reluctant to take sides against their southern neighbor. </P>
<P> Clinton ordered the embargo on Tehran Sunday, accusing it of being an outlaw state backing terrorism and seeking to make nuclear weapons. He is expected to ask Russia at a summit next week to scrap plans to sell nuclear reactors to Tehran. </P>
<P> ``We know the reasons for the embargo and we support them,'' President Islam Karimov of Uzbekistan said after meeting International Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus. </P>
<P> ``I have already said that we in Uzbekistan think that the supply of these (Russian) reactors to Iran is not feasible.'' </P>
<P> The governments of Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan declined to comment. In Tajikistan, Prime Minister Djamshed Karimov said he was ``against any coercive methods, such as an embargo being imposed on another country.'' </P>
<P> The five ex-Soviet republics, with a combined population of 50 million, have an ambivalent relationship towards Iran. </P>
<P> It is a potentially important trading partner but they fear the spread of militant Islam as they try to recover from the economic shock that followed their gaining independence in 1991. </P>
<P> ``When the Soviet Union fell apart, countries like Iran, China and Turkey thought there would be a political vacuum,'' one Western diplomat said. ``They were wrong.'' </P>
<P> Instead, Communist leaders held on to power in a region where seven decades of Soviet rule deprived Islam of a broad social and political base in all but a few areas. </P>
<P> Radical Islam gained a foothold in Uzbekistan's densely populated Ferghana Valley, but Karimov cracked down hard on the Saudi-backed Wahabi sect there in 1992. </P>
<P> Tehran continues to shelter leaders of Tajikistan's Islamic Revival Party, one of the factions defeated in a 1992 civil war. </P>
<P> But despite regular military clashes on the Tajik-Afghan border, exiled rebels look unlikely to unseat the Moscow-backed government of President Imomali Rakhmonov. </P>
<P> Secretary of State Warren Christopher said last weekend that Iran had tried in 1992 to buy enriched uranium from Kazakhstan, which inherited Soviet nuclear weapons, processing facilities and the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site. </P>
<P> That partly explains the heavy U.S. diplomatic presence in the Kazakh capital Alma-Ata, which paid off last November when diplomats pulled off a deal to airlift half a ton of uranium to prevent the nuclear material falling into the wrong hands. </P>
