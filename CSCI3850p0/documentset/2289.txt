<P>  President Clinton left Kuwait for Saudi Arabia Friday on the final leg of a Middle East swing after telling Iraq it would never again be allowed to threaten the small oil-rich state it invaded in 1990. </P>
<P> During a six-hour visit, Clinton met U.S. troops he rushed to Kuwait early this month in response to the massing of Iraqi troops close to the border and told them they could probably expect to be back home for Christmas because Iraq had heard their message. </P>
