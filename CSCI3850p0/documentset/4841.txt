<P>  Firefighters Friday extinguished a raging fire burning for more than two months at a natural gas well in southern India. </P>
<P> The well fire, considered one of the worst in decades, was put out with a 600-pound blast of dynamite late Friday afternoon, said Brian Krause, a firefighter with Houston-based Emergency Resources International. </P>
<P> ``We tried an initial blast of 250 pounds of dynamite, but that didn't work, so we went to 600 pounds and that put it right out,'' Krause said of flames that had been shooting 450 feet into the air since Jan. 8. </P>
<P> Over the next two days, crews will remove debris from the wellhead and cap the well. Officials with India's state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. then will try to determine if the well can be put into production. </P>
<P> The fire, known as a blowout, was ignited when a drilling crew struck a highly pressurized natural gas deposit near Pasarlapudi, a village in a coastal area of the Andhra Pradesh region. </P>
<P> Raymond Henry, an Emergency Resources International vice president and a former crew member with legendary well fighter Red Adair, said the fire was the third worst he had seen in his 30-year career. </P>
<P> The company was brought in last month to fight the blaze after another firm was unable to control the fire. The Houston-based crew Thursday tried to drown the fire with water, but switched to dynamite today. </P>
<P> ``It's outstanding, especially having a competitor coming in for 50 days that was unable to put this thing out,'' Krause said. ``We were beginning to wonder how big a bomb we were going to have to put in there. </P>
<P> The fire was fed by about 35 million to 50 million cubic feet of natural gas a day. Because the gas was burning off cleanly, Krause said there was little environmental impact. </P>
<P> Krause downplayed reports that several thousand people had to be evacuated from the region after the fire erupted. </P>
<P> ``We moved people away when we set off the dynamite, but that's just because there were all these people wandering around,'' Krause said. </P>
