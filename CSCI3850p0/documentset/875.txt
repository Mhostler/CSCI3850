<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Women who claim they were harmed by breast implants told a judge Thursday how they feel about manufacturers at a hearing to determine the fairness of a $4.2 billion settlement. </P>
<P> Hundreds of women suffering from ailments they say were caused by breast implants attended the mass hearing in Birmingham. Because so many people were expected, U.S. District Judge Sam Pointer moved the hearing from the federal courthouse to the theater at Birmingham's civic center. </P>
<P> Estimates placed the number attending at 800, mainly women and lawyers. </P>
<P> About 90,000 women so far have accepted the class-action settlement against nearly 60 companies. Among the major defendants are Dow Co, Baxter Healthcare Corp, 3M and Union Carbide. The companies do not admit wrongdoing and deny their implants harmed women. </P>
<P> The hearing, scheduled to resume this morning at the civic center, is being held to determine whether the settlement of the lawsuit is fair. The settlement was reached earlier this year and won Pointer's preliminary approval. </P>
<P> Under the settlement, women would receive net payments ranging from $104,000 to $1.4 million each for illnesses including neurological disorders, lupus, and scleroderma -- a progressive disease marked by the deposition of fibrous connective tissue in the skin and internal organs. </P>
<P> Among issues raised was whether the $4.2 billion was enough to settle every case. If not, lawyers will have to go back to the negotiating table. </P>
<P> Gloria Palacios Orduno, 46, of Fresno, California, complained that Hispanic women in the United States were not properly informed about how to join the settlement. Orduno said few women have received information, although press kits were sent to Spanish-language radio stations and newspapers. </P>
<P> More than 350,000 women worldwide requested information on how to join the settlement, Pointer said. Fewer than 15,000 women have rejected it, choosing to resolve their own claims, he said, and about 40 percent of the ``opt-outs'' are from foreign women. </P>
<P> Carolyn Walton, 43, came to the hearing from New York to tell Judge Sam Pointer about how she believes breast cancer she discovered two years ago was caused by leaking implants. Although chemotherapy seems finally to have halted the malignancy, she said her life has crumbled. </P>
<P> Wearing a wig to cover her baldness, she told her story to the judge and then hurried outside in tears. Half a dozen women, most saying they had breast cancer, came after her. They hugged her and asked her how they could all join together. </P>
<P> Perhaps, they said, they could form their own class-action lawsuit -- one that included breast cancer. </P>
<P> ``I feel as though I have been ambushed by silicon,'' she said. ``I got a disease that I would have never gotten otherwise.'' </P>
