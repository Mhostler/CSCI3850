<P>  Carnival goers knew Grady Stiles as the ``Lobster Boy,'' but his wife claims she knew him as a mean and abusive drunk. </P>
<P> Stiles' wife, Mary, went on trial Monday, accused of hiring a hit man who murdered her husband in 1992. </P>
<P> Her husband had turned his birth defects -- hands and feet twisted to resemble lobster claws -- into an occupation. He billed himself as the ``Lobster Boy'' and took his carnival act on the road. </P>
<P> Defense attorneys said they will try to persuade a Hillsborough County jury that Mrs Stiles hired the hit man, only because she was so abused and battered that she feared for her life. This is one of the first Florida cases in which the so-called ``battered spouse'' defense has been used. </P>
<P> ``We have to look for 12 intelligent and open-minded jurors who have now become very much attuned to what happens to battered women,'' defense attorney Arnold Levine told reporters. </P>
<P> Mrs Stiles is expected to testify during the week-long trial. </P>
<P> Her stepson, Glenn Newman, who allegedly participated in hiring a hit man, goes on trial later this month. </P>
<P> The hit man, a neighbor of the Stiles who was paid $1,500 for the crime, is serving a 27-year sentence for his role. He fatally shot Stiles as he relaxed in a living room recliner. </P>
<P> The Stiles lived near Tampa in a community where several dozen circus performers live. </P>
