<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Italy's highest court of appeal Thursday ordered a retrial of four left-wing activists acquitted of the murder 22 years ago of a senior detective involved in a case made famous in the play ``Accidental Death of an Anarchist.''  The decision by the Court of Cassation to quash the acquittals reopened a case that has remained a mystery since May 1972, when detective Luigi Calabresi was shot dead outside his home in Milan. </P>
<P> Left-wing groups held Calabresi responsible for the death of an anarchist being questioned about an equally mysterious 1969 bomb attack which killed 16 people at a bank in Milan. </P>
<P> The anarchist, Giuseppe Pinelli, was officially reported to have jumped from a window of the Milan police headquarters. His fate inspired the play ``Accidental Death of an Anarchist'' by Italian playwright Dario Fo. </P>
<P> Four activists from the group Lotta Continua (Continuous Struggle) were found guilty of the Calabresi murder in 1990 but acquitted on appeal by a Milan court last December. </P>
<P> Thursday's ruling annuled the acquittals and ordered that the case be retried. </P>
