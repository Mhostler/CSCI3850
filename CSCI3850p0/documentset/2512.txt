<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Republican George Pataki, who came from relative obscurity to defeat leading liberal Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo, vowed Wednesday to fulfill his campaign promise of cutting taxes and fighting crime in New York state. </P>
<P> ``The cornerstone of our administration is our pledge to control spending and cut taxes... we're not going to back off our pledge to cut the income tax rate by 25 percent over the next four years,'' Pataki said at his first news conference since beating the three-term Cuomo by 49 percent to 45 percent of the vote in Tuesday's election. </P>
<P> Pataki, 49, a state senator who was not well known before launching his often bitter, expensive campaign to unseat Cuomo, said he will not change much personally when he takes office on Jan. 1 and wanted to keep in touch with the electorate. </P>
<P> The Republican, who campaigned on the slogan that it was time for change after 12 years of Cuomo, said he would be changing the workings of the state government and removing ''Mario Cuomo's political cronies.'' </P>
<P> The Governor-elect, standing alongside his wife, Libby, and Lt. Gov.-elect Betsy McCooeghey, tried to reassure New York City that it would not suffer because of the cross-party endorsement of Cuomo by New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani or because he won most of his votes upstate and in the suburbs. </P>
<P> ``I understand and feel very deeply about how important the success of the city is to the entire state,'' Pataki said. ``And to the extent that the people of this city might have fears ... let me reassure them we are not going to base our decisions on political self-interest.'' </P>
<P> ``I understand that that is not the solution to crime and we are going to look to have a more comprehensive criminal justice system and we'll try to get it through as well,'' he said. </P>
