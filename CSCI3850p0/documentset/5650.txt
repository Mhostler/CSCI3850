<P>  Taiwan's Premier Lien Chan said on Tuesday that although Taipei maintains a claim of sovereignty over all of China, it would shelve this claim in the interests of harmony with its arch-rival. </P>
<P> Lien's words, which spelled out a hitherto slightly vague stance on this key issue, complemented remarks made by President Lee Teng-hui who called for ``peace and reason'' in relations between Taiwan and its giant neighbour. </P>
<P> ``Although we do not have administrative sovereignty over the Chinese mainland, that does not mean that we relinquish sovereignty over the mainland,'' Lien said in parliament in response to a question. </P>
<P> ``If we emphasise the issue of sovereignty, that will not have any contribution to cross-straits relations,'' Lien added. </P>
<P> ``If both sides continue to emphasise sovereignty issues, it is very likely that interaction between the two sides will not have any progress,'' he added. </P>
<P> Taiwan and China have been rivals since 1949 when Nationalist forces lost the Chinese civil war and fled to this island. China sees Taiwan as a rebel-held province and has not ruled out using force to recover it. </P>
<P> Taiwan has in recent years softened its position on sovereignty from an outright claim to rule all of China, to an acceptance that Beijing weilds administrative sovereignty over the mainland but Taipei retains a territorial claim. </P>
<P> Analysts say the softening of Taiwan's position was aimed at winning a reciprocal concession from Beijing to renounce the possible use of force. This has not materialised. </P>
<P> Lee, in his official reply last week to an overture from Chinese President Jiang Zemin in January, called on China to waive the threat of force as a precondition to talks on reunification which Beijing wants. </P>
<P> On Tuesday, Lee said he hoped relations across the Taiwan Strait could be characterised by peace and reason and reiterated a call for a first meeting between him and China's leaders. </P>
<P> ``We hope the two sides can maintain peace and reason and not engage in worthless speculation and struggles,'' Lee told a visiting United States senator, Charles Robb. </P>
