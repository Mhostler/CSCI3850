<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, England (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A nursery school teacher bound and gagged an asthmatic 4-year-old boy because he was making too much noise clapping his hands. </P>
<P> The school in the central England town of Birmingham confirmed that the teacher bound Nathaniel Thomas' hands and covered his mouth with tape. </P>
<P> The teacher has apologized to the boy's parents and the school is to discipline him, education authorities said Tuesday. The boy's father, Dean Thomas, is seeking legal advice. </P>
<P> ``It all began because he was clapping in class. He was playing up in the nursery unit like all the children but he is only four years old,'' Thomas told reporters. </P>
<P> ``The teacher could have punished him in many other ways, such as make him stand on his own in the corner. My son is asthmatic and this could have triggered a reaction.'' </P>
