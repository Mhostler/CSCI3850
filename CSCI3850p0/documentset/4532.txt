<P>  Clinton administration officials Friday gave an upbeat view of progress in Haiti since the U.S. military intervention last fall, but members of Congress voiced fears the situation might deteriorate. </P>
<P> ``Operation Uphold Democracy has set a new standard for the degree of peace and civic order that has been kept in a peacekeeping operation,'' Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott told a congressional hearing. </P>
<P> He said that President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who returned from exile last October following the intervention, had ``lived up to our hopes ... and promises to be a president of reconciliation.'' </P>
<P> He said U.S. forces, now numbering 5,600, would be cut by more than half when the United Nations takes over the mission at the end of March. He and and other officials put the price of U.S. and military costs in Haiti at more than $1.4 billion in fiscal years 1994-5. </P>
<P> Congress was deeply divided over the operation when it was launched but its apparent success so far has muted criticism. </P>
<P> New York Republican Benjamin Gilman, chairman of the House International Relations Committee, said he believed the new Republican Congress would not interfere in Haiti but that a bipartisan, sustainable policy ``does not now exist.'' </P>
<P> Indiana Democrat Lee Hamilton said he was less worried about what happened next year than when the United Nations pulled out. He questioned whether it was sound policy to announce that ``we are going to get out at a certain date.'' </P>
<P> The administration officials denied a report attributed by Gilman to U.N. sources that the U.N. operation in Haiti had put a cap on all procurement from American companies ``as a way of retaliating against our nation for its insistence on naming a U.S. commander as head of the Haitian operation.'' </P>
<P> Gilman's charge followed a report in the Friday's New York Daily News that the United Nations was trying to block Haiti peacekeepers from buying more than $200 million in supplies and services from U.S. contractors, allegedly in retaliation for congressional moves to cut U.N. peacekeeping funds. </P>
<P> The report said that the United Nations had approved purchase of provisions from Cuba, which is under a U.S. trade embargo. </P>
<P> In New York, U.N. spokesman Ahmad Fawzi said the report was untrue. He said requests for bids were sent out worldwide to 70 vendors, which included the United States and Cuba. </P>
<P> ``There is not one word limiting what or how much goods and services can be bought from U.S. vendors for use in Haiti,'' Fawzi said. </P>
