<P> Witnesses said the shots were fired by security guards from inside the warehouse and by gunmen from a truck which pulled up to the gate. </P>
<P> Nine people, including children, were wounded by gunfire and thrown rocks, according to journalists on the scene. </P>
<P> At least two young boys and a 12-year-old girl were injured. </P>
<P> ``There were children hiding in the bushes and the gunmen came out and were shooting them like rabbits,'' said a photographer who witnessed the scene. </P>
<P> Another radio reporter said the gunmen opened fire with shotguns, pistols and automatic weapons. </P>
<P> ``Two children under the age of 10 were hit right next to me,'' he said. ``One was hit by shotgun fire in the face and the other in the arm.'' </P>
