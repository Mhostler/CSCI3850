<P> Asked on what grounds the sect's followers were arrested, a spokesman for the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department said he was not sure. ``I don't know exactly, but I think it is for confining people against their will.'' he said. </P>
<P> The sect has denied media speculation that it may have been linked to a deadly nerve-gas attack in the Tokyo subway system on Monday. At least 10 people have died so far and more than 5,000 were affected by the gas attacks, which the government has termed indiscriminate murder. </P>
<P> The army's anti-chemical warfare unit accompanied the early-morning raid by about 3,000 officers on the Aum Shinri Kyo's 25 complexes of buildings in Tokyo and near Mt. Fuji, 100 km (65 miles) west of the capital. </P>
<P> Police said the raid stemmed from an abduction charge. Last month, 69-year old Tokyo city employee Kiyoshi Kariya disappeared after he was seen being pushed into a van by four people. His younger sister was trying to break with the sect after pledging the family's assets in donations. </P>
