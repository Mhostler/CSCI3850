<P>  A settler rabbi who said it was permissible to kill non-Jews was convicted of inciting racism by a Jerusalem court Wednesday, Israel Television said. </P>
<P> He was also found guilty of various weapons charges. </P>
<P> Ido Elba, from a settlement on the outskirts of the occupied West Bank town of Hebron, will be sentenced Thursday. </P>
<P> He told the Jerusalem Post in January it was permissible to kill any non-Jew. He was in jail on the weapons charges at the time. </P>
<P> Asked about innocent Arabs, Elba said: ``According to Jewish law, there is no such thing. No gentile on the side that is at war against us is innocent.'' </P>
<P> Elba said of settler Baruch Goldstein, who massacred 29 Muslim worshippers kneeling in prayer in February 1994 in Hebron: ``If he did what they said he did, all he did was carry out what is written: 'Whoever comes to kill you, rise up to kill him.''' </P>
<P> Israeli authorities arrested a number of settlers last fall on suspicion they were part of a ring planning attacks against Arabs. Most of those detained were later released. </P>
