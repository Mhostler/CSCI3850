<DATELINE>MIAMI (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Three one-point decisions and two overtime thrillers filled the National Football League with excitement on a Sunday that once again proved Dan Marino to be a master at conducting the winning, last-minute drive. </P>
<P> Marino marched the Dolphins 41 yards in eight plays to set up Pete Stoyanovich's 34-yard field goal with four seconds left that gave Miami a 22-21 win over the Indianapolis Colts. </P>
<P> ``There was no need to say anything to anyone,'' Marino said of the drive that improved Miami's mark atop the AFC East to 7-2. ``No speeches were needed. Everyone knew what to do.'' </P>
<P> A 28-yard interception return for a score by Ray Buchanan had given the Colts (4-6) a 21-12 fourth-quarter lead. </P>
<P> ``I felt we had scratched their heart out when I ran into the end zone,'' said Buchanan. ``I should have known better.'' </P>
<P> Marino completed 30 of 41 passes and rallied the Dolphins to 16 fourth-quarter points. It marked the 28th fourth-quarter comeback victory engineered by Marino in his career. </P>
<P> At Minnesota, Warren Moon provided the heroics by hitting Qadry Ismail with an 11-yard scoring pass with five seconds left to lift the Vikings over the New Orleans Saints 21-20. </P>
<P> Moon completed 33 of a career-high 57 attempts for 420 yards and three touchdowns. He completed 8-of-12 for 84 yards on the game-winning drive by Minnesota (7-2). </P>
<P> ``When you know you need to do it quick, Warren will come into the huddle and say, 'This is what we are going to do,''' said end Jake Reed. ``We listen and today we did what he said.'' </P>
<P> New Orleans fell to 3-6. </P>
<P> In Atlanta, Jeff George hit Terance Mathis with a nine-yard touchdown pass on the game's first drive and Norm Johnson kicked a 23-yard field goal to give the Falcons enough points for a 10-9 win over the San Diego Chargers. </P>
<P> San Diego (7-2) played without quarterback Stan Humphries, who dislocated his left elbow in their 35-15 win over Seattle last week. Gale Gilbert started for Humphries. </P>
<P> ``I'm embarrassed about how we played offensively, but at least we won the game,'' said June Jones, coach of 5-4 Atlanta. </P>
<P> In Houston, Gary Anderson kicked his fourth field goal of the game, a 40-yarder, with 3:36 remaining in overtime to give the Pittsburgh Steelers a 12-9 win over the Oilers. </P>
<P> Anderson's game-winner was set up by Houston back Gary Brown's fumble at his own 22-yard line after a hit by defensive back Rod Woodson. </P>
<P> The Steelers moved to 6-3, while the Oilers dipped to 1-8. </P>
<P> In Seattle, the Cincinnati Bengals won for the first time this season when Jeff Blake completed a 76-yard pass to Darnay Scott to set up Doug Pelfrey's sixth field goal, a 26-yarder in overtime for a 20-17 win against the Seahawks. </P>
<P> Blake, making his second career start, completed 31-of-43 passes for 387 yards to end the Bengals' frustration after starting the season with eight defeats. ``I'm happy, the guy's are happy, we're all happy to get our first win,'' Blake said. </P>
<P> In Kansas City, Joe Montana connected with Derrick Walker on a 57-yard touchdown and let the Chiefs defense do the rest in a 13-3 victory against the Los Angeles Raiders (4-5). </P>
<P> Walker scored the touchdown 9:22 into the second quarter, giving the Chiefs the lead for good as they improved to 6-3 in Marty Schottenheimer's 100th regular season coaching win. </P>
<P> In Green Bay, Brett Favre threw three touchdown passes for a big early lead and the Packers survived a late Detroit rally for a 38-30 victory over the Lions. </P>
<P> Dave Krieg, who replaced injured quarterback Scott Mitchell, threw two touchdown passes and a pair of two-point conversions to bring the Lions within eight. </P>
<P> Green Bay improved to 5-4 and dropped Detroit to 4-5. </P>
<P> In Philadelphia, Randall Cunningham threw two third-quarter touchdown passes to Fred Barnett as the Eagles spoiled Buddy Ryan's return with a 17-7 win over Arizona. </P>
<P> Cunningham won his 20th straight start at Veterans Stadium to lift the Eagles to 7-2, a half-game back of NFC East leading Dallas, who play the Giants on Monday. The Cardinals, coached by former Eagles coach Ryan, fell to 3-6. </P>
<P> At New York, Boomer Esiason threw two touchdown passes, including the 200th of his NFL career, as the Jets completed their first series sweep of Buffalo since 1986 with a 22-17 victory over the Bills. </P>
<P> Buffalo, AFC champions four years in a row, drove to the Jets' 27 in the final minute before stalling. </P>
<P> The Jets raised their mark to 5-4, the same as Buffalo. </P>
<P> In Washington, Steve Young passed for 269 yards in the first half as the San Francisco 49ers flexed their muscles in a 37-22 rout of the Redskins. </P>
<P> The 49ers (7-2) won their fourth in a row. Washington dropped to 2-8. </P>
<P> In Cleveland, Leroy Hoard rushed for 123 yards and caught a touchdown pass and Eric Turner intercepted two passes to help the Browns beat the New England Patriots 13-6. </P>
<P> The Patriots plunged to 3-6 as the Browns improved to 7-2. </P>
<P> In Los Angeles, Chris Chandler, filling in for injured Chris Miller, threw a pair of touchdowns as the Rams held on to beat the Denver Broncos 27-21. </P>
<P> The victory put the Rams at 4-5. Denver dropped to 3-6. </P>
<P> At Tampa Bay, Steve Walsh won his fourth consecutive start as the Chicago Bears used a pair of second-half touchdown drives to beat the Buccaneers 20-6. </P>
<P> Walsh led the Bears on drives of 62 and 80 yards as Chicago (5-4) snapped a two-game skid. Tampa's record is 2-7. </P>
