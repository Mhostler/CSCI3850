<P> The Security Council Saturday adopted a resolution authorizing NATO to follow Serb aircraft from Bosnia to Croatia, and if necessary, strike Ubdina airport, the launching point for rebel Serbs in Croatia. </P>
<P> But U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright told the council the pattern of activity from Ubdina justified a military response from NATO. ``We would expect that any requests for NATO air strikes made today or in the future would yield a positive response from all concerned,'' she said. </P>
<P> France's envoy, Herve Ladsous, disclosed to the council that Lapresle had asked for NATO action early Friday. Diplomats said NATO had hesitated for technical reasons while U.N. officials sought the mandate from the council and permission from Zagreb to fly into Croatia. </P>
<P> Both British and Russian envoys had said the resolution was not retroactive but pressure for some action apparently resulted after Saturday's second air strike in the Bihac area in northwest Bosnia. British Ambassador David Hannay, however, said Saturday that any decisions on military activity would be left to the U.N. officials and NATO. </P>
