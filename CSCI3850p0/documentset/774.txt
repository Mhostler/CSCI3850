<P>  Winning major golf championships is never easy, but Nick Price didn't lose any sleep in capturing his second major title in two months. </P>
<P> ``To lead a golf tournament from wire to wire is very difficult -- you have to sleep on the lead every night,'' Price said. ``Fortunately, I slept well this week.'' </P>
<P> He also worked very hard to win his second PGA Championship trophy to go along with his British Open victory last month, giving him three major titles in two years. </P>
<P> After the 37-year-old Zimbabwean had his worst round of the championship on Saturday -- a par-matching 70 -- he went out to the practice ground and hit balls until he was satisfied that he had regained his game. </P>
<P> ``Everything fell into place for me today,'' he said on Sunday about his three-under-par 67 final round, which enabled him to set a championship scoring record and take over the No. 1 spot in the world rankings. </P>
<P> ``I knew what needed to be done and I went out and did it,'' added Price, who now has 16 victories and 45 top-10 finishes in his last 82 events. </P>
<P> He had the same attitude six years ago when he finished second in the British Open for the second time -- which turned out to be a turning point in his career. </P>
<P> Seve Ballesteros outplayed Price in the final round at Royal Lytham and St. Annes, but the runner-up learned a valuable lesson from the Spanish master. </P>
<P> ``He putted so well and his short game was so much better than mine, Price recalled. ``That's when I started working on my short game.'' </P>
<P> All the work paid off handsomely. </P>
<P> ``It was my short game that outshone my long game this week,'' he said. ``My game around the greens was flawless.'' </P>
<P> While Price's golf game has no flaws these days, he says it is his mental attitude that allows him to win so consistently. </P>
<P> ``I just have so much confidence in my ability and it showed in the way I played today,'' he said after beating one of the toughest fields in golf by six strokes on a difficult golf course. </P>
<P> ``You cannot underestimate how important confidence is in this game,'' Price said. ``I'm out there trying to get control of a game that is uncontrollable.'' </P>
<P> Price, who had rounds of 67, 65, 70 and 67 on the par-70 Southern Hills golf course, actually took control of the championship with a three-under-par front nine in the final round. </P>
<P> ``I could not have wished to play the front nine any better,'' said Price, who had a six-shot advantage at the turn. </P>
<P> ``I owe this championship an awful lot,'' he said of the fourth and final major of the year. ``It kick-started the second half of my career.'' </P>
<P> Price won the 1992 PGA at Bellerive Country Club in St. Louis for his first major title -- which he said at the time ''took a pack of monkeys off my back.'' </P>
<P> Then in 1993 he won four tournaments on the U.S. Tour and the $1 million Sun City Challenge in South Africa. He also won three times in this country before his heroic come-from-behind victory in last month's Open Championship. </P>
<P> ``After that, the only thing I had left to prove was to play well in the majors -- and the British Open (victory) squashed any doubts about that,'' he said. So did his win here. </P>
<P> ``Those monkeys are lost in the bush somewhere,'' he said with a big smile. </P>
