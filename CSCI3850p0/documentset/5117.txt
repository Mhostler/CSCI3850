<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, March 23 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Romanian authorities have detained a member of the ultra-leftist Japan Red Army (JRA) who entered the country on a forged passport, Romanian Interpol officers said on Thursday. </P>
<P> Colonel Ioan Hurdubaie of the Bucharest office of the international police organisation Interpol said Yukiko Ekita, 44, was detained in the Romanian capital last week. </P>
<P> Hurdubaie told Reuters police had acted on a tip off from Japanese police, adding that the woman had entered Romania with a forged Peruvian passport. He declined to give further details. </P>
<P></P>
<P> ``Nothing has been decided for the time being...she was detained in Bucharest for using forged documents. This is an internal (police) matter.'' </P>
<P> Hurdubaie said the case was being investigated by the organised crime department of the Romanian police and by prosecutors. They declined to comment on the case. </P>
<P> A spokesman for Japan's National Police Agency said earlier on Thursday it had received no reports on the case and refused to comment further. All JRA members are wanted in Japan. </P>
<P> In 1977, Ekita was freed along with several other leftists awaiting trial in Japan after the JRA hijacked a Japanese airliner in India and demanded Tokyo release 12 prisoners in exchange for the hostages. </P>
<P> Because she was released through an extra-legal process, Ekita technically is still awaiting trial in connection with several bombings in Tokyo in 1974-75. </P>
<P> The JRA, believed to be based in the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon or in Damascus, was responsible for a series of guerrilla attacks in the 1970s and 1980s. </P>
<P> In May, 1972, three JRA guerrillas killed 26 tourists and wounded 76 at Tel Aviv's Lod Airport. Two of the guerrillas were killed by police. The third, Kozo Okamoto, was captured but later freed in an Israeli-Palestinian prisoner exchange. </P>
<P> The JRA is believed to have dwindled to 15 activists living in the Middle East, where the end of the Cold War and regional peace talks have left the ageing revolutionaries high and dry. </P>
<P> The JRA was last heard of publicly when an operative was arrested in New Jersey in 1988 after police found three home-made pipe bombs in his car, two days before he planned to blow up a U.S. Navy recruiting office. </P>
<P> Two days later, two car bombs blew up outside a U.S. servicemen's club in Naples, killing four Italians and a U.S. servicewoman. </P>
<P> The last arrest of a JRA member was in 1988 when police in the Philippines apprehended Hiroshi Sensui. He was deported to Japan and arrested. </P>
