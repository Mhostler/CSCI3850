<P>  World Boxing Council superwelterweight champion Terry Norris of the United States lost his title on a disqualification in the fifth round for rabbit punching Luis Santana of the Dominican Republic Saturday. </P>
<P> Norris gave Santana a fearsome pummeling against the ropes that dropped the challenger to the canvas where he lay flat on his back for about five minutes before being taken out of the ring on a stretcher. </P>
<P> Some in the crowd of about 10,000 in Mexico City's bullring hurled cushions and shouted insults at Norris, who said, ``I was robbed. I saw him lying there and I knew my title was gone. I definitely want my title back.'' </P>
<P> Referee Mitch Halpern of the United States waved the fight over at two minutes and two seconds of the fifth round. </P>
<P> The three judges had the bout even after four rounds. </P>
<P> Ring doctor Horacio Ramirez, who said Norris hit Santana ''directly in the back of the head,'' said Santana was okay, but sent him to the hospital as a precaution. </P>
<P> Norris headbutted Santana in the fourth round, opening a cut on Santana's forehead and appeared to be building up steam against the Dominican when the incident took place. </P>
<P> Norris's manager Joe Sayatovich fiercely protested the decision, saying he would ask the World Boxing Council to disqualify Santana for faking the incident. </P>
<P> ``He was clearly knocked out and his camp told him to stay on the mat,'' Sayatovich said. He also blamed the referee's inexperience. </P>
<P> The bout was one of five world title fights slated for Saturday at the Mexico City bull ring. </P>
<P> Earlier Genaro Hernandez of the United States retained his World Boxing Association junior lightweight title, beating challenger Jimmy Garcia of Colombia on a unanimous points decision after 12 rounds. </P>
<P> Holder Orlin Norris of the United States also retained his World Boxing Association cruiserweight title when he knocked out fellow American James Heath at 2:46 of the second round of their scheduled 12-round bout. </P>
