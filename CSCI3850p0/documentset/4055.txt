<DATELINE>DENVER (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  One of the 29 Canadian gray wolves released into the Northern Rockies earlier this month was found shot to death in Idaho, lying near the body of a dead newborn calf it had just attacked, officials said Monday. </P>
<P> ``The wolf was found by the landowner who was moving cattle from one pasture to another,'' said Sam Slavin, chief deputy of the Lemhi County Sheriff's office. </P>
<P> Next to the female wolf the landowner found a dead calf and according to a local veterinarian, black hair and flesh from the calf was found in the wolf's stomach, Slavin said. </P>
<P> ``We determined the wolf did kill the calf,'' said Ted Koch, in charge of wolf recovery in Idaho for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Koch was among wildlife experts who examined the wolf near Salmon, Idaho, close to the Montana border. </P>
<P> According to a controversial plan to reintroduce wolves into the American west, ranchers can kill a wolf if the animal is found attacking livestock. </P>
<P> ``He has not admitted or denied'' shooting the wolf, Slavin said, although the rancher has said the calf belonged to him. </P>
<P> The wolf could have been shot by a coyote hunter in the area, Slavin said. </P>
<P> ``People shoot coyotes for fun out here,'' Koch said. If the rancher had killed the wolf while the predator was attacking the calf, the killing would have been legal, Koch said. </P>
<P> However, the right to kill the wolf during an attack is reserved to the rancher or his agents, meaning this wolf killing was illegal, Koch said, and government agents are continuing their investigation. </P>
<P> Defenders of Wildlife, an environmental group, reiterated that its Wolf Compensation Fund would compensate producers at full market value for any livestock losses verified by qualified state or federal officials. </P>
<P> The fund, established in 1987, has paid approximately $17,000 to more than 20 ranchers as part of a campaign to shift economic responsibility for wolves ``away from individual livestock producers and toward the millions of people who support wolf recovery,'' the group said. </P>
<P> Also, Koch said in the past 10 years in northwest Montana, while gray wolves have migrated naturally, only 19 cows and 12 sheep have been killed by wolves. This wolf probably approached livestock because it has been recently moved and may still have been disoriented, Koch said. </P>
<P> Earlier this month, 15 wolves were released into the central Idaho wilds and another 14 were sent to Yellowstone National Park. </P>
<P> But ranchers have severely criticized the plan, fearing the wolves will attack and kill livestock. The American Farm Bureau has filed a lawsuit in federal court to stop the plan, which calls for releasing 30 wolves a year for the next three to five years. </P>
