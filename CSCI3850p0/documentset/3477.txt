<P>  Queen Elizabeth turned firefighter after smoke started billowing out of a fireplace at Windsor Castle, a spokesman for the royal family said Wednesday. </P>
<P> The queen grabbed a soda siphon and doused the fire in a grate in the Oak Room of the castle after she noticed smoke, the Buckingham Palace spokesman said. </P>
<P> ``There was a fire burning in a grate in one of the rooms at Windsor,'' he said. ``The damper in the chimney ... which excludes the draft, was blown shut and some of the smoke came into the room ... the best way to open it was to put the fire out.'' </P>
<P> He gave no details of when the incident happened. </P>
<P> Windsor Castle, one of the queen's residences, is about 20 miles west of London. The monarch and most of her immediate family spent the Christmas holiday at Sandringham, an estate in Norfolk in eastern England. </P>
<P> ``The Queen, with great presence of mind, put the fire out with a siphon of soda,'' he said. ``There was no question of either the Queen being in danger or of a major fire in Windsor Castle ... no damage (was) done,'' he added. </P>
<P> Fire-protection at Britain's royal palaces came in for some sharp criticism in an official report this year following a blaze that severely damaged several rooms in a wing of Windsor Castle in November 1992. </P>
<P> The report said the palaces did not have sprinkler systems to stop a serious fire or proper insurance for fire damage. </P>
<P> The repair bill for Windsor Castle has been put at $60 million. In August last year, the queen opened the doors of Buckingham Palace in London to tourists to help raise money toward repairing the fire damage at Windsor. </P>
