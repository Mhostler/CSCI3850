<P>  A Canadian abortion doctor shot by a sniper last month said Thursday his commitment to women's rights to abortion has not wavered since the attack. </P>
<P> Dr. Garson Romalis nearly died Nov. 8 after two shots were fired through his kitchen window as he ate breakfast. Police have made no arrests in the case but are investigating the possibility that the sniper was an anti-abortion activist. </P>
<P> ``Women have been having abortions for hundreds of years. There's no stopping it. The issue is only whether they should have safe abortions or unsafe abortions,'' Romalis told the Globe and Mail newspaper in his first interview since the shooting. </P>
<P> The attack on Romalis occurred less than a week after a U.S. jury convicted militant anti-abortionist Paul Hill for murdering a doctor and his escort outside a Florida abortion clinic in July. </P>
<P> Romalis, who is still recovering in the hospital, has been the target of anti-abortion protesters in the past, although police stress they have not ruled out other possible motives. </P>
<P> Two prominent British Columbia anti-abortion groups condemned the shooting. </P>
<P> Romalis said he was surprised by the attack because he did not view himself as a high-profile figure in the abortion debate. ``I'm just a quiet little guy...minding my own business,'' he said. ``Even though I'm a well-adjusted guy, it has shaken me up a bit.'' </P>
<P> Romalis has been under police protection while in the hospital and security has been tightened at abortion clinics and hospitals since the shooting. </P>
<P> The British Columbia Medical Association offered a $100,000 Canadian ($74,000 U.S.) reward for information leading to an arrest in the Romalis case. Police have issued two composite drawings of men sought for questioning in the case but have stopped short of calling them suspects. </P>
