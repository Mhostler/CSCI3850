<P>  For Jewish people, the tradition of fast food dates back to the Exodus, when a nation of slaves on the run escaped into the wilderness and found that the quickest way to eat was to make a flat bread called the Matzo. </P>
<P> To re-live the Exodus experience, the Hasidic Chabad Lubavitch movement has come up with a novel twist -- a free prepackaged Passover Seder-To-Go with all the trimmings for 25,000 college students who can't make it home for the holiday, a Lubavitch spokesman said Wednesday. </P>
<P> The first night of Passover is Friday. </P>
<P> On Friday evening, thousands of college students are going to sit down on campuses across the country for what is being advertised as the world's biggest Seder, spokesman Zalman Shmotkin said. </P>
<P> ``It's going to be the Great North American Passover Seder -- only we won't all be sitting at one table,'' Rabbi Yossi Levertov, a Lubavitch campus coordinator said. </P>
<P> ``What we are doing is distributing to students free Seder-To-Go packages that include in the traditional holiday meal a bottle of Kosher-for-Passover grape juice, hand-baked matzos ... a portion of freshly ground, vacuum-sealed bitter herbs, and a shank bone,'' he said. </P>
<P> Levertov said orders have been pouring in for the last two weeks from students at universities including Yale, Harvard, Princeton, MIT, Vasser, New York University, Columbia and Brown and Tulane. </P>
<P> More than 50 Chabad House student centers in the United States are spearheading Seders-To-Go, Levertov said. </P>
<P> ``We are not trying to discourage students from going home but for those who want to hang out during the holiday, this is a great way to join in the Passover celebration,'' he said. </P>
<P> For the last several weeks, students have been calling 1-800-4 CHABAD to place their Seder order, he said. The offer is also advertised in campus newspapers and rock stations and over the Internet. </P>
<P> In one radio spot where listeners are told the speaker is Bill Clinton, the sound-a-like President is heard saying: ``Let us begin by saying these four great questions that still have to be answered and we're going to ask them all across the country.'' </P>
<P> The imitator then recites in Hebrew, the first of four questions asked during a Seder: ``Why is this night of Passover different from all other nights of the year?'' </P>
<P> ``Seders-To-Go,'' the Clinton voice ultimately replies. </P>
