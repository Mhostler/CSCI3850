<P>  A Palestinian police officer was killed while trying to mediate a roadside dispute between secret police and armed Hamas militants in Palestinian-ruled Gaza, Palestinian sources said Sunday. </P>
<P> Izz al-Din al-Qassam, the military wing of Hamas, said in a leaflet that the officer, Major Yusri al-Hams, was shot dead by Palestinian secret police who opened fire Saturday night on two Qassam members. Qassam said the two activists were wounded. </P>
<P> The secret police, or Preventive Security Force, had no immediate comment but sources in PLO chairman Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement confirmed the police officer had been killed. </P>
<P> Qassam said the incident began when three secret policemen stopped a car with two of its members near the town of Rafah, at the southern end of the Gaza Strip. An argument ensued over two pistols carried by the Qassam men. </P>
<P> Hams arrived at the scene and tried to calm matters. ``When the Qassam members wanted to leave the area, the secret police opened fire,'' killing the police officer and wounding the two men, the leaflet said. </P>
<P> Arafat has said in recent weeks he would not disarm activists from Hamas, which opposes his peace deal with Israel, but pledged to stop attacks by Muslim militants against Israelis. </P>
