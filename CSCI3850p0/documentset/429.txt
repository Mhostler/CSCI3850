<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Arkansas Republican candidate for state attorney general is in trouble with the law for allegedly beating his wife but his spokesman is claiming that the charges might be ``politically motivated.'' </P>
<P> The arrest of Dan Ivy on third degree battery charges Sunday has embarrassed state Republicans who have been happily blasting away at President Cinton and his hometown allies. </P>
<P> Ivy, a Fayetteville lawyer, was charged with battery after his wife telephoned police and said he was abusing her. He was released on his own recognizance. </P>
<P> In response to requests by reporters, police released tapes of calls for assistance by Sarah Ivy and a call to headquarters by her husband late Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``My husband's pulling my hair. He's doing all kinds of things,'' Sarah Ivy told police, crying and gasping for breath. ''He's just threatened to hit me with a baseball bat. </P>
<P> ``He's done this many times before, but I've never reported it,'' Sarah Ivy is heard telling a police dispatcher. </P>
<P> Seconds later, police tapes indicate, Dan Ivy called police. </P>
<P> ``She started screaming bloody murder,'' Ivy is heard to say. ``She started running around the house accusing me of this and that. I don't know what to do.'' </P>
<P> At that point, officers arrived at the Ivy home and took Dan Ivy into custody. He was later freed when his wife did not appear to be seriously injured, according to police. </P>
<P> Ivy has not responded to calls by reporters, though he issued a statement denying that he struck his wife. </P>
<P> His campaign manager, John Baxter, said he suspected the incident was ``politically motivated.'' Baxter also said Sarah Ivy had twice received psychiatric care, but neither of the Arkansas hospitals where Baxter said she received treatment would comment. </P>
<P> Ivy is to be arraigned August 5. Arkansas law provides penalties for third-degree battery of up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine. </P>
<P> The Arkansas Republican establishment was not thrilled early this year when Ivy, after two unsuccessful races for Congress in Arkansas as a Democrat, pronounced himself a Republican. </P>
<P> But in this year's spring primaries, Ivy ran unopposed for the Republican nomination for attorney general, and opposes incumbent Arkansas attorney general Winston Bryant, a heavy favorite for re-election. </P>
<P> Ivy's political philosophy has veered from the unabashedly populist to the sternly conservative. He is best known to voters in Arkansas for his television advertisements for his personal injury law practice, which feature a toll-free number for potential litigants. </P>
