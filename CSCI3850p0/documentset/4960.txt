<P>  Israel is running into international opposition to its plans to celebrate the 3,000th anniversary of the Jewish claim to Jerusalem, Deputy Foreign Minister Yossi Beilin said Thursday. </P>
<P> But Beilin vowed continued ministry support for Jerusalem 3000, a 15-month series of cultural events, exhibitions and fairs beginning in September and announced last week by the city's right-wing Jewish mayor. </P>
<P> ``I regret very much that we have run into cool reactions from several elements, in Europe, from the Vatican and even in the United States,'' Beilin told Israel Radio. </P>
<P> The status of Jerusalem, a city holy to Jews, Muslims and Christians, is bitterly disputed by Israelis and Palestinians. Most of the world does not recognize Israel's claim to all of Jerusalem, including the Arab eastern part captured in the 1967 Middle East war, as its capital. </P>
<P> Under the Israel-PLO peace deal of 1993, negotiations on the final status of the city are scheduled to begin in 1996. </P>
<P> Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert, of the rightist Likud party, has insisted the anniversary celebrations -- marking King David's proclamation of Jerusalem as the capital of the Jewish people -- would carry a message of religious tolerance. </P>
<P> ``I can let you in on a secret ... many countries would be happier if we weren't in Jerusalem at all,'' Olmert told the radio. </P>
<P> ``I don't know what the fuss is about. Jerusalem is the capital of Israel,'' he said. </P>
