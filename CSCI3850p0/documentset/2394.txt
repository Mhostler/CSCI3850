<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The 25th anniversary of the New York City Marathon on Sunday will feature a flock of former champions and all the elements that have made the race a global event save one -- inspirational impresario Fred Lebow. </P>
<P> Led by an array of international world class runners a field of some 28,000 starters will traverse the now-familiar citywide course past hundreds of thousands on the way to the Central Park finish line where they will pass a life-size statue of Lebow, who died four weeks ago of brain cancer. </P>
<P> ``It won't be the same,'' said Allan Steinfeld, successor to the 62-year-old Lebow. </P>
<P> ``It will be strange for everybody,'' said 1988 champion Steve Jones of Britain, one of four former men's winners in the field. ``A part of the New York Marathon is missing.'' </P>
<P> Lebow had been director of the race since 1970 when he was one of 55 runners to complete the race that consisted of four loops of Central Park. </P>
<P> In 1976, Lebow took the race to the streets and bridges of the city's five boroughs and with his innovations and flair for publicity, the race grew to gigantic proportions. </P>
<P> ``Every runner in the world knows about the New York City Marathon,'' said 1983 champion Rod Dixon of New Zealand, one of 21 former winners to return for ceremonies commemorating the race's silver anniversary. ``This is the Mt. Everest of our sport.'' </P>
<P> The task of managing the event has gone to the 48-year-old Steinfeld, Lebow's righthand man over the years. </P>
<P> ``The sadness part is certainly there,'' he said. ``Fred permeates everything I do. I am constantly thinking about him and Fred is there with us, no question.'' </P>
<P> Runners, too, will have occasion to think of Lebow. </P>
<P> One of his last showbiz touches will greet them at the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge starting line when a squadron of military planes fly over and release plumes of red, white and blue smoke. </P>
<P> It is an idea Lebow borrowed from this year's D-Day festivities after a trip to the Normandy Beaches in France, Steinfeld said. </P>
<P> ``He called me from his hotel room in the middle of the night,'' recalled Steinfeld. ``He said, 'we must do this'.'' </P>
<P> There will also be aerial tributes to Lebow at the start line as five 1940 U.S. Navy fighters spell out the message ``For You, Fred.'' The message will be repeated at the eight, 17 and 20-mile marks of the race and at the finish. </P>
<P> ``I will think about him when I run,'' said 1992 champion Willie Mtolo of South Africa. </P>
<P> Other former men's champions competing are Salvador Garcia of Mexico (1991) and Gianni Poli of Italy (1986). </P>
<P> The race favorites are Vincent Rousseau of Belgium, who is making his New York City Marathon debut after winning three of his last four marathons, and Mexican-born Arturo Barrios, who recently became a naturalized U.S. citizen. </P>
<P> Rousseau has won twice already this year, clocking 2 hours seven minutes and 51 seconds to win in Rotterdam followed by an easy victory in Brussels two months ago. </P>
<P> Barrios, a former 10,000 metre world record holder, finished fifth in Boston this year in 2:08:28 and was third last year in New York. </P>
<P> ``They are the speed guys at the moment,'' said Jones. ``The rest of us are 2:12 plodders.'' </P>
<P> Neither defending champion, Andres Espinosa of Mexico and Uta Pippig of Germany, is back. </P>
<P> Two women's champions are in the field -- 1990 winner Wanda Panfil of Poland and 1987 champion Priscilla Welch of Britain -- though neither is expected to contend. </P>
<P> Panfil is recovering from an leg injury and plans on going only halfway while the 49-year-old Welch is running for the first time since 1992 surgery for breast cancer. </P>
<P> Twice New York City Marathon bridesmaid Kim Jones of the United States, the 1993 runner-up Olga Appell, a Mexican born naturalised American, and Anne Marie Letko, who has been nearly unstoppable on the roads this year, are the leading contenders. </P>
<P> In second place through 23 miles in last year's race, Letko dropped out in her first marathon, dehydrated and suffering from hyperthermia. </P>
<P> ``I'm not one to run away from problems,'' Letko said of returning to New York. ``I want to confront this again and have a happier ending.'' </P>
<P> Though the New York City Marathon will never be the same without Lebow, it will always reflect his influence. </P>
<P> ``We are celebrating Fred's legacy,'' Steinfeld said. ''Everything he left behind made this a great event.'' </P>
