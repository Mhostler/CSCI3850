<P>  Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic was quoted Sunday as saying his forces would unite with fellow Serbs in the breakaway Krajina region of Croatia if they were attacked after U.N. trooops left. </P>
<P> Karadzic, in excerpts of an interview with Britain's Sky television issued by the Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA, said Croatian President Franjo Tudjman would face a united front. </P>
<P> ``If Tudjman really decides to attack, he will have to fight against a united Bosnian Serb and Krajina Serb army and this would be the first practical step toward the unification of the two Serb states,'' he said, according to SRNA. </P>
<P> Tudjman has insisted that U.N. peacekeeping troops policing a cease-fire after his republic's 1991 war of independence from Yugoslavia must leave when their mandate expires at the end of March. </P>
<P> He argues that their presence has only allowed the Krajina Serbs to consolidate their control over the territory, amounting to one-third of Croatia, which they occupied during the war. </P>
<P> U.N. officers fear a U.N. withdrawal could ignite renewed battles in Croatia. They also noted that Krajina Serb forces were already closely cooperating with the Bosnian Serbs in fighting around the northwest Bosnian enclave of Bihac. </P>
<P> Muslim-led Bosnian government troops are defending Bihac against the Bosnian Serbs, Serb-backed Muslim rebels and forces of the self-styled Republic of Serb Krajina. </P>
