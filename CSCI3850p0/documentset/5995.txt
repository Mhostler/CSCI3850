<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Iraq's parliament ended a debate on a new U.N. resolution on partial oil exports Monday giving no explicit word on whether it would endorse or reject the offer. </P>
<P> Parliamentary speaker Saadi Mehdi Saleh said at a three-hour session attended by reporters that the deputies would meet Tuesday morning to continue their discussion of the plan. </P>
<P> It is unlikely parliament will accept the offer but the fact that discussion was extended until Tuesday was unexpected. </P>
<P> Some deputies said, despite their uncompromising attitude, they needed time to think before making up their mind. </P>
<P> Many speakers, including Foreign Minister Mohammad Saeed al-Sahaf, urged the parliament to reject the U.N. resolution, which would allow Iraq to sell $2 billion worth of oil over six months to buy humanitarian supplies. </P>
<P> Iraq's oil exports are banned under U.N. sanctions imposed for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. </P>
<P> Sahaf, in a two-hour speech, said the decision had political connotations and had ``nothing to do with humanitarian supplies for the Iraqi people.'' </P>
<P> ``If your parliament decides to reject the resolution as the executive authority did, it will be a factor bringing closer the implementation of paragraph 22,'' he said, referring to a U.N. resolution that links lifting sanctions with Iraqi disarmament. </P>
<P> Raja al-Shawi, a deputy, said she saw violation of Iraq's sovereignty ``in each word in the resolution's paragraphs.'' </P>
<P> ``It abolishes the entity of Iraq as a state,'' she said. </P>
<P> The new motion, promoted by the United States and Britain, replaced an earlier resolution which Iraq consistently rejected. </P>
<P> It allocates sums to go to northern Iraq, where Kurds have set up an autonomous administration protected by a Western no-fly zone, other sums to go to reparations for the Gulf War and specifies monitoring Iraqi distribution of supplies. </P>
<P> Iraqi politicians including Saleh have fiercely condemned it since it was adopted by the Security Council this month. </P>
<P> Some deputies, while criticizing the United States as the cause of the predicament, wondered what choices Iraq had if it did not accept the resolution. </P>
<P> ``We feel that the rejection of the resolution would be used as a pretext (by the U.S. and Britain),'' said Sheikh Mujbil Isa. ``In this case, the Iraqi people will be subject to more poverty and misery which may lead to foreign interference.'' </P>
