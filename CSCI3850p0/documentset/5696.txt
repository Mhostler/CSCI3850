<P>  A U.S. federal court Wednesday awarded a total of $47.5 million in damages to a U.S. nun and eight Guatemalan nationals in a judgement against former Guatemalan Defense Minister General Hector Gramajo for atrocities committed by the military under his command. </P>
<P> The lawsuits charged Gramajo, currently a candidate for the presidency in Guatemala, with responsibility for the brutal murder, torture and disappearance of thousands of Guatemalans and for the 1989 rape and torture of U.S. nun, Sister Dianna Ortiz. </P>
<P> Judge Douglas Woodlock, said that the plaintiffs had demonstrated convincingly that ``Gramajo was aware of and supported widespread acts of brutality committed by personel under his direct command, resulting in thousands of civilian deaths.'' </P>
<P> Gramajo did not defend himself against the lawsuits and default judgements were handed down in both cases. </P>
<P> The cases were brought in U.S. District Court in Boston because Gramajo was studying at the time at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. </P>
