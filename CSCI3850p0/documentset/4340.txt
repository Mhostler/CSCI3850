<P>  Colombian police said Tuesday they had seized a Boeing 727 jet used by drug traffickers to smuggle up to 12 tons of cocaine out of the country on a single flight, a sign of the increasing sophistication of the nation's cocaine cartels. </P>
<P> General Luis Enrique Montenegro, deputy chief of National Police, said officers seized the aircraft at the international airport in the city of Cali, 180 miles southwest of Bogota and home to the country's top cocaine cartel. </P>
<P> A police spokesman said Tuesday that the plane, owned by the obscure airline Aerolineas Americanas Limitada, had been detected by radar last Nov. 22 when it smuggled 5.4 tons of highly pure cocaine to a remote Mexican airstrip. </P>
<P> ``Since then we have been searching for the aircraft, using information from the Mexican police, and we discovered it yesterday in Cali,'' he said. </P>
<P> The find appeared to confirm recent U.S. newspaper reports that Colombian traffickers have built up a fleet of more than a dozen jet aircraft allowing them to ship tons of drugs quickly in a single flight to Mexico and other destinations for smuggling into the United States. </P>
<P> Police said the Boeing 727 seized Monday could carry up to 12 tons of drugs, far more than the light aircraft previously used by traffickers, and could fly faster than the small planes used by most national anti-drug agents. </P>
<P> The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration says that Colombia's Cali cartel controls more than 70 percent of the world's cocaine trade and a growing portion of heroin trafficking. </P>
<P> The cartel has become increasingly sophisticated in its attempts to smuggle drugs into the United States or other countries. Last year Colombian police confiscated two submarines used to smuggle cocaine underwater across the Caribbean to Puerto Rico. </P>
