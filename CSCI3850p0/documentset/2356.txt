<P>  A 12-year-old Jordanian girl in need of a bone marrow transplant turned Wednesday to Israel, now at peace with her country, for help in finding a donor. </P>
<P> A pale-looking Hibah Shahban and her father carried blood samples across the Allenby Bridge linking Jordan and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. </P>
<P> They handed the samples, taken from relatives, to an Israeli army officer mid-way across the Jordan River. </P>
<P> Israeli doctors hope to identify from the blood a suitable donor for a bone marrow transplant which they said would give the girl, who suffers from congenital anemia, her greatest chance of survival. </P>
<P> After the signing of the Israel-Jordan peace treaty last week, the youngster's father appealed to Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's office for help in treating her. </P>
<P> Rabin ordered about $7,000 in government funds to be put toward conducting tests at Jerusalem's Hadassah hospital. His media adviser, Benny Cohen, took the blood samples from the bridge to the hospital. </P>
