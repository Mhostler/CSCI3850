<P>  The Security Council said Friday it would not tolerate further delay in peace talks between the Angolan government and former UNITA rebels and added it was prepared to impose additional sanctions on UNITA if it failed to accept mediation proposals this month. </P>
<P> A statement read at a brief public meeting said the council ``expresses its impatience over the protracted nature of the negotiations, and warns that the peace process cannot be delayed indefinitely.'' </P>
<P> The talks, taking place in Lusaka, Zambia, have been held up mainly by failure to reach agreement on power-sharing proposals already accepted by the government. UNITA (the Union for the Total Independence of Angola) has been insisting on the governorship of the province of Huambo, its stronghold. </P>
<P> The Security Council said it believed a just and comprehensive agreement was within reach and strongly urged UNITA to ``demonstrate its commitment to peace and accept the complete set of proposals put forward by the secretary-general's special representative (Alioune Blondin Beye of Mali) and the three observer states'' (Portugal, Russia and the United States). </P>
<P> The council expressed gratitude to South African President Nelson Mandela offering to assist the peace process and said ``these helpful efforts deserve time to come to fruition.'' </P>
<P> As a result, the council had decided to defer temporarily additional sanctions previously threatened against UNITA. But it ``confirms its readiness to impose further measures'' if UNITA ``does not accept the mediation proposals on national reconciliation during the course of the month of August. </P>
<P> The council would ``start to compile a list of such possible measures and will not tolerate further procrastination in the peace process.'' </P>
<P> An oil and arms embargo was imposed on UNITA last September to force it to the negotiating table and the council has several times threatened to add a trade ban and place travel restrictions on key UNITA members. </P>
<P> The council reminded both sides that offensive military actions threatened all the progress made so far in Lusaka and expressed ``dismay at the actions of both parties, particularly of UNITA, which have led to deterioration of the humanitarian situation'' in Angola. </P>
