<DATELINE>AMMAN, April 4 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Jordan and Israel on Tuesday signed an agreement on tourism, the first accord to regulate bilateral ties under their October 26 peace treaty. </P>
<P> Jordan's Tourism Minister Abdulellah al-Khatib and his Israeli counterpart Uzi Baram signed the accord at a ceremony in a state guest-house in the Jordan Valley. </P>
<P> Their undersecretaries initialled the pact on February 9 as Israel completed the return of occupied Jordanian land under the treaty that ended a 46-year state of war and set out steps to full normalisation. </P>
<P> The accord calls for broad coordination, including marketing joint tour packages abroad, exchanging information and cooperation between the two national airlines, officials said. </P>
<P> It also calls for setting up a joint tourism committee of the private and public sectors to meet once a year. </P>
<P> The agreement is the first in a series of accords covering everything from trade to security and energy that are to be signed by August. </P>
<P> More than 20,000 Israelis have visited Jordan since the border was opened in November, touring the ancient Nabatean city of Petra and Mount Nebo, traditional burial site of Moses. </P>
<P> But only several hundred Jordanians have visited Israel, mainly because of lingering animosity against the Jewish state and Israeli security precautions before issuing visas. </P>
<P> Many Jordanians are of Palestinian origin and have relatives living in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza Strip. </P>
<P> The two countries are expected to revise an interim agreement on border crossings on May 1. </P>
<P> Under temporary arrangements, Amman agreed to daily entry limits of 600 Israelis at the northern Sheikh Hussein bridge and 300 at the southern Wadi Araba crossing. Israeli tour operators threatened to boycott Jordan if it did not allow in more. </P>
