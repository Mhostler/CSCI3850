<P> Dhanapala is president of the month-long conference which has been discussing an extension of the landmark nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the cornerstone of arms control for the last 25 years. </P>
<P> The 178 states which have signed the agreement are expected to make it permanent by extending it indefinitely. The pact must be renewed before the meeting ends on Friday. </P>
<P> Dhanapala said he assumed a brief conference meeting at 1500 EDT would ``have consensus on the slight postponement for tomorrow morning''. </P>
<P> ``It would be useful for all delegations to have sufficient time and to feel comfortable that they have their governments' instructions,'' he said in a telephone interview. </P>
