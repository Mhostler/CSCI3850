<P>  Health officials in Wales have called for a probe into how a dead baby was sent from one hospital to another in a cardboard box. </P>
<P> A hospital worker discovered the body when the box, delivered by a courier firm, broke open. </P>
<P> John Roberts, secretary of the health authority in Clwyd, Wales, said Friday night the hospital in Wrexham, which sent the stillborn baby's body for tests to another Welsh hospital, was investigating what happened. </P>
<P> Ambulances or funeral companies are normally hired in such cases to transport the body, at a cost of several hundred dollars. But the body was sent instead by a private courier firm for just $78.43. </P>
<P> Health officials have apologized to the parents. </P>
