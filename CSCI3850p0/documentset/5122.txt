<P>  A Croatian patrol boat fired on an Italian vessel fishing illegally in the Adriatic Thursday, seriously wounding the captain, Croatian maritime police officials said. </P>
<P> The vessel was intercepted early Thursday while trawling some 3.5 miles inside Croatian territorial waters off the port of Sibenik, said Goran Kljajic, commander of Sibenik maritime police. </P>
<P> He said the patrol boat fired several warning shots and a flare, but the Italian vessel Marisella Primo refused to stop. Police fired on the boat with an automatic rifle, wounding the captain in his right shoulder and the jaw. </P>
<P> ``The captain is now in Sibenik hospital and his condition is stable,'' Kljajic told Reuters by telephone. A spokesman at coast guard headquarters in Rome said the captain, named Ezio Bastianelli, had been hit in the shoulder and neck. </P>
<P> Kljajic said the Italian boat had been taken to Sibenik and impounded. </P>
<P> The Italian coast guard spokesman earlier told Reuters: ``The ship was between 20 and 25 miles from the Croatian coastline and it is unclear whether it was in international waters. </P>
<P> ``The weather was bad early this morning so the boat could have easily strayed into Croatian waters,'' he added. </P>
