<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Peruvian government said Monday night it had declared a unilateral cease-fire as of midnight in a 19-day-old war with Ecuador in a disputed border zone in the Amazon jungle. </P>
<P> ``Peru unilaterally declares a cease-fire in the zone of conflict with Ecuador from 1200 midnight local time Lima and Quito on Tuesday February 14, 1995,'' a Foreign Ministry statement said. </P>
<P> It said the Peruvian government ``called on Ecuador to cooperate (with the cease-fire) to avoid further bloodshed among brother nations.'' </P>
<P> The government invited a mission of observers from four guarantor countries of a 1942 treaty to verify the cease-fire, the statement added. </P>
<P> It said it had made the decision to declare a cease-fire in light of its intention ``to limit the military actions (at the border zone) to the dislodging of foreign forces that had entered Peruvian territory.'' </P>
<P> A few minutes earlier, America Television reported that the base of Tiwinza, said by the Peruvian officials to be the last post in Ecuadoran control, had fallen a ``few hours earlier.'' </P>
<P> President Alberto Fujimori was scheduled to address the nation at midnight local time Earlier, Ecuador's President Sixto Duran Ballen said in Quito that a proposal made by mediating nations to end the armed border conflict was acceptable and that both nations could have peace if Peru agreed to it. </P>
<P> ``The mediating nations have finally come to realize what their responsibility is and have presented a new proposal that very well could lead to a cease-fire, without Ecuador having to back down a single step'', Duran Ballen told reporters. </P>
<P> ``It now depends on the other side,'' he added. </P>
