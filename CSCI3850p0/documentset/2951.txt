<DATELINE>KOUROU, French Guiana (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A Western European Ariane rocket carrying an American communications satellite failed after liftoff Thursday, sending the $150 million satellite plunging into the Atlantic Ocean, space officials said. </P>
<P> The Ariane 42P rocket lifted-off at 6:57 p.m. from the European Space Agency (ESA) launch center in Kourou, French Guiana, on the northeast coast of South America. </P>
<P> ``The third-stage of Flight 70 did not function correctly, the motor ignited but after ignition the motor only partially functioned ... about at half power,'' Arianespace president Charles Bigot told reporters. </P>
<P> Thursday's failure was the second Ariane failure this year and the seventh since Western Europe began launching the Ariane series in 1979. </P>
<P> The satellite, PanAmsat-3 (PAS-3), was the third in a series of satellites for Greenwich, Connecticut-based satellite operator PanAmsat. </P>
<P> Reverge Anselmo, a PanAmsat vice president, told a pre-launch news conference that the satellite was covered by insurance. </P>
<P> The failure was similar to an Ariane malfunction last January, when a third-stage problem sent the rocket crashing and two satellites worth $300 million into the ocean. </P>
<P> Ariane's third-stage uses a mixture of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. </P>
<P> Third stage malfunctions have been responsible for five of the seven Ariane failures since Western Europe started launching the Ariane series in 1979. </P>
<P> Arianespace, the Paris-based company that makes and markets Ariane rockets, has captured over 60 percent of the world's satellite launch market since the U.S. space shuttle Challenger exploded in 1986, ending the shuttle's role in launching commercial satellites. </P>
<P> Bigot said the company was planning 13 more launches before the end of 1995, but industry analysts said that this was now impossible because of Thursday's failure. </P>
<P> Bigot said investigators would seek to determine the cause of the failure. A news conference is scheduled for 9 a.m EST Friday in Kourou. </P>
