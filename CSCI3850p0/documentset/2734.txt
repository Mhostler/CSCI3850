<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A devout but pragmatic Catholic and a young but experienced politician, Fianna Fail's new chief, Bertie Ahern, has something for everyone in a modern Ireland, which can only help his chances of becoming its next premier. </P>
<P> Ireland's biggest party chose the 43-year-old finance minister as its youngest ever leader Saturday after Prime Minister Albert Reynolds resigned. </P>
<P> Ahern immediately swore allegiance to the Northern Ireland peace process, for which Reynolds has been heaped with praise, and promised to keep it moving forward briskly. </P>
<P> His reputation as a consummate consensus politician and a man with few enemies might help him forge a relationship with ``Unionists'' -- the British province's biggest political force of Protestants, skeptical and fearful of a united Ireland. </P>
<P> But critics say he lacks Reynolds' personal vision and risk-taking, which were crucial in persuading pro-Irish and pro-British paramilitaries to declare historic cease-fires. </P>
<P> ``Ahern may not display the same relentless commitment as his predecessor to the Northern peace process,'' the Irish Times said. </P>
<P> If he becomes premier after haggling between main political parties, he may surprise critics on Northern Ireland in the same way as he won over business leaders who were suspicious of him when Premier Charles Haughey made him finance minister in 1991. </P>
<P> Economic analysts have commended his handling of Ireland's devaluation crisis in January 1993, since when the economy, partly due to outside factors, has fared well. </P>
<P> But they are less happy with his control of day-to-day spending, particularly a much-criticized residential property tax he introduced. </P>
<P> Ahern pledged Saturday to heal a rift in Fianna Fail between members loyal to Haughey and those who backed Reynolds, who took over two years ago in an internal party coup. </P>
<P> ``He shares with his political mentor Charles Haughey a certain elusive charm and is comfortable with his man-of-the-people image,'' one profiler said of the avid sports fan. </P>
<P> Ahern's avowed social conscience also puts him close on many issues to Labor, the party he must woo if he wants to form a new government. </P>
<P> Labor leader Dick Spring was widely believed to favor Ahern over his rival, Justice Minister Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, who stepped aside when it was clear she could not win the fight. </P>
<P> Described as lively and with an easy, infectious manner, some commentators consider him a lightweight who will do what his party tells him but show little decisiveness. </P>
<P> Ahern, an accountant first elected to parliament in 1977, had a rapid rise under Haughey in the legislature and then into government as minister of Labor in 1987, when he gave up his other job as Lord Mayor of Dublin. </P>
<P> Born in 1951 in the city's Northside suburb of Drumcondra, he still lives there and has a powerful grass-roots party following and fund-raising machine in the city. He studied at Dublin's University College and the London School of Economics. </P>
<P> A Catholic who is conservative on social issues such as abortion, contraception and divorce, he nevertheless separated from his wife of 19 years, Miriam Kelly, blaming the stress of his job. But he still sees a lot of his two teen-age daughters. </P>
<P> His public discussion of his marriage and his admission that he has a girlfriend is unusual for Irish politicians and a separated prime minister would be unprecedented. </P>
<P> ``He is every great Irish mother's son,'' the Irish Times said. ``He may not wear odd socks, but his oversized suits, slight stutter and constant gulping have endeared him to the public.'' </P>
<P> In another profile he was called ``an overweight and slightly unkempt figure who is a sex symbol to many women ... an obsessive politician who eschews all political ideologies.'' </P>
