<P>  Russian demands for a free hand in peacekeeping in Nagorno-Karabakh blocked agreement Sunday to send a ground-breaking multinational peacekeeping force to the troubled enclave, diplomats said. </P>
<P> They said plans for a 3,000-member force under the auspices of the 53-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe had stalled on Moscow's argument for a special role in its own backyard. </P>
<P> Thousands have died in Nagorno-Karabakh, largely populated by Armenians although it is in Azerbaijan, since the conflict broke out in 1988, although there has been an uneasy cease-fire in place since May. Karabakh Armenian forces have occupied large areas of Azerbaijani territory. </P>
<P> A senior U.S. official said the Russians were arguing Nagorno-Karabakh was parallel to Haiti, where the United States invaded and then handed over to a United Nations peacekeeping force. </P>
<P> But this approach is strongly resisted by the United States, fearful a Russian ``zone of influence'' in the former Soviet Union would undermine independence for the region. </P>
<P> ``Nagorno-Karabakh is not the same thing, nobody wants the Russians to be free players ... There is a consensus that the outside world has to get a handle on this,'' he said. </P>
<P> Diplomats said they were hopeful the problem could be resolved by heads of state at a Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe summit starting Monday in the Hungarian capital. </P>
