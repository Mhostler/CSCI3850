<DATELINE>TUNIS, Tunisia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Tunisia, the PLO's home in exile before Israel granted Palestinians self-rule in May, hopes the normalization of ties with Israel will yield economic dividends and open up the new Palestinian market for its businesses. </P>
<P> The Israeli and Tunisian foreign ministers said in New York on Saturday that their countries had agreed to start normalising relations. </P>
<P> Tunisian businessmen keen to cash in on the political development note that at least $2.5 billion in international aid is to be invested in the Palestinian self-rule areas over the next three years. </P>
<P> Under the deal announced by Tunisian Foreign Minister Habib Ben Yahia and Israel's Shimon Peres, representatives will be sent to the Belgian embassies in Tunis and Tel Aviv. A Tunisian economic liaison office will be set up in the self-rule areas of Gaza and Jericho. </P>
<P> Business sources in Tunisia said a delegation of Israeli businessmen visited Tunisia last week and met influential Tunisian leaders. </P>
<P> A Tunisian delegation had been due to leave on its first visit to Gaza this weekend, but the trip was delayed until next week to give a chance for the official announcement to be made in New York. </P>
<P> Tunisia will become the third Arab country after Egypt and Morocco to enjoy direct ties with Israel. </P>
<P> It has long played a behind-the-scenes role toward a peaceful settlement in the Middle East. </P>
<P> Former President Habib Bourguiba angered Tunisians and other Arab governments in 1965 when he proposed a solution based on recognition of the Israeli state and a Palestinian state within the boundaries of the West Bank and Gaza. </P>
<P> Tunisia, which served as the Palestine Liberation Organization's headquarters from 1982 to 1994, is believed to have quietly influenced PLO leader Yasser Arafat and other Palestinian leaders on the need for moderation and dialogue with Israel. </P>
<P> Tunisia continued to facilitate and host secret talks between the PLO and Israeli leaders even after an Israeli air raid on PLO headquarters in Tunis in 1985 in which 72 people, including 12 Tunisians, were killed. </P>
<P> Israeli government officials visited Tunisia openly after the PLO and Israel signed the broad outlines of their peace agreement in Washington in September. </P>
<P> Israeli deputy foreign affairs minister Yossi Beilin visited Tunisia twice to take part in international conferences, and Environment Minister Yossi Sarid is expected in Tunis November 1 for a Mediterranean conference. </P>
