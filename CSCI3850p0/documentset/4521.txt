<P>  British actor Stephen Fry, who mysteriously pulled out of a West End play and disappeared last week, is alive and well, his agent said Friday. </P>
<P> Fry, 37, best known for his portrayal as the butler in the television series ``Jeeves and Wooster'' based on the PG Wodehouse novels, had been starring in Simon Gray's play ``Cell Mates'' when he left three days after the opening performance. </P>
<P> He wrote to colleagues before his disappearance Saturday, bemoaning his ``failure'' as an actor. Reviews of the play had criticized Fry's performance. </P>
<P> Concern for his safety grew as days passed with no word from the comedian. But a spokeswoman for his agent, Lorraine Hamilton, said he had telephoned to say he was all right. </P>
<P> ``He has gone away for a while to be by himself,'' she said, adding that he would not say where he was. </P>
<P> Fry's portrayals of well-mannered, eccentric English gentlemen have made him popular with Britons and he appears in a number of television commercials. He also starred in the film ``Peter's Friends'' with Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson. </P>
