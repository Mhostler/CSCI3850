<DATELINE>SANUR, Indonesia, April 14 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Finance ministers from the fledgling APEC forum trickled into Bali's island resort on Friday for meetings set to be dominated by efforts to dampen a soaring Japanese yen. </P>
<P> While the Sunday gathering of Asia-Pacific officials is set to discuss the longer term problems of foreign exchange, movement of capital and infrastructure financing, delegates said it would also provide an opportunity to look at the ongoing dollar-yen crisis. </P>
<P> ``I think all three topics will be well covered and perhaps some coordination mechanism (on foreign exchange rates) might be established but it's very much too early to tell,'' said Thai finance minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda. </P>
<P> Ministers from the 18 members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation grouping -- stretching from heavyweights like the United States and Japan to the dynamic young economies of South East Asia -- are due to hold general talks on Sunday. </P>
<P> But officials made clear that in bilateral talks at least, efforts to combat the rise of the Japanese yen -- hovering around 83.70 against the dollar on late Friday -- would top the agenda. </P>
<P> Japan's cut in the key discount rate to a record one percent apparently failed to cheer the local stock market, although the move, which followed an earlier tranche of measures, was generally welcomed by delegates as a step in the right direction. </P>
<P> Officials from Taiwan, Singapore and Thailand said they all welcomed the cut. </P>
<P> ``It is very encouraging,'' Singapore's finance minister Richard Hu Tsu Tau told Reuters Television. </P>
<P> Japan's Masayoshi Takemura, due to arrive here on Saturday ahead of the opening ceremony, said earlier he wanted a ``serious debate on currency problems with finance ministers of other nations, including the United States, at the APEC meeting.'' </P>
<P> The United States, with its currency facing a serious credibility problem, is also keen to talk to Japan and to emerging Asia-Pacific economies caught in the middle of the dollar-yen shakeout. </P>
<P> U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin arrives early on Saturday. </P>
<P> ``The foreign exchange crisis is certainly going to be a subject of discussion at the meeting,'' Pao-sun Lu, head of Taiwan's Economic and Trade Office in Jakarta, told Reuters. </P>
<P> ``Hopefully we can find a solution because the gathering of so many ministers provides a good opportunity to discuss the subject.'' </P>
<P> APEC, formed in 1989, groups economies on both sides of the Pacific basin who have agreed in principle to ease trade and investment barriers by the year 2020. </P>
<P> It includes Australia, Brunei, Canada, China, Chile, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States. </P>
