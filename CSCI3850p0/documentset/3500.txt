<P>  California Gov. Pete Wilson declared a state of emergency Friday in a county which suffered more than $2 million of damage in an earthquake this week. </P>
<P> An earthquake measuring 5.3 on the Richter scale struck Monday off the northern California coast, damaging buildings in the coastal city of Eureka, 250 miles north of San Francisco, and some other parts of surrounding Humboldt County. </P>
<P> Wilson said Friday he was declaring a state of emergency in Humboldt County in response to a request from local officials. The proclamation makes Humboldt County eligible for state assistance. </P>
<P> ``I am committed to providing all the necessary resources available to assist local communities to repair damages sustained during Monday's temblor,'' Wilson said in a statement. </P>
<P> The earthquake damaged 75 houses and 27 businesses in Eureka and another 40 buildings outside the city, causing more than $2.1 million in damage, Wilson's office said. </P>
<P> Two people were injured by broken glass in the quake, officials said. </P>
<P> Part of the county courthouse in Eureka has been closed until damage to support columns can be repaired. </P>
<P> California's Office of Emergency Services reported Thursday that 1994 was the costliest year for natural disaster losses in California's history, largely because of last January's devastating Los Angeles earthquake, which killed 57 people and caused $20 billion in damage. </P>
<P> The Humboldt County state of emergency was the sixth proclaimed by Wilson in California this year. </P>
<P> In addition to the Los Angeles earthquake, other emergencies were prompted by infestations of the crop-destroying Mediterranean fruit fly in two counties, by a huge wildfire and by a shortage of salmon which forced tight restrictions on commercial fishing off northern California. </P>
