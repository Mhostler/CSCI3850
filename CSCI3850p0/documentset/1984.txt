<P>  Resigned Haitian military ruler Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras was due to leave Haiti aboard a chartered passenger jet early Thursday, a military source familiar with the operations at Port-au-Prince International Airport said. </P>
<P> Two chartered passenger jets were waiting on the tarmac at the airport to take Cedras, his family, and senior military officers into exile. The jets were protected by U.S. soldiers and military vehicles, and crews had boarded. </P>
<P> ``Both planes are leaving tonight,'' the source said in the early hours of Thursday. ``But we don't know where (they are going) and we don't know when.'' </P>
<P> U.S. soldiers lined the road leading from Cedras's home above the capital at around 1:00 a.m. EDT , although he had not appeared to have left his home. </P>
<P> Cedras's former Army Chief of Staff, Maj. Gen. Phillipe Biamby and his entourage arrived at the airport at about 1:25 a.m.in a convoy accompanied by U.S. Amabassador William Swing, and walked into the the airport's VIP lounge. </P>
