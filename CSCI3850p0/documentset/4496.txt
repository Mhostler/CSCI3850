<P>  European Commission President Jacques Santer has reassured Europe's filmmakers that limits on Hollywood and other foreign films shown on European Union screens will not be scrapped. </P>
<P> His spokesman said he made the promise at a meeting Wednesday at which a delegation of filmmakers and actors pleaded for EU help to try to stop their industry ``bleeding to death'' from Hollywood domination. </P>
<P> Referring to current limits on films, Santer's spokesman said in reply to a question, ``He is not trying to put what exists already into question.'' </P>
<P> The European Commission, the EU executive, has to take a tough decision by mid-March on how to adapt its rules on foreign content in television broadcasts to take account of emerging media services such as teleshopping. </P>
<P> The EU currently limits the amount of foreign programs allowed on its television channels but Santer said the Commission was looking at other ways of promoting the EU industry, for example through allowing state aid. </P>
<P> At a European Parliament hearing on the film industry on Wednesday directors like Bernardo Bertolucci, famous for ``Last Tango in Paris,'' and Jean-Jacques Beineix, director of Diva and Betty Blue, urged the Union to step in to help their industry survive and prosper. </P>
<P> ``We are on the ropes and the European film industry is in its death throes,'' Bertolucci told the hearing. </P>
<P> Beineix -- saying that Hollywood domination posed a similar threat to Europe as the U.S. ``Star Wars'' plan had to the former Soviet Union -- told the hearing it was not protectionist to limit the number of foreign films shown in Europe. </P>
<P> ``When North American industry creates 80 per cent of films that take up our space -- is that protectionism?'' he said. </P>
<P> France found itself isolated last week at a meeting of EU culture ministers in Bordeaux when it tried to get tighter restrictions on the number of foreign films which can be broadcast on EU screens. </P>
<P> The failure to agree on tougher quotas raised fears that even existing limits would be scrapped. </P>
<P> The current ``television without frontiers directive'' says EU television channels must, ``where practicable,'' dedicate at least half their screentime to European-made programs. </P>
<P> Santer faced strong criticism in France ahead of the meeting after saying in a newspaper interview he was not in favor of quotas. </P>
<P> Peter Fleischmann, who made ``Hard to be a God,'' criticized at Wednesday's hearings those countries -- notably Britain and Germany -- which oppose tougher regulation of the film industry. </P>
<P> ``We are ready to regulate coal and steel, carrots and potatoes -- perhaps films are less important to them than carrots and potatoes,'' he said. </P>
<P> Gabriel Axel, who made ``Babette's Feast,'' said EU films would only prosper if filmmakers received help to distribute quality films in the United States as well as Europe. </P>
<P> Greek actress Irene Pappas said Hollywood domination was responsible for low moral values depicted on the EU's screens -- including violence and ill-treatment of women. </P>
