<DATELINE>CHISINAU, Moldova (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Moldova accused the Russian parliament Monday of interference by deciding to hold a debate on an already-agreed deal to withdraw Kremlin troops from the former Soviet republic. </P>
<P> Russia's State Duma, dominated by conservative and nationalist deputies, opposes last October's deal between Moscow and Chisinau to withdraw the 14th army within three years. </P>
<P> Moldova officially says it cannot be considered a truly independent state until the army has left. </P>
<P> A Foreign Ministry statement said Moldova regretted the decision to debate the withdrawal this week. </P>
<P> The 14th Army is based in Moldova's breakaway eastern Russian-speaking Dnestr region, which views the force as the only safeguard against a repeat of 1992 bloodshed. </P>
<P> Moldova is also unhappy State Duma deputies attended a non-binding referendum last month in the Dnestr region, where the majority of those polled said they wanted the army to stay. </P>
<P> ``Such steps can only be qualified as interference in the internal affairs of the independent and sovereign state of Moldova and a violation of all norms and principles of international law,'' said the ministry statement. </P>
<P> ``Using the idea of defending the interests of Russia and Russian-speakers as a cover...the Duma deputies are in fact trying to support separatism -- in particular, by preserving the presence of Russia's 14th army.'' </P>
<P> Hundreds of people died in 1992 in bloody fighting between Moldovan and Dnestr forces and Chisinau fears worse clashes if the combatants start using the 14th army's giant arsenals. </P>
