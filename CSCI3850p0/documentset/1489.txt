<P>  Iran is about eight years away from having a nuclear bomb but faces intensive efforts by Israel and other countries to foil its plans, Israeli army intelligence chief Uri Saguy said on Monday. </P>
<P> ``It is possible to assume that if, on the one hand, the process will not be accelerated or, on the other hand, foiled, Iran ... in a period of some eight years will be in a situation in which it has a military nuclear capability,'' he said. </P>
<P> Iran has denied Western charges it is developing nuclear weapons, saying its program is only for peaceful purposes. </P>
<P> Saguy, a major-general, told Army Radio that ``painstaking, behind-the-scenes intelligence work'' was underpinning ``very comprehensive diplomatic efforts'' against any Iranian nuclear arsenal. </P>
<P> ``All these elements come together as a mutual interest of Israel and, I am happy to say, other nations, to try to foil or delay as much as possible Iran becoming a nuclear nation,'' he said, without naming the countries. </P>
<P> Saguy said Iran was still striving for the destruction of the Jewish state. </P>
<P> Last week, Iran's official radio said the first phase of a new Iranian atomic energy research centre would open in northwestern Iran next year and would be used for agricultural purposes. </P>
