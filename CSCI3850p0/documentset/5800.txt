<P>  Twelve cities have lined up to hold presidential preference balloting this November to get a jump on the publicity-attracting Iowa and New Hampshire votes next year, organizers announced Monday. </P>
<P> They said the cities will participate in ``CityVote'' -- non-binding presidential preference voting for Republican and Democratic candidates -- on Nov. 7 in connection with regular city elections. The person behind the move to draw attention to urban problems in the 1996 presidential campaign is Larry Agran, former mayor of Irvine, Calif. and an unsuccessful Democratic presidential aspirant in 1992. </P>
<P> One of the organizers said CityVote will garner publicity for cities and test the strength of presidential candidates, particularly Republicans, in a wide variety of cities around the country. Democratic President Clinton is expected to get his party's nomination easily, although former Pennsylvania governor Robert Casey is considering a challenge. </P>
<P> CityVote, also known as the National Urban Presidential Primary, grew out of a U.S. Conference of Mayors study. Backers said the 12 cities signed up so far represent more than 2.5 million people, far more than the combined populations of Iowa and New Hampshire that get all the media attention. </P>
<P> Cities planning to hold non-binding preference voting are Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minn.; Boston; Baltimore; Tucson, Ariz.; Pasadena, Calif.; Moscow, Idaho; Fayette, Mo.; and Spokane, Olympia, Tumwater and Lacey, Wash. </P>
<P> Others including San Diego, San Francisco, Houston, Akron, Ohio, Moorhead, Minn., East St. Louis, Ill., and Burlington, Vt., have also expressed interest in participating, the organizers say. </P>
<P> The Iowa caucuses, which are the first tests of presidential strength, will be next Feb. 12, followed by the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 20. </P>
