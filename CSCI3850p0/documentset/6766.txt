<P>  President Clinton will veto legislation that transfers federal responsibility for welfare programs to the states and does not provide a safety net for children, a White House spokeswoman said Monday. </P>
<P> Spokeswoman Ginny Terzano said White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta had delivered this message to several lawmakers, including Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-NY, in recent days. ''Mr. Panetta has said if a welfare bill went to a block grant assistance program and did not provide a safety net for children, then the president would veto the bill,'' she said. </P>
