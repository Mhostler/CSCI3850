<P>  The Clinton administration has backed down on its plan to require a standardized government code to secure computer communications against eavesdroppers, government and industry officials said Thursday. </P>
<P> Vice President Al Gore, leading government efforts to develop a way to ensure secrecy in computer-to-computer communications, disclosed in a letter that the administration will now work with industry software and computer hardware designers to devise a new plan. </P>
<P> The letter was sent to Congresswoman Maria Cantwell, a Washington state Democrat who has led the opposition to the administration's original plan that would have made the government the sole keeper of the code. </P>
<P> The letter, made public by Gore's office, shows a departure from the government's insistence on a new standard for encryption, or keeping electronic signals secret, known as the ''Clipper Chip.'' It set an approved federal standard for telephone communications, computer and video networks. </P>
<P> Washington-state-based software giant Microsoft Corp and other major computer firms opposed the Clipper Chip technology partly because it put the government in charge of the secret codes and users would never be sure if a federal agency was eavesdropping on their communications. </P>
<P> The Business Software Alliance, a trade group, also feared that U.S. government involvement would scare off foreign buyers of U.S. products which dominate computer markets worldwide. </P>
<P> Alliance spokesman Robert Holleyman said that Gore's letter ``is a significant victory both for U.S. software companies and the future of the global information highway.'' </P>
<P> U.S. law enforcement agencies had supported the ``Clipper Chip,'' saying they would tap only the government-held codes when they had obtained a legal warrant to search the communications. </P>
<P> There are numerous privately-developed software security codes available on the market. </P>
