<P>  Strange violent storms struck a sacred mountain in North Korea last Friday at the hour that its long-time leader Kim Il-sung died, an official news agency reported. </P>
<P> The activity showed nature itself shared the nation's deep sorrow, according to a Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) dispatch, monitored in Tokyo Thursday. </P>
<P> KCNA said Mount Paekdu -- situated on the Chinese border and revered as the cradle of North Korean communism -- ``is now writhing in grief.'' </P>
<P> ``Early on the morning of July 8, when the great heart of the supreme brain of the Korean revolution stopped beating, Lake Chon that had been calm under a thick fog suddenly stirred up violent waves,'' KCNA said. </P>
<P> ``A whirlwind with a velocity of 50 meters (yards) per second rose and heavy rains fell. It rained uninterruptedly for three days... </P>
<P> ``Tens of thousands of big and small streams flowed into the lake like falls from the cliffs of the crater atop the mountain and sometimes they rose into the air in sprays. </P>
<P> ``The waves did not subside for days. Raging waves beat upon the shore and rose high in whirlwind.'' the report said. </P>
<P> ``These wonders of Mount Paekdu reflected the sorrow of the 70 million people of the nation at the loss of the respected leader President Kim Il-sung, who defeated the Japanese imperialist aggressors, crossing steep mountains for 20 years, and accomplished the historical cause of national liberation.'' </P>
<P> This is not the first time that the Stalinist state's official media have cited supposedly strange natural marvels to promote Kim's towering personality cult or that which has grown to surround his son and chosen successor, Kim Jong-il. </P>
<P> Just days before the death of the ``Great Leader,'' KCNA carried a report that ``mysterious rainbows and triple rainbows rare to be seen in the world appeared in the sky in mid-June'' near the sacred mountain. </P>
<P> The agency said that, coming as they did on the 30th anniversary of the younger Kim's debut as a communist party official, ``people are unanimous in viewing these phenomenal facts as a praise of his brilliant revolutionary feats by nature.'' </P>
