<DATELINE>TOKYO, April 15 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  North Korea held a rally in Pyongyang on Saturday to mark what would have been the 83rd birthday of the late President Kim Il-sung, who died last July. </P>
<P> The rally was attended by senior North Korean officials including Prime Minister Kang Song-san and Vice Presidents Ri Jong-ok and Pak Song-chol, said the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), monitored in Tokyo. </P>
<P> The participants paid a silent tribute to the memory of late president, KCNA said. </P>
<P> It did not say if Kim Jong-il, his designated successor, was among those at the rally. </P>
<P> ``The entire Korean people are now greeting the birthday of the Great Leader comrade Kim Il-sung, with bitter pains at his unexpected death though they grandiously celebrated it as a revolutionary holiday every year, together with him,'' Vice Premier Kim Yong-nam told the rally. </P>
<P> Kim Il-sung, North Korea's undisputed leader for 49 years, died of a heart attack on July 8, 1994. He was 82. </P>
<P> North Korea's Stalinist cadres and their obedient media have hailed Kim Jong-il as his father's successor. But more than nine months after the dealth of the ``Great Leader,'' the younger Kim has yet to be elevated to the key posts held by his father -- state president and general secretary of the all-powerful communist party. </P>
<P> ``The whole party, the entire people and the whole army have become a strong driving force to carry forward the revolutionary cause of juche (self-reliance) generation after generation, closely united in mind and morality around the Great Leader Comrade Kim Jong-il,'' Kim Yong-nam said. </P>
<P> ``This is the most precious, immortal exploits comrade Kim Il-sung had performed for our party, revolution and people, devoting all his energies,'' he added. </P>
<P> Tensions on the Korean peninsula eased with an historic accord reached in October between North Korea and the United States under which Pyongyang promised to freeze and eventually dismantle its nuclear programme, suspected to be capable of producing nuclear weapons. </P>
<P> In return, Washington pledged to arrange the supply of $4.5 billion in new nuclear technology and alternative energy sources. </P>
<P> However, North Korea has adamantly refused to accept a South Korean reactor model which Washington says was a condition of the deal because Seoul is funding the bulk of the project. </P>
