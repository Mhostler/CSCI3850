<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A Republican takeover of Congress struck President Clinton's White House like a lightning bolt early Wednesday as voters massacred his Democratic Party. </P>
<P> ``Clearly disappointed'' was how White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers described the president as he and his wife Hillary anxiously watched on television late Tuesday as Democratic giants fell one-by-one. </P>
<P> Clinton and his aides had insisted that while Democrats would lose seats they would not lose control of both houses of Congress. </P>
<P> Only at the end of the long night, when Republican seizure of the House was assured, were they admitting that a new Republican order was taking shape on Capitol Hill. </P>
<P> Myers said Republicans must now move from obstructing legislation to helping form it, saying, ``The burden of governing is now on them.'' </P>
<P> Clinton planned to comment on the elections at an Wednesday news conference. (EDS: 2:30 p.m. EST/1930GMT). </P>
<P> Myers said Clinton would probably get in touch with the future leaders of the Senate and the House, Bob Dole of Kansas and Newt Gingrich of Georgia, on Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``It's time to move beyond the bitterness,'' she said. </P>
<P> In the face of the staggering losses, White House officials refused to concede that the tally against the majority party reflected widespread dissatisfaction with the president himself, whose final eight-day campaign swing did little to stem the tide. </P>
<P> ``Right now it really doesn't appear that this was a vote against Clinton,'' said White House chief of staff Leon Panetta. ``It was really a vote against Washington, in terms of those who are in power.'' </P>
<P> He said Clinton would be reaching out to the Republicans for bipartisanship, but he made clear a major priority of the president in 1995 would be to resurrect political reform legislation that was blocked by Republicans this year. </P>
<P> ``We've got to really speed up the way we change business here in Washington,'' Panetta told Reuters and other wire services in an interview. ``There's a lot of pressure out there from the voters for members of Congress to really face up to that issue.'' </P>
<P> If the new members of Congress ``just settle in and vote the status quo,'' he said, ``they will pay one hell of a price in two years.'' </P>
<P> Panetta said an early test of how well the two parties can work together will be whether Congress can approve a world trade agreement this year with the current membership. </P>
<P> At month's end, Congress is slated to return for a special session to vote on a world trade pact struck last year at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. After plenty of hiccups along the way, passage is now considered likely. </P>
<P> Panetta said the president would press for reforms in the U.S. welfare system in 1995 ``as well as implementing what we can in health care reform as well.'' </P>
<P> But he said health care reform, killed by both parties this year, would probably move only in incremental steps particularly as a result of the conservative tilt in Congress. </P>
<P> He predicted pressure for tax cuts from Republicans and Democrats alike but added: ``The real question is how a tax cut is going to be paid for and nobody has answered that question yet.'' </P>
<P> Clinton watched the election returns on television after staging a reception for Democratic Party leaders who worked hard in the fall campaign. It amounted to the political equivalent of a wake. </P>
<P> Sen. John Breaux, D-La., emerged from the reception trying to accept the strange reality that Democrats would no longer be calling the shots on Capitol Hill. </P>
<P> ``You know, I've never been in the minority,'' he said. ''I've been in Congress, the House and the Senate, for 22 years, and I've never done this minority bit.'' </P>
