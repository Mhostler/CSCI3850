<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  O.J. Simpson literally became defense ``Exhibit A'' at his double-murder trial Wednesday, baring his football injuries for the jury and posing in bikini briefs in a series of revealing photographs. </P>
<P> The purpose: to prove that the tall, strapping ex-athlete who once thundered through opponent's defenses on the football field and dashed through airports in Hertz rental car commercials is now too crippled to have killed his ex-wife and a friend. </P>
<P> Attorney Johnnie Cochran set the stage during a dramatic opening statement, telling jurors Simpson was suffering from an ``acute phase'' of rheumatoid arthritis in his wrists the day of the murders -- so severe, in fact, that his hands were not strong enough to shuffle a deck of cards. </P>
<P> Cochran admitted that Simpson played a round of golf the morning of the June 12 murders but left out that he had taped an exercise video just a few weeks before showing him playing basketball and doing aerobics and pushups. </P>
<P> Cochran contended, however, that the 47-year-old Hall of Fame running back's once-golden legs are also not what they used to be -- the result of three knee operations and the ravages of osteoarthritis. </P>
<P> ``What no NFL defense could do, Mother Nature and Father Time have taken their toll,'' Cochran said. </P>
<P> Then, in an obviously choreographed piece of courtroom theater, Simpson -- flanked on all sides by four sheriff's deputies -- rose from his seat at the defense table and walked slowly toward the jury box, smiling almost sheepishly. </P>
<P> Stopping no more than two feet from the 12 people who will decide his fate, Simpson leaned down and pulled up his left pants leg to display criss-crossing scars from four separate knee operations. </P>
<P> Jurors leaned forward, craning their necks for a better view. ``You in the back row can stand up,'' Judge Lanco Ito told the panel, and several leapt to their feet. </P>
<P> When it was over, Simpson -- who is charged with stabbing Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman to death -- walked calmly back to the defense table, rolling his eyes to attorney Robert Shapiro as he lowered himself gingerly into his seat. </P>
<P> The judge had approved the four-minute demonstration over the strenuous objections of prosecutors, who contended it was a blatant ploy to get Simpson close enough to the jury to impress them with his ``star appeal.'' </P>
<P> Simpson's brief baring of his knee was followed by an even more revealing display -- a series of blow-up photos showing him clad in bikini briefs in a variety of poses. </P>
<P> The defense team had the pictures taken within several days of the murders and introduced them Wednesday in an effort to prove that Simpson did not bear any of the bruises or cuts that might have resulted from a savage knife attack on two fit young people. </P>
<P> In cataloguing Simpson's ailments, Cochran said: ``He was perhaps the greatest running back in the history of the NFL with all kinds of records. But you pay a price.'' </P>
<P> ``There will be evidence of limitations now imposed upon him by virtue of his career and by virtue of these diseases,'' he said. </P>
<P> Though Simpson played golf in Los Angeles the morning of the murders, the pain in his hands was so severe that he could not even shuffle a deck of cards when he later played gin rummy at the clubhouse, Cochran said. </P>
<P> Along with two forms of arthritis and lingering pain from knee surgeries, Simpson also has dyslexia, a reading disorder, he said. </P>
