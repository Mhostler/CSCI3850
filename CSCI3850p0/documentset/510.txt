<DATELINE>SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic called on Bosnia's Serbs Sunday to reverse their opposition to the latest Bosnian peace plan, as Russia tried to rescue the deal. </P>
<P> In a statement clearly aimed at the Bosnian Serb leadership, Milosevic said peace was in the interest of all Serbs and that the plan must be accepted to avoid further bloodshed. </P>
<P> Milosevic's comments, published in the Belgrade newspaper Politika, followed a decision Saturday in Geneva by foreign ministers from the United States, Russia and European Union countries to call for tighter sanctions against rump Yugoslavia -- Serbia and Montenegro -- in a bid to force the Bosnian Serbs to reconsider their rejection. </P>
<P> Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, who lobbied Western governments to refrain from taking military steps against the Serbs, arrived in Belgrade Sunday evening to hold crucial talks with Milosevic, long-time patron of the Bosnian Serbs. </P>
<P> Yugoslav Tanjug news agency reported that it was possible that Kozyrev would also meet Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic. </P>
<P> The major powers stopped short of calling for punitive military measures to force Serb compliance with the plan and left Serb leaders an opening to pursue further negotiations. </P>
<P> Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic and Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, who support the peace plan, said Sunday the decision lacked teeth and showed international vacillation. </P>
<P> Izetbegovic said the group's communique had commendably reaffirmed Bosnia's territorial integrity and held out the prospect of expanding Muslim ``safe areas'' and exempting Muslims from a U.N. arms embargo if Serbs remained intransigent. </P>
<P> But he said the big powers had failed to chart military action if the Serbs shrugged off a stricter trade embargo. </P>
<P> ``Economic sanctions are by their very nature uncertain. Also the deadline for Serb acceptance has been twice pushed back, indicating a dangerous indecisiveness of the international community,'' he said. </P>
<P> U.N. officials were cautiously optimistic that Bosnia's rivals could agree to reopen commercial routes into Sarajevo. </P>
<P> Bosnian Serbs accepted a proposal by U.N. civil affairs chief Sergio De Mello to hold talks with the Muslim-led Bosnian government over reopening a commercial road into Sarajevo and other issues Monday, U.N. Protection Force spokeswoman Claire Grimes said in Sarajevo. </P>
<P> Grimes reported a dangerous increase in cease-fire violations in Sarajevo over the weekend. </P>
<P> ``There is persistent tension and a significant increase in sniping. Snipers are a real problem,'' Grimes said. </P>
<P> Four women, including a five-year old girl and her mother, were wounded in the Muslim part of Dobrinja Sunday when a rifle-launched grenade exploded in a street, hospital sources said. </P>
<P> The Bosnian Serb army said sniping on the Sarajevo district of Grbavica was blocking all movement in the area Sunday following fierce clashes in the Jewish cemetery on Saturday. </P>
<P> The United States said Sunday that the U.N. Security Council would probably consider new economic sanctions against Yugoslavia Monday. </P>
<P> But Madeleine Albright, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said the world had given the Bosnian Serbs another opportunity to change their minds. </P>
<P> ``We have told them to go back and look at the plan again,'' Albright said on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' program. </P>
<P> Milosevic told the Bosnian Serbs they had no right to reject peace and saddle Serbia and Montenegro with sanctions. </P>
<P> He said of the international peace plan: ``It is not entirely just as far as the Serb side is concerned ... but without doubt a compromise is necessary, peace is more just than war and life and wisdom must prevail over death and incessant destruction.'' </P>
<P> Milosevic added: ``Giving half of the (Bosnian) territory to the Bosnian Serbs and the other to the Muslim-Croat federation cannot be qualified as anti-Serb.'' </P>
<P> The Bosnian Serbs reacted angrily to the Geneva decision by saying they may cut off talks with the ``contact group'' -- the United States, Russia, Britain, France and Germany -- which drew up the peace plan. </P>
