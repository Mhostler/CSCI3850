<P>  A Chinese appeals court will consider whether to overturn a three-year sentence of administrative detention meted out to labor activist and poet Zhou Guoqiang, a relative said Monday. </P>
<P> The Intermediate People's Court will reconsider Zhou's sentence after his family members sued police and the Beijing Re-education through Labor Committee for detention which ``does not conform to standards,'' the relative said. </P>
<P> Family members paid a $9.40 fee last month for appeal proceedings to start, the relative said. But the trial date has not been set. </P>
<P> Zhou, who is detained in a labor camp in northeastern Heilongjiang province, is in ``poor health,'' said the relative who returned to Beijing recently after visiting Zhou. </P>
<P> ``He has heart problems, ulcer, allergy and suffers from rheumatism, and the condition at the reform camp is not good,'' the relative said. </P>
<P> Court officials could not be reached for comment. </P>
<P> Last November the Beijing Re-education through Labor Committee ordered Zhou, 40, who was detained last March, to serve three years in a labor camp, according to the New York-based Human Rights in China group. </P>
<P> Re-education through labor is an administrative punishment that is imposed without trial. It was formerly a way of punishing petty criminals but is now increasingly used to silence political dissidents in China. </P>
<P> When Zhou was arrested, Chinese officials said he was accused of ``colluding with hostile organizations and people to engage in anti-government activities at home and abroad,'' the human rights group said. </P>
<P> He was also accused of planning to disrupt the annual meeting of parliament last March by distributing T-shirts printed with provocative slogans and using an illegally installed fax machine to send articles to Hong Kong, the group said. </P>
<P> China has introduced sweeping economic reforms but has maintained an iron grip on politics, ruling out Western-style democracy or political pluralism. </P>
