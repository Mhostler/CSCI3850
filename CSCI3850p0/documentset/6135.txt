<P>  George Foreman said Michael Moorer deserves a rematch and he wants to give him that opportunity next. </P>
<P> ``Michael Moorer gave me a chance, so my first choice would be to give him another chance to fight for the title,'' Foreman said Friday before being honored as Fighter of the Year at the Boxing Writers Association of America dinner. </P>
<P> Foreman stunned the boxing world last November when he floored Moorer in the 10th round to regain the heavyweight title at the age of 45, 20 years after he lost it. </P>
<P> Though Moorer said it was news to him that Foreman wanted to give him a chance to take back the International Boxing Federation crown, it was good news. </P>
<P> ``I would welcome it with wide open arms,'' said Moorer, who is set for a May 13 bout against Tim Puller -- his first fight since losing the title. </P>
<P> Though Foreman was talking up Moorer, his real first choice for a next opponent is former champion Mike Tyson, a bout that would bring an enormous payday. </P>
<P> ``I would perfer him, but I don't think it is going to happen,'' Foreman said of Tyson, who was released from an Indiana prison last month after serving three years for rape. </P>
<P> ``If he stepped up right now and said George I would like to fight you tomorrow, then I would give him a few weeks to get in shape and of course it would be the top. </P>
<P> ``It would be interesting to get into the ring with someone who would be guaranteed to come after me,'' said Foreman, who felt he had to chase German opponent Axel Schultz throughout last Saturday's fight. </P>
<P> Foreman said he would consider a rematch with Schultz, but he shrugged off the wave of criticism by those who felt the German should have been declared the winner of Saturday's fight in Las Vegas. </P>
<P> ``I don't think there is any controversy,'' said Foreman, who was wearing dark glasses to hide the Schultz-inflicted bruises around his left eye. </P>
<P> Though others might have booed his performance, Foreman was pleased. </P>
<P> ``I feel pretty good, period,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``Once I get in the boxing ring and go 12 rounds and when I get back home I'm still alive, I feel great about it.'' </P>
