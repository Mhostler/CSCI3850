<P>  A far-rightist who would send in the army to fight crime and who rails against ecologists, homosexuals and television may finish third in Brazil's presidential elections Monday. </P>
<P> Eneas Carneiro, a diminutive doctor from Rio de Janeiro, offers a tough, nationalistic message to crime-weary Brazilians, and opinion polls show millions will vote for him. </P>
<P> ``Brazil needs order, and I like order ... Does that make me a fascist? Only journalists call me fascist,'' said Carneiro in an interview. </P>
<P> He hardly looks the part of an anti-crime tough guy. With a flowing beard and intense gaze, he would look more like a biblical prophet were it not for his huge eyeglasses. </P>
<P> He would impose Draconian sentences on criminals, send in the armed forces to fight crime in ``extreme cases,'' and praises the former military regime as ``a government that made Brazil advance.'' </P>
<P> He attacks ``aberrant'' homosexuals, rages against environmentalists as ``enemies of the fatherland, traitors of the people'' and assails television for its corrupting influences on children. </P>
<P> ``Television spreads false ideas, that there are no longer ethical values ... that there's no advantage to being honest, that there's nothing wrong with homosexual experiences,'' says Carneiro's campaign platform. </P>
<P> Brazil's mainstream press derides his statements as fascist rantings. Newspaper Jornal do Brasil depicted Carneiro with his beard twisted into a swastika, and newsmagazine Veja called his tiny Party for the Rebuilding of National Order ``ridiculous.'' </P>
<P> But opinion polls show he will win about six percent of the vote, more than several well-known politicians and in third place behind front-runner Fernando Henrique Cardoso and leftist candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. </P>
<P> Political analysts say Carneiro appeals to voters across Brazil who are fed up with what they see as a society disintegrating into crime, immorality and corruption. </P>
<P> ``His electorate is the angry middle class with little political consciousness,'' said sociologist Jose Chasin, quoted in Veja. ``He is not a political phenomenon, he is psycho-social phenomenon.'' </P>
<P> He also appeals to a fringe of ultra-nationalist, rightist military officers, analysts say. His running mate, Roberto Gama e Silva, is a a navy admiral. </P>
<P> Despite his attacks on television, political analysts say Carneiro owes his popularity mostly to free nightly television spots, which are offered to all candidates. </P>
