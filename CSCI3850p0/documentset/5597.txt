<P>  The U.S. Navy must continue to build to deter potential aggressors in future superpowers, Secretary of Defense William Perry said Saturday. </P>
<P> The military's strategy, Perry said, is one of ``forward presence.'' </P>
<P> He made his remarks as the Navy's latest Aegis guided missile destroyer Cole was christened at the Ingalls Shipbuilding Division of Litton Industries. The ship will be commissioned in mid-1996 and based in Mayport, Fla. </P>
<P> Asked to comment on an ABC television news magazine 20/20 report Friday night that several cadets had complained that training exercises at the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado to prepare them for possible sexual assaults involved simulated rapes and undressing, Perry said this exercise ``clearly'' went too far. </P>
<P> So did the exercise at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida where four soldiers training to be Army Rangers died in a swamp in February, he added. </P>
<P> Perry said that changes the Air Force has since made in the training exercises are ``appropriate''. </P>
<P> ``It's a balance,'' he said at a press conference following the christening. ``And I do not want to back off realistic training. We take those risks because we want to minimize the casualties that could occur'' in warfare. </P>
<P> Perry said during his christening remarks that although the cold war has ended, the United States needs to continue training its forces and improving its hardware. </P>
<P> ``Why do we continue to build mighty warships like the Cole? The reason is simple and clear,'' Perry said. ``We still face challenges around the globe that require American military presence.'' </P>
<P> Perry said the Navy's ``forward presence'' has helped to protect trade in the Western Pacific, an area ``critical to our economy and our security.'' </P>
<P> He said the same strategy has helped to contain aggression by Iraq and Iran. U.S. Navy ships that remain in that area will prevent ``and if necessary defeat any aggression,'' he added. </P>
