<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A pedestrian overpass collapsed in Seoul Sunday after being hit by an overloaded trailer truck, killing at least two people and injuring eight others, police said. </P>
<P> The truck, a bus, and two cars were trapped under a big slab of cement after a 46-foot span of the overpass came down in eastern Seoul, a police officer said. </P>
<P> A police officer said the truck was overloaded with steel products and was higher than the clearance of the overpass. </P>
<P> ``Fortunately, there there were not many people around on Sunday morning and the number of casualties was small,'' the officer said. </P>
<P> He said a bus driver and a passenger were killed, adding the death toll could rise because some of the injured were in serious condition. </P>
<P> Thirty-two people were killed Oct. 21, when a bridge in central Seoul collapsed into the Han River during the morning rush hour. </P>
<P> The disaster caused deep embarrassment to the government and President Kim Young-sam ordered harsh punishment for those responsible. The mayor of Seoul has been dismissed and 12 city officials responsible for bridge inspection arrested. </P>
