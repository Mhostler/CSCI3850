<P>  Canadian police Thursday found two more bodies, burned beyond recognition, in a Quebec home where earlier this week they found the charred remains of a couple linked to the mass murder-suicide in Switzerland. </P>
<P> Quebec provincial police found the latest bodies in the basement of the home destroyed by arson Tuesday, in the town of Morin Heights, Quebec, about 50 miles north of Montreal. </P>
<P> The bodies were so badly burned that police have been unable to determine the sex of the victims, a police spokesman said. </P>
<P> The charred remains of a man and a woman were found Tuesday, and police were awaiting dental records to identify them. Police believe the couple, who wore necklaces with medallions engraved with the letters ``TS'', were both alive when the fire began. Police speculated the letters stood for Temple Solaire. </P>
<P> The deaths in Quebec and the 48 people found dead in Switzerland have been linked to a religious cult the Order of the Solar Temple, founded by Luc Jouret. </P>
<P> The bodies found in Quebec were discovered in a house adjacent to Jouret's home in Morin Heights. </P>
