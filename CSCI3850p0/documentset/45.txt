<P>  Like an unwanted guest, the unruly U.S. dollar threatens to spoil the party when leaders of the world's most economically powerful nations gather this week for the Group of Seven (G7) summit. </P>
<P> Annual talks on the economy starting Friday had been expected to focus on the politically-congenial themes of growth and creating jobs. </P>
<P> Instead the Group -- the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Japan and Britain -- may need to act to break the fall in the U.S. currency which has tumbled to 50-year lows against the Japanese yen, undermined by a huge U.S. trade deficit and fears of rekindling inflation. </P>
<P> ``They are going to have to discuss the dollar. The other stuff about growth and jobs is like God and apple pie -- everybody is in favor,'' said Anthony Thomas, chief economist at London investment bank Kleinwort Benson. </P>
<P> Beside currencies, conflict in Bosnia and Rwanda and thorny issues from world trade to nuclear proliferation will ensure that the July 8-10 meeting in the steamy, southern Italian port city of Naples is no seaside stroll. </P>
<P> Leaders were due to give backing to a ``take it or leave it'' plan to end the 27-month-old Bosnian war drawn up by a ``contact group'' of officials from the United States, Russia, Britain, Germany and France. But the plan, splitting Bosnia between Serbs and a Muslim-Croat federation, looks set to be rejected by the warring factions. </P>
<P> The Europeans will also be looking to a commitment from the U.S. and Japan to help finance a multi-million dollar nuclear safety plan for Ukraine that would shut Chernobyl, site of the world's worst nuclear accident in 1986. </P>
<P> Over 5,000 policemen and soldiers will be deployed as part of a huge security clampdown in Naples, which is home to the Camorra, the local version of the Sicilian Mafia. </P>
<P> Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and Canada's Jean Cretien will be making their G7 debuts, but it will be a final appearance for French President Francois Mitterrand, 77, doyen of the Group after 14 summits. </P>
<P> As at Tokyo last year, Russian President Boris Yeltsin will join the final day's session dedicated to political issues. </P>
