<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Senate approved full-pension retirement for Admiral Henry Mauz Tuesday after five women senators dropped demands for a hearing on allegations including his handling of a sex harassment case. </P>
<P> Senator Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat, withdrew a motion demanding the Senate hearing after senators agreed to a review of Pentagon cooperation with the Senate on allegations against high-ranking officers. All five women Democrats in the Senate had supported the motion. </P>
<P> But Murray said she still had serious questions about allegations against Mauz because she said the Navy gave her ``conflicting and downright inaccurate'' information. </P>
<P> She said Lieutenant Darlene Simmons accused Mauz of failing to take proper action in a case involving sexual harassment and that Navy Senior Chief George Taylor accused Mauz of retaliating against Taylor for criticizing Mauz's use of Navy planes and cars for a pleasure trip to Bermuda. </P>
<P> But Senate Armed Services Committeer Chairman Sam Nunn, a Georgia Democrat, said a Pentagon investigation cleared Mauz of the allegations. He and other senators said they regretted that Mauz was retiring under a cloud. </P>
<P> Nunn said Mauz was responsible for Atlantic Fleet operations including the Navy's part in U.S. military action in Haiti and could not be held responsible for personnel mistakes at lower levels. </P>
<P> Simmons told Nunn's committee in a letter that she appealed to Mauz but he failed to hold anyone accountable for harassment when she was legal officer on a U.S. warship. </P>
<P> Murray said Simmons was given a poor fitness report and held in a pyschiatric unit for four days after she filed sex harassment charges against her superior officer for repeatedly asking her for dates and commenting on her appearance. </P>
<P> Taylor told the Senate committee Mauz was a key player in 48 charges he said were filed against him in retaliation after he appeared on ABC's ``Primetime Live'' to criticize Mauz for a 1992 pleasure trip to Bermuda. Taylor was chief of military police there at the time. </P>
<P> Nunn said the Navy counseled Mauz on use of Navy planes and cars on pleasure trips but investigations by the Defense Department cleared Mauz of the other allegations. </P>
<P> ``The facts demonstrate that Admiral Mauz had no role in any of the actions against Senior Chief Taylor,'' Nunn told the Senate. ``The facts demonstrate that he took reasonable actions to address the sexual harassment of Lieutenant Simmons (and) played no role in the hospitalization of Lieutenant Simmons.'' </P>
