<P>  The United Nations Secretary-General expressed pleasure Saturday with the four-month cease-fire accord for Bosnia which goes into effect Sunday. </P>
<P> The cessation of hostilities agreement signed Saturday supplants a simple cease-fire that was agreed between Bosnia's Muslim-led government and Serb leaders Dec. 23. </P>
<P> ``The secretary-general considers this agreement an important first step toward the achievement of a real peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina and hopes that it will clear the way for the parties to return to the negotiating table in the near future,'' said a statement from U.N. chief Boutros Boutros-Ghali's spokesman. </P>
<P> ``This achievement is a wonderful New Year's gift for the inhabitants of this war-torn country,'' the statement said. </P>
