<P>  Gunmen killed two American employees of the U.S. consulate-general here and wounded one in Pakistan's violence-ridden industrial port city of Karachi Wednesday, police and U.S. diplomats said. </P>
<P> The unidentified gunmen, armed with automatic weapons, ambushed a U.S. consulate-general car in eastern Karachi, the police said. </P>
<P> ``This morning in Karachi, armed gunmen with automatic weapons opened fire on a van transporting American Consulate- General employees to work,'' a U.S. Embassy statement in Islamabad said. </P>
<P> ``One American was killed immediately, and another has since died of wounds. A third was injured less seriously,'' it said. </P>
<P> One of the two killed was a woman, said a doctor at Aga Khan Hospital, where the victims were taken. </P>
<P> The embassy statement said the identity, affiliations and motives of the gunmen were not immediately known. </P>
<P> The embassy declined to release the names of the dead or wounded until their next of kin were informed. </P>
<P> It was also not immediately known whether the victims were diplomats. A U.S. embassy official said their job descriptions would be given later. </P>
<P> A police official said in Karachi the gunmen ambushed the consulate van in eastern Karachi around 8:30 a.m. (local) and critically wounded the three U.S. employees. </P>
<P> They were rushed to a hospital where two died. No one has claimed responsibility, he said. </P>
<P> Peter Claussen, Public Affairs Officer at the consulate, told Reuters the wounded American was in a stable condition. The van driver was unhurt. </P>
<P> It was the first major incident in which foreigners have been killed in the violence in Karachi that has left more than 1,000 people dead since the beginning of 1994. </P>
<P> A spokesman of the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad said there was a general advisory on security in Karachi for the Americans. </P>
<P> ``We have stopped Americans from traveling in dangerous areas,'' a consulate official said. </P>
<P> Police cordoned off all exits out of Karachi and launched investigations, a police official said. </P>
<P> He said the police had also strengthened security at the U.S. consulate-general, which is located near a state guest house in southern Karachi. </P>
<P> Witnesses said a number of U.S. consulate cars entered and left the mission from the back door, heavily guarded by police and private armed guards. </P>
