<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Instead of world heavyweight champions, the winners of the two titles up for grabs Saturday could just as well be dubbed world champion babysitters. </P>
<P> That's because many people believe the two fighters who will end up with the World Boxing Association (WBA) and World Boxing Council (WBC) belts will be just tucking them in safe and snug for the man of the house to come home and claim them. </P>
<P> That man, of course, is Mike Tyson, fresh from three years in prison and flush from signing a six-fight, multi-million- dollar deal aimed at having him reclaim the heavyweight mansion, which he has dominated -- in or out of prison, with or without a title -- for years. </P>
<P> In addition to the heavyweight title fights, three other championship bouts will be on the card at Caesars Palace. </P>
<P> WBC super lightweight champion Julio Cesar Chavez of Mexico (93-1-1) will defend against 29-1 Giovanni Parisi of Italy, and International Boxing Federation (IBF) welterweight titlist Felix Trinidad of Puerto Rico (25-0) will take on Roger Turner (29-2) of the United States. </P>
<P> WBC super welterweight champion Luis Santana of the Dominican Republic (39-15-2) will fight Terry Norris of the United States in a rematch of their controversial first fight. </P>
<P> In that fight last November, Norris (38-5) was the champion and ended a fifth-round flurry of punches to Santana's head with a blow to the back of the head. The Dominican went down and stayed flat on his back for several minutes. Norris was disqualified and lost his title. </P>
<P> Chavez, 32, is on the downside of a great career. He no longer has his once vaunted power or speed, but still is aggressive and damaging, especially to the body. </P>
<P> Chavez is a 6-1 favorite, but the relatively-unknown Parisi is given a better chance by some to upset the Mexican hero by using exceptional speed and sharp counter punches. </P>
<P> Trinidad, 22, is considered by many to be one of the best pound-for-pound fighters in the world. His last two victories were against fighters who were a combined 88-0. </P>
<P> There are good reasons why Turner, 31, is a 12-1 underdog. </P>
<P> In the first of the heavyweight babysitting tryouts on Saturday, Tony Tucker will fight Bruce Seldon for the WBC crown. Then former champion Larry Holmes, 45, gets to stay up late to try to take away Oliver McCall's WBC title. </P>
<P> Holmes first won the heavyweight title from Ken Norton in 1978 and was champion for seven years. </P>
<P> There probably is no one craftier than Holmes, who appears to have trained very hard for the shorter, stockier McCall, 29. But crafty can't be exchanged for years. </P>
<P> If Holmes, an 8-5 underdog, wins, he will not stay around long after he sees Tyson coming to get the title, but likely will try to use his victory to get a fight with George Foreman. </P>
<P> Holmes candidly says he wants no part of Tyson, who in 1988 crushed him in the fourth round. </P>
<P> Seven years later Holmes isn't likely to do much better, and there's always the opposite of much better for him to contemplate. </P>
<P> McCall, a former sparring partner for Tyson, won the WBC title by stopping an amateurish Lennox Lewis with a right hand to the face in the second round last September. </P>
<P> McCall, 25-5, brings a rock-solid chin and will try to get inside Holmes' famous jab and look to end the fight early. </P>
<P> The WBA stripped Foreman of its title for refusing to fight its top contender, Tony Tucker. </P>
<P> So Tucker, 35, will meet Bruce Seldon, 28, the WBA's number two contender, to decide the new champion on Saturday. </P>
<P> Tucker (52-2) has been through the heavyweight wars, even beating James ``Buster'' Douglas to win the International Boxing Federation title -- only to lose it 62 days later to Tyson, making Tucker's reign the shortest in heavyweight history. </P>
<P> The big question is whether Tucker, who has been fighting as a professional for 15 years and had 206 amateur fights, has lost his legs and reflexes. </P>
<P> Seldon (31-3) has the body of an Adonis, as he is quick to point out, can change leads quickly and has good power in both hands. But his stamina and chin are questionable. </P>
