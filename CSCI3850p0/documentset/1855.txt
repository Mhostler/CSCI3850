<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Former King Michael was expelled from Romania Friday barely an hour after arriving from Paris in defiance of a government warning not to come. </P>
<P> A statement from the leftist authorities justified his expulsion, saying the trip was ``inconvenient'' and a threat to public order. </P>
<P> ``The government regrets that the ex-sovereign and his entourage got involved in such an attempt at forcing entry into the country,'' said an official statement on state radio. </P>
<P> Dinu Patriciu, head of the royalist 1993 Liberal Party, said 72-year-old Michael was put back on the Air France flight after the government carried out its threat to bar him. </P>
<P> About 2,500 disppointed supporters waiting at the airport shouted ``Assassins, Assassins'' and ``Let Michael in'' at armed anti-terrorist police who stood by in bullet-proof vests. </P>
<P> In a statement issued just after he flew out but prepared earlier, Michael said he came for reconciliation not confrontation with the government of President Ion Iliescu. </P>
<P> ``I come to you, as a Romanian, without any intention to oppose the present constitional order of our country,'' he said. </P>
<P> Michael entered the country in 1990 only to be escorted out. </P>
<P> In 1992 his only official visit since he was forced to abdicate in 1947 drew hundreds of thousands of supporters onto the streets -- shocking the government in a country still run by members of the old Communist elite, now democratically elected. </P>
<P> His supporters see him as a worthy king who redeemed a monarchy discredited by his father King Carol II. </P>
<P> Michael had been invited as the keynote speaker at a conference on the events of August 23, 1944, when he played a key role in overturning a fascist regime and switching Romania to the Allied side -- turning its troops against Germany. </P>
<P> But Iliescu, in power since the 1989 overthrow of Stalinist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, refuses to recognize Michael even as a Romanian, referring to him as a ``foreign citizen.'' </P>
