<P>  Syria Monday rebuked Sen. Jesse Helms, the incoming Republican chairman of the powerful senate Foreign Relations Committee who has described the Middle East peace process as a ``fraud.'' </P>
<P> ``If Mr.HHelms becomes head of the senate's Foreign Relations Committee then he would be forced to learn more about the facts of the Arab-Israeli conflict,'' a Syrian information official said. </P>
<P> Helms told Cable News Network (CNN) he was opposed to U.S. troops being stationed on the Golan Heights in Syria as part of a force to monitor a possible Israeli-Syrian peace accord. </P>
<P> ``Look, this whole peace process over there is a fraud, and you'd better look carefully at what's going on,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``Syria doesn't want peace. They want the Golan Heights. They want access to the pocketbooks of the American taxpayers. And I don't think we ought to police the world.'' </P>
<P> The Syrian official said President Hafez al-Assad had repeatedly expressed a sincere desire for peace and this had been acknowledged by President Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher. </P>
<P> ``We hoped that victory would not have let Helms forget that Israel which is occupying the Arab lands is the country which is living on the pocketbooks of the American tax-payers because it receives the biggest amounts of money. </P>
<P> ``Syria did not receive any American aid for years. Peace for Syria is more noble than the issue of aid,'' the official said. </P>
<P> Peace talks are stalled over Israel's occupation of the Golan Heights, which it captured in 1967, and future ties. </P>
