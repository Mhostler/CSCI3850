<P>  Shannon Faulkner who is suing for full admission to The Citadel's all male cadet corps said Monday night her fight is making the school ``better''. </P>
<P> Faulkner who has already won the right to attend classes at the state institution said in a speech: ``I've been met with great criticism. There are quite a few people who say I am destroying the Citadel. I am not, I am making it better.'' </P>
<P> Her comments, made to an audience of 200 at the University of South Carolina here, marked her first public address in the state which is split on the issue. </P>
<P> Faulkner, the first woman student in classes with cadets at The Citadel, said the benefit she seeks in joining the program is comradeship. </P>
<P> She said she applied to the state-funded military college, based in Charleston, S.C., for four basic reasons: its education department, alumni network, prestige and the military setting. </P>
<P> Faulkner sued The Citadel two years ago for rescending its acceptance of her after learning her gender. She did not identify her sex on the school's enrollment application. </P>
<P> After legal wrangling that began with her lawsuit filed in March 1993, a federal court in Charleston ordered the woman admitted as a day student, meaning she is unable to participate in any cadet activities. </P>
<P> The address Monday was interrupted by wild applause despite a small group of Citadel supporters brandishing posters that read ``Save the Males.'' </P>
<P> The tension led to verbal sparring between Faulkner and some Citadel supporters who questioned her motives and accused her of destroying tradition. </P>
<P> Faulkner's high-profile legal battle has led to a month- long speaking tour celebrating Women's History Month. She has received several awards for her tenacious fight against The Citadel's 152-year-old all-male admission's policy. </P>
<P> The speech at USC was her first in the state in which two- thirds of the citizens believe The Citadel's Corp of Cadets should remain all-male, accordingto a statewide survey completed in March of last year. </P>
<P> An appeals court heard arguments in January and is due to decide whether she can become a cadet. </P>
<P> Time, however, is not on her side. </P>
<P> Citadel students must be accepted to the Corps of Cadets by their junior academic year, which for Faulker begins in August. School policy prohibits students' admissions into the program as seniors. </P>
<P> Faulkner, 20, confidently told the audience, which included heckling Citadel cadets and alumni, that she will be in the Corp of Cadets in August because the law was on her side. </P>
<P> She is due to make six more addresses. ``The money will go to help pay for my tuition next year,'' Faulkner said. </P>
<P> Her honorarium varies among sponsors. </P>
