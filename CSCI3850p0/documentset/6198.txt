<P>  Team Dennis Conner received permission Monday to switch boats for the upcoming America's Cup final against Team New Zealand. </P>
<P> Conner, who sailed Star & Stripes during the defender series, has been granted use of PACT 95's Young America, which had the best overall record of the three U.S. syndicates. </P>
<P> The America's Cup Trustees' Committee ruled Monday in favor of Conner in response to a protest from Team New Zealand. The committee cited the mutual consent clause that allows a team to enter two new boats in the competition. </P>
<P> Prior to acquiring Young America in an agreement reached Saturday with his former rivals, Conner had built one new yacht -- Stars & Stripes. </P>
<P> ``Stars & Stripes brought us to where we are today,'' said Conner. ``However four months of defender trials have proven Young America's hull has speed advantages. This boat and the proven strength of the Stars & Stripes team will be a winning combination in the upcoming America's Cup.'' </P>
<P> The best-of-nine race America's Cup finals begins May 6. </P>
<P> In a separate ruling, the trustees decided that neither Team New Zealand nor Team Dennis Conner will be allowed to make boat modifications after May 4. </P>
<P> Both sides had asked for clarification on rules addressing modifications during a series. </P>
<P> The only exception to the ``no modification'' rule will be if boats are required to make changes by the measurement committee or if they sustain unintentional damage. </P>
