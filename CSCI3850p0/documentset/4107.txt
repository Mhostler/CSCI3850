<DATELINE>LONDON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  British character actor Donald Pleasence, whose piercing blue eyes and bald pate made him a natural movie villain, died in France Thursday aged 75 following a heart operation, his agent said. </P>
<P> Pleasence, who was feted for his stage role as the repugnant tramp Davies in Harold Pinter's ``The Caretaker'' in 1960, moved on to Hollywood to give a string of convincing film portrayals of psychopaths and criminals. </P>
<P> Time magazine once called Pleasence an actor of ``atomic power and blinding virtuosity.'' Some U.S. critics hailed him as one of the greatest British actors. </P>
<P> The actor, who appeared in ``The Great Escape'' war film as a short-sighted forger and as an elegant despot in the James Bond thriller ``You Only Live Twice,'' had just finished his last role in the latest ``Halloween'' film when he died. </P>
<P> ``He played many villains because he played them so well,'' said his close friend, director David Giles. ``He could look amazingly malevolent although he was one of the least malevolent people I have ever met.'' </P>
<P> His agent Joy Jameson told Reuters she believed Pleasence's death was related to a heart operation he underwent before Christmas. </P>
<P> Pleasence, who died at his home in St. Paul de Vence near Nice, had a heart valve replaced in the operation. He spent much of his life in France but is expected to be buried in Britain. </P>
<P> ``I spoke to him at six o'clock last night and he seemed as right as rain,'' Jameson said. ``He was talking about a holiday he planned to take in Florida.'' </P>
<P> In his prolific career Pleasence, who won a number of stage awards as well as an Order of the British Empire medal, played a number of Shakespearean stage roles and also starred as a meek-looking wife murderer in the film ``Dr. Crippen.'' </P>
<P> His voice was featured in the Beatles' animated film ``Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.'' He recently appeared in Woody Allen's film ``Shadows And Fog.'' </P>
<P> ``He was one of the finest character actors Britain has ever produced,'' his friend, film director Michael Winner, said. </P>
<P> Born in Worksop in northern England, a town bordering on what remains of Robin Hood's Sherwood Forest, Pleasence recited poetry at an early age and by the age of nine he knew he wanted to become an actor. </P>
<P> He had no formal training and started his career in repertory stage companies after working on the railways. </P>
<P> He flew with the British Royal Air Force in World War II and his plane was shot down. He spent the last year of the war in a German prison camp. </P>
<P> One of his first big breaks was landing the part of Mavriky in the Peter Brook stage production of ``The Brothers Karamazov'' in 1946. </P>
<P> In a touring group headed by Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh, he made his New York debut at the Ziegfield Theater as the Major-Domo in ``Caesar and Cleopatra'' in 1951. </P>
<P> Moviegoers will probably remember him best as 007's evil adversary Ernst Blofeld in the 1967 ``You Only Live Twice'' and as psychiatrist Dr. Sam Loomis, head of the asylum from which Michael Myers escapes, in the Halloween films. </P>
<P> Pleasence, who threw himself totally into roles, often said he did not enjoy acting, saying it was a ``compulsive thing.'' </P>
<P> He once said: ``I alternate between being terrified and being bored, yet there is a curious excitement in it the whole time.'' </P>
<P> In Who's Who he listed his recreation as: ``Talking too much.'' </P>
