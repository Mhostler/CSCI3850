<P>  Scientists have long known about the risk of lung cancer faced by smokers. Now they have found evidence that smokers have a 70 percent greater risk of developing cancer of the pancreas as well. </P>
<P> Pancreatic cancer is the fifth biggest cause of U.S. cancer deaths, claiming roughly 25,000 lives a year. Most patients die within a few months of diagnosis and no early detection screening has been developed. </P>
<P> Smoking is linked to about 27 percent of the pancreatic cancers, according to a study made public Tuesday and being published this week in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. Scientists have not yet established other risk factors for the disease. </P>
<P> ``Pancreatic cancer is hard to study,'' said the leader of this research team, epidemiologist Debra Silverman of the National Cancer Institute. ``It's a hidden site and there are no symptoms until it spreads... That's why there are such short survival rates.'' </P>
<P> She said in a telephone interview that the smoking-pancreatic cancer link was about the same for blacks and whites, and thus did not explain why the disease is far more prevalent among blacks. </P>
<P> Her research found smokers have a 70 percent increased risk of developing pancreatic cancer. The longer someone smoked, the higher the risk. Quitting for at least 10 years lowered the risk by a third.  There have been earlier studies showing a link between smoking and pancreatic cancer, but Silverman's survey is seen as more reliable because it uses data provided by the patients themselves. </P>
<P> Silverman surveyed 526 patients aged 30 to 79 with pancreatic cancer. She gathered data on their smoking and drinking habits, coffee and tea consumption, dietary patterns, occupation and socio-economic status. </P>
<P> Silverman estimated that by eliminating smoking, about a quarter of these malignancies could be eliminated a year. </P>
