<P>  Gambia's new head of state, Lieutenant Yahya Jammeh, said Saturday he would not tolerate women tourists visiting his west African holiday paradise country in search of sex. </P>
<P> Jammeh, a serious 29-year-old clad in camouflage fatigues and a red beret, also said he and his fellow army lieutenants who seized power in a coup four weeks ago would go back to barracks as soon as they had set the country to rights. </P>
<P> ``We are Africans and we have our own moral values. Any trade that is based on sex is immoral so if there is a particular group of tourists who come here purposely for sex, and knowing the effects of such type of sex, we cannot condone that,'' he told Reuters in an interview. </P>
<P> Many of the more than 130,000 tourists who head for Gambia's palm-fringed Atlantic beaches every year are middle-aged European women seeking sex with young Gambian men. </P>
<P> Jammeh, a committed Moslem, overthrew former president Sir Dawda Jawara on July 22 pledging to put an end to corruption. </P>
<P> ``Prostitution, drugs, those are all moral woes that we don't want in an African country because those are ideas which are alien to the African people,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``We are not sex machines. I want that to be clear to whoever comes here purposely for sex,'' he added. </P>
<P> ``Any type of commercial sex is immoral in an African context, and we are going to educate the masses about the dangers of such sex, the existence of AIDS. We are going to pinpoint certain sectors and say don't get involved in this type of sex.'' </P>
<P> Jammeh, who has suspended the constitution and authorised detention without trial, said he and his Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council (AFPRC) wanted to hand over to civilian rule and return to barracks as soon as possible. </P>
<P> ``What is in the forefront of our minds is that we have to hand over to a democratically elected government,'' he said. ``We are soldiers. I have no political ambitions, none of us has any political ambitions.'' </P>
<P> He said his government would honour a pledge made in a letter from Finance Minister Bakary Dabo to donor countries August 13 promising a timetable for the transition within 45 days. ``We're here to carry out a duty just like we carry out duties in the barracks. We are soldiers and soldiers we remain.'' </P>
