<P>  Iraq has shown interest in a promised limited oil sale deal for the first time, offering amendments to a U.S.-British draft resolution, diplomats said Tuesday. </P>
<P> But envoys were not certain if the Iraqi proposals meant Baghdad would eventually accept a deal or was trying to delay the draft resolution. Some of the amendments, they said, would be unacceptable to the sponsors. </P>
<P> One amendment asks for $2 billion in sales over 90 days rather than the $1 billion in the original draft proposed by Argentina, Britain, the United States and Oman. </P>
<P> This amount would come close to letting oil flow freely and would probably be rejected, the envoys said. </P>
<P> No date has been set for a council vote on the deal, which is not expected until next week at the earliest. </P>
<P> Iraqi deputy prime minister Tareq Aziz, in New York this week, rejected the U.S.-British draft but said he would consider a ``new'' resolution if it had radical changes. </P>
<P> Iraq, however, is cautious in approving any limited oil sale deal if it interferes with getting sanctions on oil exports lifted entirely. </P>
<P> But a new report on Monday from Rolf Ekeus, head of the U.N. Special Commission in charge of scrapping Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, dashed hopes of a speedy lifting of the oil embargo. It said Baghdad has not yet come clean in accounting for materials that could be used in germ warfare. </P>
<P> A 1991 Gulf War cease-fire resolution tied a lifting of sanctions on exports, such as oil, to the destruction of dangerous weapons while imports of goods are linked to other demands, such as accounting for Kuwaiti war prisoners. </P>
<P> The limited oil sale deal is separate from the lifting of the oil ban and is intended to raise money for needed food and medical supplies for Iraq, which has been under trade sanctions since its troops invaded Kuwait in August 1990. </P>
<P> Under this plan -- an update of a similar one first approved by the Security Council in 1991 but rejected by Iraq -- Baghdad would still have to pay up to 30 percent of the proceeds into a U.N. reparations fund while additional sums would go to meet other costs stemming from the Gulf war. </P>
<P> France has also proposed several amendments to the draft, asking for $1.5 billion over 90 days and making allowances for costs Iraq needs to restart pumping oil. The $1.5 billion figure is also unacceptable to the sponsors. </P>
