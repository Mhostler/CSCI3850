<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Nearly 700,000 people dropped out of the Food Stamps program between March and August, a decline due at least in part to a traditional seasonal slowdown, the government said Thursday. </P>
<P> Participation in August -- the latest month for which figures were available -- totalled 27,263,625 people, down 41,486 from the preceding month, according to the Food and Nutrition Service, part of the U.S. Agriculture Department. </P>
<P> Food stamp enrollment topped out in March at 27.96 million with the nearly 700,000 person decline the largest March to August drop since 1988. </P>
<P> Food Stamp analysts say this represents a change from the recession-driven participation growth from 1989 to 1993, when participation rose rapidly during the winter months and stabilized over the late spring and summer months. </P>
<P> During the 1989 to 1993 period, the economy drove most of the growth and participation with part of that growth fueled by expansion of the Medicaid program and improvements in the anti-hunger program allowing for greater participation. </P>
<P> Food stamps help low-income households buy food. Maximum benefits for a family of four rose this fiscal year to $386 a month from $375 offered in fiscal 1994, the agency said. </P>
<P> Beginning in March 1991, monthly enrollment has exceeded the mark of 22.6 million set in March 1983 during a recession, rising to its March 1994 all-time high. </P>
<P> The tally for August listed 6.8 million recipients in the Women, Infants and Children feeding program compared with 6.6 million recipients during July. </P>
<P> California led the country with 3.1 million people on food stamps, followed by Texas with 2.7 million and New York with 2.2 million. Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois and Michigan had more than one million enrolled each. </P>
