<P>  North Korea appeared to step up its war of words with South Korea Sunday, accusing the South's President Kim Young-sam of being the worst dictator his country had ever known. </P>
<P> The attack, assailing Kim for not allowing South Koreans to grieve the death this month of North Korea's ``Great Leader'' Kim Il-sung, came in a statement from the North's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland. </P>
<P> ``The inter-Korean relations which had been heading for reconciliation have begun turning back to the original point of confrontation due to his provocations,'' said the committee, whose statement was carried on North Korea's KCNA news agency. </P>
<P> The statement was released in Geneva less than a week before the planned resumption in the Swiss city of negotiations between North Korea and the United States on Pyongyang's suspected nuclear weapons program. </P>
<P> The talks began on July 8 but were postponed next day after the news of Kim Il-sung's death. A historic North-South presidential summit which was to have been held last week was also derailed. </P>
<P> The statement follows Seoul's decision last week to put on show a North Korean defector who claimed that Pyongyang had already built five atomic warheads with material diverted from its nuclear power stations. Seoul was later obliged to officially deny the allegation. </P>
<P> The North Korean statement, dated July 30, makes no mention of the United States and directs its bile instead at the South Korean president and leadership. </P>
<P> ``In South Korea there has been no such dictator as Kim Young-sam, whose regime has brought the North-South relations to extreme confrontation,'' the committee said. </P>
<P> It said the death of Kim Il-sung, North Korea's ruler for more than 45 years, had been the ``biggest national misfortune for both the North and the South.'' </P>
<P> The committee said that instead of allowing the Korean people to grieve the death freely, Kim Young-sam had ``perpetrated military provocations'' against the North in a ``never-to-be condoned treachery.'' </P>
<P> ``The present confrontation in the North-South relations originated from this,'' it said. </P>
<P> The committee attacked South Korea's decision to ban mourning for Kim Il-sung and to forbid mourners from traveling to the North. It accused the South Korean president of ``driving the sword into the bleeding hearts of his fellow countrymen in deep grief.'' </P>
<P> The committee went on to assail South Korean authorities for their drive against Hanchongryon, the South's nationwide radical student group which defied the mourning ban. Seoul has announced a crackdown on leftist student groups. </P>
<P> ``The Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland bitterly denounces in the name of the entire Korean people the South Korean authorities' reckless anti-communist confrontation campaign and fascist reactionary rule as an intolerable provocation against the North and an act strangling the South Korean national democratic forces,'' it said. </P>
<P> ``The anti-national acts of the South Korean rulers are ridiculous and rash acts of wretches whose day are numbered.'' </P>
