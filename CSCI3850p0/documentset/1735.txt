<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Finance ministers and central bankers from the world's richest countries met Saturday determined to ensure economic recovery starts cutting unemployment and to try to calm jittery financial markets. </P>
<P> But the meeting of the Group of Seven risked being overshadowed by a threatened trade war between the United States and Japan after a midnight EDT deadline expired without a breakthrough. </P>
<P> U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said before he met Japanese officials in Madrid, ``We are continuing to press for the opening of these markets.'' </P>
<P> The trade dispute, which has already upset currency markets, made it all the more important for the G7 -- the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada -- to send the right signals to investors worried about rising interest rates. </P>
<P> The G7 ministers and central bank chiefs are expected to stress their determination to nip inflation in the bud before accelerating economic growth turns it into a major problem. </P>
<P> Both the U.S. and Britain have begun responding to potential economic overheating with higher interest rates and Germany's Finance Minister Theo Waigel said this was the right approach. </P>
<P> Ahead of the talks, on the sidelines of the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund, Waigel also made clear the G7 could help lower interest rates by cutting budget deficits. </P>
<P> ``Budget consolidation must be strengthened in all industrial countries,'' Waigel told reporters Saturday. </P>
<P> Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer's message to the markets was that inflation was not a problem in Germany but the central bank would react with usual rigour to any inflationary threat. </P>
<P> ``The inflation problem is never dead. It will always be there. We must always be alert, but at the moment I see no immediate inflationary fears in Germany,'' he said. </P>
<P> Interest rates have been rising because investors are worried that G7 governments might be so determined to keep their economies strong that they forget about the inflation problem. </P>
<P> Another top G7 priority this weekend is finding a common response to an IMF call to pump $50 billion into the world economy via an issue of its currency, the Special Drawing Right. </P>
<P> Germany vehemently opposes the plan, which it says is not necessary and could be dangerously inflationary. </P>
<P> But Bonn has accepted a joint U.S.//British proposal to issue about $24 billion of SDRs aimed at providing liquidity to 37 new IMF members, mainly former communist countries in east Europe. </P>
<P> The G7 is likely to accept the compromise, but Waigel flatly ruled out going beyond it and said there was no way the G7 could accept the SDR issue for all 179 IMF members as the IMF wants. </P>
<P> It was still not clear before the talks whether the G7 would issue a communique but officials indicated individual ministers would hold verbal briefings. </P>
<P> That would relieve the G7 of the problem of finding a common position on currencies, which only Japan seems worried about. </P>
<P> Tokyo is looking for action to push down the value of the yen whose rise is threatening the fragile Japanese recovery. </P>
<P> But Japan's G7 partners are less worried. Tietmeyer said, ``All in all, there is no special cause for concern about the present situation on foreign exchange markets.'' </P>
<P> The G7 will be joined later in the talks by officials from Russia and Ukraine. The rich West has stressed it will push for tough economic reform in return for its financial support. </P>
