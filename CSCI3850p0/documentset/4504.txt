<P> Release at 5 p.m.  Influenza outbreaks struck nursing homes in New York state but this winter remains a typical flu season, federal health experts said Thursday. </P>
<P> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the first outbreak of the flu season occurred at a 300-bed nursing home on Long Island in late November. Since then, influenza outbreaks have been seen in 46 other nursing homes in New York state, including 16 on Long Island. </P>
<P> This winter's flu vaccine protects against the type-A and type-B influenza, which are the only two strains seen so far this season around the United States, the CDC said. </P>
<P> After eight residents in one wing of the 300-bed Long Island nursing home came down with flu-like symptoms, anti-viral agents were given to the rest of the elderly residents, in accordance with federal recommendations. The quick response meant that only six other people developed flu-like illnesses. </P>
<P> While the flu vaccine prevents illness in young, healthy adults 70 to 90 percent of the time, it is only 30 to 40 percent effective in preventing flu in nursing home residents, the CDC said. </P>
<P> Despite the reduced effectiveness of the vaccine in elderly persons, the CDC said this year's flu vaccine still reduces complications and hospitalization of nursing home residents more than half of the time. It is also up to 80 percent effective in preventing those in nursing homes from dying because of flu-like illnesses. </P>
