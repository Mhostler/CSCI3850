<P>  An American oil trader sacrificed his hair for hunger in a $2,000 haircut paid by co-workers during a local food drive Friday. </P>
<P> Rich Maloof, of the BP oil company, offered to have his head shaved if co-workers chipped in $500 for the annual charity event. They ended up pooling together $2,000. </P>
<P> ``It's weird. I think I'll be carrying a ballcap in my briefcase for a couple of weeks,'' said the 34-year-old who had his head shaved before hundreds of spectators. </P>
<P> BP had set up a soup kitchen lunchtime Friday in the atrium of its downtown headquarters and took donations from area restaurants, a bakery and a soft drink bottler. </P>
<P> People bought samples of oxtail soup, chicken chili and smoked pork tenderloin soup with dumplings. Airline and concert tickets and other prizes were also raffled for the charity, Harvest for Hunger. </P>
<P> Harvest for Hunger is an annual Cleveland and Akron area food drive that was established to help some 400 hunger centers, said BP spokeswoman Vivan Davis. </P>
<P> The U.S. unit of British Petroleum Co Plc raised $16,408 for the charity. </P>
