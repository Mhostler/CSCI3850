<P>  President Clinton Monday expressed sympathies to the family of an American woman who died of her wounds from a suicide bombing in the Gaza Strip. </P>
<P> Aliza Flatow, 20, of West Orange, N.J., was on leave in the Holy Land from her junior year at Brandeis University in Massachusetts. She died Monday of wounds suffered during one of two Gaza Strip suicide bombings Sunday that killed a total of eight people, including seven Israeli soldiers. </P>
<P> White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Clinton expressed his deepest sympathies and condolences to the family and friends of Flatow and praises the family's courage. </P>
<P> He said Clinton also stressed that ``this death is a poignant reminder that the enemies of peace sometimes know no boundaries as they inflict their terrorist outrages on those who seek peace and seek to live in peace.'' </P>
<P> ``The president is all the more determined now to support those who are attempting to bring a comprehensive, lasting and just peace to all the peoples of the Middle East,'' he said. </P>
<P> On Sunday an Islamic militant crashed a car full of explosives into a bus carrying soldiers and civilians near Kfar Darom Jewish settlement and another guerrilla ran a car loaded with explosives into an Israeli convoy at Netzarim settlement. </P>
<P> Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the Kfar Darom attack. Hamas said it carried out the Netzarim bombing. </P>
