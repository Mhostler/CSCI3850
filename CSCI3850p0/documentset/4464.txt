<P>  When President Clinton meets Prime Minister Jean Chretien this week in Ottawa, the angry sparks generated in Canada in 1988 by the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement will be but a dim memory. </P>
<P> And why shouldn't it be? Trade between Canada and the United States soared more than 40 percent in the first five years of the free trade accord. </P>
<P> Gordon Ritchie, Canada's negotiator of the agreement, recalls being lambasted as a Judas and being told by a screaming protester: ``You sold out your country for 30 pieces of silver.'' </P>
<P> ``There was an astonishingly high level of tension in the debate,'' said Ritchie, now chief executive of the Ottawa consulting firm Strategico, who vivdly remembers the ordeal. ``A lot of it got very personal.'' </P>
<P> U.S. officials say Clinton's Feb. 23-24 visit to Canada will be a ``celebration'' of the special relationship between the two countries. </P>
<P> Canada posted a record trade surplus with the United States in 1994, which rose to C$28.4 billion ($20.3 billion) from C$19.7 billion ($14.1 billion) in 1993. </P>
<P> ``If you look at the trade numbers, they have obviously exploded,'' said Bill Merkin, a Washington-based trade analyst with Strategic Policy Inc. who was one of the main negotiators for the United States in the free trade negotiations. </P>
<P> Merkin said he sometimes chuckles at the controvery that arose over free trade in Canada. </P>
<P> ``It is a bit ironic that with all the hand wringing that it has turned out so well,'' he said. </P>
<P> Free trade was assailed at the time -- in what now looks like a great outpouring of national paranoia -- as the biggest sellout of the country by Canada's Conservative government. </P>
<P> The accord called for elimination of tariffs over 10 years but also tackled a number of non-tariff barriers while setting up a trade dispute settlement mechanism. </P>
<P> The Left, led by labor groups that staged large national protests, was worried that everything from Canada's supply of fresh water to its vaunted social programs were at stake in the accord. </P>
<P> But instead of cataclsym, Canadian business seemed to thrive under the deal. Companies restructured to fight new competition, but were also helped by the low Canadian dollar and a recovery in the United States. </P>
<P> ``It did require a lot of restructuring in Canadian manufacturing,'' said Murray Smith, an analyst with the Ottawa think tank, Center for Trade Policy and Law. </P>
<P> He said Canadian business ran up a bill importing more machinery and other products but then began turning out more finished manufactured goods for export. </P>
<P> Foreign investors also poured money into Canada looking to gain unfettered access to the United States under the pact. Toyota Motor Corp., for example, recently announced a C$600 million ($450 million) expansion of its plant in Ontario with the aim of exporting more cars to the United States. </P>
<P> Canada's export boom helped lift the country from a deep recession in the early 1990s, and economists say it is the bright spot in an economy where domestic demand remains weak. </P>
<P> Canada's Liberal government, which campaigned against free trade in opposition, has come full circle on free trade, backing the accord's expanion last year to include Mexico. </P>
<P> Chretien has been evangelical in support for NAFTA, as the new deal is called, looking to include other South America nations in the agreement as well. There has been talk that European nations could be asked to join it as well. </P>
<P> But not everyone is convinced free trade is the panacea for all Canadians. </P>
<P> Maude Barlow, head of the nationalist Council of Canadians, remains staunchly opposed to the accord, believing it enriched corporations while actually hurting workers in the long run. </P>
<P> ``Your exports from Canada can look good if you clear cut a forest, but is that good for the forest?'' she asks. </P>
