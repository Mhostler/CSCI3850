<P>  Serb forces launched an air raid on the U.N. ``safe area'' of Bihac Friday as they pressed a relentless assault against Bosnian government troops, U.N. spokesmen said. </P>
<P> U.N. officials said the Serb planes hit the Muslim-held town in northwestern Bosnia with a missile, a napalm bomb and a cluster bomb. No casualties were reported by U.N. observers on the ground. </P>
<P> In Tuzla, two children were killed and two other people were wounded in a shelling attack on the north Bosnian town of Tuzla, Muslim-controlled Sarajevo radio reported. </P>
<P> U.N. officers could not immediately confirm the attack on the town, which is a U.N.-designated ``safe area.'' </P>
<P> Spokesman Paul Risley said of the Bihac air raid, it ``was a pure violation of a U.N. safe area. We are discussing a response to that.'' </P>
<P> A missile also struck the Bosnian parliament building in Sarajevo, a day after a similar assault on the offices of the Bosnian president, which U.N. officers blamed on Serb forces. </P>
<P> The secretary-general of the Bosnian Federation parliament, Avdo Campara, told Reuters he was in his office when the missile exploded and narrowly escaped injury from flying glass. </P>
<P> The United Nations called the missile attack on the government building ``outrageous.'' But the Bosnian Serb army chief, Gen. Ratko Mladic, snubbed a request by the U.N. force commander to discuss the city's deteriorating security. </P>
<P> The Bihac air raid coincided with U.N. reports that street fighting had erupted to the north in the town of Velika Kladusa, where rebel Muslim troops allied with Serb forces had advanced in the northern part of enclave. </P>
<P> A U.N. spokesman said the rebel Muslims loyal to renegade leader Fikret Abdic were fighting Bosnian government soldiers within Velika Kladusa in a thrust that threatened to sever the government-held enclave. </P>
<P> U.N. spokesman Col. Jan-Dirk Merveldt said two jets had been spotted flying at a height of 650 feet over Bihac. </P>
<P> One fired a missile and U.N. military observers, or UNMOs, found evidence that a napalm and a cluster bomb had been used, but the United Nations said no casualties had been caused. </P>
<P> Merveldt said the Serb jets had clearly targeted a government army barracks within the safe area but only damaged an old warehouse and football field. </P>
<P> The United Nations has threatened to call in NATO air power if the U.N.-declared ``safe area'' of Bihac is attacked. </P>
<P> Risley added, ``We made it clear yesterday an attack on a safe haven would lead inevitably to the use of NATO air power.'' </P>
<P> NATO sources, however, said the alliance's AWACS surveillance planes monitoring the NATO no-fly zone over Bosnia had failed to detect the raid. </P>
<P> Western military sources said the Serb aircraft were able to slip away after the attack because NATO, which has expended huge resources on enforcing the no-fly zone, did not have a combat patrol in the area. </P>
<P> The last air attack on Bihac, on Nov. 9, in which an ammunition dump was destroyed, was carried out by a Serb ground-attack jet which took off from Croatia. </P>
<P> Bosnian media said Friday's raid was carried out by two or three Serb jets which took off from Udbina in Croatia. </P>
<P> Earlier in the day, a sniper killed a 7-year-old boy and seriously wounded his mother near the city's Holiday Inn, further undermining a shaky truce in the Bosnian capital. </P>
<P> Fighting in Bihac and a disturbing rise in shooting and shelling in Sarajevo prompted fears that all of Bosnia could soon plunge back into all-out war. </P>
<P> France and Britain agreed Friday to warn the United States they would have to withdraw their troops from Bosnia if it took further steps to undermine a U.N. arms embargo, a French spokesman said. </P>
<P> The controversy was not expected to die, however, as the Pentagon reported that the Clinton administration has given Congress plans to unilaterally lift the embargo and provide up to $5 billion in military aid to the Bosnian Muslims. </P>
