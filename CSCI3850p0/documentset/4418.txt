<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  An American balloonist took off from South Korea early Saturday in an attempt to make what he said would be the first solo balloon crossing of the Pacific Ocean. </P>
<P> The balloon took off on its 5,500 mile journey from Seoul's Olympic Stadium before dawn Saturday piloted by Steve Fossett, 50, a stockbroker from Chicago. </P>
<P> Fosset told reporters shortly before takeoff that he aimed to reach San Francisco within four days and that the flight was to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Korea's liberation from Japanese colonial rule. </P>
<P> ``The flight will celebrate the 50th anniversary of Korea's independence and American cooperation in securing the independence,'' Fossett said. </P>
<P> The specially designed balloon, 52 feet in diameter and 98 feet high, weighs more than two metric tons -- including the pilot's gondola with fuel and supplies. It will fly at speeds of up to 75 mph at an altitude of between 19,000 and 39,000 feet, the flight organizers said. </P>
<P> Fossett will use an oxygen mask during the flight. Among his supplies are 30 1.5-liter bottles of water and ``specially prepared'' foods, the domestic news agency Yonhap said. </P>
<P> Fossett plans to maintain radio communications with Korean and U.S. meteorological agencies during the flight. </P>
<P> He said the weather conditions for the take-off were very good, with light winds in Seoul. </P>
<P> ``We are looking forward to an excellent flight,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``This is a dangerous flight and there's a lot to worry about but we have made careful preparations.'' </P>
<P> The Korean-U.S. organizing committee plans another balloon flight by a Korean pilot on the same route on Aug. 15, the date of Korea's independence in 1945 from 36 years of Japanese colonial rule. </P>
