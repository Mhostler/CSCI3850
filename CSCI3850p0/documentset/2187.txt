<P>  Former presidential candidate Ross Perot predicted Sunday that sanctions against Iraq would be lifted soon to reward Saddam Hussein for boosting President Clinton's popularity just before the November elections. </P>
<P> ``Clinton owes Hussein a big one for moving Iraqi troops down to the border just before our election (and) standing there until Clinton told him to go home,'' Perot said during his weekly radio show. </P>
<P> ``The real question is ... what will Hussein's reward be for propping Clinton up during the November elections?'' he continued. ``Sanctions will be lifted in the next few months and Iraq will be shipping oil again.'' </P>
<P> Thousands of Iraqi troops had moved into the area bordering Kuwait earlier this month, but retreated when the United States sent troops to the region. </P>
<P> Shortly after the withdrawal Iraqi officials asked the United Nations to lift its ban on Iraqi oil exports, one of several economic sanctions imposed as a result of Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. </P>
<P> Perot also accused Clinton of planning a trip to the Middle East next week in order to further boost his popularity ratings. </P>
<P> ``This is a carefully orchestrated trip shortly before the November election,'' the Dallas billionaire told listeners of his national call-in show. ``The American people should understand why this trip is being made at this time.'' </P>
<P> On the topic of Haiti, Perot said he planned to look into the cases of three U.S. soldiers who the military said had committed suicide while on active duty in Haiti. </P>
<P> ``A number of enlisted men in Haiti, who were in the same units with the men who have died, are telling the press that their comrades were killed and did not commit suicide,'' he said. ``We will make sure the record is straight before it's over. That's the least we can do.'' </P>
