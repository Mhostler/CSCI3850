<P>  Phil Mickelson carded seven birdies in the first 10 holes at Tucson National Golf Course Thursday for a seven-under-par 65 and a share of the first-round lead with Tom Purtzer at the Northern Telecom Open. </P>
<P> One stroke behind in score, but two strokes back in relation to par, was Howard Twitty, who shot a 66 at the par-71 Starr Pass course. </P>
<P> The $1.25 million event is being contested over two courses for the first two rounds. Those who survive the cut will play the final two rounds on the par-72 Tucson National layout. </P>
<P> Mickelson, who won as an amateur here in 1991, got off to a blistering start with four consecutive birdies. He picked up three more strokes with successive birdies on holes eight through 10. </P>
<P> ``I drove the ball well and kept in play. I only missed one green by a wide margin, so I gave myself some good opportunities,'' Mickelson said. </P>
<P> When Mickelson won this event at age 20, he beat Purtzer by a stroke after Purtzer double bogeyed the final hole. </P>
<P> Purtzer went on to win two tournaments later that year, but he is looking for his first title since 1991. </P>
<P> Purtzer picked up five of his seven strokes on Tucson National's four par-five holes. He eagled the second hole, sending a 1-iron second shot to 15 feet, and birdied the other three long holes. </P>
<P> ``My stats were really bad on par fives last year, so I made a concerted effort to play them better,'' Purtzer said. ``That's where you should make up all your ground.'' </P>
<P> Britain's Nick Faldo, making his return after a five-year absence as a member of the U.S. PGA Tour, shot a one-under 70 at Starr Pass. </P>
<P> ``I'm very disappointed,'' said Faldo after he bogeyed the final hole. ``It's the same old problem with the putter. I played alright, just hit a couple of bad shots.'' </P>
