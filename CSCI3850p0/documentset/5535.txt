<P>  About 120 people suffering from anxiety disorders triumphed over terror Thursday to attend a national conference of people whose fears can be so intense they cannot leave home. </P>
<P> ``For these people, the idea of getting on an airplane would be equal to climbing Mount Everest,'' said Jerilyn Ross, president of the Anxiety Disorders Association of America. </P>
<P> ``It is exciting to see people get strength by knowing they would be among others suffering from similar disorders.'' </P>
<P> About 600 clinicians, researchers and patients are attending the AADA's 15th National Conference this week. </P>
<P> Ross, psychotherapist author of a book called ``Triumph Over Fear'', is a former sufferer of anxiety disorder, a mental illness which afflicts about 23 million Americans. </P>
<P> While symptoms differ, patients share fears as physically and emotionally terrifying as being trapped in a burning building. </P>
<P> People with agoraphobia, a common anxiety disorder, spend years avoiding places where they have panic attacks until they're afraid to leave their houses or even a single room. </P>
<P> During panic attacks, patients say they feel like they're losing their minds amid an overwhelming sense of doom. Fears they might lose control and do something embarrassing or harmful, like scream uncontrollably or jump out of a moving car, are also common. </P>
<P> Loss of productivity due to anxiety disorders cost the U.S. $35.4 billion in 1990, according to a study conducted by the Institute on Behavior and Health. </P>
<P> Ross said progress in treating these disorders through therapy and new medications have enabled about 60-90 percent of patients to resume normal lives. </P>
<P> ``Two years ago, a woman who hadn't left her home in eight years came to our conference, which was held in South Carolina,'' Ross said. ``I worked with her for three months prior to the conference. She's doing very well now,'' she said. </P>
<P> The AADA released a survey Thursday of Pittsburgh-area residents which found that fewer men than women were likely to take anxiety disorders seriously. ``The truth is that panic disorder is a medical illness caused at least in part by a chemical imbalance in the brain,'' Ross said. </P>
<P> New York-based psychologist Catherine Riggs-Bergesen said conferences were a good way to treat these disorders. </P>
<P> ``Society's non-acceptance of persons with anxiety-based disorders has reinforced these individuals' non-acceptance of themselves. Being gathered in groups is incredibly reinforcing and therapeutic,'' she said. </P>
