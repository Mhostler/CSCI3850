<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Poland's ruling left-wing coalition agreed Tuesday on a program for a new government headed by parliamentary Speaker Jozef Oleksy. </P>
<P> But the coalition has failed so far to strike a deal with President Lech Walesa over key cabinet posts. </P>
<P> Oleksy, picked up by the coalition to replace Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak after a demand from Walesa, said earlier he still needed a compromise with the president over appointments of three key ministers. </P>
<P> A coalition statement said the prospective prime minister confirmed he would try to form a cabinet following hours of talks between Oleksy's senior Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) and the Polish Peasant Party (PSL). </P>
<P> It said the two parties also agreed a division of posts within the future cabinet. It gave no details but PAP said Oleksy would immediately start talks with potential ministers. </P>
<P> ``During coalition talks Tuesday a program of the government of Jozef Oleksy was agreed as well as principles of cooperation between the two partners,'' it said. </P>
<P> Walesa, having brought a collapse of the current premier Pawlak, insisted Tuesday that Oleksy accept his nominees for the key defense, foreign affairs and interior ministries. </P>
<P> ``The president will not agree to candidates other than those selected by him,'' Walesa's spokesman Leszek Spalinski told the public Trojka radio station. </P>
<P> A fight over the defense and foreign ministries was a central issue in Walesa's campaign to oust Pawlak, who decided last week to resign after Walesa threatened to dissolve parliament to remove his cabinet. </P>
<P> Oleksy, picked by the ruling left-wing coalition to replace Pawlak, spoke with Walesa early Tuesday but no agreement on the three controversial posts had been reached. </P>
<P> His party colleague and leader of the SLD told reporters before the coalition meeting that he hoped Walesa might allow the new cabinet to be born. </P>
<P> ``I would like to believe that the president, who has said at frequent meetings that he wants an effective government, will not torpedo its formation,'' Aleksander Kwasniewski said. </P>
<P> Under Poland's interim constitution, in force until a full post-communist system is worked out, Walesa has a say in appointing the three ministers. </P>
<P> He accused Pawlak's government of trying to take away this right and the conflict has kept the defense ministry vacant since November. </P>
<P> Walesa and Pawlak also reached stalemate over a new foreign minister to replace Andrzej Olechowski, an associate of Walesa, who quit last month saying the prime minister was undermining his policy abroad. </P>
<P> PAP news agency said Walesa's candidate to replace Olechowski was another presidential aide Andrzej Ananicz, former deputy foreign minister. </P>
<P> For defense the president proposed Zbigniew Okonski, a non-party candidate the coalition has previously rejected. </P>
<P> The only uncontroversial candidate offered by Walesa is the present interior minister, Andrzej Milczanowski. </P>
