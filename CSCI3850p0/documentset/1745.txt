<DATELINE>KATALE CAMP, Zaire (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The frail Rwandan women with babies on their backs waited for hours at the distribution point for a food handout that never came. </P>
<P> Then they trudged back through biting rain, past children playing in the mud, to their homes -- tiny domes of sticks and plastic sheeting. </P>
<P> ``It is not our fault, what has happened,'' said one, shivering with cold as the rain filtered through gaps in her igloo-like roof. </P>
<P> Baffled by events, she huddled in a blanket donated from abroad. </P>
<P> ``We are hungry,'' she said. ``We are afraid our children are going to go hungry and we want them to start food distribution again.'' </P>
<P> By ``them'' she meant the 80 or 90 foreign aid workers who left the camp on Friday after a series of threats against their lives, the most brutal of which was the murder of one of their local helpers whose body was dumped outside their quarters. </P>
<P> To aid agencies, struggling to care for 850,000 refugees from Rwanda's Hutu majority who flooded into eastern Zaire in July, Katale Camp, 30 miles north of the border town of Goma, has become a no-go zone ruled by bandits. </P>
<P> ``Uncontrolled elements are still in control of the camp,'' Lyndall Sachs, spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee service UNHCR said Saturday as representatives from a full roster of the world's crisis agencies met 10 miles further north to debate their plans. </P>
<P> Reporters visiting Katale late Saturday saw no visible signs of tension. No roadblocks. No harassment from Hutu militiamen with their dreaded machetes. </P>
<P> Small traders hawked sugar, salt, clothes, shoes and relief agency blankets. </P>
<P> Rwandan nurses, employed by the aid agencies, carried on their work. </P>
<P> The relief workers' compound had not been looted, as the agencies feared it would be when they left. But there were no food handouts for the women lining up at the distribution points. </P>
<P> ``I don't know why the aid workers withdrew,'' said Joseph Nduwa'zu, a Rwandan working for UNHCR. ``I think it was a misunderstanding.'' </P>
<P> ``In my opinion there was no reason to halt operations. Things are going on normally as before.'' </P>
<P> ``It was an overreaction,'' chimed in another local aid worker. </P>
<P> The agencies say that seven separate aid workers had their lives threatened before the decision to pull out was made. </P>
<P> Those that withdrew from Katale include UNHCR, Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors without Borders), the German Red Cross, Oxfam, Concern, Assist and Care Australia. Swedish and South Korean aid workers also left. </P>
<P> According to refugees, the threats which put the agencies to flight were linked to the issue of return -- still the most explosive issue in the Rwandan crisis. </P>
<P> Even separate arms of the United Nations are at odds over the question: should Hutu refugees go home to a land now controlled by the Tutsi, the minority tribe whose members were the main victims of a mass slaughter by Hutu soldiers and militiamen in April and May? Is it safe for them to go? </P>
<P> Some 28,000 defeated soldiers and militiamen who fled with the refugees have used threats and force to keep them in Zaire. </P>
<P> People in the camp say the local scout whose body was dumped outside the foreign aid workers' compound Wednesday was killed by refugees who believed that UNHCR trucks were arriving to take them home by force. </P>
<P> UNHCR spokeswoman Sachs says the trucks were sent to move a refugee market to a site away from the main road. </P>
