<DATELINE>NEW YORK (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA's political wing Sinn Fein, said Thursday that Britain has been pressuring the White House to keep him from meeting with President Clinton. </P>
<P> But a White House official said there were never any plans for Adams to meet with Clinton and denied the administration was being pressured by London. </P>
<P> ``There is a battle going on by the British to make sure we don't get into the White House,'' Adams said during a breakfast with members of the Irish American Labor Coalition. ``We don't know yet today whether we will see the administration.'' </P>
<P> A spokesman for Adams said meetings with ``lower-level White House aides'' are scheduled for Monday, but there has been no word on whether Adams would meet Clinton. </P>
<P> ``We have until Monday to change the situation,'' an aide to Adams said. </P>
<P> The White House official said: ``There's never been any contemplation of Gerry Adams meeting with the president or vice president or anyone else at the White House. </P>
<P> ``If a meeting were to be held, it would be at the State Department working level, but no decision has been made on that,'' the official said. </P>
<P> The official also said that while the White House is in consultation with the British government on the Northern Ireland peace process, Adams was not being kept away from the White House due to any pressure from London. </P>
<P> Adams is on a nine city, two-week tour of the United States, a month after the Irish Republican Army (IRA) declared a cease-fire in its 25-year war against British rule of Northern Ireland. </P>
<P> ``I'm sure the administration will deal with us in a fair manner,'' Adams said. </P>
<P> He would not say how the British were preventing him from meeting with Clinton next week. </P>
<P> A spokesman at the British consulate in New York was not immediately available for comment. </P>
<P> ``We do know that they worked very hard to stop me from coming to this country and they failed to do that. So let's make sure they fail again,'' Adams said. </P>
<P> ``This has nothing to do with the British government. It's an American issue and citizens here should ask the British government to butt out,'' he said. </P>
<P> On Wednesday, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said that Adams should be greeted by Clinton when he visits Washington. </P>
