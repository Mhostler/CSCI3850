<P>  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin complained to President Clinton Thursday of a plan in the House of Representatives that would cut funding for Jordan's debt forgiveness, the White House said. </P>
<P> White House spokesman Mike McCurry said that in a phone conversation with Clinton, the Israeli prime minister was ''upset and somewhat alarmed'' by a House subcommittee's vote to cut U.S. debt forgiveness of Jordan from $275 million during this budget year down to $50 million. </P>
<P> The Clinton administration's decision to forgive Jordan's debt helped lead King Hussein to agree to a peace treaty with Israel last year. </P>
<P> Rabin told Clinton that it would be harmful to the Middle East peace process for the United States to renege on its commitments, McCurry said. </P>
<P> Clinton replied he would do everything he could to work with moderates in the Senate to block the action if it passes the House. </P>
<P> ``The president told the prime minister in all candor that we face a very tough audience now on Capitol Hill,'' McCurry said, telling reporters that the House subcommittee action was another example of isolationism creeping into American politics -- a subject of a major speech by Clinton Wednesday night. </P>
<P> He said those who oppose the funding should ask themselves how much more expensive it would be to ``prepare for war'' in the Middle East than nurture bonds of peace developing between Israel and its Arab neighbors. </P>
<P> He said Clinton hoped to speak with King Hussein by phone later in the day. </P>
<P> In addition, Clinton met Thursday with the Saudi foreign minister, Prince Saud, to discuss the Middle East peace process. </P>
<P> McCurry said the two leaders discussed specifically the need to provide assistance and support to the Palestinians as they begin to accept their responsibilities under the 1993 peace accord between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization. </P>
<P> They also discussed the need for maintaining tough post-Gulf War sanctions against Iraq and efforts to reach peace between Israel and Syria. </P>
<P> Clinton thanked the prince for Saudi King Fahd's reaffirmation of Saudi Arabia's commitment to ending the Arab economic boycott of Israel, McCurry said. </P>
