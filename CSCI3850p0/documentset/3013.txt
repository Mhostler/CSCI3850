<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A rare northern right whale that took a wrong turn up the Delaware River was headed back toward sea Monday, but marine experts said they were puzzled by reports of a new whale sighting in nearby Maryland. </P>
<P> The new whale, of an undetermined species, was reported Monday to be heading down the Susquehanna River near Havre de Grace, Maryland, where the river enters the Chesapeake Bay, said Kim Thounhurst of the National Marine Fisheries Service. </P>
<P> ``There have been a lot of sightings of whales in the past week in places that aren't used to seeing whales,'' she told a news conference. ``We don't know what's going on.'' </P>
<P> A whale sighting was also reported Friday in the canal linking the Chesapeake and Delaware bays in northeastern Maryland, and a humpback whale was spotted Saturday in the Potomac River, Thounhurst said. </P>
<P> At least two whales and possibly up to four are involved in the four sightings. </P>
<P> ``It may just be an extraordinary coincidence that we have two different species in two different river systems next to one another,'' Charles Mayo of the Center for Coastal Studies in Provincetown, Mass., told the news conference. </P>
<P> But any additional whales would force scientists to ask what was causing the animals to swim off course, Mayo said. </P>
<P> He said humpback whales typically migrate southward around this time of year, but the movements of right whales are less distinct and understood. </P>
<P> A right whale, believed to be the same one that spent the weekend swimming and spouting along the Philadelphia waterfront about 80 miles from the open ocean, was spotted by a tugboat pilot Monday near the mouth of the Delaware River as it enters the Delaware Bay, Thounhurst said. </P>
<P> ``If the sightings that we've had today are confirmed, we think the animal seems to have oriented itself, turned south and gone down the Delaware River into the bay,'' Thounhurst said. </P>
<P> New Jersey marine police and other rescue workers would continue to monitor that whale's progress. </P>
<P> Amy Knowlton, a scientist at the New England Aquarium in Boston, said the right whale that visited Philadelphia was probably born in 1991. That is older than first thought, and, while still a juvenile, mature enough for the whale to navigate on its own. </P>
<P> Officials said the main danger to the whale now is probably shipping traffic in the busy Delaware Bay. </P>
<P> ``One of the concerns that you have -- particularly with right whales -- is that an animal may in fact be hit by a ship. It is one of the major causes of mortality for right whales,'' he said. </P>
<P> There are only about 350 right whales in the North Atlantic region, and a smaller number live in northern Pacific Oceans. Greater numbers of right whales live in southern oceans, Wilkinson said. </P>
<P> Northern right whales reach 55 feet in length when mature and feed on small marine life, which they strain through bony plates of baleen in its mouth. </P>
