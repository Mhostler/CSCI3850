<P>  The office of Colombia's prosecutor general Monday confirmed the authenticity of telephone recordings that suggest President-elect Ernesto Samper received drug money for his election campaign. </P>
<P> ``The authenticity of the voices ... has been proven,'' an office spokeswoman told Reuters, referring to the telephone conversations between a local journalist and leaders of the Cali cartel recorded on two audio tapes. </P>
<P> A third tape was sent anonymously to news organizations Sunday with yet another telephone conversation but the prosecutor general's office has yet to examine it. The conversation on the tape alludes to contributions being made to Samper's campaign but not to his main rival, Conservative Andres Pastrana. </P>
<P> A clandestine group calling itself Honorable Colombians has claimed responsibility for the recordings, saying it wants to make public the truth about supposed collaboration between local politicians and drug traffickers. </P>
<P> Alberto Giraldo, the local journalist whose voice appears on the first two tapes, acknowledged being an intermediary for the Cali cartel. But he said their offer to contribute to the campaign of either candidate had been rejected. </P>
<P> Samper, who narrowly won elections June 19, has denied accepting drug money and has asked the prosecutor general's office to search his campaign accounts for any evidence of illicit contributions. He has pledged to fire anyone who might have accepted such a contribution without the party leader's knowledge. </P>
<P> Samper is traveling in Europe and is expected to return to Colombia at the end of July. </P>
