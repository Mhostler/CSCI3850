<P>  Russian President Boris Yeltsin's trip to the United States was causing talk at home Tuesday -- not because of what he told the United Nations but because of whom he left behind. </P>
<P> The 63-year-old Russian leader sparked reports of dark Kremlin intrigue after he unexpectedly left a circle of close aides high and dry in Moscow as he headed for the United States. </P>
<P> Chief among the protocol casualties were Yeltsin's acerbic press service chief Vyacheslav Kostikov, who normally shadows his master's every step during trips abroad. </P>
<P> Izvestia, a respected and well-informed daily, said the names of Kostikov and several other key advisers including his speechwriter were struck from the official party list at the last moment. </P>
<P> ``According to established practice, nobody has the right to do this without the knowledge of the president,'' Izvestia commentator Vasily Kononenko wrote in an article in which he suggested that a sinister battle for the ear of the president was under way. </P>
<P> Kostikov, a 54-year-old former journalist who has tenaciously defended Yeltsin since being named to head his press team in May 1992, could not be reached for comment Tuesday. </P>
<P> But Izvestia quoted him as saying darkly: ``There are reasons why the president decided to leave me here at this time.'' </P>
<P> The make-up of the team advising Yeltsin on his Washington trip has assumed significance in the light of his visit to Germany earlier this month during which he behaved erratically. </P>
<P> He stumbled on the steps of Berlin city hall after a champagne lunch, seized a conductor's baton to direct an orchestra and, on another occasion, grabbed a microphone and sang tunelessly. </P>
<P> Izvestia made no mention of the Germany trip, in which Yeltsin oversaw the withdrawal of the last Russian troops from Berlin, beyond saying it was ``underproductive.'' </P>
<P> In an article redolent of the intrigue of the tsarist court, it saw the snub to Kostikov and others as evidence of a struggle among advisers to exert influence over Yeltsin ahead of the presidential elections due to take place in June 1996. </P>
<P> Nobody is yet certain that Yeltsin will run for re-election though Kostikov has suggested he may. </P>
<P> ``In the president's camp a split has either begun to take shape or has taken place,'' it said. </P>
<P> Izvestia saw a central figure in the maneuvering as Viktor Ilyushin, a close ally of Yeltsin since his days as a communist party boss in Sverdlovsk (now Yekaterinburg) and the Kremlin chief's number one aide. </P>
<P> The newspaper portrayed Ilyushin as leader of a group of advisers promoting the political rise of erstwhile Yeltsin allies increasingly sympathetic to the hard-line opposition. </P>
<P> ``In the president's camp two camps have formed -- the democratic one which is in disfavor and the Ilyushin group which long ago learned how to talk to the president and more importantly knows how to make him feel comfortable in power,'' it said. </P>
<P> Other close aides said to be out of favor were Dmitry Ryurikov, Yeltsin's adviser on foreign affairs, economic consultant Alexander Livshits, Georgy Satarov, in charge of relations with parliament, Yuri Baturin, security adviser, and speechwriter Lyudmila Pikhoya. </P>
