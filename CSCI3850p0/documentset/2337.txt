<P>  Three Western hostages were executed by their Khmer Rouge captors and their remains have been exhumed as evidence, Cambodia's Second Prime Minister Hun Sen said Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``Today, I would like to report the deaths of the three Westerners. The three are dead -- they were killed by the Khmer Rouge,'' Hun Sen said in the southern town of Kampot. </P>
<P> The remains of the three were exhumed Tuesday from graves discovered near Vine Mountain in southern Kampot province. </P>
<P> ``The Khmer Rouge detained them from the train ambush and then they killed them. This means clearly the Khmer Rouge are murderers of the Cambodian people and they now kill foreigners too,'' Hun Sen said. </P>
<P> Briton Mark Slater, 28, Jean-Michel Braquet, 27, from France and David Wilson, 29, an Australian, were taken hostage by the Khmer Rouge July 26 after a train ambush in southern Kampot province in which 13 people were killed. </P>
<P> Along with three ethnic Vietnamese and an unknown number of Cambodians, the three foreigners were marched at gunpoint to a Khmer Rouge base in nearby Vine Mountain, which is about 95 miles south of Phnom Penh. </P>
<P> Information Minister Ieng Mouly had announced earlier Tuesday the discovery of the graves believed to contain the bodies of the three Western hostages. </P>
<P> ``The Royal Cambodian Government regrets to announce that graves believed to contain the bodies of the three Western hostages were located Monday 31 October in the Vine Mountains in Kampot Province,'' he said in a statement. </P>
<P> Hun Sen said the remains recovered from the graves would be brought from Vine Mountain to Kampot town later Tuesday. He said a military guard had been posted at the site to protect the graves. </P>
<P> ``I would like to express my condolences to the fathers of the three and I would like to condemn those who killed the three abducted from the train,'' Hun Sen said. </P>
<P> Mouly said the embassies of Australia, Britain and France have been notified of the discovery and representatives were invited to attend the exhumation. </P>
<P> He said he believed the trio were executed ``around the 28th of September.'' </P>
<P> A senior Khmer Rouge defector told Reuters Sunday the three Westerners were killed on the orders of Gen. Noun Paet, the insurgent commander at Vine Mountain. </P>
<P> ``They were tied up and shot by AK-47. I've known this for a long time but (General Noun) Paet ordered my men to say they were sent to the border,'' he said. </P>
<P> The government was currently searching for Noun Paet, Mouly said. </P>
<P> ``He's refused to defect so we are searching for him, and if we capture him I think he must be punished,'' he said. </P>
<P> The Cambodian army last week seized Vine Mountain, but there was no sign of the hostages or of Paet, who was believed to have escaped west to more secure rebel-held areas. </P>
<P> Khmer Rouge defectors who took part in the train ambush but had since defected would be pardoned, he said. </P>
<P> There had been no word on the fate of the hostages since a videotape and a letter were received in Phnom Penh Sept. 2. </P>
<P> On Tuesday the British Embassy issued a toughly worded travel advisory requesting that their nationals avoid Cambodia because of its security problems. </P>
<P> ``The situation in Cambodia poses serious security risks. British visitors are advised not to visit the country,'' it said. </P>
<P> Britain condemned the killings as a barbaric outrage and said it would press Cambodia to bring those responsible to justice. </P>
<P> ``This tragic and senseless killing of an innocent British tourist in Cambodia is an outrage,'' Antony Baldry, parliamentary under-secretary of state at the Foreign Office said in a statement. </P>
<P> ``We shall press the Cambodian authorities to do everything in their power to ensure there are no further abductions of innocent foreign tourists and that the perpetrators of this appalling crime are brought to justice.'' </P>
