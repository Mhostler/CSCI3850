<P>  The struggling Philadelphia Flyers sent high scoring right-winger Mark Recchi to the Montreal Canadiens Thursday for veteran wingers Gilbert Dionne and John LeClair and defenseman Eric Desjardins. </P>
<P> The Flyers, who have only one win in their last five games, also sent a third-round pick in the 1995 entry draft to the Canadiens as part of the deal. </P>
<P> Recchi, who scored 107 points last season to lead the Flyers, had just two goals and three assists for five points in Philadelphia's first 10 games this year. </P>
<P> Desjardins, Dionne and LeClair all played significant roles in Montreal's last Stanley Cup in 1993. </P>
<P> Desjardins has six assists, Dionne has three assists and LeClair has one goal and four assists for five points in nine games this year. All three players are expected to be in uniform Thursday night when the Flyers host Florida. </P>
