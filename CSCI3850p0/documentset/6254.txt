<DATELINE>ATLANTA (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A hamstring injury and New Zealander Brett Steven combined to take sixth seed Aaron Krickstein out of the $328,000 AT&T Challenge tennis tournament Wednesday. </P>
<P> A frustrated Krickstein, who injured his right hamstring midway through the match, lost to the unseeded Steven 7-5, 6-2 in a second-round contest at the clay court tournament. </P>
<P> Second seed Michael Chang dismissed fellow American Wade McGuire 6-1, 6-2 in 60 minutes in another second round match. </P>
<P> Chang, ranked six in the world, powered in his serves, which were clocked as fast 121 miles per hour (195 kph) and never gave the 213-ranked McGuire a chance. </P>
<P> Fourth-seeded American Todd Martin rolled over German lefthander Karsten Braasch 6-2, 6-2 to join Chang and Steven in the quarter-finals. </P>
<P> Krickstein, ranked 40, took command early against 49th-ranked Steven, holding onto a break advantage until 5-4 when he failed to serve out the first set. </P>
<P> From there it was Steven who took charge, holding serve for 6-5 and breaking Krickstein again for the set with a backhand winner. </P>
<P> Krickstein, who has been plagued by injuries throughout his career, suffered the injury during the second game of the second set and it was all downhill from there. </P>
<P> ``My concentration wasn't that great in the second set due to the fact that I was disappointed I got hurt,'' said a downcast Krickstein. </P>
<P> ``Every week this year something's been wrong. I'll see how the rest of the year goes but I'm certainly not going to play another year if it goes on like this.'' </P>
