<P>  Cambodian army units and Khmer Rouge guerrillas Tuesday clashed over a section of a vital road link in the country's northwest. </P>
<P> Reuters, visiting the frontline position 23 miles south of Battambang, Cambodia's second largest city, was briefed by a senior officer about the clash. </P>
<P> Khmer Rouge forces had fired on government positions with heavy machine-guns and 100mm tank guns, said Gen. Meas Sopheap. </P>
<P> He did not give any details about casualties on either side but said government forces were preparing to smash through Khmer Rouge entrenchments on Route 10, a road connecting the guerrilla-held area around Pailin in the west and Battambang. </P>
<P> The government position was further reinforced Tuesday with the arrival of four new T-55 tanks. </P>
<P> Its position on Route 10 is defended by two 152mm howitzers and a truck-mounted multiple-rocket launcher. </P>
<P> Meas Sopheap said the Khmer Rouge in Treng were now surrounded on three sides by government forces. </P>
<P> On May 1, Khmer Rouge guerrillas attacked and overran a string of government positions in northwest Treng commune 25 miles south of Battambang. </P>
<P> Tuesday, the U.S. Embassy in Phnom Penh said it would donate 200,000 ration packs to the Cambodian Red Cross to help feed former Khmer Rouge guerrillas who have defected to the government and local people recently displaced by fighting in the northwest. </P>
