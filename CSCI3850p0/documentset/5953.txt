<P>  Pope John Paul said Sunday a spirit of forgiveness was needed to end what he called a spiral of hatred and violence. </P>
<P> ``Let us learn to forgive,'' the 74-year-old Pontiff told pilgrims in St. Peter's Square during his Angelus address. </P>
<P> ``The spiral of hatred and violence which bloodies the path of so many individuals and so many nations can be interrupted only by the miracle of forgiveness,'' he said. </P>
<P> The Pope did not refer to any specific conflict or incident. </P>
<P> He has spoken out frequently against ethnic and nationalist violence, including strife in Bosnia and Rwanda. </P>
<P> Last week, he told President Clinton in a message that last week's Oklahoma City bombing was an unspeakable crime. </P>
