<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Defense Secretary William Perry will seek new bilateral U.S. military ties with Pakistan and India on a visit to those South Asian nations next week, a senior Defense official said Wednesday. </P>
<P> Perry will also discuss the controversial issue of nuclear proliferation with leaders in Islamabad and New Delhi, but will not press them to reverse current course and join the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT), the official told reporters. </P>
<P> The official, who asked not to be identified, said Perry will instead discuss possible U.S. bilateral peacekeeping exercises and increased defense cooperation with India and Pakistan, and will urge those potential nuclear antagonists to be more open with each other about defense policies and budgets. </P>
<P> ``The purpose here is to build a defense relationship and build it on a new basis,'' stressed the official, noting that Perry will be the first U.S. Defense secretary to visit South Asia since Frank Carlucci in 1987 during the Cold War. </P>
<P> Perry will depart Washington for Egypt this Friday on a week-long trip to the Middle East and South Asia that includes stops in Israel, Pakistan and India in that order. </P>
<P> He will return home on Jan. 14. </P>
<P> South Asia has been an area of major concern to the United States since India exploded a nuclear device in 1974. Pakistan says it, too, has acquired the capability to make nuclear weapons but has not made a decision to do so. </P>
<P> But Islamabad says its nuclear program is peaceful and that it will not sign the NPT unless arch-foe India does the same. </P>
<P> ``We don't feel we are going to change anybody's mind about the NPT during the secretary's visit,'' said the Defense official, who added that Perry also did not intend to press Israel to join the NPT. </P>
<P> ``Proliferation is an important global issue. It is one that the United States has raised a number of times,'' the official said of Pakistan's nuclear program, including reports that China has supplied missile technology to Islamabad. </P>
<P> But ``it (proliferation) is not the central focus of Secretary Perry's trip. The purpose of his trip to South Asia is to build relationships,'' the official added. </P>
<P> In Pakistan, Perry plans to hold talks with Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, Defense Minister Aftab Shaaban Meerani, and other top officials. In India, he will meet Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao and government leaders. </P>
<P> The United States halted all military and new economic aid to Pakistan in 1990 over the nuclear issue and has refused to approve Pakistan's agreement to buy 71 U.S. F-16 fighter jets in the late 1980s at a cost of $1.4 billion. </P>
<P> The State Department warned China and Pakistan last September that they would face new U.S. economic sanctions if it was established that China had shipped M-11 nuclear-capable ballistic missles to Pakistan. </P>
<P> Asked Wednesday if the United States had proof that such missiles had been received by Islamabad, the Defense official told reporters, ``There are different levels of knowing things and not knowing things. Definitive proof is not there.'' </P>
<P> In Egypt and Israel, the official said, Perry will reaffirm close U.S. defense ties with the two countries, but will not inject himself into the troubled Middle East peace process. </P>
<P> Perry will discuss only ``in general terms'' an expected U.S. plan to provide some peacekeeping troops on the Golan Heights if a peace agreement is struck between Israel and Syria, the official added. </P>
