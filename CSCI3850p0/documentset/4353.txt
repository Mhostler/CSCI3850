<P>  President Ernesto Zedillo ordered the Mexican army Tuesday to halt its advance in the southern state of Chiapas and called on Indian rebels to lay down their arms as the government moved to end a 13-month-old peasant uprising. </P>
<P> At the same time Chiapas Governor Eduardo Robledo Rincon resigned, removing a key obstacle to peace talks with the self-styled Zapatista National Liberation Army. </P>
<P> Zedillo, speaking to indigenous groups in the national palace in Mexico City, said he would send an amnesty law to Congress Wednesday for rebels who wish to give up their arms. </P>
<P> He called upon the Zapatistas to seek a political solution to the crisis, which has wrenched Mexico since it began New Year's Day 1994. The rebels launched their insurgency for Indian rights and greater democracy. </P>
<P> ``Today I am giving precise instructions to the Attorney General's Office and the Mexican army that they not carry out any action which may provoke armed confrontation'' in Chiapas, Zedillo said. </P>
<P> ``The Mexican army will not take any offensive action and will restrict itself to patrols aimed at preventing acts of violence,'' he added. </P>
<P> The rebels said Sunday they were open to negotiations to end their uprising, but have insisted that Robledo, who is from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), had to step down before they would hold peace talks. Negotiations held last year had failed. </P>
<P> Robledo was elected governor in August elections that the rebels and the leftist Democratic Revolution Party (PRD) say were fraudulent. He took office Dec. 8, a week after Zedillo became president. </P>
<P> The Chiapas congress later voted in Julio Cesar Ruiz, a career PRI bureaucrat, as interim governor. PRD leader Porfirio Munoz Ledo told reporters in Mexico City that Robledo's departure was ``a good first step'' but that the jury was still out on whether it would bring peace to Chiapas. </P>
<P> In his resignation speech, Robledo acknowledged Chiapas had long been a place of injustice and poverty, but said the government was making efforts to change. </P>
<P> Speaking directly to the Zapatistas, he said: ``If your struggle has just causes, as many of us have recognized, it should be defended within the law.'' </P>
<P> He urged the Zapatistas to accept Zedillo's amnesty offer and called for San Cristobal de Las Casas Bishop Samuel Ruiz to resign his post. Ruiz has mediated the crisis, but recently has been accused of having links to the Zapatistas. </P>
<P> The resignation of Ruiz, Robledo said, would show ``that his true interest was always that of Chiapas.'' </P>
<P> Zedillo ordered the arrest last Thursday of key rebel leaders, including the masked Subcommander Marcos, and sent the military into rebel territory to capture them. </P>
<P> Some 2,500 troops, backed by tanks and armored vehicles, moved in without resistance as the Zapatistas fled to the mountains. They now hold most key towns once under rebel control. </P>
<P> Two leaders and several lower-ranking members of the rebel army have been arrested, but Marcos, who Zedillo said was actually Rafael Sebestian Guillen from a middle-class Mexican family, remains at large, very likely in a mountain stronghold out of reach of the army. </P>
<P> Zedillo ordered the arrests after the discovery of Zapatista arms caches in Mexico City and other locations that he said indicated the rebels would widen their war. </P>
<P> The rebels said Sunday the army had bombed two towns and committed human rights abuses as they moved in, but Zedillo said the claims were not true. Amnesty International USA said in Washington it had confirmed strafing attacks by the army. </P>
<P> Only two soldiers are known to have died in the offensive. At least 145 people died in fighting in January 1994 until a cease-fire that lasted until last week. </P>
