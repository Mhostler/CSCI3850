<P>  A U.S. congressman said on Thursday after a 10-day visit to Lebanon he considered it safe for American businessmen and tourists and would tell the State Department so when he got home. </P>
<P> Illinois Republican Ray Lahood, a Lebanese-American, said he was concerned by the continued enforcement of a 10-year U.S. travel ban imposed on Lebanon during the 1975-90 civil war. </P>
<P> ``I will tell the State Department that I think the government officials here have got their programme together, that they're working very hard, that they have good security, that I've seen the security. You know I travelled all over the country. </P>
<P> ``In my opinion it's a very hospitable country and I feel that it's a safe country,'' Lahood said on the last day of his visit. </P>
<P> He and state senator George Shadid, also a Lebanese-American, were escorted around Lebanon by armed Lebanese police. </P>
<P> Secretary of State Warren Christopher extended the travel ban on Lebanon for six months in February, angering Beirut which called it utterly unjustifiable. </P>
<P> Lahood complained that U.S. citizens could travel to other countries as dangerous or more dangerous than Lebanon. ``You can travel to Iran now, but you can't travel to Lebanon.'' </P>
<P> He said the ban was excluding U.S. business from Lebanon's post-war reconstruction. </P>
<P> ``There are many countries involved in development and helping Lebanon get back on its feet and America's not involved in it, and that's disappointing.'' </P>
<P> Lahood met Lebanese President Elias Hrawi, billionaire Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri, members of parliament and Lebanon's main religious leaders. </P>
<P> But he did not meet representatives of the pro-Iranian Hizbollah (Party of God), a Shi'ite Moslem fundamentalist movement, which Washington considers the main threat to U.S. security interests in the country. </P>
<P> Hizbollah is widely believed responsible for many civil war kidnappings of Westerners and bombings of Western buildings, including two U.S. embassy buildings, which gave Beirut a reputation for mayhem and bloodshed in the 1980s. </P>
<P> The hotel where Lahood stayed is one km (half a mile) from an empty seafront lot occupied until last year by the wreckage of the U.S. embassy, destroyed by a suicide bomber in 1983. </P>
<P> But asked if he felt there was still a potential threat to Americans in Lebanon Lahood said: ``I don't feel that way right now, but I know the State Department feels that way.'' </P>
