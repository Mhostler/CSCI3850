<DATELINE>CANBERRA, May 2 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A man charged with murdering an Australian police chief went on trial on Tuesday and immediately sacked his lawyers, accused police of harassment and asked the judge to stand down. </P>
<P> Lawyers for David Harold Eastman, accused of gunning down Australian Federal Police assistant commissioner Colin Winchester in 1989, told the court at the start of the trial their client no longer wanted them to represent him. </P>
<P> Eastman, who has pleaded not guilty, then told the court he wanted the case adjourned so he could take separate legal action against police for harassment. </P>
<P> Eastman, 49, a former bureaucrat, said police had made at least four death threats against him. </P>
<P> He also applied for judge Kenneth Carruthers to stand down, alleging bias, but Carruthers rejected the application and declined to adjourn the trial. </P>
<P> Eastman was arrested in December 1992 after a reopened inquest into Winchester's death found what the coroner said was fresh evidence linking him with the murder weapon. </P>
<P> Winchester was shot in the head by a .22-calibre rifle in the driveway of his Canberra home in January 1989. The first inquest ended in November 1991 with an open finding. </P>
<P> The trial is expected to continue for about six months, with the early stages to be dominated by protracted legal argument. </P>
