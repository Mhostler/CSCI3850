<P>  Spanish trawlers ceased fishing in disputed north Atlantic waters off the coast of Newfoundland on Sunday after Canadian fisheries officials took action against one of the vessels. </P>
<P> ``Our goal today was to make them stop fishing and that is the case,'' a spokeswoman for Canadian Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin told Reuters. </P>
<P> Fisheries officials confirmed that they had launched an operation to halt the Spanish fleet trawling for turbot, or Greenland halibut, on the Grand Banks in international waters just outside Canada's 200 nautical mile limit but declined to elaborate. </P>
<P> However, Greenpeace Canada observers, monitoring Spanish radio frequencies, said four Canadian patrol boats converged on a Spanish trawler with the intention of boarding, causing the fishing to stop. </P>
<P> Tobin is expected to give details about the action, the latest salvo in Canada's acrimonious dispute with overfishing of turbot, before leaving for New York, where a United Nations conference on straddling fish stocks begins on Monday. </P>
<P> Straddling involves schools of fish on either side of international boundaries. </P>
<P> Greenpeace Canada, which has a ship monitoring radio broadcasts by the Spanish fleet said the Canadian Coast Guard had threatened action against one of the 18 trawlers in the area known as the nose of the Grand Banks. </P>
<P> ``The Canadian Coast Guard gave the order to one of the trawlers to halt and prepare to be boarded by fisheries officers,'' Catherine Stewart of Greenpeace said. </P>
<P> She said four Canadian patrol vessels converged on the Spanish vessel, the Verdel, but it refused to be boarded, saying it is in international waters and is not illegally fishing. </P>
<P> Canadian fisheries vessels have been patrolling the Grand Banks to monitor Spanish vessels which resumed turbot fishing in defiance of a 60-day moratorium imposed by Ottawa. </P>
<P> Stewart said Spanish patrol vessel the Viga had called on all Spanish trawlers in the area to meet at a rendezvouz point about 20 miles outside Canada's jurisdiction. </P>
<P> The action follows the arrest on March 9 of a Spanish factory trawler, the Estai, in international waters, which sparked a diplomatic stand-off with the European Union. The boat was later released after payment of a $500,000 Canadian ($340,000 U.S.) bond last week, returning to a hero's welcome in the Spanish port of Vigo Thursday. The captain is due to appear in a Newfoundland court on April 20 on four charges of illegal fishing. </P>
<P> Tobin said Saturday that Canada sent out two patrol boats equipped with warp cutters -- used to cut cables that connect fishing nets to trawlers -- as three days of high-level talks between Ottawa and the European Union in Vancouver ended without any resolution on the dispute. </P>
<P> Canada has accused European fleets, mainly Spanish vessels, of overfishing for turbot and is pushing for tougher conservation measures after the closure of the cod fishery in 1992 threw tens of thousands of Atlantic coast fisherman out of work. </P>
<P> Europe has accused Ottawa of piracy and wants a greater share of the international 27,000-metric-ton turbot quota. </P>
<P> Discussions were to continue on Sunday in Brussels between expert groups looking at better enforcement measures, a Canadian foreign affairs spokeswoman said. </P>
<P> Tobin is expected to call for a binding world agreement to protect fish stocks at the U.N. conference. </P>
