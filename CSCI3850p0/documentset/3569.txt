<DATELINE>MOGADISHU, Somalia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A four-day-old street war between rival clans that killed at least 23 people and wounded more than 300 in the shattered Somali capital eased Wednesday amid talks to arrange a cease-fire. </P>
<P> Witnesses reported only sporadic shooting and clan elders said they were doing their best to end the battles for Mogadishu's Bermuda district. </P>
<P> ``But the fighting could resume at any moment,'' warned a clan elder involved in negotiations to end the fighting. </P>
<P> The rival militias want to control Bermuda because it is near the seaport, an important prize after the last U.N. forces, remnants of an unsuccessful peacekeeping mission, leave by the end of March. </P>
<P> Officials at Mogadishu's Digfer, Benadir and Keydsaney hospitals said they received 23 dead and 306 wounded -- most of them civilians -- since fighting began Saturday. </P>
<P> But they added that the toll was bound to be higher as some dead were buried by relatives without being taken to hospitals, while some wounded were treated at makeshift medical centers. </P>
<P> The fighting for Bermuda pitted Abgal clan militiamen loyal to self-declared president Ali Mahdi Mohamed against Murusade fighters led by Mohamed Kanyare Afrah, an ally of warlord Mohamed Farah Aideed. </P>
<P> U.N. officials are concerned that fighting could hamper the withdrawal of the 9,000 remaining U.N. troops to the seaport and nearby airport, but say they do not expect the force to be deliberately attacked. </P>
<P> The U.N. Office for Civilian-Military Operations in Somalia closed Wednesday after coordinating convoys of aid and displaced people and the protection of foreign aid agencies for two years. </P>
