<P>  The Security Council is concerned about the safety of Czech and Jordanian U.N. troops in southern Croatia, council President Jean-Bernard Merimee of France said on Thursday. </P>
<P> In a statement to reporters, he said members were troubled that there had not yet been full compliance with two council statements last week calling for the withdrawal of Croatian and other troops from zones separating Croats and Croatian Serbs and freedom of movement for U.N. troops. </P>
<P> ``It is in particular the situation in Sector South which is of concern to the members of the Security Council,'' he said. </P>
<P> ``The safety and security of the Czech and Jordanian battalions are being seriously threatened. Their freedom of movement must be restored as soon as possible,'' Merimee added. </P>
<P> He said he did not know how many Croatian troops were in the U.N. zones of separation, which they entered after capturing the Croatian Serb enclave of Western Slavonia last week. </P>
