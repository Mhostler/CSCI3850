<DATELINE>WASHINGTON, (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The U.S. and Japanese trade ministers both stood firm Tuesday as they held last-ditch talks aimed at opening Tokyo's markets enough to avert U.S. sanctions. </P>
<P> President Clinton has given Tokyo until Friday to strike a handful of trade deals or risk sanctions on a range of items from car parts to glass. </P>
<P> ``Every option is on the table. But these kinds of deals are often struck at the last minute, so who can say until you've seen your opponent's last hand,'' said a U.S. official. </P>
<P> Aides are betting on a partial deal and partial sanctions, but prospects could well shift as the deadline nears. </P>
<P> Hoping to tip the scales away from sanctions, Japanese Trade Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto flew to Washington for a fleeting visit, indicating to the U.S. side that he has no plans to alter the basic Japanese negotiating stance. </P>
<P> For his part, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor reminded Tokyo that Friday is an absolute deadline for a deal, insisting it is up to Japan to head off the U.S. sanctions. </P>
<P> Kantor, Hashimoto and Commerce Secretary Ron Brown met for almost 1 3/8 hours Tuesday evening to try and break the deadlock but signalled no quick deal was in sight. </P>
<P> While Brown called the opening talks ``very constructive,'' he said lower-level officials would keep thrashing out the problems over the days ahead. </P>
<P> After a 90-minute session between Hashimoto and Kantor later Tuesday night, the Japanese trade minister told reporters the talks would continue Wednesday. </P>
<P> Both sides were engaged in classic negotiating tactics as they approach the finish line of an arduous, 14-month drive to tackle their $60 billion trade imbalance. </P>
<P> ``We're trying to narrow the gap and we feel some movement from their side. But somehow they have a tactical way of handling business which is not helpful,'' said a Japanese official. ``We're already at the very final stages so we don't need these tactics and game-playing.'' </P>
<P> The Japanese too are pulling surprises. </P>
<P> Until Saturday, Foreign Minister Yohei Kono had been in charge of the fractious trade portfolio and Hashimoto's surprise intervention caught even some Japanese short. ``It was all of a sudden,'' said the Japanese aide. ``Do the Americans feel OK about the fact that we're on collision course?'' </P>
<P> The answer must be no, for if Clinton slaps sanctions on Tokyo, he risks further weakening the dollar which would boost U.S. interest rates. Nor does Japan like the idea of a higher yen, which would price its exporters out of world markets. </P>
<P> Hence the scramble for middle ground. </P>
<P> Besides the Hashimoto meeting, Kantor scheduled an evening telephone call with Foreign Minister Kono, who is due to take over the negotiations Thursday or Friday. </P>
<P> But personal chemistry may be the best hope, since Hashimoto and Kantor -- both known for their abrasive style and quick wit -- have struck a strong rapport. </P>
<P> Should that fail, Japan's glass and car parts industries are top of the list for possible action Friday under so-called Super 301, a unilateral U.S. trade tool that opens a lengthy negotiating process under the threat of sanctions. </P>
<P> Alongside, officials are striving for deals in procurement and insurance. A Japanese aide said there had been undue confidence in insurance, saying ``it is not such a done deal.'' </P>
<P> On procurement, the situation is touch and go. ``But we're certainly not there yet,'' said one U.S. aide. </P>
<P> A senior administration official said that without a deal, procurement sanctions were assured since the White House would not support any delay. A list of targets would be published and new tariffs imposed after 30 days. </P>
<P> The sanctions under consideration would have little economic impact, according to senior U.S. officials, whose main fear is the political and financial fallout. </P>
