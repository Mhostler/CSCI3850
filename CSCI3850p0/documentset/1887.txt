<P>  An Iraqi opposition radio station said Sunday Baghdad has massed more than 100,000 soldiers near Iraq's borders with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. </P>
<P> The radio, which calls itself Iraqi Army Radio, said five divisions of Iraqi Republican Guards were moved to the southern part of Iraq. </P>
<P> A transcript of the broadcast sent to Reuters said: ``More than 100,000, all military men in civilian clothing, have been massed near the Iraqi-Kuwaiti-Saudi borders.'' </P>
<P> The United States said Saturday up to 64,000 Iraqi troops backed by hundreds of tanks have massed in southern Iraq and some have advanced toward the border. </P>
<P> U.N. observers in Kuwait said Sunday up to 20,000 people were apparently moving into a tent city on the Iraqi side just north of the border. </P>
<P> Hundreds, described by Iraq as stateless civilians angry at their expulsion from Kuwait, had already arrived. </P>
<P> The Tehran-based Iraqi ``Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq'' said in a separate statement Sunday that military convoys were seen moving south along roads to Kuwait. </P>
<P> An Iraqi opposition source in London told Reuters the radio was the mouthpiece of a group within the Iraqi army opposed to President Saddam Hussein. </P>
<P> The source, who asked not to be named, declined to disclose details or say where the station was broadcasting from. </P>
<P> The BBC said the first broadcast by the so-called ``Voice of the Brave Iraqi Armed Forces'' came from a transmitter somewhere in the Middle East which had been carrying anti-Saddam broadcasts under other names since early this year. </P>
