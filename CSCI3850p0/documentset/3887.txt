<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  As opening arguments start Monday in the O.J. Simpson case, his dream team of tough, experienced male defense lawyers will be up against a ``woman of steel'' in chief prosecutor Marcia Clark. </P>
<P> It's the kind of juxtaposition that could have been created by a Hollywood central casting department. </P>
<P> The petite, 40-year-old former dancer's speciality is trying murder cases with the intensity of an avenging angel. </P>
<P> Susan Sarandon could play her in the movie and so could Wonder Woman if one is to believe some of the press she has been receiving on the eve of trial. A New York Times profile Sunday was headlined, ``The Murder Case of a Lifetime Gets a Murder Prosecutor of Distinction.'' </P>
<P> Clark believes she speaks for the victim or as she put in a summation in one of her past murder cases, ``We speak of justice for a defendant, but what about the victim. Is the victim to be forgotten? What about justice for the victim? The notion of justice is not a one-sided thing. If we fail to make the punishment fit the crime, we have failed to do justice.'' </P>
<P> Her hobby, when she's not working, batting out legal briefs on a computer in her garage or raising two young sons as a twice-divorced mother, is reading mystery novels. </P>
<P> Clark, known for her somber off-the-rack courtroom business suits and serious, no-nonsense demeanor has become the most famous prosecutor in America as she enters opening arguments in her 21st murder case. </P>
<P> She is up against some of Los Angeles's premier trial lawyers -- the suave Johnnie Cochran, considered one of the state's most brilliant defenders, the legendary cross-examiner F. Lee Bailey, the constitutional expert Gerard Uelman and the man who assembled the legal dream team and may now play a less-than-leading role, crafty criminal lawyer Robert Shapiro. </P>
<P> Their job is, as Bailey said the other day, is to take the state's case ``apart brick by brick'' and Clark's job is to keep that case intact. </P>
<P> Lawyers who have worked with her or have opposed her in court say she is more than up to the job, citing her as a woman with nerves of steel able to endure a shelling from the opposition one minute and come back on the attack the next. </P>
<P> As is her habit in murder cases, she keeps in close touch with the families of the victims and has won high praise from relatives of the two people O.J. Simpson is alleged to have murdered, his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend, Ronald Goldman. </P>
<P> Born in California, the daughter of an Israeli immigrant chemist who worked for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, she was a dancer after college. </P>
<P> Her first husband was an Isaeli professional backgammon player. The marriage broke up when she went to law school and their paths diverted. Friends remember her reading law books in gaming clubs while her husband plied his trade. </P>
<P> Her second marriage was to a former employee of the Church of Scientology who later become a computer engineer. </P>
<P> She filed for divorce just days before she was assigned to the Simpson case. </P>
<P> Although the death penalty has been ruled out as a punishment should Simpson be convicted, Clark has asked for it in previous cases. </P>
<P> In the case of the murder of two choir singers shot dead inside their church, Clark told the jury of their killers, ``The death penalty may be the most you can do, but ladies and gentlemen in this case, it is the least you can do....'' </P>
<P> The jury agreed and imposed the death sentence. </P>
