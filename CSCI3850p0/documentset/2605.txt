<P>  A 64-year-old widower suspected of shooting six people he thought were responsible for robbing him was arrested Monday when police found him at home asleep just hours after the crimes. </P>
<P> Three of the victims - including a 7-year-old girl - were listed in very critical condition following the Sunday night shooting spree. </P>
<P> All but one of the victims were caretakers for two state-run halfway houses for the mentally ill. The suspect, who worked part-time as a driver for the homes, apparently felt the others had stolen thousands of dollars from his house, police said. </P>
<P> The victims included the girl, her mother, 25, and her grandmother, 52, the girl's uncle, 16, her mother's boyfriend, 51, and a 24-year-old resident of one of the two homes. </P>
<P> ``Everybody was shot in the head, one between the eyes,'' Wausau Police deputy chief Paul Luoma said. ``Five or six hours after the shooting we found (the suspect) sound asleep in his home.'' </P>
<P> ``We don't know why, but he somehow associated these caretakers with stealing his money,'' Luoma said. </P>
<P> After they denied knowing anything about the theft, he allegedly opened fire with a small-caliber weapon, then traveled a short distance to the other home, then returned home and went to bed, Luoma added. </P>
