<P>  Former Dallas Cowboys coach Jimmy Johnson is expected to announce next Sunday whether he plans to coach next season in the NFL or remain in his new role as a television broadcaster. </P>
<P> The Dallas Morning News reported Monday that Johnson, who steered the Cowboys to back-to-back Super Bowl titles, has narrowed his choices to either coaching the Philadelphia Eagles or returning for a second season with Fox Sports. </P>
<P> During Sunday's broadcasts, Fox ran spots promoting ``Jimmy's Big Announcement,'' to be made next Sunday. </P>
<P> The Los Angeles Rams and Tampa Bay Buccaneers are also said to be interested in hiring Johnson. The Dallas Morning News said that Philadelphia is considered the front-runner to land Johnson because new Eagles owner Jeff Lurie is willing to make Johnson the highest-paid coach in football. </P>
<P> The Eagles, currently coached by Rich Kotite, have lost five straight games. </P>
<P> Johnson, who stepped down after last season amid strained relations with Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, is reportedly seeking a contract worth $4 million per year in salary and benefits. </P>
