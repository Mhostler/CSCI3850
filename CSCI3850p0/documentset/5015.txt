<DATELINE>PARIS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  European nations, hoping to stop the flames of ethnic conflict spreading across the continent, put their seal Monday on a ``stability pact'' intended to defuse disputes before they turn into Yugoslav-style wars. </P>
<P> Foreign ministers from the 15-nation European Union (EU), Eastern Europe, the Baltic states and Russia meet Monday and Tuesday to celebrate agreements that deal with the rights of ethnic minorities and sensitive questions of national borders. </P>
<P> The pact, initially proposed by France and backed by the EU, is supposed to make sure that former Soviet bloc states which have a chance of joining Western institutions will resolve such problems long before they are admitted to NATO or the EU. </P>
<P> At a ceremony in Paris Sunday, Hungary and Slovakia signed one of the agreements to be included in the pact. </P>
<P> ``By this treaty, we're setting out on a European path. We want to walk on the European path towards integration,'' Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar told reporters after he signed the agreement with Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula Horn. </P>
<P> The deal guarantees respect for borders and the rights of minorities, including 600,000 ethnic Hungarians in Slovakia. </P>
<P> French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, who first suggested the stability pact to help to overcome longstanding divisions on the continent, hailed the agreement and said it would bring Eastern European nations closer to the EU. </P>
<P> It may come too late to give Balladur a badly-needed boost to his prestige. Opinion polls ahead of France's presidential elections in April and May suggest he is certain to lose to his chief rival, Jacques Chirac. </P>
<P> More than 50 countries will attend the Paris meeting, which will include a joint political declaration pledging respect for borders and minorities, as well as around 80 separate bilateral and multilateral agreements on specific problems. </P>
<P> Negotiated after a similar conference in Paris last May, these cover everything from the status of Russian minorities in the Baltic republics to border controls. </P>
<P> Eastern European states, many of whom hope to join the EU by the year 2000, were initially suspicious of the idea but went along with it as a precondition for membership. </P>
<P> Now they say the initiative has proved a useful catalyst in resolving outstanding problems with neighboring countries. </P>
