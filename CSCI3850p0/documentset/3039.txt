<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P> (Eds: combines takes, adds details)  United Nations officials have asked Croatian Serb forces to allow a phased withdrawal of half the 1,200 Bangladeshi peacekeepers from around the embattled enclave of Bihac, possibly as early as Wednesday, the Washington Post reported. </P>
<P> It would be the first forced pullout by U.N. troops since Bosnia's war began 32 months ago. </P>
<P> The paper quoted U.N. officials in its Wednesday editions as saying the ``redeployment'' would serve as a trial run for the possibility of pulling out more of the 23,000 U.N. peacekeeping forces stationed throughout war-torn Bosnia. </P>
<P> U.N. officials reported fierce fighting Tuesday around Bihac town, a Muslim-held enclave in northwest Bosnia that is supposed to be under U.N. protection. </P>
<P> The Post said the withdrawal plans highlighted how seriously U.N. officials were considering curtailing the U.N. mission in Bosnia as a result of Serb harassment after two NATO airstrikes in late November. </P>
<P> U.N. officials said their plans called for the Bangladeshi troops to be removed from Bihac in groups of 100 on six successive nights, beginning Wednesday, the paper reported. </P>
<P> It said the chances of the Croatian Serb forces agreeing to the plans could not be determined and there was uncertainty over whether the Bosnian Muslim forces would let the Bangladeshis leave territory still controlled by the Muslims. </P>
<P> The Croatian Serbs, who control access to the enclave from the north and west, have only allowed two U.N. resupply convoys to reach the Bangladeshi troops since October. </P>
<P> As of Dec. 6, those troops had only three days of fuel left for their vehicles, electricity and telephones, the paper quoted the officials as saying. </P>
<P> It said under the plans, the Bangladeshis would be withdrawn from Velika Kladusa, in the north of the Bihac pocket, and possibly from another base near the town of Cazin, but not from a 3-by-5-mile U.N.-designated ``safe area'' around the town of Bihac. </P>
<P> The Serbs have said they will stop harassing U.N. troops only if NATO promises to abandon further combat missions. </P>
<P> Over the last month, Serb forces have locked Canadian troops in jail cells, groped female British soldiers at a checkpoint, forced U.N. military observers to lie bound and gagged on an airfield as a ``human shield'' against NATO strikes and held hundreds of soldiers hostage, the paper said. </P>
<P> They have also refused hundreds of requests to resupply U.N. forces scattered throughout Bosnia, most notably the Bangladeshi troops around Bihac. </P>
<P> U.N. spokesman Paul Risley said Tuesday there had been heavy clashes in the southern suburbs of Bihac town and machinegun and anti-aircraft fire had hit a wall surrounding the hospital compound. </P>
