<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, March 25 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad launched his ruling coalition's election campaign on Saturday with a call for a big win at the polls to ensure the country's continued development. </P>
<P> ``We need more than two-thirds majority to ensure progress and development,'' Mahathir told the National Front convention in Kuala Lumpur. </P>
<P> The country is preparing for a general election expected to be held in April. </P>
<P> Mahathir said the coalition should be retained for the next 25 years to enable it to fulfill its pledge of making Malaysia a developed country by 2020. </P>
<P> The coalition, formed in 1974, comprises 14 parties but is dominated by Mahathir's United Malays National Organisation (UMNO). It is the successor to the Alliance coalition which brought independence to Malaysia from Britain in 1957. </P>
<P> While Mahathir addressed the 4,000 coalition members in the cavernous Putra World Trade Centre, police said 60 landowners arrived to protest against a controversial land acquisition law. </P>
<P> The landowners' spokeswoman Liew Tet Kim said they were protesting against the low compensation given by the Negri Sembilan and Johor state governments for their land. </P>
<P> But police kept the protesters away from the delegates and escorted them from the trade centre. </P>
<P> ``We defused the situation early to prevent any incidents,'' police chief Shamsuddin Abdul Hamid told Reuters. </P>
<P> Political analysts said opposition parties will make land acquisitions a major issue in the election campaign following a series of controversial acquisitions. </P>
<P> ``Mahathir's National Front will have to tread carefully in dealing with this issue as the opposition will play on it,'' said political analyst Hassan Rashid. </P>
<P> But Mahathir blasted the opposition in his speech, broadcast live on national television, saying the people should not elect opposition candidates merely for the sake of democracy. </P>
<P> ``Democracy is for forming a good government, not democracy for democracy's sake,'' he said. </P>
<P> Hassan said Mahathir's speech suggests that he will call for snap polls soon. ``He is psyching his people for the election and it appears to peak now,'' he said. </P>
<P> Polls are not due until October but posters and billboards displaying the scale of justice symbol of the National Front have been put up throughout Kuala Lumpur and in other parts of the country. </P>
<P> But few doubt the election outcome, whenever it is held. Political analysts said Mahathir, who has led the government for the past 14 years, will be returned to power and the only question is how big the landslide will be. </P>
<P> ``The very existence of the opposition is now an issue,'' Lim Kit Siang, the opposition leader and Democratic Action Party general secretary, told Reuters recently. ``They want to crush us.'' </P>
