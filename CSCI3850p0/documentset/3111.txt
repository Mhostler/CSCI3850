<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A pilot whose plane crashed 11 days ago in California's Sierra Nevada mountains reached safety Friday after an epic trek to seek help, but rescuers found his two passengers dead, officials said. </P>
<P> Rescuers had been searching for Peter DeLeo's single-engine aircraft since it vanished Nov. 28 while flying from Long Beach to Mammoth Lakes in northern California, officials said. </P>
<P> But they had found no trace of the Maule M-5 aircraft until Friday, when DeLeo, 33, walked into the Ranch House Cafe in Olancha, 250 miles southeast of San Francisco and told employees he had been walking since his plane crashed in the snow-blanketed Sierra Nevada. </P>
<P> DeLeo said he had flagged down a car after walking out of the wilderness and was dropped off at the restaurant from where he called the local sheriff's office for help. </P>
<P> ``I walked in and he was talking on the phone with someone trying to get a rescue team together,'' waitress Joyce Murcer told a local radio station. </P>
<P> ``He was all black, he was holding his arm, we think probably his arm was broken. He wouldn't seek medical attention, he was too interested in wanting to get his two companions rescued,'' Murcer said. </P>
<P> DeLeo told Murcer he had been walking through chest-deep snow in the mountains. </P>
<P> DeLeo went back up in a sheriff's department plane to lead rescuers to the spot where his plane went down, said Civil Air Patrol Col. Sidney Wolfe. </P>
<P> Two Civil Air Patrol planes and a Navy helicopter also participated in the rescue mission, Wolfe said. </P>
<P> The searchers found the crash site and discovered that one of the passengers had walked a short distance and died while the other passenger was dead in the aircraft, Wolfe said. </P>
<P> The victims were identified as Lloyd Matsumoto, 57, and Waverly Hatch, 49, both of Long Beach. </P>
<P> DeLeo told rescuers that his two companions were still alive when he set off to find help, radio reports said. </P>
<P> Wolfe said DeLeo was in good condition. It was unclear whether he suffered any injuries in the crash. The cause of the crash was unknown. </P>
