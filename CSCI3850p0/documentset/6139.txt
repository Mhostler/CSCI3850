<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  FBI agents Friday night questioned a man who closely resembled the composite drawing of the second suspect being sought in the Oklahoma bombing, but had no evidence linking him to the blast, police said. </P>
<P> The man, whose name was not released, was arrested Friday morning on auto theft charges after he was found in possession of a car with an Oklahoma license plate, Santa Monica Police Chief James Butts told reporters. </P>
<P> Police called FBI agents in to question the man because he bore a strong resemblance to the description of ``John Doe Number 2,'' who is being sought nationwide as the second suspect in last week's bombing of an Oklahoma City federal building. </P>
<P> Butts said the man was from Oklahoma and that he had tattoos ``all over his body,'' including his arms. The FBI's description of ``John Doe Number 2'' said he had only a single tattoo on one of his arms. </P>
<P> ``There is no evidence other than a close likeness to the composite of John Doe Number 2 that would connect him to the bombing,'' Butts said. ``The FBI investigation is ongoing at this moment.'' </P>
<P> But a police source said earlier that authorities had already ruled out any link between the man and the Oklahoma bombing. The death toll from the blast rose to 117 Friday. </P>
<P> The man was arrested as he was returning to a Pontiac Firebird parked on a city street. He lied to police about his identity and was found to have an extensive arrest record, including larceny, burglary and auto theft, Butts said.  Since the April 19 bombing, the FBI has been bedeviled by a series of reported ``John Doe Number 2'' sightings from around the country but they have all turned out to be false alarms. </P>
