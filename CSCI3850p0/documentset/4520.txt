<P>  South Korea Friday lambasted the communist North for planning to oust a Polish contingent from a multinational body which polices the fragile peace along Korea's Cold War border. </P>
<P> A foreign ministry spokesman said North Korea's threat to dismiss a Polish mission from the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC) was a violation of the armistice which brought the 1950-53 Korean War to an inconclusive halt. </P>
<P> ``We are gravely concerned about such behavior by North Korea -- trying to destroy the NNSC and threatening peace and stability on the Korean peninsula,'' he said in a statement. </P>
<P> North Korea notified the six-man Polish delegation two weeks ago that food, water and electricity to their camp, just north of the inter-Korean border near the truce village of Panmunjom, would be cut off at the end of February. </P>
<P> A Swedish NNSC delegation member told Reuters the Poles had been confined to their camp for two weeks. </P>
<P> ``We have not seen them since Feb. 9, which is the last time they were allowed to patrol inside the Joint Security Area at Panmunjom. It is almost as if they are being held prisoner at their camp,'' he said. </P>
<P> He said the Poles were in regular walkie-talkie contact with the Swedish-Swiss NNSC camp south of the border, saying they were fit and well. </P>
<P> Warsaw's foreign ministry said Thursday Poland would not withdraw from the NNSC even if team members had to quit the camp. </P>
<P> North Korea's move against the Poles is its latest effort to dismantle the intricate armistice process which has kept an uneasy truce in Korea for more than 40 years. </P>
