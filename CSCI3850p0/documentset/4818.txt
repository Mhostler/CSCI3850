<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Clinton cleared the way Thursday for Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams to raise funds in the United States provided the money is used for peaceful purposes in Northern Ireland and also invited Adams to the White House. </P>
<P> Noting that progress has been made in talks to end the strife in Northern Ireland, White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry said, ``The president has decided to permit Gerry Adams to engage in fundraising activities during his proposed upcoming trip.'' </P>
<P> The IRA declared a cease-fire six months ago and pro-British Protestant guerrillas followed suit in October. </P>
<P> Adams has been here three times since Clinton overruled protests by Britain and many of his own advisers to grant him a visa 1994, but barred fundraising. Clinton said he granted the visa to encourage the peace process and saw it as a vindication when the IRA declared a cease-fire last September. </P>
<P> McCurry said Adams, ``along with the political leaders in Northern Ireland who are committed to the peace process,'' will be invited to a St. Patrick's Day reception March 17 at the White House in honor of Irish Prime Minister John Bruton. </P>
<P> It marks the first time Adams will meet Clinton. </P>
<P> British officials reacted with dismay at Clinton's action, which came just days after Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, was in Washington stressing his opposition to ending the fundraising ban. </P>
<P> ``We've made it clear to him (Adams) that we expect that any and all funds that are raised will be used for legitimate political party activities which serve to reinforce Sinn Fein's committment to the peace process,'' McCurry said. </P>
<P> He said the decision was made ``in furtherance of the president's desire to nurture the peace process under way.'' </P>
<P> McCurry said Adams was banned from fundraising on previous visits ``because of concerns related to disarmament and other issues. Progress has been made in the talks.'' He said ''specifically, we believe we have made some progress on the issue of decommissioning'' IRA weapons and explosive. </P>
<P> Sinn Fein has been able to raise funds in the United States, but Adams has been barred from being personally involved in such efforts during his three previous visits. </P>
<P> Sinn Fein is opening an office in Washington next week with U.S. approval and has started a fundraising arm called the Friends of Sinn Fein. It will hold a fundraiser next week in New York, which Adams now is expected to attend. </P>
<P> Earlier this week, Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew said in a visit to Washington that Britain would not insist that the IRA give up all its arms before ministers entered into talks with Sinn Fein. </P>
<P> He said that Britain would press Sinn Fein and the IRA to show ``a willingness in principle to disarm progressively'' with the scrapping of ``some arms'' as a confidence-building gesture. </P>
<P> British officials have been in exploratory talks with Sinn Fein following the IRA's cease-fire. They have held separate talks with political representatives of Protestant guerrillas. </P>
<P> White House officials downplayed the strain Clinton's decision places on ties between Washington and London, with McCurry telling reporters: ``We have a very productive and good and warm and special relationship with the United Kingdom... While we may differ somewhat on tactics from time to time, we will proceed in the spirit of that relationship.'' </P>
<P> Separately, Rep. Peter King, a New York Republican active in Irish affairs, said Adams would now be invited to attend the annual St. Patrick's Day lunch in Congress next week. </P>
<P> On Tuesday, King said he would boycott the lunch because House Speaker Newt Gingrich did not invite Adams. Gingrich had told reporters then he received no encouragement to invite Adams from the White House and State Department. </P>
