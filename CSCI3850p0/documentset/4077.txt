<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  U.N. experts have installed more weapons monitoring equipment in Iraq but are not yet ready to certify full Iraqi compliance with Gulf War cease-fire terms, a U.N. official said Wednesday. </P>
<P> Goran Wallen, director of the United Nations monitoring center in Baghdad, said several teams of U.N. inspectors and experts have visited Iraq already in 1995 and added: ``We have deployed more sensors and equipment at Iraq's weapons sites.'' </P>
<P> He said discussions were continuing with Iraq for a fuller picture of past weapons activities, particularly in the biological warfare area. </P>
<P> ``There have been some signs of improvement in the biological sphere,'' Wallen told Reuters. He declined to elaborate. </P>
<P> He added that more needed to be done before the U.N. Special Commission disarming Iraq under the 1991 Gulf War cease-fire terms declared Baghdad was in full compliance. </P>
<P> ``There is no way to say when monitoring will be in place,'' Wallen said. ``A lot of equipment still needs to be installed. There are a lot of censors to put in place and new adjustments are needed for previous installations.'' </P>
<P> He said more laboratories were needed and a high level of security was needed as the Iraqis feared information collected through monitoring would slip into the hands of other countries. </P>
<P> Wallen said supply of missing data by Iraq would help the U.N.'s efforts to put the arms monitoring program in place. He added that the U.N. had just started provisional monitoring in for biological warfare materials. </P>
<P> Iraq says it has fully honored all obligations to have a ban on its oil exports, imposed when it invaded Kuwait in 1990, eased or lifted. Iraqi arms official said it was just a matter of time to fulfill remaining U.N. demands. </P>
<P> The United Nations Security Council, under pressure from the United States, voted last month to leave the sanctions on Iraq intact. </P>
