<P>  Jose Maria Olazabal is more worried about his short game than his shortened toe as he prepares to defend his Masters championship. </P>
<P> ``My toe is getting better. I am still limping on the golf course but it doesn't bother me swinging the club,'' the 29-year- old Spaniard said Tuesday. </P>
<P> Olazabal, who had surgery in January to have a bone shortened in the big toe of his right foot, said what really concerned him was his chipping and putting -- which are all- important in the Masters. </P>
<P> ``I have struggled with my game. Last week my short game was pretty bad,'' said Olazabal, who has played only four tournaments this year. </P>
<P> ``And you know the short game is very important on this golf course. You need to be good around the greens and on the greens,'' added Olazabal, who Monday spent two hours practicing chipping and putting. </P>
<P> The European Ryder Cup star, who grew up on a golf course in Spain, said he did not feel any added pressure returning to Augusta National as defending champion. </P>
<P> ``This year I don't mind about it (defending) because that means I have achieved one of my goals as a professional -- and I would love to have that pressure every year.'' </P>
<P> Olazabal, who had been tipped as a future superstar since his youth, won his first major championship last year when he won the Masters by two strokes in a stirring head-to-head battle with American Tom Lehman. </P>
<P> He was asked about his mental attitude going into Thursday's opening round. </P>
<P> ``Well, I think it is better this year,'' he said. ``I don't have that pressure of not having won any major.'' </P>
<P> All he has to do, apparently, is worry about Augusta National's lightning fast greens, which seem even firmer than usual this year. </P>
<P> ``If the greens are firm, obviously, the test is going to be much tougher,'' he said. ``They were very firm last year -- and very fast. It worked well for me last year, but I don't know if the same thing will happen this year.'' </P>
<P> Olazabal was asked what part of his short game was giving him problems. </P>
<P> ``Chipping and putting,'' he said. ``Most of the greens I have missed I haven't been able to get up and down. And whenever I have had a good chance from close range I haven't been able to make those putts.'' </P>
<P> Still, Olazabal, playing in his ninth Masters, admitted that his experience will be important as he tries to join Jack Nicklaus and Nick Faldo as a winner of successive green jackets. </P>
<P> ``I know that experience is a great factor in this tournament,'' he said. ``And knowledge, especially knowledge of the golf course. </P>
<P> ``There are no easy holes on this golf course,'' he added. ''I don't know which one is the most difficult. I made a seven on ( the par-three) number six -- and that is the record on that hole.'' </P>
