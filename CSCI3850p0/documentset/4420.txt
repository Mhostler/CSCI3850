<P>  Iran has denied any role in helping Iraq export oil in violation of U.N. sanctions, the Iranian news agency IRNA said Saturday. </P>
<P> Iran's United Nations mission issued a statement Friday denying a ``fabricated'' New York Times report Thursday that said Iraq had devised a secret system to export crude oil and refined products to neighbors Turkey and Iran. </P>
<P> The Iranian mission described the report as ``unjust attempts by certain circles, mainly in the United States, to implicate... Iran, without any supporting evidence, in the alleged smuggling of the Iraqi oil and refined products,'' IRNA reported. </P>
<P> The White House said Thursday that the United States believed Iraq was defying the U.N. ban and estimated that between 80,000 and 100,000 barrels a day were being sold covertly. </P>
<P> The U.N. sanctions were imposed on Iraq, once a major world oil exporter, after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. </P>
<P> ``Iran has time and again rejected any direct or indirect involvement in any shipment of the Iraqi oil and will not allow any violation of the Security Council resolutions within its borders until the United Nations decides to lift the sanctions,'' the statement added. </P>
<P> Iran and Iraq fought an eight-year war, which ended in 1988 with Tehran's acceptance of a U.N. cease-fire resolution. </P>
