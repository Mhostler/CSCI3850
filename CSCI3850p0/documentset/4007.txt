<P>  A judge Friday ordered the defense lawyer for Susan Smith, who confessed to drowning her two sons in a lake, to reveal whether he will use an insanity defense to try to save his client from the electric chair. </P>
<P> Judge William Howard said Smith defense lawyer David Bruck must reveal by Feb. 28 whether he plans to use the defense strategy in the trial of the 23-year-old former secretary, due to stand trial April 24 for the murders of her sons Michael, 3, and Alex, 14 months. </P>
<P> Bruck has not disclosed whether he will use the insanity defense or claim that Smith is guilty but mentally ill and told the court he needed more information before reaching a decision. </P>
<P> Smith, who has been silent since her arrest last November, spoke briefly in court for the first time, answering questions posed by the judge about her competency to assist in her own defense. </P>
<P> She told the judge during the pretrial hearing that she was taking the anti-psychotic drug Risperdal, which she said ``helps me to think.'' </P>
<P> Under the judge's questioning, she identified her attorney and prosecutor Tommy Pope and said she understood their roles. The judge said there was no evidence of mental disability. </P>
<P> Howard also refused a prosecution request that Smith be ordered to undergo a psychiatric evaluation. </P>
<P> ``I would not order (Smith) to submit to an evaluation that would have her discuss anything about this case because it would be a violation of her Fifth Amendment right to remain silent,'' the judge said. </P>
<P> Smith fabricated a story about a carjacker kidnapping the boys in her hometown of Union, S.C., and made tearful pleas on national television for their return. </P>
<P> But the hoax was revealed when Smith confessed to pushing her car down a nearby boat ramp with the two children strapped into the back seat. </P>
<P> Pope is seeking the death penalty and if a sentencing jury agrees, Smith will die in the electric chair. A successful insanity defense, however, could mean she is institutionalized at a mental hospital or sent to prison for a lengthy term. </P>
<P> During the hearing, Pope demanded that a state physician test Smith, citing recent comments by Bruck in which he described the crime as ``a sad case of mental illness.'' </P>
<P> Prosecutors said they were concerned that three months had already passed, giving the defense plenty of time to prepare Smith for the test. </P>
<P> ``In essence, she has had three months of insanity training,'' Pope charged. </P>
<P> All lawyers in the case have been ordered by the court to refrain speaking with the media to ensure a fair trial. </P>
