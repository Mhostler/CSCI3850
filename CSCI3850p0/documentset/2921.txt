<P>  Germany will boycott all major swimming meets in China until it can be proved that the country is not cheating with drugs, German swimming federation team manager Ralf Beckmann said Wednesday. </P>
<P> Beckmann said the Germans would not compete in a World Cup meeting in Beijing next January and planned to talk to other nations this weekend about joining the boycott. </P>
<P> The moves follow Wednesday's confirmation from China's Olympic Committee that 11 Chinese athletes had tested positive for banned substances at last month's Asian Games in Hiroshima. </P>
<P> It is believed seven of those who failed doping tests are swimmers who between them won 11 gold medals in Japan. </P>
<P> ``It is clear from the news in the last few days that there is a system behind it and it is not just individuals,'' Beckmann said. ``We will not compete at major events there until we can see that the system has gone.'' </P>
<P> Beckmann said he would try to persuade other countries to join the boycott when he met officials at this weekend's European sprint swimming championships in Norway. </P>
<P> ``We want dope tests to be carried out in China at the same level as they are in the rest of the world. </P>
<P> ``We will inform the other European countries of our decision. There is then obviously the question of whether they will take the same step.'' </P>
<P> China has repeatedly denied that it feeds its swimmers banned drugs on a regular basis. </P>
<P> Beckmann said German swimmers would still compete against Chinese athletes at meets in Europe and that a German team would still be ready to go to China to compete in the Olympic Games should they be held there in the future. </P>
<P> ``But we want FINA (swimming's international governing body) to make sure dope testing is carried out worldwide, especially where there is a lot of suspicion.'' </P>
