<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A member of Ethiopia's former Marxist military junta, on trial for human rights abuses during a 17-year reign of terror, defended his record Thursday and said he was in the dock of a ``kangaroo'' court. </P>
<P> Former Prime Minister Fikre Selassie Wogdereyes, in an emotional speech, transported the Addis Ababa court back to the heady atmosphere of 1974 when a popular uprising overthrew a centuries-old feudal monarchy. </P>
<P> ``We stepped in to save the country,'' said Fikre Selassie, describing how the ``dergue'' military council took power after students and trade unionists had paralyzed Emperor Haile Selassie's government 20 years ago. </P>
<P> ``We did not conspire. We were welcomed.'' </P>
<P> Fikre Selassie, a diminutive former army officer, delivered his speech on the third day of the trials after judges completed reading charges and asked if there were any objections in the court. </P>
<P> The charges of genocide and murder, read from a 269-page document, detailed the alleged killings and disappearences of the emperor, dozens of his ministers, aristocrats and nearly 2,000 victims of the ``Red Terror'' against rival Marxist groups. </P>
<P> He recalled how the dergue's first slogan was: ``Ethiopia First, revolution wthout bloodshed.'' </P>
<P> Fikre Selassie and 45 other officers, now elderly men in suits, are sitting in the dock. But the man blamed for bathing the revolution in blood after ascending to lead the junta, exiled Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam, is being tried in absentia with dozens of others. </P>
<P> Prosecutors accuse those being charged Thursday, with ordering the executions illegally. </P>
<P> But Fikre Selassie said: ``When the dergue was formed, its functions were defined by the law. Everything was done according to the law and the will of the people.'' </P>
<P> Mengistu's government is accused of inflicting brutal suffering by the forced resettlement of 700,000 people to starve northern rebels of support, for Stalinist collectivization policies and aggravation of the 1984 famine in which up to a million starved to death. </P>
