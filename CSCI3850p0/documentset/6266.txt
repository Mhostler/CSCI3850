<P>  U.S. budget cuts for overseas aid threaten to undermine the entire international aid effort by prompting other countries to follow suit, a senior U.S. aid official said Thursday. </P>
<P> Carol Lancaster, deputy administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), said a meeting of aid donors in Paris this week had focused on big budget cuts expected to be imposed by the U.S. Congress in the next few weeks. </P>
<P> ``Our colleagues have been saying if the United States makes such deep cuts, it is likely that their governments will want to do the same thing,'' she told reporters. </P>
<P> Lancaster, speaking during a meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's Development Assistance Committee (DAC), said she feared Congress could cut $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion off a total budget for foreign affairs of $20 billion. Of the total figure, some $10 billion is spent on multilateral and bilateral aid. </P>
<P> ``The likelihood of deep cuts is very, very considerable,'' she said, adding that a great part of the reduction would come out of bilateral aid. </P>
<P> On the assumption that $3 billion in economic assistance to Egypt and Israel would be retained, given the strategic importance of the Middle East, USAID would have to make cuts elsewhere and close down a number of programs. </P>
<P> International aid for poor countries is already flagging, and fell in 1993 to its lowest level for two decades. The United States, struggling to curb its big budget deficit, has fallen behind Japan as the world's biggest aid donor, and is among those countries that give the lowest contribution per head. </P>
<P> Hiroshi Hirabayashi, Director-General for Economic Cooperation at Japan's Foreign Ministry, said Tuesday this week's meeting aimed to stress the need to revive aid efforts. </P>
<P> DAC figures released in February showed that official development assistance fell to $55.96 billion in 1993 from $60.85 billion the year before. </P>
<P> The meeting was also expected to agree on 10 indicators to be used to assess which countries deserve development aid -- meaning that some of them could be ruled ineligible. </P>
