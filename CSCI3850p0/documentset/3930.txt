<P>  President Clinton Tuesday froze U.S. assets of 12 Middle East ``terrorist'' groups, saying he was responding to recurrent acts of violence that could disrupt the peace process. </P>
<P> Clinton issued an executive order and sent a letter to Congress announcing he was freezing the U.S. assets of the groups and prohibiting transfers of money to them. </P>
<P> The groups included Islamic Jihad, which claimed responsibility for a weekend bombing that killed 19 people in Israel, and Hamas, which bombed a bus in Tel Aviv in October, taking 22 lives. </P>
<P> Both oppose the Israeli-Palestine Liberation Organization peace deal of 1993 and advocate armed struggle against Israel. </P>
<P> ``I have authorized these measures in response to recurrent acts of international terrorism that threaten to disrupt the Middle East peace process,'' Clinton said in a letter to Congress explaining his actions. </P>
<P> Suicide bombers have hit Israel five times in the last nine months, killing 54 people, even as Israeli leaders made peace with Jordan and held low-level talks with Syria. </P>
<P> Clinton, who toured the Middle East in October and witnessed the Israeli-Jordanian peace deal signing, said the terrorist activities threatened U.S. interests. </P>
<P> ``Fund raising for terrorism and use of the U.S. banking system for transfers on behalf of such organizations are inimical to American interests,'' he said. </P>
<P> The president's executive order, issued under the authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, took effect at 12:01 a.m. EST Tuesday. </P>
<P> The 12 groups included two Jewish organizations -- Kach and Kahane Chai -- and 10 Arab groups, some of which have several names. </P>
<P> The Arab groups were listed in the executive order as Hamas; Hizbollah (Party of God); the Egyptian Jihad Group; Abu Nidal Organization; the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Nayef Hawatmeh faction; the Palestinian Islamic Jihad -- Shiqaqi faction; the Palestine Liberation Front -- Abu Abbas faction; the Islamic Group; the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine; and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine -- General Command. </P>
<P> Clinton has also frozen the U.S. assets of 18 individuals suspected of involvement in Middle East terrorism, including Egyptian cleric Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, on trial in New York, accused of plotting to bomb the World Trade Center. </P>
<P> They also included Abu Nidal; George Habash, Secretary General of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine; and Abu Abbas, director of the Palestine Liberation Front -- Abu Abbas faction. . </P>
<P> Clinton plans to discuss the decision in his State of the Union address to Congress Tuesday night, McCurry said. He said Clinton also was preparing anti-terrorism legislation to ''strengthen our ability to prevent terrorist acts, to identify those who perpetrate violent acts and bring them to justice.'' </P>
<P> Officials said it would be several days before they would know how much money was affected by the president's order. </P>
<P> When reporters asked how the government could enforce the order, when the groups could simply change the names on bank accounts, officials conceded there were difficulties involved. </P>
<P> ``It's not foolproof,'' said one official, who spoke on condition he not be named. ``But this is one of several methods that can be used for the problem of having the United States be a funding source for terrorist organizations.'' </P>
<P> He said the legislation being prepared would contain ``other devices,'' including use of wiretapping, expediting deportation proceedings, criminalizing conspiracy to commit terrorist acts abroad, and prohibiting fund raising. </P>
<P> In New York, representatives of Israeli and Arab groups condemned Clinton's move. </P>
<P> ``Clinton's comparison of Kach to the terrorist group Hamas is an insane analogy tantamount to comparing Bill Clinton to Adolf Hitler,'' said a statement from Binyamin Kahane, whose father Meir Kahane founded the Kach movement. </P>
<P> The head of the New York-based National Council on Islamic Affairs, Dr M.T. Mehdi, said money sent by Muslim groups was mostly used for helping schools, hospitals and orphans. ''Possibly 10 percent might go for military purposes.'' </P>
