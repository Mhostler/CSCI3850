<P>  The European Commission and Canada are expected to hold further talks Tuesday to try and resolve a bitter dispute over fishing rights off the coast of Newfoundland. </P>
<P> ``A meeting is planned for late afternoon,'' a Commission official said, declining further comment. </P>
<P> Canadian External Affairs Department spokeswoman Jennifer Sloan said: ``We anticipate meeting the EU again this afternoon.'' </P>
<P> Sloan said both sides were reporting back to their political authorities following their failure to reach a deal Monday after more than seven hours of talks. </P>
<P> ``Every day we have made some progress,'' Sloan added. </P>
<P> Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez said Tuesday Spain could not accept a draft agreement reached between the EU and the Canadians, who have been at loggerheads since Canada seized a Spanish trawler early last month for alleged overfishing. </P>
<P> ``There are unsatisfactory elements which we are not going to be able to accept,'' Gonzalez said in a radio interview. </P>
