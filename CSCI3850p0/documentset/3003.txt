<P>  Richard Ravitch, the former chief negotiator for Major League Baseball owners in contract talks with striking players, said Monday he was giving up his job as president of the Player Relations Committee on Dec. 31. </P>
<P> Ravitch notified acting Commissioner Bud Selig of his decision to leave by letter. </P>
<P> ``As you know, my contract expires on December 31,'' Ravitch wrote. ``I understand how critical it is for baseball to achieve its collective bargaining objectives and I don't want to impair that effort in any way. But for personal and business reasons, it's not feasible for me to consider an extension.''  Ravitch, who was chief negotiator until being replaced last month by Boston Red Sox owner John Harrington, added: ``I am confident you and your colleagues will ultimately be successful.'' </P>
<P> Ravitch had been hired on the basis of his reputation in the business world as a tough labor negotiator. He played a key role in formulating the revenue sharing plan that has been a cornerstone of the owners' contract offer to players. </P>
<P> The Players Association went on strike on August 12 and owners ultimately canceled post-season play, including the World Series. </P>
