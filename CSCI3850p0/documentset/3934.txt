<P>  British murderess Myra Hindley, convicted nearly 30 years ago of killing five children, will be hypnotized in an attempt to discover where one of her victims is buried, the government said Tuesday. </P>
<P> Prisons Minister Michael Forsyth announced the decision after a plea from the family of Keith Bennett, who was 12 when he disappeared in 1964. </P>
<P> ``While I am not sure there will be a positive result, we owe it to the family to agree to their request,'' Forsyth said. </P>
<P> Hindley, dubbed by tabloid newspapers as ``The Most Evil Woman in Britain,'' is serving a life sentence for the crimes. </P>
<P> She watched as her lover Ian Brady assaulted and murdered the children and buried their bodies on moors in northern England. </P>
<P> Hindley, 52, has admitted to procuring the children for Brady and helping to gag one of them but apart from that she insists she did not touch any of them. </P>
<P> ``All these years I have been fighting to give my son a proper burial,'' said Winnie Johnson, Bennett's mother. ``It's now hopeful, after nearly 31 years.'' </P>
