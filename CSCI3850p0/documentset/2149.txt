<P>  The Department of Energy Thursday has developed what it terms ``a major technological breakthrough in lighting,'' a far cheaper way of producing light using a bulb of sulfur bombarded by microwaves, the Washington Post reported in its Friday editions. </P>
<P> It said a small Rockville, Md.-based company, Fusion Lighting Inc., developed the prototype lamp under contract to the DOE. </P>
<P> The lamp consists of a closed quartz sphere filled with an inert gas and a tiny amount of sulfur. One golf-ball-sized sulfur bulb, when irradidated by the kind of compact microwave found in kitchen ovens, puts out as much light as hundreds of high-intensity mercury vapor lamps. </P>
<P> The newspaper quoted Christine Ervin, DOE's assistant secretary for energy efficiency, as describing the lamp as a major technological breakthrough. </P>
<P> Ervin told the newspaper commercial products were not expected until 1995, with the first applications likely to be in large outdoor and indoor spaces such as shopping centers, airport hangars and factories. </P>
