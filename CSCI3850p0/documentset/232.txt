<P>  Honda Motor Co Ltd plans to more than double the production capacity of its East Liberty, Ohio, assembly plant as part of a larger plan to build more cars in the United States, according to a published report. </P>
<P> The Dayton Daily News, quoting unnamed sources inside and outside the company, said in its Friday editions that Honda plans to add about 150,000 units of production capacity to the 130,000 units currently available at the factory. </P>
<P> Sources said the move would likely result in the addition of hundreds of assembly line jobs at the plant. </P>
<P> A spokesman for Honda declined to comment on the report, but he said Honda has scheduled a news conference for Tuesday in Detroit to discuss its ``North American strategy.'' </P>
<P> Back in January, Honda announced plans to build an all-new Acura luxury car at the plant in time for the 1996 model year. </P>
<P> The car, which would cost somewhere between $23,000 and $30,000, would be the first luxury model built by a Japanese automaker in the United States. </P>
<P> With the dollar currently trading at historic lows against the Japanese yen, which makes imports from Japan more expensive, analysts say Japanese carmakers are being forced to reconsider their strategy of building higher-priced cars at home and exporting them to the United States. </P>
<P> In 1982, Honda became the first Japanese carmaker to build cars in the United States when it opened a factory in Marysville, Ohio. Today Honda builds the popular Accord sedan in Marysville and its Civic subsompact car in East Liberty. </P>
