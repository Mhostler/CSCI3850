<P>  U.S. and U.N. officials met with Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide Wednesday and said the transition to a U.N. peacekeeping force at the end of March was proceeding smoothly. </P>
<P> The meeting with Aristide and other Haitian officials was the first in a series of planning sessions for the transition from U.S.-led peacekeeping troops to a 6,900-member U.N. force March 31. </P>
<P> About 70 percent of the U.N. peacekeepers already are in Haiti, said James Dobbins, special Haiti coordinator for the U.S. State Department. About 2,400 U.S. troops will be included in the U.N. force. </P>
<P> ``This will be a smooth, a seamless transition in Haiti,'' Dobbins said. </P>
<P> The meeting at the Presidential Palace came amid fears the departure of U.S. troops will unleash a crime spree in Haiti. It occurred just hours after an International Police Monitor dressed in civilian clothes was wounded during a robbery attempt late Tuesday. </P>
<P> Military officials said the attack was likely a robbery rather than politically motivated. </P>
<P> The unidentified officer, an Argentine, was grazed in the back of the head by a bullet fired by one of two men who accosted him on the street in Petionville, an upscale suburb of Port-au-Prince. </P>
<P> Last weekend armed civilians stormed and ransacked a police station in the remote northern town of Limbe after U.S. troops briefly left the area. </P>
<P> The United States led a multi-national force into Haiti last September that at its height numbered about 21,000 troops. The intervention paved the way for Aristide, ousted in a September 1991 coup, to return to office. </P>
