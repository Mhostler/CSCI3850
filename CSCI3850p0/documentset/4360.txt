<P>  A German Tornado fighter pilot blinded by the sun reflecting off the Baltic Sea accidentally bombed a ship during a training exercise, the German defence ministry said Wednesday. </P>
<P> The pilot mistook the buoy-laying ship for a floating target in the Luftwaffe's Schoenhagen practice range on February 9, the ministry said in a statement. </P>
<P> ``He was blinded...by the sun, the reflections on the water surface, the cockpit glass and in his optical visor.'' </P>
<P> A spokesman told reporters the ship suffered some damage but no one was hurt because it was hit only by practice bombs, dubbed ``bombettes'' by the German air force. </P>
<P> Practice runs at the Baltic Sea bombing range were suspended while officials investigated ways of improving security. </P>
