<P>  Burundi, the central African nation which borders on war-torn Rwanda, may soon explode with bloodshed, population displacement and devastation, a group of physicians monitoring the situation said Wednesday.  Physicians for Human Rights (PHR), a Boston-based group, said a four-person medical delegation in Burundi had found a ''profoundly sick society'' where the majority Hutu and the minority Tutsi lived in terror, each fearing exploitation and extermination by the other. </P>
<P> Witnesses said this week that at least 15 people had been killed in two days of clashes in Burundi's capital Bujumbura. </P>
<P> The clashes, involving angry Tutsi youths, were sparked by the arrest of opposition politician Mathias Hitimana, leader of the Tutsi-led Party for the Reconciliation of the People. </P>
<P> PHR said the close intertwining of the Rwandan and Burundian crises was illustrated by several recent incidents. Rwanda has seen the exodus of some 2.7 million mainly Hutu refugees who have fled their country after the mainly Tutsi Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) defeated the former Hutu government last month. </P>
<P> ``We found overwhelming evidence that Hutu and Tutsi civilians have experienced physical violence, displacement from their homes, hardship, and an almost continuous state of terror,'' Dr Benoit Nemery, a Belgian toxicologist and spokesperson for PHR's delegation said in a statement released by the group. </P>
<P> PHR Wednesday urged international leaders and the U.N. Secretary General to pressure Burundi's political parties to agree on the appointment of a president and deploy human rights monitors and advisors to the African nation. </P>
