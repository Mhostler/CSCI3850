<P>  Seventeen Northern Ireland police were hurt when rioting erupted overnight after a parade commemorating the end of World War II in Europe, police said. </P>
<P> Police said the trouble started at the end of the parade by the Protestant Orange Order when people following it attacked police with gasoline bombs, bottles and stones. </P>
<P> ``Two hundred were involved at the height of the trouble,'' a police spokesman said. Eight were arrested, including one accused of looting. </P>
<P> Police said there were no sectarian overtones to the riot, the second major disturbance in Northern Ireland this week after an ugly skirmish between police and Republicans in Londonderry Wednesday. </P>
<P> But Thursday night's clashes were more serious than the Londonderry incident, which caused visiting Prime Minister John Major to cast doubt over holding talks next week between the Reublican party, Sinn Fein, and the government. </P>
<P> Police said the rioters ``were not part of the parade. They attacked police. </P>
<P> ``The parade by the Orange Order was going home when the group following behind began throwing missiles at police. Five firebombs were thrown,'' the spokesman said. </P>
<P> Northern Ireland has enjoyed rare peace since the Irish Republican Army called a cease-fire to its 25-year guerrilla war against British rule last September. </P>
<P> This week's demonstrations were the worst violence since the IRA truce was followed last October by a cease-fire by Protestant Loyalist gunmen who fought to keep the province British. </P>
<P> The British government is holding exploratory talks with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, and politial groups close to the Loyalists to try to find a basis for a lasting Northern Ireland settlement. </P>
