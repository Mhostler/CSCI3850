<P>  Gay men are more interested in romance and long-term relationships than in sex, according to a survey by a gay-oriented magazine. </P>
<P> The results from the survey by The Advocate came from 13,000 responses received from its readers. They appear in the August 23 issue of the magazine, which goes on sale Tuesday. </P>
<P> The survey found that 80 percent of gay and bisexual men would rather live without sex than without love. </P>
<P> Seventy-one percent also said they prefer long-term monogamous relationships to other arrangements. </P>
<P> ``Popular images of gay men emphasize the quest for sexual gratification and underplay the quest for romance and companionship, but the results of this survey contradict that image,'' said Janet Lever, associate professor of sociology at California State University in Los Angeles, who analyzed the results. </P>
<P> The survey also found that 71 percent believe another gay man can tell they are gay while only 29 percent believe that heterosexuals can tell they are gay. </P>
<P> It found that 78 percent lift weights or undertake some similar excercise to improve the way they look. </P>
<P> The magazine said it received 13,000 replies to the 171-question survey, which was published in its May 3 issue. From those, a sample of 2,500 was selected for tabulation. </P>
