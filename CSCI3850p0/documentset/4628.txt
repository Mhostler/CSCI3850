<P>  Few Somalis seem to be weeping about the departure of foreign troops from their soil this week -- but orphaned urchins Abdullah and Ahmed cried their eyes out. </P>
<P> U.S. Marines who came ashore to cover the evacuation of U.N. peacekeepers Tuesday were at a loss about what to do with the young children who wailed and sobbed when Pakistani soldiers who took care of them for months left. </P>
<P> ``The Pakistanis took care of them but now they have nowhere to go,'' said Gunnery Sgt. Ron Turner. </P>
<P> The children were clearly terrified of the uniformed American men wielding guns who seemed deeply touched by the boys' distress. </P>
<P> ``I gave them some candy. I haven't got any left,'' said one Marine. </P>
<P> But the sympathy of the Marines seemed to symbolize efforts by the world to do good in a country where the people often appeared ungrateful -- and where the crisis was too great for all the money and military might of the West to solve. </P>
<P> The Marines were able to discover through Somali translators that the two boys had no parents and came from weak clans that live far from Mogadishu, capital of a country which foreign intervention failed to pull out of tribal anarchy. </P>
<P> If they were turned out onto the streets, the tiny boys would join thousands of homeless children who lost their families in civil war and famine. </P>
<P> Somalis have a strong clan network which means those in need can always rely on relatives for help. But Abdullah and Ahmed told translators they had nobody they knew to go to. </P>
<P> The Marines asked Somali police stationed at the sea port for advice, but the men lounging about in the shade said they should simply be thrown out. </P>
<P> When Italian and U.S. Marines abandon the beachhead bases as the last U.N. troops leave in the next couple of days, the boys could be left behind as mobs of gunmen move in to loot the empty foreign bases. </P>
<P> Turner said he had tried to get in touch with an orphanage set up by U.S. Marines when they first landed in Mogadishu to end Somalia's famine in December 1992. </P>
<P> He said that the Somali-run institution, known as the ``Restore Hope Orphanage'' after the mission in which thousands of U.S.-led troops arrived in a landmark humanitarian effort two years ago, had been closed down. </P>
<P> Relief services in Somalia are collapsing because foreign aid workers have mostly left, taking with them money and supplies raised when the African country was a worthy target of the world's sympathy. </P>
<P> The United Nations failed to broker peace between rival clan militia leaders and is abandoning the mission after two years. Some 132 peacekeepers and hundreds of Somalis were killed in fighting during the U.N. effort. </P>
<P> Mogadishu's streets are back in the hands of ruthless militias. In a nation without proper education, health or justice, it will be defenseless civilians who suffer the consequences of the U.N. withdrawal most. </P>
