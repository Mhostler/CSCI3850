<DATELINE>LONDON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A bomb exploded in a British seaside town Saturday and police accused the Irish Republican Army (IRA) of an indiscriminate attack on innocent people. </P>
<P> The bomb damaged around 15 shops in Bognor Regis, showering the street with glass and sending up a plume of black smoke. </P>
<P> Police said there were no reports of injuries. </P>
<P> But Chief Inspector Michael Parks told reporters many people in the busy shopping precinct would have been hurt if it had exploded just half an hour earlier. </P>
<P> A police spokesman said a man identifying himself as speaking for the IRA had called a suicide telephone help line half an hour before the blast and warned that a bomb had been planted in the town. </P>
<P> Police said another caller saying he was from the IRA, which is battling to oust the British from Northern Ireland, warned of a bomb in Brighton, just along the coast from Bognor Regis and about 80 miles south of London. </P>
<P> Army bomb disposal experts later detonated a suspect package found strapped beneath Brighton pier, a tourist landmark. </P>
<P> Assistant Chief Constable Richard Childs said: ``Yet again it appears that the IRA have launched an indiscriminate attack on ordinary people going about their normal business with no concern for the consequences of their actions.'' </P>
<P> Neither of the callers said where the bombs were planted. </P>
<P> The attack coincided with marches by Protestant hardliners in Northern Ireland Saturday, 25 years after similar parades led to British troops being sent in to quell riots. </P>
<P> Since then around 3,500 people have died as a result of the conflict as the IRA fought to unite the British province with its Irish neighbor and Loyalist extremists opposing both the IRA and union with Ireland have fought back. </P>
<P> The bomb cast a shadow over hopes of an IRA cease-fire as part of a peace plan promoted by British and Irish governments. </P>
<P> The initiative, which offers the IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein, a seat at peace talks if violence stops, is stalled. </P>
<P> But Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams told demonstrators in London on Saturday the conflict could be in its final phase. </P>
<P> In a message relayed to about 400 people marching through the British capital to protest on the 25th anniversary of the deployment of British troops in Northern Ireland, Adams said he was optimistic about progress in peace negotiations. </P>
<P> ``I am convinced that we are in the final phase of this long conflict. I do not know how long this phase will last, but with courage and determination and with your help I am sure that we can advance the search to a resolution,'' Adams said in the message, read by Sinn Fein councillor Francie Molloy. </P>
<P> Adams is banned from Britain under a government exclusion order and his voice may not be broadcast on British media. </P>
<P> The bomb came a year to the day after the IRA planted seven incendiary devices in the southern seaside town of Bournemouth. </P>
<P> The IRA says English seaside resorts are ``priority targets'' because of their economic importance, but security forces see them as ``soft targets'' because of the turnover of visitors. </P>
<P> In their most spectacular attack on the mainland, the IRA in 1984 bombed Brighton's Grand Hotel, the ruling Conservative party's headquarters for its annual conference that year. </P>
<P> The 1984 bomb killed five and injured 31, including then cabinet minister Norman Tebbitt, and came close to killing the then prime minister Margaret Thatcher. </P>
