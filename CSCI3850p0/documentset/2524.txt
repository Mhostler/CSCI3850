<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Newt Gingrich, the man slated to be the next House speaker, Wednesday dropped his conciliatory stance toward Democrats and dubbed President Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton ``counterculture McGovernicks.'' </P>
<P> Former Sen. George McGovern, the Democratic Party's 1972 presidential candidate, campaigned on the platform of ending U.S. involvement in Vietnam calling it ``the saddest chapter in our history'' and restoring traditional values at home. Republican candidate Richard Nixon trounced McGovern. </P>
<P> The Washington Post reported in its Wednesday editions that Gingrich, a Georgia Republican, also called the White House a circle of ``left-wing elitists'' and said he would push for a vote on a constitutional amendment to allow school prayer. </P>
<P> Republicans gained a House majority in Tuesday's elections for the first time in 40 years. Gingrich, the current minority whip, is expected to elected Speaker by his colleagues when the new Congress convenes in January. </P>
<P> Known for his combative style, Gingrich had adopted a conciliatory tone in post-election interviews, saying he would work with the White House when possible and pledging that Republicans were serious about governing. </P>
<P> But the Post said that during a daylong series of interviews, Gingrich showed returns to his old style, saying, for instance, that the administration would be ``very, very dumb'' to try to oppose the new conservative agenda. </P>
