<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A Puerto Rican drug trafficker escaped from a Colombian police detention center just days before he was to be extradited to the United States, a police official said Monday. </P>
<P> The official said Fernando Montanez Bultron, who is wanted in the United States for trafficking in heroin, broke out of the center in Bogota early Sunday. </P>
<P> He said they did not know how Montanez managed to escape but suspect he bribed some of the officers at the center. </P>
<P> Montanez, 49, was to be sent to the United States within days, after Colombia's Supreme Court approved his extradition. </P>
<P> He was caught in the Caribbean port of Barranquilla last January carrying false identification papers and trying to smuggle heroin out of the country. </P>
<P> The police official said security had been bolstered at the city's airport and bus terminal to prevent him from escaping. </P>
<P> Montanez escaped by helicopter from a prison in Puerto Rico in 1991 where he was serving a 24-year sentence. </P>
<P> Colombia is the third largest producer of heroin in the world, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. </P>
