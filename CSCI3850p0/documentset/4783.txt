<P>  PLO chairman Yasser Arafat met leaders of the organisation's mainstream Fatah movement in Tunis Wednesday to discuss the stalled peace process with Israel, PLO officials said. </P>
<P> Arafat, who arrived for a two-hour stopover in Tunis, was to leave immediately after the meeting for Morocco, where he was expected to meet King Hassan. </P>
<P> Fatah leaders have been holding informal meetings since Sunday without Arafat, in an apparent attempt to keep the organization's decision-making process in Tunis rather than in the Gaza Strip where Arafat lives. </P>
<P> PLO officials said Arafat would attend a Fatah central council meeting postponed March 3 and now scheduled for March 15 to 16 in Tunis. </P>
<P> They said the PLO executive committee would meet in Tunis March 17 to 18 to take ``crucial decisions'' on the stalled peace process. </P>
