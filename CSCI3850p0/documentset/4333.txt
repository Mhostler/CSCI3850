<P> By Joanne Kenen  Scientists said Tuesday they are gaining insight into a newly discovered breast cancer gene and are developing guidelines for counseling women at risk. </P>
<P> The advance moves researchers closer to being able to develop a diagnostic test that will help identify women who are at risk for this form of breast and ovarian cancer. No one is yet sure how long it will take to develop that test. </P>
<P> Scientists have so far identified two genes linked to breast cancer and were able to isolate one of them, known as BRCA1. Women with a mutation in these genes have a very high risk of breast cancer, and probably ovarian cancer. </P>
<P> But not all breast cancers are linked to these genes. Scientists have not yet unraveled all the interconnected genetic and environmental factors that cause the disease. </P>
<P> Even women without mutations in these genes have the same risk as the overall population, and should have mammograms and regular screenings. </P>
<P> The new research, published in Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) involves DNA samples taken from 1,086 women with breast or ovarian cancer. </P>
<P> About one-half of the women came from high-risk families. The rest did not have that type of family history. </P>
<P> The team was led by Mark Skolnick of the University of Utah School of Medicine and vice president of Myriad Genetics in Salt Lake City. </P>
<P> In this study, the team found BRCA1 mutations in 7.3 percent of the patients. There were 38 different mutations, three of which seemed fairly common. </P>
<P> Many mutations involved a truncated BRCA1 protein, which may be useful in developing a screening test. </P>
<P> Even when there is a test, women will be faced with serious questions about what to do about the results. There is no sure way of preventing breast cancer in these women, although there are some experimental therapies being investigated. </P>
<P> Related to this issue, a team reported in JAMA progress in developing guidelines for doctors, especially primary care physicians, to help counsel women about their risk. </P>
<P> ``Health care clinicians need to be aware of the significance of specific family patterns of breast cancer, surveillance guidelines, and psychological concerns of women who believe they are at high risk for breast cancer, whether that risk is real or perceived,'' Dr. Barbara Weber of the University of Pennsylvania and her co-authors wrote. </P>
<P> According to the American Cancer Society, an estimated 182,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in the United States this year, and 46,000 women will die of the disease. If a woman lives to age 85, she has a one in nine chance of developing breast cancer. </P>
