<P>  The United States does not believe a textual hitch over a nuclear submarine training facility will derail an agreement between Russia and Estonia for the pullout of Moscow's troops, a senior U.S. official said Wednesday. </P>
<P> ``What remains to be decided are very minor technical details,'' the official told reporters in Washington, speaking on condition that he not be identified. </P>
<P> ``I think it is something that the experts will wrap up quickly on both sides,'' he said. </P>
<P> Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Estonian President Lennart Meri announced Tuesday that Moscow would pull its troops out of Estonia by August 31. </P>
<P> Moscow has already withdrawn its forces from Lithuania and promised to pull out from Latvia by the end of August. </P>
<P> This left the estimated 2,000 troops in Estonia as the major obstacle to an improvement in relations with Russia's Baltic neighbors, formerly members of the Soviet empire. </P>
<P> As part of the deal to leave Estonia, Russia promised to dismantle a nuclear reactor at its Paldiski naval base in Estonia. </P>
<P> But the two governments didn't sign the part about the nuclear reactor, and it was reported in Moscow on Wednesday that the Estonian side needed to consult further on the text. </P>
<P> The U.S. official noted that Yeltsin and Meri had ``stood up and announced an agreement and signed an agreement'' on the troop withdrawal Tuesday. </P>
<P> ``They committed to it as heads of state,'' he said, and Washington did not think they would back out of the pact over the Paldiski hitch. </P>
<P> President Clinton acted as an intermediary between the Russians and the Balts as they negotiated the troop withdrawal agreements, and he had strongly advocated an August 31 pullout date for the troops in Estonia as well as Latvia. </P>
<P> Last week, Clinton wrote ``a very long and frank letter to Yeltsin about what was at stake here,'' the senior U.S. official said. ``He also wrote a long letter to President Meri about the need to come to an agreement.'' </P>
<P> Clinton discussed the issue in person with Yeltsin earlier this month in Naples at an economic summit. But when a reporter asked Yeltsin at a joint press conference with the U.S. president whether Russian troops would leave Estonia by the end of August, he declared ``nyet.'' </P>
<P> U.S. officials said Wednesday they thought Yeltsin was conducting public negotiations at the time, and would keep his word on the withdrawal now that he has signed a deal with the Estonians. </P>
<P> ``President Yeltsin is a man of his word. He has kept every agreement he has made with us,'' the official said. </P>
<P> ``We have no doubt he will comply with this commitment and the Russian troops will be withdrawn by August 31.'' </P>
