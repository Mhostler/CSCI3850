<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  President Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin traded ideas on how to end the fighting in Bosnia Tuesday in informal ``patio diplomacy'' that underscored the demise of an old Cold War rivalry. </P>
<P> At the start of a two-day summit that saw them greet each other with a friendly hug, Clinton and Yeltsin also joined in an emotional tribute to U.S. and Russian veterans of World War Two, some of whom fought side-by-side against the Nazis. </P>
<P> Clinton said the unusual White House Rose Garden ceremony was meant to celebrate bonds forged in the crucible of battle, and ``to pledge that the opportunity we lost five decades ago to build a better world will not be lost again.'' </P>
<P> The warmth of Clinton's words reflected an extraordinarily warm atmosphere that has grown up between Washington and Moscow after nearly a half century of suspicion and hostility. </P>
<P> At the White House state dinner, Clinton praised Yeltsin as the ``man who led one of the most peaceful and successful revolutions of our times, the second Russian revolution.'' </P>
<P> ``We know reform has been difficult and there is a hard road yet to travel,'' Clinton said. ``You have already proved the pessimists wrong.'' </P>
<P> Yeltsin said he ``felt good'' about his fifth visit to the United States and toasted the president and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and the ``strength of the Russian and U.S. relationship based on partnership and for all time.'' </P>
<P> A U.S. official told reporters that Clinton had opened his first round of talks with the Russian leader by proposing that they move from the Oval Office to an adjoining outdoor patio, and that a ``very friendly and at times very direct'' discussion of Bosnia and other global hotspots ensued. </P>
<P> ``It provided a very positive, useful atmosphere where they could together, very frankly at points, discuss how we can move forward on some of these very difficult issues,'' he said. </P>
<P> Secretary of State Warren Christopher said the two leaders exchanged views on a wide range of issues, including the civil war in Bosnia, in a friendly, constructive manner.  ''These are two men who like each other, they speak quickly in an animated way, they've learned how to communicate and they kow how to get right down to business. </P>
<P> A Russian official said the two agreed in principle on an international conference on the Bosnia crisis, but Christopher said Clinton such a meeting was not appropriate at this point. </P>
<P> Clinton and Yeltsin also tackled such ticklish issues as Russian arms sales to Iran, a major irritant to Washington, and Christopher said they were near agreement on that score. </P>
<P> Asked if the prospective deal would involve a cutoff of Russian arms sales to a country regarded by Washington as the world's leading proponent of terrorism, Christopher said: ``I'm hinting that a resolution of this matter is within view ... Obviously it would involve some approach of that kind.'' </P>
<P> Yeltsin also said the talks had been productive, resonating a tone set at the opening ceremony of his fifth meeting with Clinton since their Vancouver, Canada, summit in April, 1993. </P>
<P> He and Clinton greeted each other with a handshake, then wrapped their arms around each other's shoulders in a casual hug. Clinton later said in a speech they met ``not as adversaries but as partners in the quest for a more prosperous and more peaceful planet.'' </P>
<P> ``The Russian-American relationship is at last, remarkably, a normal one, full of real accomplishment and genuine promise,'' Clinton said. </P>
<P> Yeltsin, who is staying along with wife Naina at Blair House, a VIP guest residence across from the White House, was equally upbeat in reply. </P>
<P> ``It is fair to say that the United States is a strong partner and not an easy one to deal with, just like Russia,'' he said, speaking through a translator. ``This makes it all the more exciting ... for the two countries to join hands.'' </P>
<P> Bosnia was one of several potential points of friction in a relationship that has steadily warmed after nearly a half century of emnity. </P>
<P> Congress has instructed Clinton to seek a lifting of a U.N.-sponsored arms embargo that has left the Bosnian Muslims outgunned by the Bosnian Serbs if the Bosnian Serbs do not accept an international peace plan for Bosnia by October 15.  ''The president will carry out his commitment to Congress and go forward with a presentation of a resolution with some kind of a delay in the implementation of it,'' Christopher said, pointing out that the Bosnian Muslims have asked that actual lifting of the embargo be held off until Spring. </P>
<P> That could spell political trouble for Yeltsin, who has been criticized by hard-liners in the Russian parliament for not defending the Bosnian Serbs, Russia's ethnic cousins. </P>
<P> Another potential irritant was Moscow's insistence that it has the main responsibility for ensuring peace and stability in the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union, known in Russia as ``the near abroad.'' </P>
<P> Yeltsin repeated that insistence in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly Monday, but Christopher said the United States does not accept the concept of spheres of influence.  ''We recognize that Russia naturally has a particular interest in countries on its borders, just as we do, but I wouldn't agree with a characterization of a principle guarantor because I think that's a matter for the international community as a whole, working through such organizations as the United Nations,'' he said. </P>
