<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czech Republic (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A Prague court gave a seven-month suspended jail sentence Thursday to the editor of the now-defunct weekly Politika for disseminating racial hatred against Jews and defaming the nation, the CTK news agency reported. </P>
<P> Criminal action was opened against Josef Tomas after Politika published a list of Czech ``Jews and half-breeds'' in December 1992 and started a campaign to brand the Talmud, the basic code of Jewish civil and religious law, a racist document. </P>
<P> Public outrage erupted when Politika published the list of 168 people it identified as Jews involved in the Czech cultural world, and an editorial saying ``the stupid Czech nation merely sits back and watches this Jewish looting going on.'' </P>
<P> The issue was confiscated and Politika was closed down the next day. </P>
