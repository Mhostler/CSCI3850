<P>  Sen. Dianne Feinstein cast new doubt Tuesday on the Senate's willingness to approve a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, saying that Social Security be protected before she would support the measure. </P>
<P> ``If Social Security funds are left in the balanced budget amendmentm I cannot vote for it,'' the California Democrat said at a news conference to introduce a change to the amendment, aimed at protecting Social Security from any cuts necessary to balance the budget. </P>
<P> ``Therefore if my vote is important this legislation to exempt Social Security funds from the balanced budget equation is going to have to succeed,'' she said. </P>
<P> The position of every single senator is being watched closely because support for the amendment is hovering very near the 67 needed for support, if all 100 senators vote. </P>
<P> Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch at first rejected the possibility changing the amendment, saying Feinstein's proposal would open a loophole ``big enough to drive a truck through,'' because any program could be designated a part of Social Security. </P>
<P> But the Utah Republican conceded at a news conference that the vote is very close and said he might be forced to reconsider his view if the amendment fell short of the two-thirds needed. </P>
<P> Feinstein appeared at a news conference with other senators who also endorsed a change to protect Social Security. However, none of the others conditioned their support of the balanced budget amendment on the protection of Social Security. </P>
<P> If it became part of the Constitution, the amendment would require three-fifths of all members of both houses to permit a deficit or to increase the nation's credit line. It would also require a majority of all members of both houses to raise taxes. </P>
<P> The Constitution now sets a majority as a quorum. A majority of that quorum is enough to pass any bill. As Hatch has said, that means if a quorum of 51 senators is present, 26 senators are enough to pass a bill. </P>
<P> The balanced budget amendment debate is expected to continue at least through the middle of the month. </P>
<P> The House last week approved the balanced budget amendment. If it is approved in the Senate, 38 of the 50 states must ratify it. The amendment would take effect in 2,002 or two years after it is ratified, whichever comes later. </P>
