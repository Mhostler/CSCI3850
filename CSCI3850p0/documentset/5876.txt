<P>  As rescue workers in the United States battled to save further victims of the Oklahoma City car bombing, shockwaves from the tragedy were registering thousands of miles away in Asia-Pacific countries. </P>
<P> News of the explosion arrived too late for newspapers in several countries but in others it was splashed across front pages. </P>
<P> Government leaders in Australia and New Zealand were among the first to send condolences to U.S. President Bill Clinton. </P>
<P> ``This is an appalling tragedy,'' said New Zealand's Prime Minister Jim Bolger in a statement. </P>
<P> ``While the full extent of the carnage caused by the explosion is still not known, it is clearly very considerable. That so many children are reported to be among the casualties is especially saddening,'' he added. </P>
<P> Australia's Prime Minister Paul Keating was no less condemning in his outrage. </P>
<P> ``This was an act of criminal cowardice against innocent people, and we join you in condemning those responsible and calling for swift justice,'' Keating said. </P>
<P> ``You can be assured that if your authorities require any help from Australia in their investigations it will be readily and quickly given,'' he added. </P>
<P> In Indonesia, home to one of East Asia's largest Moslem populations and current head of the 111-nation Non-Aligned Movement, a Foreign Ministry spokesman expressed Jakarta's regrets. </P>
<P> ``Any sort of act resorting to terror or bombing is against the struggle of a common cause... and cannot be accepted,'' he said. ``There are peaceful means.'' </P>
<P> A commentator in Singapore described the deep sense of shock that was also felt in the island state. </P>
<P> ``I think most people are absolutely aghast at the atrocity,'' said Walter Woon, a law professor and a nominated member of Singapore's Parliament. ``We're all appalled by terrorism.'' </P>
<P> Hong Kong and Taiwan government officials were not available for comment early on Thursday but grim details of the story were splashed across newspapers, while local TV and radio stations carried updates of the toll. </P>
<P> All three English-language papers carried colour pictures of the blast and mentioned the horror had come on the second anniversary of a federal raid on the compound of the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas. </P>
<P> However, there was less mention of other theories being studied about the perpetrators of the explosion including possible Islamic or Middle Eastern connections. </P>
<P> In South Korea, a major ally of the United States and home to some 36,000 U.S. troops, official reaction to the tragedy was still awaited. </P>
<P> However, a South Korean anti-terrorism expert told Reuters the blast was a lesson for the world that vigilance against acts of terror can never be relaxed. </P>
<P> ``In the wake of the incident, we should realise there is no place around the world where we can be safe from fanaticism.'' </P>
