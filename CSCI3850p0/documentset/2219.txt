<P>  U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said Tuesday he fully backed the commander of U.N. forces in Bosnia, despite calls for his dismissal by all the parties in the Bosnian parliament. </P>
<P> ``I have full confidence in General (Michael) Rose. I just want to express my gratitude to him, he has done wonderful work,'' Boutros-Ghali told the British Broadcasting Corp. in a radio interview. </P>
<P> All eight political parties in the Muslim-dominated Bosnian parliament have demanded the removal of Rose, accusing him of appeasing the Serbs. </P>
<P> Boutros-Ghali, during a visit to London, told the BBC that his special representative in former Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi, was responsible for the peacekeeping operation -- not Rose. </P>
<P> Boutros-Ghali said Bosnia's Muslim-led government could, if it wished, complain to him about Akashi. </P>
