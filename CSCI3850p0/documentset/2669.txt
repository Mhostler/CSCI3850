<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Argentina is creating an elite investigations unit to look into the unsolved bombings of Buenos Aires' AMIA Jewish cultural center and the Israeli embassy, President Carlos Menem said Thursday. </P>
<P> The government has also established a $2 million fund to provide rewards for information on acts of terrorism, Menem told a local radio station. </P>
<P> A presidential spokesman could give no further details on the elite investigations squad. </P>
<P> The attack against the AMIA building in downtown Buenos Aires last July and the bombing of the embassy in May 1992 together killed over 100 people. </P>
<P> Argentine Jewish organizations had urged the creation of a special squad to investigate the bombings, Menem said. </P>
<P> Menem, whose parents emigrated from Syria, sets off Sunday on an official visit to his ancestral homeland. Argentine Jewish leaders have urged him to ask President Hafez al-Assad to not let radical guerrilla groups maintain bases on Syrian territory. </P>
