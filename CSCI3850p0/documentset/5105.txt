<P> In his second day of testimony, Kaelin -- a shaggy-haired part-time actor whose career has flourished in the spotlight of the Simpson case -- said he heard three ``thumps'' at about 10:40 or 10:45 p.m. PST while he was talking to a friend on the phone. He said a short time later he went outside with a flashlight to investigate but did not venture far up the path because he was frightened. </P>
<P> Fidgeting nervously at times, Kaelin said he saw that a limousine had arrived at the Brentwood estate, apparently to take Simpson to the airport for a flight to Chicago. </P>
<P> Prosecutors contend that Simpson drove two miles from his estate to his ex-wife's condominium and killed Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman at about 10:15 p.m. They say he then returned home in time to catch the limousine for the airport. </P>
