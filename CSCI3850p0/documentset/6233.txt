<P>  A French appeals court Wednesday freed former communications minister Alain Carignon from jail where he had been held for seven months awaiting trial on corruption charges. </P>
<P> His release raised doubts over whether he would still go on trial May 15, as currently scheduled, or whether the trial would now be delayed and, perhaps, moved to another town. </P>
<P> He was required to put up bail of $200,000 and pledge to remain in France and stay away from other parties in the case, the appeals court said. </P>
<P> Carignon also sent the court a letter stating that he did not intend to stand for re-election as mayor of the Alpine city of Grenoble, attorney Jean-Francois Arrue, a lawyer representing a civil party in the Carignon case, told reporters. </P>
<P> Carignon, a Gaullist, faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted of corruption, fraud and influencing witnesses. </P>
<P> In a 100-page charge sheet made public last month, investigating magistrate Philippe Courroye accused Carignon of accepting gifts and benefits worth some $4.36 million from units of water firm Lyonnaise des Eaux in exchange for a water privatization concession in Grenoble. </P>
<P> Carignon has always rejected the accusation. </P>
