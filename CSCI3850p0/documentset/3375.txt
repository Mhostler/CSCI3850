<DATELINE>POTSDAM, Germany (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A former East German border guard walked free from court Thursday after receiving an 18-month suspended sentence for shooting two people nearly 30 years ago trying to flee to the West. </P>
<P> The 51-year-old guard, identified only as Guenter D., was convicted of manslaughter and attempted manslaughter for shooting dead a 20-year-old refugee and wounding his fiancee, 24, near a highway checkpoint in March 1965. </P>
<P> A court in Potsdam found two other defendants not guilty. </P>
<P> Prosecutors had sought a 2 3/8-year sentence. </P>
<P> The shootings were just one incident in a series during which at least 400 people were killed trying to cross the heavily fortified border around West Berlin and between the two Germanys during the Cold War. </P>
<P> Prosecution officials said last month they would charge seven former top East German officials, including the last communist leader Egon Krenz, with the manslaughter of people trying to escape across the Berlin wall. </P>
<P> It marked the second wave of indictments of top East German officials since unification. Most have ended in suspended sentences or trials being abandoned because of ill health. </P>
