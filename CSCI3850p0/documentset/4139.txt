<P>  Rescue workers dug around the clock Saturday to reach two miners trapped more than 24 hours in an underground mine in southwestern Wyoming after a record earthquake hit the region. </P>
<P> ``We believe we know where they are and we are working to reach them as quickly as possible,'' said Rick Casey, vice president of operations at the Solvay Minerals mine. </P>
<P> Rescue workers, many from neighboring mines, believe they are a little more than one-half mile from the area where the trapped miners were last seen, but the work is arduous because they are having to rebuild the mine's fresh air system. </P>
<P> ``We made some good progress today,'' Casey said in a telephone interview. The rescue effort was helped by a decline in levels of methane gas in the mine as repairs on the ventialation system progressed. </P>
<P> The Friday morning quake was centered about 20 miles west of Rock Springs, Wyo., and registered 5.4 on the open-ended Richter scale. </P>
<P> It was the largest quake ever recorded in the area, according to the U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo. The nearest metropolitan area is Salt Lake City, 180 miles west. </P>
<P> Fifty-five miners were underground when the quake hit, and nine of them received minor injuries, Casey said. The area is sparsely populated and there were no reports of injuries or damage other than at the mine. </P>
<P> The mine, owned by Solvay S.A. of Belgium, produces trona, which is processed into soda ash for making glass. </P>
