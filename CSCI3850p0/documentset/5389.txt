<DATELINE>PALERMO, Sicily (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  The Sicilian Mafia, in a classic act of intimidation, left a severed goat's head and a cross on the doorstep of a top anti-Mafia prosecutor Sunday, police said. </P>
<P> Prosecutor Erminio Amelio, brother of acclaimed filmmaker Gianni Amelio, found the package Sunday when he opened the door of his heavily-guarded apartment in the Sicilian capital Palermo. </P>
<P> Police said they were investigating why none of the soldiers who provide round-the-clock surveillance of Amelio's building reported any suspicious movements. </P>
<P> Amelio is part of an elite pool of Palermo magistrates probing Mafia crime. </P>
<P> His brother's films include ``Lamerica'' and ``Child Thief.'' </P>
<P> Leaving animal's heads on doorsteps is a typical act of Mafia intimidation. Last year Giuseppe Cipriani, the anti-Mafia mayor of the Sicilian town of Corleone which was immortalized in Hollywood's ``Godfather'' movies, found the bloody head of a calf in front of his house. </P>
