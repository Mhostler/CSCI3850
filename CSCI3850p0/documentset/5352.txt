<DATELINE>MOSCOW (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Thousands of Kazakhs lined up Friday outside commercial banks to change 10-tenge banknotes for $250 each after a local newspaper said the notes contained stripes of gold and platinum, Itar-Tass news agency said. </P>
<P> The Express K newspaper said the London mint used the precious metals in the security stripe by mistake and commercial banks would be eager to buy up the whole issue at up to $250 each. The tenge now stands at 60 to the dollar. </P>
<P> The clue came in the date -- Express K, which is not published Saturdays, was getting its April Fool's Day jokes in one day early. </P>
