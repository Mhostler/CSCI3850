<P> Dated Nov. 29, the draft communique is called ``final revised draft'' and there are believed to have been some changes since then. </P>
<P> It will not be final in any event until President Clinton and the other 33 Americas Summit participants formally approve it. </P>
<P> For one thing, the draft does not include specific language on free trade, which was still being debated and which some view as the centerpiece of the summit. </P>
<P> Nevertheless, the document, including a declaration of principles and an action plan, runs nearly 30 pages of often detailed text, and officials indicated that they do not expect any major alterations. </P>
<P> The U.S-hosted summit, which is set to open Friday, is expected to extol the virtues of democracy, which has taken hold in every country in the hemisphere except Cuba, and set a goal for free trade and economic integration throughout the region. </P>
