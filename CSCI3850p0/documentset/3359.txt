<P>  Because of death threats, incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich has agreed to use a car and driver he earlier shunned. </P>
<P> Gingrich will be protected by a security detail at the strong urging of Capitol Hill police, congressional sources said Wednesday. </P>
<P> Police sources said Gingrich, a controversial political figure, had received death threats since Republicans won control of the House in Nov. 8 elections. Aides to outgoing Speaker Thomas Foley, a Washington Democrat, said he had also received death threats during his tenure in office. </P>
<P> Gingrich spokesman Tony Blankley denied a report in the New York Daily News that Gingrich would be driven around in an armored limosine. </P>
<P> ``It will be a standard American car, probably a minivan sort of car ... the sort of car that shuttles kids to soccer games across America,'' Blankley said. </P>
<P> In 1992, Gingrich gave up a car and driver available in his position as House Minority Whip after a Republican challenger made an issue of the service in campaign ads. </P>
<P> In a letter to Gingrich, Capitol Hill Police Chief Gary Albrecht said, ``My primary concern is for your safety, and the simple fact is we live in a world where security must play a major role in the life of a person in your position.'' </P>
<P> Albrecht told Gingrich recent incidents at the White House, including a shooting and plane crash on the White House grounds, as well as the Dec. 13 arrest of an armed individual trying to enter the Capitol complex, heightened concerns. </P>
<P> The House speaker is second in line in succession to the presidency, after the vice president. </P>
<P> A Capitol Hill police spokesman said the security provided Gingrich would be ``in line'' with the level of security provided for Foley. Other sources indicated two plainclothes security officers would be assigned to Gingrich, which would more manpower than Foley had. </P>
<P> The spokesman refused to say whether Gingrich received more death threats than other lawmakers, adding: ``It's not uncommon for members of Congress to receive threats.'' </P>
<P> The Georgia lawmaker lives a block from the Capitol and currently walks to work. Staff aides also drive Gingrich to events around the city. </P>
