<DATELINE>SHANGHAI, China (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Prominent Shanghai dissident Bao Ge has been moved out of the city to a ``re-education camp'' in the eastern province of Jiangsu, Chinese dissident sources said Friday. </P>
<P> Bao was transferred to the Da Feng Camp after being sentenced last September to three years of ``re-education through labor,'' the sources said. </P>
<P> Because the authorities had not allowed family members to visit him, it was only Thursday that they were told Bao had been moved out of the city, the sources said. </P>
<P> ``He was moved out without being able to see his family members,'' a source said. </P>
<P> Bao, a member of the Shanghai-based Association for Human Rights, was detained in June last year. </P>
<P> He had been campaigning for compensation from Japan for atrocities committed by the Japanese military during its occupation of China from 1931 to 1945. </P>
<P> His campaign, which has appeal among many Chinese, has embarrassed the government, which declined to ask for war compensation from Japan. </P>
<P> Three years is the maximum sentence of the ``re-education through labor'' program, a form of administrative detention that avoids the need for a formal trial under Chinese law. </P>
<P> However, in practice, the period can be extended, Western human-rights groups say. </P>
