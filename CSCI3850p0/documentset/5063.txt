<P>  Russian heavy bombers and big guns pounded Chechen separatist positions for the second day running Tuesday, Itar-Tass news agency said. </P>
<P> In raids lasting throughout the night, air strikes targeted the towns of Argun, Gudermes and Shali -- strongholds of Chechen resistance east and southeast of the capital Grozny, Tass said, quoting local sources. </P>
<P> The Russian news agency gave no details of casualties in the latest military action. </P>
<P> Chechen independence fighters, forced out of Grozny in early February by Russian forces, have continued their resistance in surrounding towns but concede they might eventually be forced to wage a partisan war from the mountains. </P>
<P> Russian tanks and troops rolled into the North Caucasus territory last Dec. 11 to crush a three-year bid for independence. </P>
<P> A member of Russia's top policy-making body, the Security Council, meanwhile said Russian troops had wiped out or seized most Chechen heavy armaments and ammunition caches during the three-month conflict. </P>
<P> Oleg Lobov, secretary of the Security Council, said Russian troops had mostly sealed off conflict zones and put an end to big military operations in the breakaway region. </P>
<P> But Lobov, in an interview with Interfax news agency, said Moscow should not underestimate the threat of ``terrorism'' beyond Chechnya's borders -- a reference to threats by the separatist leadership to carry out punitive attacks on installations in Russia proper. </P>
<P> ``Russians must be prepared to put a halt to such attempts,'' he said. </P>
