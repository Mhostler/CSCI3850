<P>  More than 90 percent of Gulf War veterans tested in a study have a respiratory problem that could explain a mysterious illness afflicting many of those who served in the conflict, researchers said Wednesday. </P>
<P> A survey of 43 veterans in New Jersey found that 40 of them, including many who had not complained of any symptoms, had an obstruction of the upper airways that limits the rate at which air can get into the lungs. </P>
<P> Biopsies showed that virtually all those with the obstruction suffered from a chronic inflammation of the upper airways, said Dr. Arvind Das of the Robert Wood Johnson Medical Center in New Brunswick, New Jersey. </P>
<P> ``This was very unexpected,'' said Das, who presented his findings here at the annual conference of the American Thoracic Society and American Lung Association. </P>
<P> The chronic inflammation, which Das speculated stems from prolonged exposure to the dense black smoke of burning Kuwaiti oilfields during the 1991 war, almost certainly is responsible for the coughing and shortness of breath reported by a majority of veterans in the study. </P>
<P> More importantly, such inflammation is known to cause sleeping disorders such as sleep apnea, which can lead to fatigue, a leading symptom of the Gulf War syndrome, which has never been fully explained. </P>
<P> The findings are supported by two other studies reported at the conference, both of which concluded that previously unrecognized sleep disorders may be responsible for symptoms of the illness. </P>
<P> Das said the inflammations he found were similar in both smokers and non-smokers and were not found in a control group of healthy young men. ``Smoking does not explain it -- definitely not,'' he said. </P>
<P> He said smoke from oil fires was the most likely explanation, noting that soldiers in the Gulf War were exposed to thick smoke sometimes for weeks on end. And he said large particles from petrochemical smoke are known to dissolve in the upper airways, where they would not be detected in routine medical examinations. </P>
<P> Das said he plans to do a study on the sleeping patterns of the veterans next. </P>
