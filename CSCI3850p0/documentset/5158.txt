<DATELINE>JERUSALEM, March 24 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin has linked a July 1st deadline for an Israel-PLO agreement on extending self-rule to PLO head Yasser Arafat curbing anti-Israel guerrillas, Rabin's spokesman said on Friday. </P>
<P> Spokesman Oded Ben-Ami confirmed Israeli media reports Rabin told U.S. Vice President Al Gore in talks on Thursday that the deadline, set in an effort to break an impasse in peace talks, depended on Arafat's ``curbing terrorism.'' </P>
<P> Asked if he could confirm the reports, Ben-Ami said: ``Yes I can.'' </P>
<P> Gore was to meet Arafat on Friday at the Jericho self-rule enclave. Rabin's statement seemed likely to figure prominently in talks between the two. </P>
<P> Israel's Jerusalem Post daily said participants at the meeting between Gore and Rabin afterward reminded Israeli reporters Rabin had long said dates set for stages of the 1993 PLO-Israel peace deal were not ``holy.'' </P>
<P> Palestinian elections and an Israeli troop redeployment away from West Bank population centres, first steps in extending self-rule to more of the West Bank, were set for last July. </P>
<P> Self-rule began in most of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho last May. </P>
<P> Differences over elections and Israeli security fears spurred by suicide bombings by Islamic militants opposed to the peace deal stalled talks on the peace deal's next stages. </P>
<P> After the last suicide bombing in January by two guerrillas from Gaza in which 21 Israelis were killed near Tel Aviv, Rabin said further progress depended on Arafat curbing attackers. </P>
<P> On March 9, the day U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher arrived in Israel on a peace shuttle, the sides agreed to the deadline for agreement on extending self-rule. </P>
<P> The deadline bouyed Christopher's mission. Palestinians warned it remained to be seen if the target date would be met. </P>
