<P>  Hong Kong police searching for computer hackers closed down most of the colony's internet providers, cutting up to 10,000 people off from the computer superhighway, industry sources said Sunday. </P>
<P> Only one dedicated commercial gateway to the internet was left operating, they said. A Hong Kong government spokesman confirmed the police commercial crime bureau had raided eight providers in an investigation into hacking and taken away equipment from at least two. </P>
<P> The Hong Kong government's Office of Telecommunications Authority (OFTA) said in a statement it had provided technical assistance to the police and added it was conducting a separate investigation into whether some operators had been providing non-licensed telecommunications services. </P>
<P> Many users responded with fury to being cut off, posting angry complaints to the plethora of computer bulletin boards operating in Hong Kong. </P>
<P> Hong Kong's internet industry, considered the most advanced on-line market in Asia, has been rocked in recent months by a price war following the entry of the eight new operators onto the market. The colony has seen a surge in internet use because of aggressive marketing campaigns by new operators. </P>
<P> Industry sources said the raids had cut off between 8,000 and 10,000 individuals from the internet. They said at the last count there were 12 providers in Hong Kong, nine or 10 of them commercial operators as opposed to university-operated gateways. </P>
<P> An executive at Hong Kong SuperNet said he believed the company was the only commercial operator holding a license. </P>
<P> He said the company held a market share of about 80 percent and could not see how the prices offered by the newcomers could be commercially viable. </P>
<P> A technician at one of the new operators said the company had been awaiting word from OFTA on whether internet providers needed a license requiring the holder to pay a levy to Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd, which holds the international telephone communications monopoly in Hong Kong. </P>
<P> ``The requirements were not totally clear and appeared to have been written before the internet came into being,'' he said. </P>
