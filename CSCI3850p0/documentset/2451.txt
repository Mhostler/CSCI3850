<P>  A soldier stole a tank from an Israeli army base, rammed it into a bus and slightly injured eight passengers before police coaxed him into surrendering Monday, the army said. </P>
<P> Hundreds of police gave chase during a four-hour ordeal that began Sunday night when Sgt. Amit Nehemiah, a tank mechanic, broke through a fence around a southern Israeli army base and took the tank for a ride. </P>
<P> ``This was a guy who apparently has problems. He took the tank on a trip. It's good he was stopped and there were negotiations with him and that's how it ended,'' Israeli Police Chief Assaf Hefetz said. </P>
<P> The army said eight people were hurt when the turret sideswiped a bus in which they were riding. </P>
<P> Witnesses said Nehemiah opened fire with an army rifle but no one was hurt by the gunshots. He knocked over a few street light signs before the tank lost a track and got stuck on an electric pylon. </P>
<P> Police said a friend and specialists with the force negotiated with Nehemiah, finally convincing him to get out. </P>
