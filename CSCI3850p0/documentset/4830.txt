<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  For the San Antonio Spurs, it was last-second perfection, but for the Cleveland Cavaliers, it was a mental lapse that caused them to come up short -- literally. </P>
<P> Sean Elliott's layup off an inbounds pass from Doc Rivers with one second left lifted the Spurs to a 100-98 victory over the Cavaliers Thursday. </P>
<P> After Cleveland's Terrell Brandon missed a 15-footer, the Spurs grabbed the rebound and called timeout with one second to go. San Antonio moved to midcourt for the inbounds pass and Rivers found Elliott under the basket for the game-winner. </P>
<P> ``The play couldn't have worked more perfectly,'' said San Antonio coach Bob Hill. ``Doc Rivers made a great pass. </P>
<P> ``If they put size on the ball, it makes it kind of tough to make a pass like that.'' </P>
<P> Cleveland forward Chris Mills said the team forgot to bring 6-foot-9 Michael Cage in to use his height to harass the 6-foot-4 Rivers. </P>
<P> ``We were in the timeout and decided to come out and take the delay of game right away,'' Mills said. ``As soon as the official handed him the ball, we were going to step out of bounds and get a feel of what they were going to do. </P>
<P> ``Then we were going to send Michael Cage in and have him guard the inbounds, and we never got around to putting him in. It was just a mental lapse by the team.'' </P>
<P> David Robinson scored nine of his 26 points in the final 3:20 as the Spurs, the hottest team in the NBA, won for the ninth time in their last 10 games. </P>
<P> Terrell Brandon scored 24 points and Tony Campbell added 21 for Cleveland, which has lost five of its last six games. </P>
<P> Cleveland used a 16-4 burst to erase a six-point deficit and take a 94-88 lead when Danny Ferry hit a 3-pointer with 4:11 to play. The Spurs countered with an 8-2 run to tie the game at 96-96 as Robinson scored seven points. </P>
<P> ``I'm sorry for the team,'' said Cleveland coach Mike Fratello. ``They worked very hard against an outstanding club and came up a little bit short.'' </P>
<P> In Charlotte, Alonzo Mourning scored 13 of his 35 points in the fourth quarter to lift the Hornets to their fourth win in five games, a 112-99 triumph over the Seattle SuperSonics. </P>
<P> Mourning connected on 12-of-20 from the field, hauled in 13 rebounds and blocked six shots as the Hornets won their fourth in a row at home. Charlotte beat Seattle for the second time in 11 days and swept the season series. </P>
<P> ``That's a hell of a win for us,'' said Charlotte coach Alam Bristow. ``Not many teams can beat Seattle twice.'' </P>
<P> ``In order for us to get to the next level we have to beat teams of this caliber,'' said Mourning. ``This game makes a statement.'' </P>
<P> Dell Curry made six 3-pointers and had 22 points and Larry Johnson added 21 points and eight assists for the Hornets. </P>
<P> Kendall Gill had 23 points and 11 rebounds for the Sonics, who have lost four of their last six games. </P>
<P> In Miami, Otis Thorpe scored 22 points as the Trail Blazers continued their dominance of the Heat with a 99-90 victory. Portland is 14-1 all-time against the Heat and 6-1 in Miami. </P>
<P> After Miami got within 81-79 with 6:57 left, the Trail Blazers used a 10-0 run to break open the game. James Robinson and Clifford Robinson made 3-pointers during the spurt as Portland opened a 91-79 lead with 4:13 remaining. </P>
<P> James Robinson added 16 points off the bench for Portland. </P>
<P> Glen Rice and Billy Owens scored 16 points apiece for the Heat, who had a three-game home winning streak snapped. </P>
<P> Portland point guard Rod Strickland was sent home for the rest of the road trip with recurring pain in his bruised shoulder. </P>
<P> The Blazers' bench netted 60 of their 99 points, outscoring Miami's reserves 60-36. </P>
<P> In Sacramento, Reggie Miller scored 30 points to lead the Indiana Pacers to a 109-94 victory over the reeling Kings. </P>
<P> Derrick McKey scored 21 points and Rik Smits added 19 for the Pacers, who took the lead for good in the second quarter. </P>
<P> Mitch Richmond scored 21 points and Walt Williams added 19 for the Kings, who have lost nine of their last 10 games. </P>
