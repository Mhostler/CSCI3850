<P>  U.S.-based PanAmSat said it planned to launch a replacement within a year for its $150 million PanAmSat-3 (PAS-3) satellite that crashed into the Atlantic Ocean Thursday after the failure of an Arianespace rocket. </P>
<P> ``It's not a major setback. We have a long-term outlook, and we are looking at the next 10-20 years,'' Andrew Jordan vice-president for the Asia-Pacific region, told Reuters at a television trade show in Hong Kong. </P>
<P> ``It won't affect our plans to reel out our global service.'' </P>
<P> He said Arianespace, a Paris-based company, was committed to relaunching within 12-14 months. The European-made Ariane rocket carrying the PAS-3 satellite failed after liftoff on Thursday. </P>
<P> It was the second Ariane rocket failure this year and the seventh since Western Europe began launching the Ariane series in 1979. </P>
<P> Hughes Aircraft Company, the designer of PAS-3, had already built components for a spare PAS-3 that could be completed within a year, said Jordan. </P>
<P> The satellite was to have covered North and South America, Europe and Africa. </P>
<P> PanAmSat-4, which will cover the area between Hong Kong and Europe, including India and Africa, will be launched on schedule in April or May 1995, he said. </P>
