<P>  North Korea's parliament has shown no sign of holding its customary April session, a surprise departure for the obsessively secretive nation, South Korean government officials said on Tuesday. </P>
<P> They said the apparent delay in convening a session of the Supreme People's Assembly was a further indication that de facto leader Kim Jong-il was in no hurry to assume the nation's top posts following his father Kim Il-sung's death last July. </P>
<P> ``The North Korean Supreme People's Assembly is not likely to convene a plenary session this month when the five-year term of current parliamentary members ends,'' a Unification Ministry official said. </P>
<P> The April session was normally devoted to replacing parliamentary members and debating a national budget bill, the ministry said. </P>
<P> ``In past practice, the assembly issued a notice to open plenary sessions at least 15 days ahead of schedule. But there has not yet been any such notice,'' the official said. </P>
<P> He also cited the absence of Choe Gwang, chief of general staff of the North Korean People's Army, as another indication the plenary session would not be held. </P>
<P> Choe left Pyongyang on Sunday to visit Indonesia and Malaysia. All North Korean military leaders are committed to attend plenary sessions of the assembly, he said. </P>
<P> He said Choe, expected to succeed as defence minister following the death of O Jin-u in February, would stay in the two countries for about 10 days. </P>
<P> North Korea was later this month due to hold a series of major events, including an international sports and cultural festival and memorial events to mark the birthday of the late president Kim Il-sung. </P>
<P> The festival, which starts on April 28, will be the biggest international event in its history, to which thousands of foreign spectators and journalists have been invited. </P>
<P> ``The North would not want to proceed with major parliamentary sessions amid such a jubilant mood,'' the Seoul official said. </P>
<P> ``These facts back up the prevailing view of North Korea watchers here that Kim Jong-il will not be officially named the head of state until July'' when a one-year mourning period for Kim Il-sung ends. </P>
