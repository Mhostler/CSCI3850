<DATELINE>PARIS (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Pope John Paul has told French bishops he is ready to receive Bishop Jacques Gaillot, France's ``Red cleric'' whom the Vatican sacked in January for his liberal views, the headquarters of the French church said Saturday. </P>
<P> A statement from the French Bishops' conference said its president, Monsignor Joseph Duval, visited the Vatican from Thursday to Saturday where he met the pope. </P>
<P> ``Pope John Paul II and Cardinal Bernardin Gantin are ready to receive Monsignor Jacques Gaillot as soon as he requests it,'' the French church statement said. </P>
<P> The LCI all-news television channel said Gaillot had decided to accept the invitation and would make the request. </P>
<P> The church statement said the Vatican wanted to help Gaillot ``exercise his ministry with the rights and duties that this entails.'' </P>
<P> The statement said the pope listened at length to a report by Duval on the reaction of French Catholics to Gaillot's removal as bishop of the Norman city of Evreux. </P>
<P> Thousands of people protested after Gaillot was fired from his diocese for upsetting Rome with his liberal views on such issues as birth control and workers' rights. </P>
<P> The French bishops' conference acknowledged last month that firing Gaillot had upset many Catholics and promised to continue to pay his salary and social welfare taxes. </P>
<P> Gaillot defied Vatican doctrine by urging the use of condoms against AIDS, speaking in favor of allowing priests to marry and calling for greater tolerance of homosexuality. </P>
<P> He also angered successive French governments by urging much tougher action to help the poor, the unemployed and homeless. </P>
<P> Duval's visit to the Vatican came amid fears Gaillot's sacking could prompt a further drift away from Catholicism in France, where it is nominally the religion of 47 million of the 55 million population. But only one in 10 French Catholics is a regular church-goer. </P>
<P> The church statement said the pope would address a message soon to French Catholics ahead of his scheduled visit in 1996. </P>
<P> Duval wrote that Gaillot could meet the pope with members of his parish if they so desired. </P>
<P> Gaillot now officially heads a diocese in southern Algeria which has not existed since the Middle Ages, the ancient city of Partenia which disappeared after Islam became the predominant religion in the region. </P>
