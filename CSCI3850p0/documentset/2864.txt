<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Democratic Sen. John Breaux of Louisiana Monday suggested forming a bipartisan centrist caucus in the Senate to influence legislation and combat more extreme views on both sides. </P>
<P> In a news conference, Breaux said he thought up to five Republicans and five Democrats might be willing to join such a caucus which could seize the balance of power in the Senate -- which will be dominated by Republicans in January. </P>
<P> ``Let's set up bipartisan caucuses in the Congress so we can talk to each other about the problems that people really care about and move the Congress back to the mainstream,'' said Breaux. </P>
<P> In the last session of Congress, the Louisiana Senator spearheaded an effort to pass a bipartisan health care reform plan which ultimately failed. But he said cooperation between the Republicans and Democrats remained the only way to get things done. </P>
<P> On welfare, he said the majority of Americans agreed on the need for reform but did not endorse Republican ideas that would cut loose people currently on state support without a safety net. </P>
<P> ``Let's remind ourselves that there are innocent babies and children that did not ask to be born and cannot just be dumped out into orphanages or put up for adoption, taking them away from their parents,'' he said. </P>
<P> Breaux said the Republicans could not legislate without the help of moderate Democrats because they lacked the 60 votes necessary to stop a filibuster. </P>
<P> He said moderate Democrats working closely with progressive Republicans could form a blocking coalition. </P>
<P> ``Neither side would have enough votes to pass anything without that center,'' said Breaux. </P>
<P> He envisaged his 10-member caucus meeting weekly to discuss its agenda. ``You get a bipartisan coalition of 10 folks -- five and five -- and I think it could have a major impact on the flow of legislation and the passage of legislation.'' </P>
<P> Breaux said he had already discussed his idea with colleagues on both sides of the aisle. He mentioned Democratic Sens. Sam Nunn of Georgia and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska but did not name any potential Republican members. </P>
