<P>  The days of enmity and confrontation between the United States and North Korea are ending and a new era of hope is beginning, a high-level North Korean official said in an interview published Wednesday. </P>
<P> In the interview with the Los Angeles Times, Ri Jong Hyok said if the present trend of dialogue between the two governments and their citizens continued, it would not be long before the United States and North Korea established diplomatic relations. </P>
<P> The Times said Ri, a 58-year-old former diplomat, was a member of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il's inner circle and his status was the equivalent of a U.S. cabinet member. </P>
<P> He was interviewed in Los Angeles Monday at the end of a two-week, six-city visit of the United States which also took him and his four-member delegation to New York, Washington, Virginia Beach, Va., Atlanta and Chicago as well as Los Angeles. </P>
<P> Asked why Kim Jong Il had not become the head of the government or the Communist Party seven months after his father's death, Ri said he was still observing a mourning period which could last as long as three years in the traditional Korean culture. </P>
<P> In addition, he said, titles were ``mere forms, which we do not consider important.'' </P>
<P> Ri also talked about his vision of a united Korea and suggested that as a first step, both sides should accept the existing governments' political, economic and social structures. </P>
<P> The governments should then create a third ``federal government'' to handle issues on which both sides agreed, such as a joint Olympic team, Ri said. </P>
