<P>  Israel Radio quoted a cabinet minister as saying Monday that Israel and Syria were engaged in secret peace contacts. </P>
<P> ``Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer confirms there were secret contacts with Syria, not at the ministerial level, but at the same echelons that led, in his words, to the dizzying success in other peace agreements,'' the radio reported. </P>
<P> The radio did not elaborate and Ben-Eliezer, who is housing minister, could not be reached immediately for comment. </P>
<P> He appeared to be referring to secret contacts with the PLO and Jordan that led to interim peace deals with both in the last year. </P>
<P> Israeli media reported that unprecedented pro-peace billboards had appeared in Syria and the radio quoted Ben-Eliezer as saying this was evidence of progress in the secret contacts. </P>
<P> Three years of Israeli-Syrian peace talks are stuck over the fate of the Golan Heights captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war. Syria wants them back. Israel wants a commitment to full relations, open borders and trade. </P>
