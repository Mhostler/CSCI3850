<P>  Turkish Foreign Affairs Minister Erdal Inonu assured France Friday that Ankara's incursion into Iraq to flush out rebel Kurds was not open-ended, but said troops would stay until their mission was completed. </P>
<P> ``All of our friends understand that the military operation against the PKK (Kurdistan Workers Party) is an operation of limited duration, of limited goals,'' Inonu said. </P>
<P> ``We have no intention of remaining in Iraq, we have no intention of setting up a ``cordon sanitaire' (protective line) or anything like that,'' Inonu told reporters. </P>
<P> The Turkish minister was in Paris to soothe French officials, irritated by Ankara's military operations in Iraq, ahead of this weekend's 11-nation Mediterranean Forum in the Riviera resort town of Sainte-Maxime. </P>
<P> He met Defense Minister Francois Leotard and Cooperation Minister Alain Lamassoure Friday and planned to hold talks with Foreign Minister Alain Juppe while in Sainte-Maxime. </P>
<P> Asked how their talks with Inonu had gone, Lamassoure declined comment while Leotard said only that Paris had already clearly stated its position on Turkey's military move. </P>
<P> France, current holder of the European Union's rotating presidency, has urged Turkey to respect international borders and human rights and to quickly withdraw its forces from Iraq. </P>
<P> ``We hope the Turkish operation in Northern Iraq ends as rapidly as possible,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Richard Duque said when asked about Friday's meetings. </P>
<P> Inonu, pressed on when Turkey would withdraw its troops, said it would do so ``when its mission is completed and when there is no longer a possibility of attacks against Turkey from just outside its borders.'' </P>
<P> ``This is nothing more than an operation against terrorists,'' he said, adding humanitarian aid to the region was continuing. </P>
<P> It also urged France to warn Turkey its ``blind and brutal repression'' of the Kurds would harm ties with Europe. </P>
<P> The 19-day-old incursion has drawn sharp criticism from Turkey's Western allies, particularly Germany and France. </P>
