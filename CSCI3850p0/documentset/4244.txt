<P>  The Consumer Products Safety Commission Wednesday voted against regulating the manufacture of five-gallon buckets, despite 36 drownings of toddlers in such buckets each year. </P>
<P> CPSC Chairman Ann Brown said the commission decided to end a rule-making process in view of progress made by the five major manufacturers in putting warning labels on buckets in both English and Spanish, and their commitment to spend $500,000 over the next several years to educate the public. </P>
<P> Brown also noted that setting federal standards for buckets would have resulting significant costs, and there was no guarantee that such a standard would be practicable and reasonable for all buckets. </P>
<P> The CPSC said the manufacturers had placed labels on 80 percent of the buckets produced, warning adults of the danger of toddlers drowning in the five-gallon size. More buckets were expected to be labeled in coming months. </P>
<P> Brown admitted she was still concerned that warning labels and an information campaign might not be sufficient to reduce the drowning hazard, but said she was heartened by news that no deaths had been reported in California since a new law requiring warning labels took effect in September 1993. </P>
<P> While there would be no federal law requiring the labels, Brown suggested the CPSC might consider failure to label a substantial product a hazard under the Consumer Product Safety Act and encouraged bucket makers to continue efforts to design buckets that eliminated the drowning hazard. </P>
<P> ``In voting to terminate the rulemaking proceeding, I am not suggesting the bucket industry should stop looking for design solutions to the bucket drowning hazard,'' she said, citing work by the Olin Corp. to develop a child safety device designed to fit easily in most buckets. </P>
<P> CPSC Commissioner Mary Sheila Gall also voted to end the rulemaking proceeding, but said she based her decision on evidence that all reported toddler drownings were due to the absence of adult supervision. </P>
<P> ``It is those charged with the responsibility of caring for young children who are creating the hazard. It is not the product,'' she said. </P>
<P> ``The federal government cannot mandate changes in products as a substitute for responsible adult supervision. The tragedy is that none of these children had to die.'' </P>
