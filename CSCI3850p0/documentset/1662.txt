<P>  Croatian President Franjo Tudjman demanded Wednesday that sanctions against Belgrade not be lifted until it cuts off support for rebel Serbs in Croatia. </P>
<P> Tudjman also made an appeal to normalize relations with Belgrade -- if it recognized Croatia's internationally recognized borders, which include Serb-controlled areas. </P>
<P> The major powers last week eased sanctions against rump Yugoslavia as a reward for its military blockade against the Bosnian Serbs, their former proteges. The resolution hasn't yet gone into force. </P>
<P> ``Croatia welcomes Belgrade's announced readiness to isolate the Bosnian Serbs with their suicidal war option,'' Tudjman told the 49th General Assembly session. </P>
<P> ``But (we) expect Belgrade to do the same with regard to insurgent Serbs in Croatia. Croatia demands that the lifting of sanctions against Yugoslavia be also linked to the cessation of the occupation of Croatian areas.'' </P>
<P> Croatia lost a third of its territory after its June 1991, declaration of independence from Yugoslavia sparked an uprising by its Serb minority which was openly supported by Belgrade. </P>
<P> A cease-fire was negotiated in January 1992, by which time the occupied territories came under the nominal control of the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) but remained under the de facto control of Serb militias. </P>
<P> Tudjman also touched on the issue of normalizing relations with the rump Yugoslav Federation, now comprising only Serbia and Montenegro. </P>
<P> ``We shall accept any meeting leading to the recognition of the Republic of Croatia by Belgrade within its internationally recognized borders which would make the message to the insurgent Serbs about the necessity of gradual reintegration quite unambiguous,'' he said. </P>
<P> The failure of U.N. peacekeepers to make any headway with the Serbs in the four U.N. Protected Areas (UNPAs) in Croatia and to facilitate the return of Croatian refugees has led Tudjman to repeatedly threaten not to renew UPROFOR's mandate and take the territory back by force. </P>
<P> Tudjman indicated, however, that Croatia would agree to renew the mandate when it expired this weekend. </P>
