<P>  North Korea accused South Korea Friday of seeking to sabotage its nuclear dialogue with the United States by throwing up ``artificial barriers.'' </P>
<P> As North Korean and U.S. delegates resumed talks in Geneva after a four-week break, Radio Pyongyang carried a stern warning to the Seoul government not to interfere. </P>
<P> ``Words and deeds casting shadows on the road of the talks are emerging,'' a Foreign Ministry spokesman said. </P>
<P> The ministry statement, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), charged the South Korean authorities with attempting ``to create difficulty by all means'' between Pyongyang and Washington. </P>
<P> ``Some insidious forces are raising unreasonable and wrong voices that the issue of special inspection should be taken and discussed at the current talks as one of the basic agenda items, that it is desirable to build a thermal power plant in place of light-water reactors, and that North-South dialogue should precede the North Korea-U.S. talks.'' </P>
<P> ``Special inspection'' refers to long-pressed demands by Seoul, Washington and their allies that U.N. experts be allowed to search secret North Korean nuclear sites for proof of the existence of a suspected nuclear weapons program. </P>
<P> The United States and South Korea believe Pyongyang may have covertly produced enough plutonium to make two warheads, something that might be verified by analysis of radioactive waste at the sites in question. </P>
<P> Pyongyang flatly denies the sites are part of a nuclear weapons program but has refused the inspections. During a tense confrontation earlier this summer North Korea responded to U.S. threats of sanctions by threatening war. The two sides then backed down and agreed to hold talks on a resolution of the dispute. </P>
<P> The special inspection issue was shelved, at least temporarily, in the interests of getting North Korea to the negotiating table. The focus switched to trying to ensure Pyongyang does not produce more weapons-grade plutonium in the future. </P>
<P> South Korea has been watching preparations for the resumed U.S.-North Korean meeting with some suspicion. </P>
<P> Seoul has also backed away somewhat from an earlier commitment to a North-South summit, arranged before the July 8 death of North Korean leader Kim Il-sung, as it waits to see what sort of regime emerges in Pyongyang. </P>
<P> The latest statement by North Korea, which has long sought to drive a wedge between Washington and its South Korean ally, highlights two other possible points of discord. </P>
<P> These are continuation of U.S.-North Korea talks even if the North-South dialogue is stalled, and the West's proposed replacement of Pyongyang's plutonium-producing graphite nuclear reactor with a less controversial light water reactor. </P>
<P> Both sides meeting in Geneva said this week they were hoping for good talks. </P>
<P> Pyongyang's latest statement Friday, however, made clear that any attempt to raise again the question of special nuclear inspection would be fiercely resisted as ``a grave encroachment of our sovereignty and the supreme interest of the state.'' </P>
