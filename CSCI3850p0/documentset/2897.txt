<P>  A federal judge Tuesday set a March trial for Francisco Duran on criminal charges that include attempting to assassinate President Clinton when he sprayed semi-automatic rifle fire at the White House last month. </P>
<P> U.S. District Judge Charles Richey scheduled the next hearing in the case for March 16 to consider various defense motions and then to start selecting a jury. </P>
<P> Richey predicted that the trial could be completed by the end of March, saying, ``It is not a complicated case.'' </P>
<P> Duran has pleaded not guilty to an 11-count indictment related to the Oct. 29 attack in which he allegedly fired 29 shots from a Chinese-made weapon through the White House fence. </P>
<P> The attempted assassination charge alone carries a possible maximum sentence of life imprisonment for Duran, 26, a Colorado Springs, Colo., hotel worker only recently released from a federal prison after serving time for assault. </P>
<P> The other 10 charges include four counts of assaulting a federal officer, two counts of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, two counts of using an assault weapon in a crime of violence and one count each of destruction of U.S. property and interstate transportation of a firearm. </P>
<P> No one was injured in the attack. Clinton was watching a televised football game in the upstairs White House family quarters at the time and heard the shots. </P>
<P> Prosecutor Eric Dubelier said he expected to call as many as 25 witnesses and that two weeks should be sufficient to conclude the trial. </P>
<P> Richey gave defense attorney Leigh Kenny until Jan. 6 to file various defense motions, including one that she said would seek to suppress certain unspecified evidence. </P>
<P> Kenny said she would respond by Jan. 6 to a request by prosecutors asking whether Duran would assert the insanity defense. </P>
<P> Kenny said prosecutors just last week turned over two boxes of evidence, including several thousand pages of documents, and that witnesses far away from Washington, D.C. needed to be questioned before deciding on what defense to use. </P>
<P> The judge put off a decision on a request by several news organizations that he release a four-page letter found in Duran's truck after the shooting. </P>
<P> Richey said he wanted to wait until after the defense attorneys and prosecutors file their legal papers before deciding whether to make the letter public. </P>
<P> Duran, who continues to be held in jail without bond, sat in the courtroom wearing prison garb during the 15-minute hearing, but did not say anything. </P>
