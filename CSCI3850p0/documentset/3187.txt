<P>  A key General Assembly committee has painted a bleak picture of the Sudan, saying governments and rebels had not abated their violence against civilians, particularly in war areas. </P>
<P> The Khartoum government, in a resolution approved Tuesday, was singled out for arresting those who met with U.N. human rights monitors, conducting air attacks against civilians and impeding international relief efforts. </P>
<P> The resolution was approved by a vote of 91 in favor, 13 against with 47 abstenstions by the assembly's social, humanitarian and cultural committee. A decision by this panel, which includes all U.N. members, means a near-identical poll when the the full assembly votes next week. </P>
<P> The document expressed ``deep concern at the serious and continuing human rights violations,'' such as summary executions, detentions, torture and forced labor. </P>
<P> The military-dominated Sudan government came to power six years ago, dismantling civil society and enforcing laws which discriminate against non-Muslims and women in an essentially ethnically diverse society. </P>
<P> Muslim opposition groups and university students in particular have not fared much better under emergency rules, which ban political parties, trade unions and most other civil rights, according to U.N. reports and Human Rights Watch. </P>
<P> A resulting civil war in the southern part of the country and in the central Nuba mountains has inflicted hardships on all civilian populations. Massive international humanitarian aid is required to prevent starvation in many areas and recent negotiations to end the conflict have been abortive. </P>
<P> The war pits government troops against two groups of rebels from the mostly animist and Christian south opposing Muslim rule. Hundreds of thousands of civilians have died. </P>
<P> The resolution said the assembly was alarmed by the ``large number of internally displaced persons and victims of discrimination in the Sudan.'' </P>
<P> It expressed ``deep concern'' about large numbers of children used as soldiers by all parties to the conflict. </P>
<P> Children have been carted off to camps to prepare for military service by rebels and the government without permission of their families. </P>
<P> The resolution is based on a report by special U.N. rapporteur Gaspar Biro, who last year was refused entrance to the Sudan. He said that anyone detained in the Sudan by government security forces risks ``ill-treatment'' particularly in secret detention centers known as ``ghost houses.'' </P>
<P> One case he cited was that of Father Aliaba James Surer, an ageing veteran southern politician living in Khartoum, who apparently was arrested for talking to Biro late in 1993 and last May, was beaten and tortured. </P>
<P> The Sudan government has lashed out at Biro's report calling it ``outrageous, repetitive, untruthful and politicized.'' The Sudanese envoy told the committee his government wanted to reunite children with their families and had worked with U.N. bodies to achieve these results. </P>
