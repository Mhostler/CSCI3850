<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Samples of hair found in a blue knit cap at the scene where O.J. Simpson's ex-wife and a friend were murdered have been found by the FBI to match those of the football great, a television station reported Tuesday. </P>
<P> KNBC television, the west coast flagship affiliate of the NBC network, said scientists at the FBI laboratory in Washington found that samples from the cap were consistent with hairs taken under court order from Simpson's scalp. </P>
<P> Simpson, a former football great turned sportscaster, actor and advertising pitch man, has pleaded innocent to the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson, 35, and Ronald Goldman, 25, who were killed outside Nicole Simpson's Brentwood townhouse June 12. </P>
<P> The hair samples were among a number of developments in the Simpson case, which is moving quickly toward its September 19 trial date. </P>
<P> The disclosure of the FBI tests, which do not carry the scientific weight of the much more accurate DNA blood tests, nevertheless cast doubt on Simpson's contention that he was never at the crime scene on the night the murders were committed. </P>
<P> In a motion filed Monday, prosecutors said a sample taken from a bloody trail leading away from the murder scene match the DNA type of Simpson's blood, according to preliminary test results. </P>
<P> Meanwhile, Superior Court Judge Lance Ito, after hearing two days of testimony on a defense demand that the prosecution be ordered to turn over vital blood samples in the case, said he would rule on the matter Friday. </P>
<P> Simpson's team wants to carry out its own DNA tests on blood samples so it can evaluate the prosecution's results if they link Simpson to the scene of the murder. </P>
<P> Defense attorney Gerald Uelmen, in what may be similar to arguments made when the trial proper starts September 19, said three of the five blood spots taken from the trail had shown that the DNA in them was too degraded for testing. </P>
<P> Uelmen suggested to Ito that the defense might attack the accuracy of the one positive test on the grounds that the degradation of the other samples might have been caused by environmental factors, faulty collection, or faulty storage, any one of which could cast doubt on the validity of the positive test. </P>
<P> In another development in the case, the police officer who found a bloody glove on O.J. Simpson's estate after the football star's ex-wife and a friend were murdered sought to bar defense lawyers from seeing his military service and discharge records. </P>
<P> The officer, Detective Mark Fuhrman, was branded a ``racist cop'' by an unnamed member of the defense team in an article in The New Yorker magazine last month. The attorney also suggested that Fuhrman planted the glove, which matched one found at the scene of the killings, on Simpson's property. </P>
<P> Defense lawyers have said Fuhrman made racist remarks to a psychiatrist when he unsuccessfully applied for a police disability pension in 1981, saying he disliked blacks and Hispanics. Simpson is black. </P>
<P> In a declaration attached to his motion, Fuhrman, an ex-Marine, said the comments he made to the doctor were ''misquoted and taken out of context.'' </P>
<P> ``Any racially insensitive comments that I may have made to Dr (John) Hochman were in the context of a therapeutic session and were specifically intended to refer to my work with violent gangs and gang members, and the emotions that this stressful, dangerous and difficult type of police work engendered in me,'' Fuhrman wrote. </P>
<P> In another development, attorneys for Simpson friend Robert Kardashian filed a motion seeking to quash a subpoena ordering Kardashian to testify before the grand jury investigating charges against Al Cowlings, Simpson's friend. </P>
<P> CBS News reported that Simpson's girlfriend, Paula Barbieri, is being called before the grand jury Thursday. </P>
