<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  A high-ranking Greek Navy officer and his probable assailant were killed by a hand grenade Thursday but police could not say whether any Greek guerrilla groups was involved. </P>
<P> ``(He) was killed as a result of a powerful explosion caused by a hand grenade,'' Athens police chief Christos Keramidas told reporters. </P>
<P> Police said foreign language teacher Ioannis Markevits had arrived at the house of Lt. Commander Spyros Benetatos, 41, with the grenade, which exploded when the door opened. </P>
<P> They said the grenade was similar to those used by Greek guerrilla groups in the past but could not say for sure whether this was a guerrilla or a criminal attack. </P>
<P> ``We are examining all possibilities,'' Keramidas said. </P>
<P> Urban guerrillas have staged many bomb and rocket attacks against Greek and foreign targets since the 1970s. The deadliest of all, the extreme leftist November 17 group, has killed 21 Greeks, Americans and Turks since it emerged in 1975. </P>
<P> Benetatos was commanding a Greek Navy destroyer after returning from an assignment with NATO in Brussels in September. His wife had given birth recently and was expected home from the hospital in the next two days. </P>
<P> The powerful blast brought scores of policemen to the posh northern Athens suburb of Paleo Psychiko, where many embassies are located. </P>
<P> The guard of the Saudi Arabian ambassador's home, down the road from the blast, told police he saw Markevits arrive at the three-story house on a motorcycle and wait for about 45 minutes before walking up to the house and ringing the bell. </P>
<P> Reporters at the scene said his body, which fell just outside the entrance of the house, was badly mutilated. </P>
<P> Police said they had received a number of telephone calls claiming responsibility for the incident but none of them seemed credible. </P>
<P> The Marxist-Leninist November 17 group specializes in shootings, rocket and bomb attacks. It usually claims responsibility for its actions in long-winded pamphlets sent to Athens newspapers. </P>
