<DATELINE>LONDON (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Britain's Department of Transport said Saturday it had ordered an immediate report following newspaper allegations that lax security made the Channel Tunnel vulnerable to bomb attacks. </P>
<P> The Observer said investigations by its reporters disclosed negligent security on passenger trains and car shuttles using the tunnel linking Britain and France that was opened last year. </P>
<P> ``At Waterloo (station in London) they were able to board the train without having their luggage checked or X-ray scanned, abandon a large (suitcase) on the baggage rack and leave the train before departure without being challenged by security,'' the Observer reported. </P>
<P> It said the bag completed the three-hour journey to Paris without being noticed. Reporters were also able to open low-security locks to get into storage areas on car shuttles and passenger trains and mandatory security procedures were regularly ignored, the newspaper said. </P>
<P> A Department of Transport spokesman told Reuters: ``We have been in touch with EPS and Eurotunnel (the companies responsible for passenger safety) to ask for an immediate report. Security is a matter for the operators.'' </P>
<P> A spokeswoman for Eurotunnel said: ``If we had told the Observer what our security procedures were, they would have realized that their article is flawed and amateur and it would have compromised our security.'' </P>
<P> She declined to answer further questions. </P>
<P> The Observer quoted ``a senior counter-terrorism expert with Channel Tunnel experience'' as saying security was so poor it was unnoticeable. </P>
<P> ``Had I been a terrorist on target reconnaissance I would have been encouraged by the lack of security and supervision at both terminals,'' the unnamed expert was quoted as saying. </P>
