<P>  Revelations that Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race organizers withheld information about a dog's death has disturbed some sponsors and prompted calls for policy changes. </P>
<P> ``Dog care isn't the issue. The issue is the Iditarod's public relations policy,'' said Dick Westlund, a director of General Communications Inc., an Anchorage-based long-distance telephone company that put about $150,000 worth of sponsorship into this year's race. </P>
<P> He said top Iditarod managers decided during this year's race to withhold information about dog deaths unless asked about them specifically. </P>
<P> ``It's our opinion that the Iditarod made a mistake in not fully disclosing in a reasonable time frame,'' Westlund said Tuesday. ``I think that mistake has been realized, and I think you'll see a change in policy.'' </P>
<P> A spokesman said sponsor Alaska Airlines also regretted the Iditarod's failure to voluntarily release dog-death information, a change from past years when such incidents were announced in official news releases. </P>
<P> ``I think anyone associated with the race would certainly be concerned with the way this thing developed,'' said Bill McKay, a marketing official for the Seattle-based carrier. </P>
<P> The company gave at least $50,000 to the race in cash and in-kind services, mostly targeted at veterinarian programs, McKay said. </P>
<P> Dogs have died in every running of the 22-year-old Iditarod, which goes some 1,160 miles from Anchorage to Nome. This year's race started March 4; Montana musher Doug Swingley won the event on March 14. </P>
<P> The death that was not immediately reported was in the team of Minnesota musher Robert Somers. It occurred on March 10 near the race's halfway point. </P>
<P> Until late last week, it was widely reported that the only dog to die in the race was one in the team of Japanese musher Keizo Funatsu, who encountered troubles in a severe storm. </P>
<P> Funatsu dropped out of the race on March 17, three days after Swingley's victory. He was rescued and hospitalized for frostbite. That incident occurred near Nome, where several reporters and spectators were gathered. News about Somers' dog was not publicized until last week. </P>
