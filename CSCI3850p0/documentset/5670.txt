<DATELINE>SINGAPORE, April 12 (Reuter) </DATELINE>
<P>  Men holding top office jobs have a higher sperm count than factory workers and mechanics but that does not necessarily mean managers or accountants are more fertile, according to a Singapore study. </P>
<P> The joint study by the National University of Singapore (NUS) and the Singapore General Hospital found that exposure to heat might cause low sperm count in factory workers, the Straits Times newspaper said. </P>
<P> But if professionals think this means they have more of what it takes to make babies than their workers, think again, Chia Sin Eng, head of the study team, was quoted as saying. </P>
<P> ``I don't want them to go around with their egos inflated. It does not automatically mean they have greater fertility, as other factors such as the condition of the sperm need to be considered,'' said Chia, a lecturer at NUS's medical faculty. </P>
<P> The team examined sperm of more than 600 men, who were slotted into eight broad job categories. </P>
<P> The differences emerged even after several factors known to lower sperm count -- such as smoking, alcohol drinking and medical history -- were considered. </P>
<P> ``There is no need for plant workers to give up hope even if (they are) found to have lower sperm counts. You only need one sperm to fertilise,'' Chia said. </P>
